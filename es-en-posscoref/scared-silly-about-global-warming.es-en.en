Scared Silly about Global Warming 
The continuous presentation of scary stories about global warming in the popular media makes us unnecessarily frightened . 
Even worse , it terrifies our kids . 
Al Gore famously depicted how a sea-level rise of 20 feet ( six meters ) would almost completely flood Florida , New York , Holland , Bangladesh , and Shanghai , even though the United Nations estimates that sea levels will rise 20 times less than that , and do no such thing . 
When confronted with these exaggerations , some of us say that they are for a good cause , and surely there is no harm done if the result is that we focus even more on tackling climate change . 
A similar argument was used when George W. Bush &apos;s administration overstated the terror threat from Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq . 
But this argument is astonishingly wrong . 
Such exaggerations do plenty of harm . 
Worrying excessively about global warming means that we worry less about other things , where we could do so much more good . 
We focus , for example , on global warming &apos;s impact on malaria - which will be to put slightly more people at risk in 100 years - instead of tackling the half-billion people suffering from malaria today with prevention and treatment policies that are much cheaper and dramatically more effective than carbon reduction would be . 
Exaggeration also wears out the public &apos;s willingness to tackle global warming . 
If the planet is doomed , people wonder , why do anything ? 
A record 54 % of American voters now believe the news media make global warming appear worse than it really is . 
A majority of people now believes - incorrectly - that global warming is not even caused by humans . 
In the United Kingdom , 40 % believe that global warming is exaggerated and 60 % doubt that it is man-made . 
But the worst cost of exaggeration , I believe , is the unnecessary alarm that it causes - particularly among children . 
Recently , I discussed climate change with a group of Danish teenagers . 
One of them worried that global warming would cause the planet to &quot; explode &quot; - and all the others had similar fears . 
In the US , the ABC television network recently reported that psychologists are starting to see more neuroses in people anxious about climate change . 
An article in The Washington Post cited nine-year-old Alyssa , who cries about the possibility of mass animal extinctions from global warming . 
In her words : &quot; I don &apos;t like global warming because it kills animals , and I like animals . &quot; 
From a child who is yet to lose all her baby teeth : &quot; I worry about &#91; global warming &#93; because I don &apos;t want to die . &quot; 
The newspaper also reported that parents are searching for &quot; productive &quot; outlets for their eight-year-olds &quot; obsessions with dying polar bears . 
They might be better off educating them and letting them know that , contrary to common belief , the global polar bear population has doubled and perhaps even quadrupled over the past half-century , to about 22,000 . 
Despite diminishing - and eventually disappearing - summer Arctic ice , polar bears will not become extinct . 
After all , in the first part of the current interglacial period , glaciers were almost entirely absent in the northern hemisphere , and the Arctic was probably ice-free for 1,000 years , yet polar bears are still with us . 
Another nine-year old showed The Washington Post his drawing of a global warming timeline . 
Looking up to make sure his mother is following along , he taps the end of the drawing : &quot; In 20 years , there &apos;s no oxygen . &quot; 
Then , to dramatize the point , he collapses , &quot; dead , &quot; to the floor . 
And these are not just two freak stories . 
In a new survey of 500 American pre-teens , it was found that one in three children aged 6-11 feared that the earth would not exist when they reach adulthood because of global warming and other environmental threats . 
An unbelievable one-third of our children believe that they don &apos;t have a future because of scary global warming stories . 
We see the same pattern in the United Kingdom , where a survey showed that half of young children aged 7-11 are anxious about the effects of global warming , often losing sleep because of their concern . 
This is grotesquely harmful . 
And let us be honest . 
This scare was intended . 
Children believe that global warming will destroy the planet before they grow up because adults are telling them that . 
When every prediction about global warming is scarier than the last one , and the scariest predictions - often not backed up by peer-reviewed science - get the most airtime , it is little wonder that children are worried . 
Nowhere is this deliberate fear mongering more obvious than in Al Gore &apos;s Inconvenient Truth , a film that was marketed as &quot; by far the most terrifying film you will ever see . &quot; 
Take a look at the trailer for this movie on YouTube . 
Notice the imagery of chilling , larger-than-life forces evaporating our future . 
The commentary tells us that this film has &quot; shocked audiences everywhere , &quot; and that &quot; nothing is scarier &quot; than what Gore is about to tell us . 
Notice how the trailer even includes a nuclear explosion . 
The current debate about global warming is clearly harmful . 
I believe that it is time we demanded that the media stop scaring us and our kids silly . 
We deserve a more reasoned , more constructive , and less frightening dialogue .
