The Indian Exception 
NEW DELHI - The ratification by the United States Congress of the historic India-US Nuclear Agreement marks a remarkable new development in world affairs . 
Initially signed in July 2005 , the agreement is a major milestone in the growing partnership between the world &apos;s oldest and largest democracies . 
That agreement signals recognition of what may be called &quot; the Indian exception &quot; - a decision by the world &apos;s sole superpower , together with all other nations involved in commerce in nuclear-related materials , to sell such materials to India , despite India &apos;s refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its two nuclear tests . 
India &apos;s refusal to sign the NPT was based on principle , for the NPT is the last vestige of apartheid in the international system , granting as it does to five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council the right to be nuclear weapons states while denying the same right to others . 
A long-time advocate of global nuclear disarmament , India &apos;s moral stand on the NPT enjoys near-unanimous backing within the country . 
Its weapons program is also widely ( though far from universally ) supported at home as a security imperative in a dangerous neighborhood . 
Unlike Iran and North Korea , which signed the NPT and then violated its provisions through clandestine nuclear weapons programs , India has openly pursued its own nuclear development , and it has a stellar record on non-proliferation , never exporting its technology or leaking a nuclear secret . 
Moreover , its nuclear program is under strict civilian control . 
All of this is implicitly recognized in the newly ratified India-US accord , which survived tough bilateral negotiations , codification of its provisions into US law , and unanimous approval in August by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
Finally , the Nuclear Suppliers Group of 45 countries , urged by the Bush administration to follow the IAEA &apos;s example , did so unconditionally . 
Congressional action in America was the last act of a long drama , and it cleared the way for US companies to bid for Indian nuclear contracts , an area in which they will face stiff competition from France and Russia . 
But the agreement &apos;s main significance should be seen in terms of the burgeoning Indo-American relationship . 
Estranged during the Cold War by American support for Pakistan and India &apos;s leadership of the non-aligned movement , the two countries have been drawing ever closer during the last decade . 
Bilateral trade is booming . 
American companies have quintupled their investments in India over the last decade . 
Indians are reading MRIs for American patients , providing call-center support for American consumers , and delivering world-class research and development services for American companies . 
Polls have repeatedly revealed that India is one of the few countries in the developing world where America is still held in high regard . 
India has also become a more visible presence in the US . 
There are more Indian students at American universities than those of any other foreign nationality . 
The successes of the growing Indian-American population have made it an influential minority in the US , including thousands of doctors and nurses , innovative Silicon Valley professionals ( one of whom invented the Pentium chip , while another created Hotmail ) , the CEOs of Citigroup and Pepsi , two US astronauts , and the young governor of Louisiana - in addition to taxi-drivers , gas-station attendants , and clerks at all-night convenience stores . 
Yoga clinics are rampant across the country , Indian restaurants are mushrooming in the remotest exurbs , and Bollywood DVDs have found unlikely American fans . 
India &apos;s place in America &apos;s consciousness is fundamentally different from what it was just half a generation ago . 
Clearly , both the Bush administration and Congress have recognized this intensifying partnership when they approved the India-US Nuclear Agreement . 
There was , of course , opposition within both countries to the deal . 
In the US , the &quot; non-proliferation ayatollahs , &quot; who hypocritically consider nuclear weapons an unmitigated evil except in their own hands , railed against it . 
In India , parties on both the left and the right opposed it - the former claiming that it mortgaged India &apos;s foreign policy to the US , and the latter arguing that it didn &apos;t go far enough to preserve India &apos;s nuclear independence . 
But , like all good agreements , the deal is a &quot; win-win &quot; : it helps India cope with crippling energy shortages by tripling its nuclear power generating capacity , and it provides major business opportunities for American companies to sell reactors and nuclear technology . 
Moreover , by subjecting India &apos;s civilian nuclear installations to international inspections , it achieves an important US foreign policy objective by bringing India into the worldwide non-proliferation fold . 
And there &apos;s no question that helping India to grow will earn America the gratitude of the world &apos;s largest free-market democracy . 
The agreement will not transform India &apos;s energy situation overnight , or end the country &apos;s dependence on expensive fuel imports . 
But its passage confirms that the US relationship with India promises to be one of America &apos;s closest and strategically most important in the twenty-first century . 
As America struggles with a financial crisis and quagmires in the Middle East and Central Asia , sealing this agreement with India may be one of the beleaguered Bush administration &apos;s only enduring foreign policy accomplishments .
