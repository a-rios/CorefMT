Reforming Russia &apos;s Military Industrial Complex 
Under President Vladimir Putin , Russia has launched a comprehensive program to restructure its defense industry , which has shrunk dramatically since the Soviet era . 
This process has achieved some progress , but fundamental structural problems persist that lead Russia to export large quantities of advanced weapons to conflict-prone regions , placing the Kremlin at odds with Europe , the United States , and other countries . 
Over the last six years , the Putin administration has encouraged the nationalization and consolidation of private-sector defense firms into large , vertically integrated , state-controlled holdings . 
In November 2000 , Putin approved the creation of a single government-supervised arms exporting agency , Rosoboronexport , to end the self-destructive competition that had developed between the country &apos;s major weapons-exporting enterprises . 
Earlier this year , the agency gained the exclusive right to sell Russian weapons to foreign countries . 
At present , the government is promoting the creation of a similar institution in the aviation sector , the new United Aircraft Building Corporation ( UABC ) , which includes major state and private manufacturers of fixed-wing aircraft . 
Proponents of the merger believe it will improve the efficiency of the Russian aircraft industry and , by lowering costs , make Russian planes more attractive to foreign buyers . 
Under Putin , Russian military spending has also rebounded . 
This year , the Russian government will provide the Ministry of Defense almost 5 trillion rubles ( $ 189 billion ) under the 2007-2015 State Armaments Program . 
The percentage of the defense budget allocated to purchasing military equipment will rise from 44 % in 2006 to 50 % by 2011 . 
The primary purpose of this increased spending is to push new weapons systems from the research and development stage to actual procurement for Russia &apos;s armed forces . 
Over the course of 2007-2015 , Russia &apos;s army and navy will replace almost half ( 45 % ) of their military equipment . 
In the past , poor government and industry practices frustrated similar plans to supply large numbers of advanced conventional weapons to Russia &apos;s armed forces . 
The country &apos;s military-industrial sector suffers from limited domestic orders and extensive overcapacity . 
Purchases for the Russian army and navy have been increasing , but still only sustain about one-fourth of Russia &apos;s existing military production capacity . 
The Russian government now spends more on new Russian-made conventional weapons than do foreign purchasers . 
Yet , persistent inefficiencies in the Russian defense procurement system result in foreign buyers receiving more new systems than the Russian military . 
As a result , Russia &apos;s leading defense firms remain heavily dependent on foreign sales . 
Although Russia &apos;s arms exports have decreased considerably since the Soviet period , its revenue per transaction is now greater because Russian firms have yielded much of the lower-end market to less expensive suppliers like China , India , and other former Soviet bloc allies . 
Moreover , where the USSR transferred much weaponry under easy commercial terms or without charge ( e.g. , under long-term loans not expected to be repaid ) , Russia now discounts arms only for its closest allies . 
On March 27 , 2007 , the Defense Ministry announced that Russia &apos;s annual arms exports increased by 50 % , from $ 4 billion to $ 6.5 billion , from 2001 to 2006 . 
In an effort to both maximize foreign revenue and strengthen Russia &apos;s own military potential , former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , who now oversees Russia &apos;s military-industrial complex and is one of the two leading candidates to succeed Putin as president , stressed the need for &quot; the national defense industry to find a balance between a commitment to arm the Russian military and an opportunity to export arms to countries not subject to UN sanctions . &quot; 
Besides helping to sustain the health of Russia &apos;s military industrial complex , many Russian officials think that arms sales will promote Russia &apos;s diplomatic interests by strengthening ties with recipient states . 
These transactions , however , have complicated Moscow &apos;s relations with foreign governments , particularly the United States . 
American officials complain that Russia &apos;s self-imposed restrictions on arms sales are much weaker than those of Western countries , especially with regard to authoritarian governments accused of committing human rights violations or states seeking weapons of mass destruction . 
Washington has protested against Russian military sales to Belarus , China , Iran , Syria , Uzbekistan , and Venezuela . 
In early January 2007 , the US government imposed economic sanctions on three Russian companies , including Rosoboronexport , for selling missiles and other prohibited military technologies to Iran and Syria . 
Russian officials insist that their military exports conform to all applicable international laws and involve primarily defensive weaponry that will not disrupt regional power balances . 
They add that the US and its allies also transfer large volumes of weapons to areas of conflict , including South Asia and the Middle East . 
Russian officials also contend that US and other foreign objections often reflect a desire to eliminate unwelcome Russian competition or curtail the Kremlin &apos;s influence in important regions , such as Eastern Europe , Asia , and the Middle East . 
In 2005 , the head of Rosoboronexport , Sergei Chemezov , said : &quot; Let &apos;s have no illusions : if we stop sending arms to export , then someone else will do it . &quot; 
Russia seems prepared to negotiate on some security issues , including such sensitive questions as Iran and Kosovo . 
Achieving limitations on Russian arms sales , however , will prove much harder . 
Given the condition of Russia &apos;s military-industrial complex , considerations of national pride , geopolitical influence , and entrepreneurial profits will likely sustain Russian interest in selling weapons to almost any client no matter how distasteful to Western governments .
