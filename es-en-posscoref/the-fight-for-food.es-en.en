The Fight for Food 
GENEVA - Every year , 3.5 million mothers and children below the age of five die in poor countries because they do not have the nutrition they need to fight common diseases . 
Three-quarters of them could have survived diarrhea or malaria if they had been properly nourished . 
For those who do survive , the future looks grim : all studies show that children who are undernourished in the first two years of life suffer health problems and lag in development for the rest of their lives . 
Insufficient nourishment impedes their capacity to learn , fitness to work , and ability to develop their talents . 
Besides the human suffering , the economic costs of malnutrition are huge : according to the World Bank , countries where malnutrition is most prevalent lose , on average , between 2 % and 3 % of their GDP . 
The issue is not severe and acute malnutrition , which hits populations suddenly , usually as a result of conflict . 
It is caused by imbalanced nutrition or a lack of vitamins and essential minerals that enable the human body to grow and that maintain its vital functions . 
For example , recent data show that even a moderate deficiency of Vitamin A results in higher mortality . 
In fact , we could avoid the death of at least one million children every year by improving their intake of it . 
Doing so would not be difficult . 
Humans have added essential vitamins or minerals to their foods since time immemorial ; indeed , since the beginning of the twentieth century , food fortification has been a major government policy in developed countries to reduce nutritional deficiencies and improve public health . 
All scientific studies of such interventions prove that fortification of basic foodstuffs works . 
Chile promoted the addition of iron to milk , resulting in a 66 % reduction of anemia amongst babies . 
The fortification of maize meal with folic acid in South Africa - one of the projects supported by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition ( GAIN ) - was followed by a 40 % reduction in spina bifida , a serious deformation of the neural tube in new-born babies . 
Moreover , these essential interventions cost little and deliver a lot : to enrich cooking oil with Vitamin A costs less than $ 0.10 per liter , and fortification in general has a benefit-to-cost ratio of at least eight to one . 
What is missing is the willingness to act . 
At GAIN , we are convinced that there is an urgent need to fight malnutrition if the world wants to achieve the United Nations &quot; Millennium Development Goals , which commit the world to halving global poverty and hunger by 2015 . 
Fighting malnutrition is the first step toward reaching this objective . 
Science has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of food fortification , and the technologies and know-how are available in the private sector , which has the capacity to innovate and deliver products to the poorest . 
Europe and the G8 must act . 
Not only do they need to make the fight against malnutrition a policy priority ; they also must invest . 
The equation is straightforward : € 160 million for fortification programs could improve the health of one billion people . 
To put that amount into perspective , the regular move of EU institutions between Brussels and Strasbourg costs € 200 million per year . 
While the latter is an understandable expense historically , the time has come for the EU and G8 to make different political choices that help keep 3.5 million mothers and children alive and well .
