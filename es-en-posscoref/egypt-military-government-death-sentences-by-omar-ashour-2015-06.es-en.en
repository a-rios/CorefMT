Egypt &apos;s Dead Men Walking 
CAIRO - Mass death sentences are usually associated with regimes like those of Adolf Hitler &apos;s Nazis or Pol Pot &apos;s Khmer Rouge . 
But Egypt &apos;s military rulers have now joined the ranks of such regimes , staging circus-like trials in which the outcome is foreordained . 
One such trial , in March 2014 , produced 529 death sentences ; another , in April , yielded 683 death sentences . 
And the trend shows no signs of slowing . 
Last month , 107 people - including Mohamed Morsi , Egypt &apos;s first freely elected president - were handed death sentences for their alleged role in a mass &quot; prison break &quot; during the January 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak . 
Morsi was also accused of &quot; colluding with foreign militants &quot; - that is , Hezbollah and Hamas - in order to free political prisoners in Egypt . 
Soon after , the six defendants in the so-called &quot; Arab Sharkas &quot; case - who were handed death sentences in October 2014 for allegedly attacking security posts - were executed , despite a local and international outcry against the flawed trial . 
According to Ahmed Helmi , a lawyer for four of the six men , the government wanted to &quot; send a message following Morsi &apos;s verdict &quot; that it would carry out such sentences . 
His clients and the others , he concluded , were just &quot; scapegoats . &quot; 
Overall , civilian courts have handed down more than 1,000 death sentences since Egypt &apos;s military overthrew Morsi in July 2013 . 
The profiles of the &quot; convicts &quot; raise eyebrows : Emad Shahin , for example , is a world-renowned academic who has taught at Harvard and the American University in Cairo ; 
Sondos Asem is a promising young scholar and political activist . 
Making matters worse , extra-judicial killings by the security services and elements in the military are rampant . 
The most dramatic of these episodes accompanied the coup in July 2013 , when Egyptian police and army opened fire on crowds protesting Morsi &apos;s ouster in Cairo &apos;s Rab &apos;a Square , killing more than 1,000 protesters in less than ten hours . 
More recently , Islam Atito , an engineering student at Cairo &apos;s Ain Shams University who supported the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood , was found dead in the desert on the outskirts of Cairo . 
Egypt &apos;s interior ministry claimed that Atito had been involved in the &quot; assassination &quot; of a police officer and was killed in a firefight with security forces during a raid on his &quot; hideout . &quot; 
But according to the student union of the university &apos;s engineering faculty - whose members collectively resigned in protest against the killing - Atito was arrested during a final exam on the university campus . 
The government , it is claimed , had Atito abducted and murdered in response to his activism . 
As a human-rights lawyer monitoring the case notes , this is just one of several such cases - none of which is being seriously investigated . 
These judicial and extra-judicial killings reflect the depth of Egypt &apos;s current crisis . 
The &quot; hawks &quot; who control the security and military establishments seem intent on restoring a Mubarak-style regime , but with one key difference : they believe that Mubarak did too little to repress the opposition . 
For Egypt &apos;s current leadership , the brutal tactics employed by the likes of Libya &apos;s Muammar el-Qaddafi and Syria &apos;s Bashar al-Assad are more likely to work in the Egyptian context than in those countries . 
After all , the probability of international intervention ( as in Libya ) is nil , and the likelihood of a full-fledged armed revolution ( as in Syria ) is extremely limited . 
But relying on force to subdue dissent in a country where 70 % of the population is under the age of 30 will be a major challenge , if not resulting in a bloodbath . 
The brutal policies of Egypt &apos;s hawks have also transformed the opposition . 
At a 2013 sit-in protesting Morsi &apos;s ouster , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s Supreme Guide , Mohamed Badie , declared , in what became a rallying cry for the movement , &quot; Our peacefulness is stronger than their bullets . &quot; 
But , with Badie having since been sentenced to death in multiple cases ( including one related to attacks on police stations in the southern province of Minya ) , the phrase has become the subject of bitter mockery among young political activists , including Brotherhood members . 
Rassd , a Brotherhood-affiliated news website , recently published a letter ( link in Arabic ) by the group &apos;s former secretary-general , Mahmoud Ghozlan , asserting that the &quot; revolution &quot; will continue to be non-violent . 
But it also published harsh criticism of Ghozlan &apos;s position by young Brotherhood activists - a notable development for an organization in which dissent is rarely publicized . 
In fact , anger among younger members has become so acute that the Brotherhood has allegedly changed some 65 % of its leadership , according to Ahmed Abdel-Rahman , the head of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Administrative Office Abroad ( a new body that organizes the thousands of Brotherhood members now in exile ) . 
The organization has also adopted a harsher line , having publicly stated that the &quot; reformist &quot; approach that its government took after winning parliamentary and presidential elections in 2011 and 2012 was &quot; wrong , &quot; and that excluding non-Islamist revolutionary youth groups was a &quot; major mistake . &quot; 
Given Egypt &apos;s mass death sentences , extrajudicial violence , and the dominance of hawks in the security and the military establishments , together with the rhetorical , behavioral , and organizational changes within the Muslim Brotherhood , the chances of reconciliation are fading by the day . 
In an environment in which &quot; compromise &quot; is regarded as a dirty word , Egypt &apos;s future appears to be far from bright .
