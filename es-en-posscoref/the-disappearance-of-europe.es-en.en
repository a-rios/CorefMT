The Disappearance of Europe 
BRUSSELS - What will it mean to be European 25 years from now ? 
Unlike the United States , whose history as a &quot; melting pot &quot; has given Americans a truly multi-ethnic character , native Europeans are becoming an endangered species . 
Europe badly needs immigrants , yet is not culturally prepared to welcome them . The coming decades will therefore see substantially greater social change in Europe than elsewhere , although the nature of that change is far from clear . 
At first glance , much of Europe &apos;s current debate is about political and economic integration - about how far its nation states should go in pooling resources and sovereign powers in the European Union . 
But beneath the surface , the real tensions are about immigration and fears that national &quot; cultures &quot; are threatened by the influx of non-natives , both white and non-white . 
Immigration in Europe today is running at a higher rate than in the US , with almost two million people arriving officially every year , together with an unknown number of illegal immigrants . 
The most conservative estimate , by Eurostat , the EU &apos;s statistical agency , puts the total number of newcomers to Europe between now and 2050 at 40 million . Inevitably , that sort of influx will ensure that Europe &apos;s already vociferous right-wing extremist politicians win even greater support . 
The specter of rising racial tensions is worrying enough . 
But it is just one aspect of Europe &apos;s urgent need to import people from Africa and Asia . 
Europeans will also see the dismantling of their welfare states and social security systems ; the cherished &quot; European model &quot; of pensions , healthcare , and unemployment benefits risks being replaced by the despised and widely feared &quot; American model . &quot; 
This is not , needless to say , because Europeans crave the rigors of America &apos;s less cosseted social conditions , but because it &apos;s the only way that European governments will be able to stay afloat financially . 
The root cause of all these developments is Europe &apos;s population shrinkage . 
The &quot; demographic time bomb &quot; that economic analysts have been discussing for a decade or more is now exploding . 
The result is widespread labor shortages in many EU countries and an alarming reduction in the proportion of working-age people whose taxes pay the pensions and medical costs of those who have retired . 
Many countries have themselves aggravated the problem , either by encouraging early retirement or - as with France - through job-creation nostrums like the 35-hour working week . 
About one-third of male workers in Europe quit their jobs by their early fifties . 
That , together with two generations in which birth rates across Europe have dropped well below the two-children-per-couple replacement rate , and what the European Commission describes as &quot; spectacular &quot; increases in longevity , means that by 2050 , instead of four workers supporting each retiree , there will be only two . 
In short , European policymakers are in an impossible position . 
The political mindset in most EU countries remains firmly focused on unemployment as the chief ill to be cured , whereas the real threat is the worsening shortage of people to fill job vacancies . 
The European Commission has warned that this will put a lower ceiling on GDP growth rates . 
According to Klaus Regling , the Commission &apos;s Director-General for Economic and Financial Affairs , Europe &apos;s working population has so shrunk that from 2010 onward maximum annual economic growth in western Europe will drop to 1.8 % , from an average of 2.3 % in recent years , and to just 1.3 % a year from 2030 . 
Economic stagnation on this scale has alarming implications , because it means less and less tax revenues to fund all the reform projects and infrastructural investments Europe badly needs to regain its productivity and high-tech competitive edge . 
And if things look bad for Western Europe , they &apos;re worse for the EU &apos;s formerly communist newcomers , whose demographic trends imply that average potential growth will nosedive from today &apos;s healthy 4.3 % per year to just 0.9 % after 2030 . 
Much of Europe already suffers from under-performing labor markets in which job seekers and would-be employers either can &apos;t or won &apos;t find one another . 
Stubbornly high youth unemployment , along with Europe &apos;s dwindling numbers of school-leavers , is already canceling out the positive effects of immigration . 
Here in Brussels , where the largely North African immigrant population comprises a quarter of the city &apos;s inhabitants , hotels and restaurants recently resorted to an emergency on-line recruitment service to counter their worsening staff shortages . 
The manpower crisis is even more acute in sectors that demand greater skills and qualifications . 
Like the US , Europe &apos;s manpower-related difficulties are accentuated by the rise of India and China . 
How Europeans , and to a lesser extent Americans , will maintain their high standards of living is anyone &apos;s guess . 
But Europe &apos;s problem is greater , for its politicians are at a loss to cope with the high-voltage issues of race , religion , and ethnicity in societies that seem determined to remain anchored in the past .
