China &apos;s $ 3.2 Trillion Headache 
BEIJING - While the downgrade of United States government debt by Standard 
Poor &apos;s shocked global financial markets , China has more reason to worry than most : the bulk of its $ 3.2 trillion in official foreign reserves - more than 60 % - is denominated in dollars , including $ 1.1 trillion in US Treasury bonds . 
So long as the US government does not default , whatever losses China may experience from the downgrade will be small . 
To be sure , the dollar &apos;s value will fall , imposing a balance-sheet loss on the Peoples &quot; Bank of China ( PBC , the central bank ) . 
But a falling dollar would make it cheaper for Chinese consumers and companies to buy American goods . 
If prices are stable in the US , as is the case now , the gains from buying American goods should exactly offset the PBC &apos;s balance-sheet losses . 
The downgrade could , moreover , force the US Treasury to raise the interest rate on new bonds , in which case China would stand to gain . 
But S P &apos;s downgrade was a poor decision , taken at the wrong time . 
If America &apos;s debts had truly become less trustworthy , they would have been even more dubious before the agreement reached on August 2 by Congress and President Barack Obama to raise the government &apos;s debt ceiling . 
That agreement allowed the world to hope that the US economy would embark on a more predictable path to recovery . 
The downgrade has undermined that hope . 
Some people even predict a double-dip recession . 
If that happens , the chance of an actual US default would be much higher than it is today . 
These new worries are raising alarm bells in China . 
Diversification away from dollar assets is the advice of the day . 
But this is no easy task , particularly in the short term . 
If the PBC started to buy non-dollar assets in large quantities , it would invariably need to convert some current dollar assets into another currency , which would inevitably drive up that currency &apos;s value , thus increasing the PBC &apos;s costs . 
Another idea being discussed in Chinese policy circles is to allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar . 
Much of China &apos;s official foreign reserves have accumulated because the PBC seeks to control the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate , keeping its upward movement within a reasonable range and at a measured pace . 
If it allowed the renminbi to appreciate faster , the PBC would not need to buy large quantities of foreign currencies . 
But whether renminbi appreciation will work depends on reducing China &apos;s net capital inflows and current-account surplus . 
International experience suggests that , in the short run , more capital flows into a country when its currency appreciates , and most empirical studies have shown that gradual appreciation has only a limited effect on countries &quot; current-account positions . 
If appreciation does not reduce the current-account surplus and capital inflows , then the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate is bound to face further upward pressure . 
That is why some people are advocating that China undertake a one-shot , big-bang appreciation - large enough to defuse expectations of further strengthening and deter inflows of speculative &quot; hot &quot; money . 
Such a revaluation would also discourage exports and encourage imports , thereby reducing China &apos;s chronic trade surplus . 
But such a move would be almost suicidal for China &apos;s economy . 
Between 2001 and 2008 , export growth accounted for more than 40 % of China &apos;s overall economic growth . 
That is , China &apos;s annual GDP growth rate would drop by four percentage points if its exports did not grow at all . 
In addition , a study by the China Center for Economic Research has found that a 20 % appreciation against the dollar would entail a 3 % drop in employment - more than 20 million jobs . 
There is no short-term cure for China &apos;s $ 3.2 trillion problem . 
The government must rely on longer-term measures to mitigate the problem , including internationalization of the renminbi . 
Using the renminbi to settle China &apos;s international trade accounts would help China escape America &apos;s beggar-thy-neighbor policy of allowing the dollar &apos;s value to fall dramatically against trade rivals . 
But China &apos;s $ 3.2 trillion problem will become a 20-trillion-renminbi problem if China cannot reduce its current-account surplus and fence off capital inflows . 
There is no escape from the need for domestic structural adjustment . 
To achieve this , China must increase domestic consumption &apos;s share of GDP . 
This has already been written into the government &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan . 
Unfortunately , given high inflation , structural adjustment has been postponed , with efforts to control credit expansion becoming the government &apos;s first priority . 
This enforced investment slowdown is itself increasing China &apos;s net savings , i.e. , the current-account surplus , while constraining the expansion of domestic consumption . 
Real appreciation of the renminbi is inevitable so long as Chinese living standards are catching up with US levels . 
The PBC should target the renminbi &apos;s rate of real appreciation , rather than the inflation rate under a stable renminbi . 
And then the government needs to focus more attention on structural adjustment - the only effective cure for China &apos;s $ 3.2 trillion headache .
