The 60-Year Itch ? 
JERUSALEM - &quot; Europe is boring : thank God , for you and for us , &quot; my interlocutor told me . 
&quot; Today , drama is in the Middle East , growth is in Asia , hope is in Africa , and proximity to the United States is in Latin America . 
Europe is nowhere - it has become the lost continent . &quot; 
There is , of course , a little provocation and a lot of irony in these remarks . 
A few years ago , their speaker occupied important positions within US diplomacy ; he is now a key figure of the New York establishment . 
And his provocation highlights a sad reality that Europeans must accept and confront : Europe no longer interests America . 
Yes , the European Union &apos;s enlargement since 2004 was preceded by NATO &apos;s eastward expansion . 
But that has not made a real difference ; at the end of the day , America is also losing interest in NATO , which turned in a not-fully-convincing performance in Libya and a downright poor one in Afghanistan . 
Earlier this month , I gave a talk in Washington , DC , entitled &quot; Hollande &apos;s France : A Year After . &quot; 
The audience members &quot; average age was significantly higher than mine ( and I am 66 ) . 
The complexities of French politics do not interest young Americans - and why should they ? 
Would I have had a younger and larger audience if my talk had been called &quot; Merkel &apos;s Germany on the Eve of the Upcoming Election &quot; ? 
Whereas young Europeans look for jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities in America , young Americans go to Europe as tourists . 
For them , Europe is a continent undergoing museumification - a place to &quot; do , &quot; not a place to be . 
This disinterest in Europe is not recent , but it has deepened over recent years . 
Since the end of the Cold War , Europe has no longer been the first line of defense of the United States . 
And , since the end of the Balkan wars , the continent &apos;s security problems have disappeared ( except at the margins , as in Georgia , or potential threats stemming from its near-abroad , particularly the Arab world ) . 
Many American scholars who were once interested in Europe &apos;s social model have moved on to other research interests or retired , with no new generation to replace them . 
Learning European languages is no longer popular in American schools , with the possible exception of Spanish . 
To some extent , Mandarin has become the new French , but with a major difference : The language of Molière was a cultural tool , not ( or not entirely ) an instrument of economic success . 
Of course , it would be wrong to overemphasize disenchantment and push self-flagellation too far . 
Europe still exists in the US , though probably more among the Washington administrative and political elite than within the world of New York finance and business , despite the fundamental importance of transatlantic trade for both economies . 
But is the US interested in Europe or only in parts of it ? 
In Washington - as in Beijing , for that matter - the temptation to approach Europe in a bilateral manner is strong and growing . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s America , rendered prudent by the costs of the country &apos;s military adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan , is only too happy to count on the interventionist traditions of Great Britain and France . 
From Libya to Mali , France and Britain are largely seen as the extended arm of an America that is increasingly reticent to commit its own troops - or even weapons . 
Similarly , for the US government , as for China &apos;s leaders , Germany has become Europe &apos;s key economic actor . 
Of course , faced with the Chinese economic challenge , America would be happy to forge a united front - especially in matters of trade - with the continent that is still the world &apos;s leading commercial power . 
But Europe &apos;s interest in successfully concluding a proposed EU-US free-trade agreement may be even stronger . 
Without America by its side , Europe would be more vulnerable in the face of a rising China than America would be without the EU . 
So America needs Europe , but now at the margins . 
Europe , given its current divisions and the growing gap between its northern and southern economies , still needs America . 
In security terms , Europe would be quite lonely without the US , whatever the nature of the threat . 
Of course , the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden &apos;s revelations of the global reach and the extent of America &apos;s Internet and telephone surveillance are , to say the least , unpleasant . 
But America &apos;s questionable means of satisfying its legitimate security concerns are certainly less damaging for Europe in the long run than is Chinese industrial espionage . 
America is taking risks with the rule of law , but China has a long way to go before it becomes a country ruled by law . 
In the immediate aftermath of Snowden &apos;s revelations , the French satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné ran a headline that said : &quot; For once , Obama is interested in what we are saying . &quot; 
Europeans should be pleased - and relieved - that they are no longer America &apos;s first line of defense . 
But if they want the US to listen to them , they need to have something to say , and they need to say it together .
