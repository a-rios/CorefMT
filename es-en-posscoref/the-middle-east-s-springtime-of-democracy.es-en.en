The Middle East &apos;s Springtime of Democracy 
Election results around the Middle East mark a new trend : Islamist political parties - those that base their platforms on Islamic law - are highly popular . 
Where elections are held , Islamists do well : Hamas among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza ; the religiously-oriented Shi &apos;ite coalition in Iraq ; a parliamentary faction in Morocco and , most significantly , the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) in Turkey . 
Democracy movements in Lebanon , Egypt , and elsewhere in the region must face the challenge of incorporating Islamist parties into democratic systems . 
But can the Islamists be trusted ? 
Will they tolerate dissent ? 
Or will such elections be based on &quot; one man , one vote , one time ? &quot; 
As a sociologist , I have been studying these issues for 30 years . 
As an inmate of an Egyptian prison , I discussed them with my fellow prisoners , many of whom were imprisoned as supporters of Egypt &apos;s Islamic movement . 
My conclusion ? 
Islamist parties are changing . 
These parties understand the social transformations underway in the Middle East that are leading toward democracy , and they want to take part . 
In my view , we may be witnessing the emergence of Muslim democratic parties , much like the rise of Christian Democratic parties in Europe in the years after World War II . 
The Islamists &quot; popularity is not difficult to understand . 
Since autocratic regimes in the Middle East left little room for free expression , the mosque emerged as the only place where people could freely congregate . 
Religious groups responded to this opportunity , emerging first as social welfare agencies , and then becoming the equivalent of local politicians . 
In the process , they gained credibility as trustworthy advocates of the people - a real distinction from repressive and corrupt governments . 
In principle , it would be hypocritical to advocate democracy and at the same time the exclusion of Islamists from peaceful political participation . 
But the practice of electoral politics also gives us reason for optimism . 
By my count , some two-thirds of the 1.4 billion Muslims in the world now live under elected governments in which Islamist parties are players . 
When Islamist groups are denied access to electoral politics , their cause takes on a mythic aura . 
Their principles remain untested ideals , never forced to confront the practical realities of governance . 
The late King Hussein took up this challenge in 1989 , after bread riots in the southern Jordanian city of Ma &apos;an . 
The King brought all the political forces together to draft a national charter for political participation . 
The Islamists signed on , pledging their respect for the rules of the game . 
In the years since , Islamists have participated in four Jordanian elections . 
The first time , they gained a governing plurality , put their slogans into practice , and failed to maintain their popular support . 
In the four ministries the Islamists ran , they imposed restrictions on female staff members , triggering widespread protests that ultimately forced the four ministers to resign . 
Their share of the vote in subsequent elections declined sharply . 
By contrast , it is a mistake to believe that force can eliminate Islamist movements . 
Instead , political reform ought to include them - under the following conditions : Respect for the national constitution , the rule of law , and the independence of the judiciary ; 
Guaranteed equal rights and full political participation for non-Muslim minorities ; 
The role of external actors in promoting democracy in the Middle East is also critical . 
Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were predicated , at least in part , on spreading freedom ; similarly , the Middle East Partnership Initiative is supposed to make democracy the centerpiece of American assistance in the region . 
It is important to remember , though , that democracy was on the international agenda before the United States was attacked in September 2001 . 
Under the Barcelona Accord of 1995 , the European Union offered aid and trade to several Arab countries , in exchange for progress on democratic reform . 
The trade improvements have been delivered , but little has been accomplished on Arab domestic reform . 
In the 1970 &quot; s , the Helsinki Accord helped bring down the Soviet Empire . 
We need a comparable formula for the Middle East . 
Whatever one thinks of American military intervention , one must concede that it has altered the region &apos;s dynamics . 
Domestic opposition forces , while distancing themselves from the US , have been markedly emboldened in Lebanon , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and elsewhere . 
We are all watching for signs of opening among our neighbors . 
I know that stirrings of democracy have been crushed before : in Budapest in 1956 , Prague in 1968 , and in Tiananmen Square in 1989 . 
Yet something about the last few months feels new and irreversible . 
Too many people in too many places are defying their oppressors and taking risks for freedom . 
To a long-time activist , today &apos;s climate feels like spring .
