War in Slow Motion 
Cut through all the rhetoric and posturing of war , terrorism , and nuclear holocaust and one thing stands above everything else in the looming confrontation between India and Pakistan . 
India , badly shaken by last December &apos;s suicide attack on its parliament ( which came within seconds of wiping out the entire political leadership of the world &apos;s largest democracy ) is not bluffing . 
It is prepared to go to war to put a stop to the terrorist incursions that have ravaged Kashmir for 18 years . 
Yet India &apos;s &quot; war policy &quot; is flexible , because it does not demand a classical victory over Pakistan . 
It wants , instead , to end cross-border terrorism by changing Pakistan &apos;s long-held belief that it could &quot; bleed India with a thousand cuts &quot; at low cost to itself and thus bring about a change in the status of Kashmir as part of India . 
In its &quot; war against terror , &quot; India will thus apply force in small doses spread over time with a cumulative impact , possibly extending beyond the next year - a war , so to say , in slow motion . 
What would such a war look like ? 
A look at the structure of the opposing forces will help here . 
India enjoys a substantial quantitative and qualitative superiority over Pakistan in conventional forces . 
This superiority is why Pakistan acquired nuclear weapons . 
It could not match India in any conventional battle , and like the West in its confrontation with the USSR during the Cold War , sought the security of nuclear stalemate . 
India &apos;s &quot; war aim &quot; - that is , if war comes - is to raise the costs to Pakistan of its policy of encouraging and inciting cross-border terrorism . 
At present levels of deployment along the 2,900-km long border , Pakistan &apos;s annual military bill will jump from 35 to 42 % of GDP , a hideous amount in a decaying economy . 
India , meanwhile , will see its military budget increase 2 % , to 9 % of GDP . 
Of course , India will seek to keep the war conventional , and so will try to pose its threat to Pakistan at well below the nuclear threshold as Islamabad defines it . 
But such military planning requires pinpoint judgments on both sides . 
India would seek to keep the war confined to the state of Jammu and Kashmir , the locus of jihadi terrorist attacks . 
India &apos;s main forces , especially its armored forces , even now at the height of mobilization , remain deployed in a strategically defensive posture across the region outside Kashmir . 
India &apos;s offensive operations are likely to be conducted in small doses , with infantry attacks by small units layered between artillery barrages . 
Pakistan would likely respond in kind , and so a continuing battle of attrition would ensue without territorial advances , something akin to the Israeli-Egyptian battles between 1971-73 . 
( It should be remembered , however , that those battles led to the Yom Kippur War of 1973 , a struggle that at one moment almost nearly lured the US and USSR into the most serious nuclear confrontation since the Cuban Missile Crisis . ) 
India believes that static warfare and a battle of attrition would substantially interfere with terrorist infiltrations across the Line of Control that separates Indian Kashmir from that controlled by Pakistan . 
Real escalation would come with the use of combat aircraft . 
With a 750 to 350 numerical advantage in combat aircraft , India &apos;s Air Force is far superior . 
More importantly , India has a decisive edge with 390 high performance modern ( 1980-90s acquisitions ) all-weather combat aircraft ( 40 Sukhoi-30 , 50 Mirage-2000 multi-role combat aircraft , 70 air superiority MiG-29 , and 110 Jaguars and 120 MiG-27 strike aircraft ) compared to Pakistan &apos;s 30-odd F-16 multi-role combat aircraft . 
But India is likely to limit the use of air power to strikes against terrorist training camps and selected infrastructure in Pakistani-occupied Kashmir . 
Pakistan would likely respond either by engaging Indian fighters in aerial dogfights or by attacking Indian air bases . 
Should air combat take place , India &apos;s Navy , with a superior force of 27 major surface warships ( including 3 guided missile cruisers ) and 16 submarines ( against Pakistan &apos;s 7 warships and 9 submarines ) would seek to dominate the north Arabian Sea , cutting off Pakistan from trade and resupply . 
Of course , in the face of India &apos;s vast advantages in conventional forces , and the flexible nature of India &apos;s strategy , there is a grave risk that Pakistan will escalate its response hastily , even to the point of approaching its own ultimate &quot; Samson Option &quot; - use of nuclear weapons . 
India &apos;s nuclear doctrine and strategy , poorly understood abroad , is not to use nuclear weapons first . 
Pakistan , however , does not subscribe to such a &quot; no-first-use &quot; doctrine . 
Still , it may be expected to resort to nuclear weapons only if its survival or extremely vital interests are at stake . 
India will do everything it can not to push Pakistan into such a corner , especially since the war it seeks to wage is one against terrorism and not Pakistan itself ( although that distinction often gets blurred . ) 
In the event of a doomsday scenario , where Pakistan uses its nuclear weapons first , the bulk of India &apos;s nuclear arsenal would survive to deliver , in terms of Indian doctrine , &quot; assured retaliation &quot; leading to &quot; unacceptable levels of punishment . &quot; 
The result ? 
Grievous damage to India , but the almost total destruction of Pakistan &apos;s state and society . 
&quot; War in slow motion , &quot; it seems , does run the risk of becoming a war of annihilation .
