Conservative Interventionism 
BERKELEY - At this stage in the worldwide fight against depression , it is useful to stop and consider just how conservative the policies implemented by the world &apos;s central banks , treasuries , and government budget offices have been . 
Almost everything that they have done - spending increases , tax cuts , bank recapitalization , purchases of risky assets , open-market operations , and other money-supply expansions - has followed a policy path that is nearly 200 years old , dating back to the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution , and thus to the first stirrings of the business cycle . 
The place to start is 1825 , when panicked investors wanted their money invested in safe cash rather than risky enterprises . 
Robert Banks Jenkinson , Second Earl of Liverpool and First Lord of the Treasury for King George IV , begged Cornelius Buller , Governor of the Bank of England , to act to prevent financial-asset prices from collapsing . 
&quot; We believe in a market economy , &quot; Lord Liverpool &apos;s reasoning went , &quot; but not when the prices a market economy produces lead to mass unemployment on the streets of London , Bristol , Liverpool , and Manchester . &quot; 
The Bank of England acted : it intervened in the market and bought bonds for cash , pushing up the prices of financial assets and expanding the money supply . 
It loaned on little collateral to shaky banks . 
It announced its intention to stabilize the market - and that bearish speculators should beware . 
Ever since , whenever governments largely stepped back and let financial markets work their way out of a panic out by themselves - 1873 and 1929 in the United States come to mind - things turned out badly . 
But whenever government stepped in or deputized a private investment bank to support the market , things appear to have gone far less badly . 
For example , the US government essentially authorized J.P. Morgan to act as the country &apos;s central bank in the aftermath of the 1893 and 1907 panics , created the Resolution Trust Corporation at the start of the 1990 &quot; s , and , together with the IMF , intervened to support Mexico in 1995 and the East Asian economies in 1997-98 . 
At the very least , few modern governments are now willing to let financial market heal themselves . 
To do so would be a truly radical step indeed . 
The Obama administration and other central bankers and fiscal authorities around the globe are thus , in a sense , acting very conservatively , even as they embrace deficit-spending programs , boost the volume of government bonds , guarantee risky private debt , and buy up auto companies . 
I understand what they are trying to do , and I am somewhat reluctant to second-guess them . They are all doing their absolute best , and I know that if I were in any of their shoes I would be making bigger mistakes than they are - different mistakes , probably , but bigger ones for sure . 
Nevertheless , I do have one big question . 
The US government especially , but other governments as well , have gotten themselves deeply involved in industrial and financial policy during this crisis . 
They have done this without constructing technocratic institutions like the 1930 &quot; s Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the 1990 &quot; s RTC , which played major roles in allowing earlier episodes of extraordinary government intervention into the industrial and financial guts of the economy to turn out relatively well , without an overwhelming degree of corruption and rent seeking . 
The discretionary power of executives , in past crises , was curbed by new interventionist institutions constructed on the fly by legislative action . 
That is how America &apos;s founders , such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton , envisioned that things would work . 
They were suspicious of executive power , and thought that the president should have rather less discretionary power than the various King Georges of the time . 
Yet , today &apos;s crisis has not led to the establishment of such financial institutions . 
So I wonder : why didn &apos;t the US Congress follow the RFC / RTC model when authorizing George W. Bush &apos;s and Barack Obama &apos;s industrial and financial policies ? 
Why haven &apos;t the technocratic institutions that we do have , like the IMF , been given a broader role in this crisis ? 
And what can we do to rebuild international financial-management institutions on the fly to make them the best possible ?
