Sacred Promises 
JOHANNESBURG - A promise to the poor is particularly sacred . 
It is an act of grace and great leadership when all efforts are made to keep these pacts , and that is why those G-8 countries that are leading the charge for the poorest , especially for those in Africa , deserve much credit . 
But we who praise must also be prepared to censure where it is clearly deserved . 
It saddens me that great nations like Italy and France are going in the wrong direction and falling behind with the pledges they made four years ago at the G-8 summit in Gleneagles , Scotland . 
We must all campaign to encourage leaders at the forthcoming G-8 meetings to get back on track and do what is right . 
Of course , African development must be driven by African citizens - from all areas of society . 
But we also need and welcome international support in our struggle against poverty and injustice . 
That means support from governments , and from good citizens in countries like Italy . 
I expect that most of us tend to be deeply distressed- and often devastated- when we look at the news and see what is happening in Darfur , Zimbabwe , and the Congo . 
Well , I want to tell you that there is good news from Africa . 
When I went to Darfur recently , I was particularly struck by those humanitarian workers who keep going back into an awful situation . 
I want to stand up and shout loudly for the fact that there are so many young people who are incredibly idealistic , who do believe that poverty can become history , who believe that it is possible to have a world without war . 
Evil does not have a free rein . 
I come from a position that says that ours is a moral universe , and good will ultimately prevail . 
In Africa , just within the past decade , 34 million more children are now going to school , having the chance to learn to read and write and escape poverty . 
This is thanks to the efforts of African leadership and effective aid , including that of G-8 countries . 
It can be hard to imagine 34 million children . 
So imagine just one child who can now go to school and receive the gift of education . 
Give this child the face of a child you know . 
Give the face a name . 
It &apos;s not about numbers ; it &apos;s about that child - somebody &apos;s son , somebody &apos;s brother . 
It is fantastic that this has happened . 
There is also good news in the fight against illnesses like HIV / AIDS . 
There are now an estimated three million people in Africa on life-saving AIDS treatment . 
Imagine that you are in a family affected by AIDS , your breadwinner received a death warrant , and you watched this person slipping away . 
Then she gets antiretroviral drugs and you see a metamorphosis . 
We thought our mother was dying , but now our mother is well enough to go to work . 
There are three million such individuals . 
Because aid has been given . 
A promise to the poor is particularly sacred . 
Not keeping that promise is a sin .
