Seven Years in Afghanistan 
KABUL -We began a journey in Afghanistan seven years ago with the war that ousted the Taliban from power . 
Much has been accomplished along the way , for Afghanistan and for the world . 
In less than 45 days in 2001 , we Afghans were freed from the menace of terrorism and the Taliban . 
Back then , Afghanistan &apos;s people held great hopes for an immediately wonderful future . 
Some of those hopes were fulfilled . 
Our children are back in school . 
Roughly 85 % of Afghans now have access to some health care , up from 9 % before 2001 . 
Child mortality - among the worst in the world in 2001 - has dropped by 25 % . 
Democracy , a free press , economic gains , and better livelihoods - all of that is there . 
But , sadly , we are still fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda . 
What is it that we have not done right that makes us - and the rest of the world - less secure ? 
After the liberation in 2001 , the international community concentrated on Afghanistan alone as the place to fight extremism and terrorism , while we Afghans argued that our country is not the right place to fight . 
The war on terrorism cannot be fought in Afghan villages . 
But we were not heard . 
Regardless of whether that was the result of a lack of knowledge or a lack of will , events have proven us right . 
Unfortunately , for the past two years , Pakistan has been suffering as much or perhaps more than Afghanistan has suffered . 
Almost the entire tribal belt along the Pakistan / Afghanistan border is suffering . 
Just as schools were burned in Afghanistan from 2004 onwards , for the past year schools - especially for girls - have been burned there , leaving 80,000 children without facilities . 
Bridges have been blown up , soldiers and police killed . 
Bombs have exploded from Karachi to Lahore to Islamabad . 
The violence has spread to India as well , with bombings in Gujarat , Bangalore , and Delhi . 
So the problem is regional , and it concerns institutional support for extremism that incites terrorism . 
Unless we collectively address the roots of the problem by ending that support , as well as financial support for radicalism in all forms , we will not defeat terrorism . 
This has not been properly understood in the West , which has been fighting the symptoms of terrorism , but has failed to attack its underlying causes . 
Fortunately , today I see signs of recognition of this malaise . 
And democratic change in Pakistan is good news for Afghans , Pakistani people , and , by extension , many others around the world . 
Pakistan &apos;s new president , Asif Ali Zardari , has suffered from terrorism as we have suffered . 
His wife , Benazir Bhutto , was killed by terrorists . 
I visited Pakistan for President Zardari &apos;s inauguration , and for the first time I saw a dim ray of hope . 
If we can all work together - Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , the United States , and our allies - I see a possibility of moving beyond the days when a government thinks it needs extremism as an instrument of policy . 
When all governments in the region reject extremism , there will be no place for extremists , and terrorism will wither away . 
But this also requires helping those people who out of desperation have fallen prey to extremist forces . 
Last year , I pardoned a 14-year-old boy from the Pakistan tribal area in Waziristan who had come to Afghanistan to blow himself up as a suicide bomber . 
Only utter hopelessness can drive so young a man to such an act . 
We must rescue these people by giving them a better future , which only more education and new opportunities can bring . 
Desperation and poverty are the tools used by evil forces to raise their terrorist cadres . 
But that environment will not change if political will is lacking , and if there is no action by the US and the governments of the region to get our economies to create jobs that offer hope . 
Moreover , in order to deny terrorists institutional support , we must bring institutional strength to Afghanistan . 
We must enable Afghans to look after themselves and defend their country , to have a future in Afghanistan , to have hope of raising their children in Afghanistan . 
Recently , I spoke to an Afghan man very close to me . 
He has a son who works in the Afghan Foreign Office . 
That young man was born in the US but returned to Afghanistan four years ago . 
The father asked , &quot; Do you think I should take my son back to the US ? &quot; 
Let him live here , let him work here , let him be an Afghan . &quot; 
He said , &quot; Yes , but will he have a future ? &quot; 
A viable future means security as well as bread . 
We have started to bring hope by educating young Afghans , but we have not yet succeeded in bringing them a secure life , free from the danger of bombs and aerial bombardment . 
Only when that happens will Afghanistan be secure . 
And if the two other conditions are fulfilled - removal of political backing for radicalism and help for the desperate - we will have a safer life not only in Afghanistan , but in Pakistan , India , and the rest of the world .
