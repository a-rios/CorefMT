China &apos;s African Front 
DAKAR - China &apos;s sacred text is not a holy book like the Torah , the Bible , or the Koran . 
Instead , it is The Art of War by Sun-Tzu . 
Sun &apos;s core belief is that the &quot; ultimate excellence lies not in winning every battle but in defeating the enemy without ever fighting . &quot; 
So it is no surprise that cunning and deception form an essential part of Chinese diplomatic and corporate culture . 
Indeed , down through the ages they have served as the touchstone for Chinese leaders &quot; survival and success . 
Nowadays , we are witnessing the application of Sun &apos;s ideas in Africa , where China &apos;s prime objectives are to secure energy and mineral supplies to fuel its breakneck economic expansion , open up new markets , curtail Taiwan &apos;s influence on the continent , consolidate its burgeoning global authority , and clinch for themselves African-allocated export quotas . 
( The Chinese takeovers of South African and Nigerian textile industries are good examples of this strategy . 
The textiles exported the world over by these industries are deemed African exports when in reality they are now Chinese exports . ) 
Astutely , China has sought to place its African investments and diplomacy within the context of the old non-aligned movement and &quot; Bandung spirit , &quot; an era when many Africans viewed China as a brotherly oppressed nation , and thus supported efforts by the People &apos;s Republic to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council , to replace Taiwan . 
And , of course , China offered firm backing for Africa &apos;s anti-colonial struggles and efforts to end apartheid . 
In trying to depict its current dealings with Africa as &quot; win-win &quot; cooperation , China deliberately seeks to portray Africa &apos;s current relations with the West as exploitative . 
Unlike China , its leaders claim , the West continues to hold African countries hostage through a combination of unequal trade deals , lack of access to capital markets , aid dependency , financial deregulation and economic liberalization , budget austerity , crippling debt , political meddling , and military intervention . 
What the Chinese are silent about is that their country &apos;s growing engagement in Africa has created both opportunities and risks for African development . 
Although China &apos;s trade , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and aid may broaden Africa &apos;s growth options , they also promote what can only be called a win-lose situation . 
For , excluding oil , Africa has a negative trade balance with China . 
Making matters worse , African exports to China are even less technology-intensive than its exports to the world . 
China &apos;s share of Africa &apos;s unprocessed primary products was more than 80 % of its total imports from Africa . 
Equally , imports consist of cheap Chinese products of appallingly poor quality . 
The level of Chinese FDI flowing into Africa at present is staggering . 
But this Chinese FDI is bundled together with concessional loans , and there is much double-counting , with the same ventures being recorded both as aid flows and as inflows of FDI . 
Given the heavy volume of concessionary loans provided by China , concern about African countries &quot; future debt burden is growing . 
And no matter how much China publicizes its record in Africa , the greatest contributor of financial inflows to the continent is the African diaspora . 
Indeed , South Africa , not China , is the country making the largest investments in the rest of Africa . 
China &apos;s credo of &quot; non-interference in domestic affairs &quot; and &quot; separation of business and politics &quot; is , not surprisingly , music to the ears of African leaders , who fall over each other to sing the praises of Chinese cooperation with their countries . 
These leaders &quot; attitudes recall the worst behavior of their predecessors , many of whom engaged centuries ago with the West &apos;s rising imperial powers to halt the growth of indigenous industry . 
Instead , these potentates of the past chose to import manufactured goods from Europe in exchange for their own subjects , whom they exported as slaves . 
When slavery was abolished , the terms of partnership with Western colonizers changed from trade in slaves to trade in commodities . 
After independence in the early 1960 &quot; s , during the Cold War , they played the West against the Soviet bloc for the same purpose . 
Today , many African leaders pursue similar policies with China , which has struck bargains across Africa to secure crude oil , minerals , and metals in exchange for infrastructure built by Chinese companies . 
Hence , the import of Chinese labor into a continent not lacking in able-bodied workers . 
Indeed , within a mere decade , more Chinese have come to live in Africa than there are Europeans on the continent , even after many centuries of European colonial and neo-colonial rule . 
With apartheid-style practices - including the gunning down of local workers by a Chinese manager in Zambia - Chinese managers impose appalling working conditions on their African employees . 
Today , China has seized control of a huge swath of local African industries , in the process grabbing their allocated export quotas . 
As China &apos;s global economic role increases , its labor costs will rise and its currency will appreciate , eroding its competitiveness . 
Might Chinese manufacturers then look to Africa as a base for production , using the facilities they have built and the hordes of workers they have been steadily exporting there ? 
Chinese leaders pride themselves on a keen sense of history , and on taking a long-term view of China &apos;s development . 
The descendants of slave traders and slave owners in the United States now have a black man as their president ; 
Unless the Chinese mend their ways , the same fate awaits them in Africa . 
Sun-Tzu would understand that .
