Bonded Bankers 
CAMBRIDGE - Since the global financial crisis , regulators have worked hard to make the world &apos;s big banks safer . 
The fundamental problem is well known : major banks have significant incentives to take on excessive risk . 
If their risky bets pay off , their stockholders benefit considerably , as do the banks &quot; CEOs and senior managers , who are heavily compensated in bank stock . 
If they do not pay off and the bank fails , the government will probably pick up the tab . 
This confluence of economic incentives to take on risk makes bank managers poor guardians of financial safety . 
They surely do not want their bank to fail ; but , if the potential upside is large enough , it is a risk they may find worth taking . 
Several solutions to this problem have been proposed , and some - such as increased capital requirements and restrictions on risky investments - are headed toward implementation . 
More recently , two other important solutions have emerged . 
Under the first , more developed proposal , banks would undertake large obligations via long-term bonds , which would be paid only if their operations are sound . 
In effect , the long-term bondholders would guarantee the rest of a bank &apos;s debts , including the riskiest ones . 
If the bank faltered , the guaranteeing bondholders would stabilize the most troubled elements of the firm . 
The bondholders - not the bank &apos;s core operations - would take the hit . 
Proponents hope that this would soften the systemic cost of bank failure . 
They also hope that the guarantees would motivate the bondholders to monitor banks &quot; activities and pressure bank managers to limit their risky operations . 
The second solution that is gaining ground is to revise bankers &quot; compensation . 
Senior bank managers would be paid not in cash or equity , but in the bank &apos;s long-term bonds , thereby giving them a larger financial stake in the bank &apos;s long-term stability , instead of its long-term stock price . 
If the bank failed , it would be unable to repay the bonds , and the managers owning bonds would be that much poorer . 
Bank regulators in the US and elsewhere are now seriously considering such changes , but they have yet to determine how comprehensive the compensation makeover should be . 
In general , though , a substantial share of senior bankers &quot; pay would be deferred for several years . 
If the bank did not survive that long , the managers would lose that money . 
This could be achieved by unfunded pension obligations , which do not require that banks set aside the money in advance . 
Banks overseen by managers who had larger unfunded pensions weathered the financial crisis better than their counterparts , presumably because they had a stronger incentive to keep them safe . 
A more aggressive approach would compensate bankers with the same bonds that guarantee their institutions &quot; short-term , volatile , and risky debts . 
As a result , bank managers would have a personal financial stake in ensuring that the risky obligations do not blow up , as they did during the 2007-2008 financial crisis . 
If the obligations deteriorated and the bank failed , the managers would be left unpaid . 
Because the obligations would be guaranteeing the rest of the bank &apos;s operations , the managers would , it is hoped , be especially vigilant in ensuring that basic operations were safe . 
By tying senior managers &quot; pay to the bank &apos;s stability , the financial sector , advocates argue , would be forced to police itself . 
This incentive-based regulation could bolster economic stability more effectively than expecting regulators to keep pace with banks &quot; risky activities . 
The proposal is not perfect - not least because bank managers &quot; compensation would still be tied to profits . 
If a banker is told that he or she will be compensated entirely in bonds this year , with the bank &apos;s annual profits determining the number of bonds to be received , the banker would obviously want to boost this year &apos;s profits - even if it required taking bigger risks . 
After the banker receives his or her first bond payment , the incentives become more complex . 
The banker wants last year &apos;s bonds to be paid ( creating an incentive to safeguard stability ) but wants a high payment this year ( creating an incentive to maximize profit , which usually entails risk-taking ) . 
Moreover , bankers could find ways to sell the long-term bonds . 
While regulators can require that the bonds remain unpaid by the bank , and even that bankers prove that they have not sold them , senior bankers are adept at finding loopholes . 
They could , for example , retain ownership of the bonds , but sell off their economic interest . 
Bank executives who hold large numbers of these bonds would have an incentive to lobby to dilute the bonds &quot; guarantee . 
If the bank &apos;s financial condition deteriorated , their bond holdings might motivate them to conceal that and hope for a turnaround before their bonds were wiped out . 
All of this highlights the imperative that regulators develop a shrewd and comprehensive strategy for supervising such a compensation system . 
Otherwise , it would lose its effectiveness . 
Compensating bankers with bonds helps to promote safety , but it does not let the regulators off the hook . 
Despite these challenges , a new , bond-based compensation strategy could enhance bank stability considerably . 
Though there is no silver bullet for bank regulation , implementing such a system with care and vigilance would be an important step in the right direction .
