Putin and Medvedev : Teammates or Rivals ? 
Vladimir Putin &apos;s decision to serve as prime minister should Dmitri Medvedev become Russia &apos;s next president has made their electoral success in March a virtual certainty . 
Although the Communist Party &apos;s leader , Gennadi Zyuganov , and the Liberal Democrats &quot; Vladimir Zhirinovsky are running - in contrast to 2004 , when they fielded stand-ins - neither will get more than 15 % of the vote . 
Even assuming that Mikhail Kasyanov , Boris Nemtsov , and Democratic Party leader Andrei Bogdanov somehow collect two million signatures each to get on the ballot , the outcome will be the same . 
Indeed , so far , none of them has more than 2 % popular support . 
But , while Medvedev &apos;s victory in the first round of voting appears assured , the important questions will arise after the ballots are counted . 
How will power be distributed between Medvedev and Putin ? 
Who will be in charge ? 
Will Russia have to rewrite its laws and Constitution to give the prime minister more official power ? 
Is Putin risking his political future by accepting a formally secondary role and making himself accountable for all socio-economic policy ? 
Russia &apos;s Constitution does not allow for a &quot; technical presidency . &quot; 
The head of state has extensive powers , which alone indicates that Medvedev will be a strong president . 
Moreover , Medvedev is a strong-willed politician and very experienced administrator . 
But Putin will be a strong prime minister , if only because he &apos;s Putin . 
He is set to remain the most popular person in Russia for a long time to come . 
That implies a system of governance with at least two decision-making centers - perhaps in addition to United Russia , the party of Putin and Medvedev , which won 64 % of the vote in the recent parliamentary election up from 37 % in 2003 . 
All this represents obvious progress from the standpoint of the separation of powers . 
In consenting to become prime minister , Putin is well aware of what to expect . 
After all , he served as prime minister for several months in 1999 . 
Many commentators underestimate the prime minister &apos;s powers . 
According to the Constitution , the prime minister is head of the executive branch , and the government is empowered to determine the main direction of domestic and foreign policy . 
Much depends on who is prime minister ; heavyweight politicians holding the office can potentially eclipse the president . 
Recall Yevgeny Primakov - or Putin at the end of Boris Yeltsin &apos;s last presidential term , when it was obvious to everyone that the prime minister was running the country . 
The 2008 version of Prime Minister Putin will undoubtedly be stronger than the 1999 version . 
So no changes are required to the laws or the Constitution for him to remain a key political player . 
But Medvedev - youthful and energetic , with a fresh mandate - will be far stronger than Yeltsin was in 1999 . 
A powerful prime minister seems preferable . 
One of the chief weaknesses in Russia &apos;s constitutional design is that power is separated from accountability : the president has the most power , but the government is held accountable for policy results . 
From this standpoint , the American model , for example , is more successful : the head of state also leads the government . 
While not entirely addressing the flaws in the design , the new situation - with the strongest political figure heading the executive branch - will permit more effective performance by the government , which is still battling to recover from Putin &apos;s administrative reforms of 2004 . 
Many commentators have reproached Putin for agreeing to take a job that they say is beneath him - assuming responsibility for road-building , social services , inflation , and many other problems that could undermine his popularity . 
However , he should be thanked rather than reproached . 
But how stable will this new polycentric system of governance be ? 
How long will Medvedev remain president and Putin prime minister ? 
What if they quarrel ? 
Of course , stability requires agreement between the two key actors ; and there are sure to be plenty of opponents and allies trying to stir up trouble between them . 
But Putin and Medvedev have worked together for more than 17 years with no serious conflicts . 
Moreover , Putin has never made a mistake about the loyalty of the people he promotes . 
In the Yeltsin era , sacked officials often took revenge by publishing their memoirs and &quot; telling all &quot; about their ex-boss . 
In the Putin era , no one has done so . 
Mikhail Kasyanov , a former prime minister and now an opposition critic , was inherited from Yeltsin . 
When Putin made the most important appointment of his life - the choice of his successor - one can be sure that his calculations were thorough . 
So Medvedev will become the next president , and will hold that office for at least one full term . 
And Putin will remain prime minister throughout that time , with a good chance of becoming president again in 2012 or 2016 - or after any other presidential election over the next two decades .
