The ECB &apos;s Path Not Taken 
It is now clear that the European Central Bank views higher interest rates as the right response to rising oil prices . 
As a result , the ECB risks painting itself into a corner , for the logic behind this week &apos;s interest-rate hike implies that more increases will follow - a series of policy mistakes that will cost the Eurozone economies heavily . 
Despite statements to the contrary , no central bank , including the ECB , can simply focus on inflation and ignore what happens to economic activity . 
Suppose , for the sake of argument , that stabilizing prices came at the cost of a 30 % unemployment rate . 
Surely nobody would want that . 
The ECB &apos;s defenders would say that such an outcome is purely hypothetical - and irrelevant - for there is no conflict between stabilizing inflation and sustaining the appropriate level of economic activity . 
Price stability , according to this view , reduces uncertainty , thereby enabling firms and individuals to take the right decisions , so it is good , not bad , for economic activity . 
This argument is true - most of the time . 
But when an economy faces a major adverse shock , such as a sharp increase in oil prices , then the twin goals of stabilizing inflation and maintaining economic activity conflict , and the central bank &apos;s job becomes more difficult . 
Think about what stabilizing inflation means in such a context . 
Firms are likely to pass the increase in energy costs on to consumers by raising their prices . 
In response , workers are likely to demand higher nominal wages . 
If the central bank is to avoid an inflation spiral , it must ensure that the &quot; first round &quot; effects of higher energy prices on inflation do not fuel such &quot; second round &quot; effects . 
In an environment where productivity gains and wage growth are already weak , as in Europe today , persuading workers to accept a cut in real wages may be tough . 
The interest-rate increase decided this week will soon appear insufficient , and will have to be followed by further hikes and a large increase in unemployment . 
In order to achieve its inflation goal , the ECB may have to contract activity until workers are , in effect , beaten into submission . 
Is there a better way to respond to adverse shocks ? 
The answer from monetary theory is an unambiguous &quot; yes &quot; : give workers a chance to adjust to higher energy prices , allow for some pass-through of higher prices to wages over time ( so that wages adjust more gradually ) , and make clear that inflation will return to its target range within , say , a year or two . 
Such a policy will limit the increase in unemployment , at the cost of only temporarily higher inflation . 
So , why is the ECB set on a tougher course ? 
There are three plausible reasons . 
First , there has been little wage pressure so far . 
So the ECB may not have to increase interest rates very much in order to contain inflation . 
If this scenario plays out , the impact on economic activity and employment will be minimal . 
But there are good historical grounds for thinking that it won &apos;t . 
What we are seeing in Europe today is more likely to be delayed adjustment rather than passive acceptance of real wage cuts by workers and unions . 
The ECB should not delude itself into thinking that a small increase in interest rates will be enough . 
If and when wage pressure comes , the ECB , to remain true to its word , may be forced to increase interest rates much more than it now expects . 
The second argument is that if the ECB stands firm , workers will not demand higher nominal wages , for they will understand that this would only lead to higher interest rates and higher unemployment . 
This argument is not irrelevant ; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bargaining . 
But one should not expect too much from a tough ECB stance . 
Think of the limited success of the ECB &apos;s advocacy of greater labor-market flexibility : there has been no dramatic increase in the pace of reforms . 
The third argument is that higher inflation today would endanger the ECB &apos;s credibility in the future . 
This argument , too , is hardly irrelevant : higher inflation today must not be permitted to change inflation expectations in the medium run . 
Leaving interest rates on hold in the face of adverse price shocks thus requires a convincing explanation by the ECB of its underlying policy . 
Here , the ECB &apos;s task is all the more difficult because , having focused so narrowly on inflation stabilization , markets would read adoption of a more flexible stance as a change in position . 
Moreover , because the ECB has actually exceeded its inflation target in recent years , its credibility is already in doubt . 
True , adopting the appropriate policy would require the ECB to articulate its rationale with great care . 
Here it can take lessons from its British and American counterparts : credibility does not require dogmatism , but rather clarity of purpose . 
What is at stake is too important to ignore . 
On its current policy path , unless oil prices fall , the ECB risks being forced to commit to substantially higher interest rates , and thus to a further increase in Eurozone unemployment .
