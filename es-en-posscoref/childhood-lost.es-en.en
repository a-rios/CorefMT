Childhood Lost 
The cries of working children can be heard the world over . 
They often labor under hazardous conditions , handling poisonous chemicals , inhaling noxious fumes , and hauling excessive weights . 
They are usually overworked , underfed , and underpaid - if they are paid at all . 
Though many countries have enacted laws forbidding the use - and abuse - of children in the work force , optimism about the conditions faced by working children is unwarranted . 
That conclusion stems from an inescapable fact : the families of most working children depend on their labors to survive . 
Because child labor means cheap labor , the young are often the most employable in developing and recession-plagued economies . 
The director of a medium-size textile enterprise in Bangladesh admits without hesitation that 70 % of his employees are between the ages of 13 and 17 . 
&quot; They provide the same productivity as adults , &quot; he says , &quot; but for a fraction of the cost . &quot; 
Children , of course , are unlikely to organize or complain to authorities when they are overworked and underpaid . 
They are not aware of their legal rights . 
It verges on slavery when children are locked up without proper lighting , food , and healthcare . 
But they don &apos;t question long hours and dire working conditions . 
Instead , most are grateful to be working at all . 
In Asia and the Pacific , children routinely work endless hours , sleep on factory floors and subsist on scanty rations . 
Young Indian factory workers who fail to follow instructions are sometimes regret branded with red-hot iron rods , and some teenage Thai prostitutes are disciplined by having acid thrown in their faces . 
For thousands of South American , Caribbean , and African children rented out as maids and houseboys , there is no recourse when they are overworked , beaten , and raped . 
As an official of Kenya &apos;s Child Welfare Society concedes , &quot; There is little we can do to help when a child is ill-treated unless the case becomes known to us or to the police . &quot; 
Even when an employer is reasonable , working conditions may still prove dangerous . 
Children in Central America harvest crops sprayed with pesticides . 
Colombian children squeeze through the narrowest shafts of coalmines . 
Thai children toil in unventilated factories , working with glass heated to 1,500 degrees Celsius . 
Indian children inhale large doses of sulphur and potassium chlorate to fashion flammable powder into matches . 
Youthful glassmakers in Brazil breathe toxic silicone and arsenic fumes . 
Sometimes the physical damage from such labors is permanent . 
Brazilian , Colombian , and Egyptian youngsters who work in brickyards often suffer irreparable spinal damage from carrying heavy loads . 
More generally , children who spend long hours in factories all over the world often enter their teens with permanently deformed limbs . 
If they live that long . 
Thousands of children don &apos;t . 
In India safety conditions are so neglected in many factories that numerous children have died in electrical fires and chemical explosions . 
Laws exist to protect children from hazardous conditions in many occupations , but they are seldom enforced . 
The agricultural sector - the largest employer of children in both developing and industrialized countries - is particularly difficult to oversee . 
There is little that officials can do to monitor or modify the children &apos;s workloads on large farms or small family enterprises . 
In fact , parents often appear to be the harshest taskmasters . 
Indian fathers still sometimes repay debts by committing their children to bonded labor . 
Pakistani parents occasionally maim their children to make them beguiling beggars . 
Sadly , families are often the last to protest exploitation of their children . 
The ILO contends that children suffer greatly when they are forced to perform as &quot; small adults . &quot; 
&quot; The child &apos;s creativeness and ability to transcend reality are blunted , &quot; states one ILO report , &quot; and his whole mental world is impoverished . &quot; 
The young worker does not learn how to play , or how to read and write ; worse , he smokes and , in the Caribbean , he drinks cane rum to keep going , as he doesn &apos;t have enough to eat . 
In 1973 , an ILO convention called for a worldwide minimum working age of 15 . 
In ten years , only 27 of the ILO &apos;s 150 member nations ratified that convention . 
Several more countries have laws that set the minimum work age between 12 and 16 , but the ILO cautions that few countries &quot; have what could be considered a comprehensive prohibition of dangerous work for young children , &quot; and that even fewer have &quot; measures to protect young persons from moral degradation . &quot; 
Since laws are not the answer to child labor , many experts propose compulsory education as a means to curb it . 
But education laws have proved elusive too . 
In practically all impoverished societies , parents place wages above education . 
As a result , the percentage of dropouts is rising at an alarming rate . 
A recent study by UNESCO shows that in developing countries up to 60 % of children do not complete primary school . 
Relief agencies agree that the total abolition of child labor is an unrealistic goal . 
So , for millions of such children , the future holds little promise or hope . 
Working children are entitled to something better , regardless of whether they know it .
