A Window on China &apos;s New Normal 
CAMBRIDGE - Every year at this time , China &apos;s government organizes a major conference - sponsored by the Development Research Center , the official think tank of the State Council - that brings together senior Chinese officials , CEOs from major Chinese and Western firms , and a small group of international officials and academics . 
The China Development Forum ( CDF ) occurs just after the annual National People &apos;s Congress . 
At the forum , speakers , including the finance minister and the head of the central bank , summarize the Chinese leadership &apos;s current thinking . 
Officials then listen to comments and suggestions from Western business and academic participants , including a question and answer session with Premier Li Keqiang . 
Although I have been attending the CDF &apos;s meetings for more than a decade , I found this year &apos;s conference substantially different from any in the past . 
The key difference was the official Chinese recognition that annual real GDP growth has declined permanently from the past three decades &quot; average rate of nearly 10 % . 
The official estimate is that real GDP grew 7.4 % in 2014 , and that the rate will probably slow further , to 7 % , this year . 
The Development Research Center presented detailed estimates showing that the growth rate will continue to decline , reaching about 6 % by the end of the decade . 
Virtually every Chinese official referred to this slowdown as their country &apos;s &quot; new normal . &quot; 
They all seemed reconciled to slower growth , which was initially surprising , because officials previously argued that China needed rapid growth to maintain employment and avoid political unrest . 
They now appear to understand that the declining growth rate will not lead to unemployment , because the slowdown reflects China &apos;s structural shift from export-oriented heavy industrial production to increased production of consumer services , which require more employment to create the same amount of value . 
Stronger growth nevertheless remains necessary , because China is still a relatively low-income country with substantial poverty . 
Although China &apos;s total real GDP is second only to that of the United States ( and might be larger when measured in terms of purchasing power ) , its per capita income is only about $ 7,000 , or roughly 15 % of the US level . 
And consumption remains low - only about 50 % of GDP when government spending is included , and just 35 % when limited to household consumer spending . 
So China has a long way to go to reach its leaders &quot; goal of achieving a &quot; modern prosperous society . &quot; 
The Chinese see that the &quot; new normal &quot; requires a shift in their growth strategy from factor-driven growth to innovation-driven growth . 
But it is not clear how that increase in innovation will be achieved . 
While officials stress reliance on the market , China does not have the venture capital and &quot; angel financing &quot; that facilitates innovation in the US . 
The authorities may hope that their plan to insure bank deposits will shift deposits from the three largest banks to many smaller banks around the country , facilitating local startups &quot; access to financing . 
Many other economic problems loom . 
Officials acknowledged at the CDF that the biggest risks lie in the financial sector , particularly owing to local governments &quot; very large liabilities . 
In the past , the government dealt with the problems that these liabilities caused for the banking system by injecting funds into the banks . 
Environmental problems are another powerful drag on China &apos;s current standard of living . 
But they also represent a potential way to increase GDP should overall demand decline significantly . 
China acknowledges that high levels of air and water pollution create discomfort and harm the public &apos;s health . 
Government spending on remedying environmental damage could absorb substantial funds if demand-side weakness exacerbates the expected supply-side slowdown . 
Moreover , the very weak performance of state-owned enterprises , which continue to play a large role in heavy industry and in some service sectors , represents a powerful brake on growth . 
Although official policy aims to reduce these firms &quot; role so that &quot; the market can play the decisive role in resource allocation , &quot; shrinking these firms has proved to be difficult , owing to their strong political backing within the Chinese Communist Party . 
At the same time , China maintains restrictions on direct investment by foreigners , limiting both the kinds of firms and the share of joint ventures that they can own . 
The official policy is to reduce the barriers to foreign corporate investment , especially in high tech and the service sector . 
There were , of course , a number of subjects that remained just below the surface and were not discussed at this year &apos;s CDF . 
There was no indication of a slowdown in President Xi Jinping &apos;s anti-corruption campaign , though some private conversations suggested that the campaign has resulted in decision-making delays that are hurting productivity and growth . 
There was also no discussion of Chinese cyber theft of Western technology . 
When that subject was raised in 2014 , Li denied that the Chinese do such a thing , but noted that Chinese firms are hacked by domestic sources . 
And , with the CDF &apos;s emphasis on cooperation , there was no discussion of possible military action by the Chinese to stake their disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas . 
Meetings like the CDF provide a useful window into a country whose importance for the global economy will continue to grow . 
The current slowdown to a new normal makes such windows even more important .
