The EU or the Christmas Pig 
&quot; We must see to it that the pig - this animal that we , the Romanian nation , cannot afford to live without - is not wiped out . &quot; 
So a socialist deputy in Romania &apos;s Parliament exclaimed in panic a few weeks ago . 
&quot; Within a year , 4.5 million pigs will be killed , but chickens will still enter the European Union before we do , &quot; chirped the president of Romania &apos;s Pig Breeders Association . 
Across Romania , fear is growing of a looming porcine genocide as the country prepares to negotiate its way into the EU . 
For the fact is that most pigs are bred and slaughtered here in a way that fails to meet EU standards , and no one is prepared to invest the money needed to get our piggeries up to Union levels . 
But will our beloved pig be permitted to put the supreme national interest in jeopardy ? 
Romania is due to end its membership negotiations with the EU in 2004 . 
Of course , we have lots of problems that the EU wants to see resolved : unfettered corruption , poor public administration , a justice system that makes a mockery of impartiality , and an economy which , despite some progress , has not yet been declared a &quot; functioning market &quot; by the European Commission . 
But it is agriculture , and in particular the Romanian pig , that is causing the severest headaches in Bucharest and in Brussels . 
Although Romania is just a few hundred miles away from the EU countries , it is a few centuries away in terms of agriculture . 
Some 40 % of our population lives in rural areas , with 80 % of the land divided into small lots . 
For centuries Romanian farmers have bred a few pigs each year , out of which the biggest are slaughtered just before Christmas , on St. Ignatius &apos; Day . 
It is an almost pagan sacrifice : in the farm &apos;s backyard the animal is held down by a pair of strong men , the pig squealing as much as it can . 
Suddenly , a third man cuts the pig &apos;s throat , a fountain of blood sprinkling everyone . 
Then the carcass is singed on a fire and cut into pieces according to the different cuts of meat . 
People dance around , drink heavily , and prepare for a monstrous feast . 
Unfortunately , in terms of the European Commission , nothing is less &quot; European &quot; than this porcine hecatomb . 
In fact , EU regulations demand that pigs be raised and killed as humanely as possible , in order to make them suffer as little as possible . 
Pigs should be vaccinated , given anesthesia , provided even with the chance of a merciful euthanasia . 
Better yet , the pig should die in his sleep , finished off peacefully by trained executioners . 
Everything should be supervised by vets . 
Otherwise , you are infringing EU regulations and are guilty of exercising &quot; unnecessary cruelty &quot; upon animals . 
Either Romania , as an EU applicant , complies with these regulations or it must abandon pig breeding on a familiar scale and , as a consequence , increase the share of pork importation . 
Unless breeders adapt to the new , coming European era , Romanian pigs , at least those bred on thousands and thousands of small farms scattered across the countryside , seem doomed . 
The problem is that , in Romania , we have a hard enough time comprehending and protecting human rights , let alone animal rights . 
Veterinarians are few , but our human health services are in ruin as well . 
Indeed , most people cannot afford proper medication , and hospitals suffer from gross under-funding . 
So it seems to most Romanians not only preposterous , but immoral , for the EU to care so much for a pig &apos;s last moments of life when it seems to care so little for the everyday life of ordinary Romanians . 
Moreover , how is our government supposed to get millions of farmers to give up their barbaric ancestral habit ? 
By trying to coerce them with fines ? 
In America , I am told , a slang word for the police is &quot; pigs . &quot; 
Are we to have pig police here ? 
Our ruling social democratic party has its stronghold in Romania &apos;s rural areas . 
If Romania &apos;s peasants come to believe that the EU insists that they hug their pigs , not butcher them with knives , their fidelity towards the social democrats will wither . 
Those lost votes , however , won &apos;t go to responsible center-right parties , but to the fiercely nationalistic , anti-European , Greater Romania Party , perhaps the closest thing Europe now has to a fascist party . 
This is a nightmare that both European and mainstream Romanian politicians want to avoid . 
Fortunately , there seems to be a way to conciliate both EU bureaucrats and even our most diehard peasants . 
Our ugly pre-Christmas ritual butchery can be christened a &quot; traditional , folk custom , &quot; a sacred rite deeply embedded in the fabric of Romanian nationhood . 
The proximity of Christmas will provide the ritual with a religious patina . 
Because national , religious , and folk traditions are supposed to be protected across the Union , our unsavory habit of slaughtering squealing pigs can be preserved even as Romania enters the EU . 
The sad fate of our porcine population will not be frowned upon as primitive and anti-European , but will be condoned as a venerable national tradition , preserved in accordance with the best European standards . 
So our Romanian pig may survive after all - at least until the next St. Ignatius &apos; Day - thanks to multi-culturalism . 
But perhaps before we Romanians are asked to establish animal rights , we should told to pay more attention to ensuring respect for our own .
