America &apos;s Employment and Growth Challenges 
NEW YORK - For many , if not most , Americans , the crisis that befell them in 2008 - leading to slow growth , rising unemployment , and high anxiety among voters - appeared to spring from nowhere . 
Certainly , the vast majority of economists , investment analysts , financial firms , and regulators failed to see the growing risk . 
While the precise timing of any crisis is impossible to predict , ample signs of rising risk , distortions , structural problems , and imbalances could be seen by anyone who took the time to interpret a decade &apos;s worth of mounting debt , low savings , surging asset prices , and excess consumption . 
The United States was on an unsustainable growth path for at least a decade - probably longer - before the crisis . 
Restoring balance and eliminating the distortions will require time , investment , and structural change , and should be the central focus of America &apos;s economic policy . 
The household sector is especially important . 
If the main problem had been confined to excess leverage and risk-taking within the financial sector , the economic shock would have been large , but the recovery quicker . 
It was the huge loss of households &quot; net worth that brought down the real economy ( with an assist from the credit squeeze on smaller businesses ) . 
Let &apos;s be clear : elevated savings and reduced consumption relative to pre-crisis levels are likely to be permanent even after households reduce leverage and restore retirement savings - a process that in the US has removed roughly $ 1 trillion from the demand side of the economy . 
To make up the difference , Americans need to compete effectively for a portion of global demand . 
Does this mean that the US is headed for a &quot; new normal , &quot; rather than a reversion to pre-crisis conditions ? 
It does . 
Put bluntly , Americans were living beyond their means for too long . 
With foreign borrowing financing a yawning trade deficit , the US economy as a whole spent more than it earned , which both caused and hid structural problems . 
So the main post-crisis challenge is not to return to the old normal , which was not sustainable , nor is it to recover from a deep balance-sheet recession , but rather to make a structural transition from the old abnormal to a new normal that is sustainable . 
This does not mean that recovery of households &quot; balance sheets can be ignored in the post-crisis period . 
The US Federal Reserve has had to carry out a difficult balancing act : with no sign of inflation on the horizon - and at least some risk of deflation - it has maintained low interest rates even as credit conditions have eased . 
Contrary to most commentary , this is not a growth strategy , but rather an attempt to limit the considerable risk of another major downturn , induced by further balance-sheet damage in the housing sector . 
True , low interest rates , together with a second round of quantitative easing , are causing considerable global distortions , as funds flow into fast-growing emerging markets , fueling inflationary pressure and asset bubbles . 
But , given the US housing market &apos;s fragility , raising interest rates could cause prices to plummet , sinking the economy again . Despite their complaints , it is not clear that emerging economies would prefer another deep US downturn to the current flood of inbound capital that that they must manage . 
As it is , deficient consumption and stubbornly high unemployment are likely to be with Americans for some time . 
But this is not how the future was sold to the public , and , until recently , financial markets were acting as if recovery was at hand and would be relatively quick . 
The proverbial dead-cat bounce - when freefall stops and inventories run out , causing output to pick up a bit - was misinterpreted as evidence of a V-shaped recovery : sharply down and sharply back up . 
Despite the impression created , particularly in the US , by media commentary and political debate , fiscal stimulus clearly helped in the crisis , though its impact is diminishing rapidly . 
Recent studies by the International Monetary Fund indicate that in most advanced countries , including the US , the growth in budget deficits was largely automatic , owing far more to declining tax revenues and rising expenditures on unemployment benefits than to stimulus spending . 
The appropriate timing of fiscal retrenchment is , in fact , difficult to decide . 
On one side is concern about another downturn and deflation . 
On the other side is the risk of excessive debt , currency instability , and - where unemployment is structural - doubts about the benefits of additional stimulus . 
Indeed , advanced countries , including the US , have dug themselves into a deep hole . 
It is not yet a hole of the type one finds in Greece , where restoring fiscal balance and reviving economic growth are probably impossible without a restructuring of public debt . 
But climbing out will be difficult and painful . 
At this stage , the best course would be to adopt a credible multi-year plan , based on reasonable but conservative growth assumptions , to reduce deficits to sustainable levels and limit the accumulation of public debt . 
With a new , more hostile Congress , and with members of a new economic team coming on board , Obama &apos;s challenge is to build a consensus around a medium- and long-term recovery strategy , with a focus on restoring growth and employment . 
The limited fiscal resources that are available should be targeted on areas that affect competitiveness in the tradable sector . 
That means forgoing some government services . 
The truth is that all the net employment growth in the US economy over the last 20 years has been in the non-tradable sector , where Americans don &apos;t have to compete . 
Leading drivers of employment growth have been government , health care , and , until the crisis , construction . 
While this is just one part of a much more complex story , it seems unlikely that these and other non-tradable sectors can sustain employment growth in the future . 
With the tradable sector neutralized and the non-tradable sectors maxed out , the economy lacks sufficiently powerful growth engines . 
That must be fixed , which requires that competitiveness become the central focus of longer-term US economic policy - the sooner , the better .
