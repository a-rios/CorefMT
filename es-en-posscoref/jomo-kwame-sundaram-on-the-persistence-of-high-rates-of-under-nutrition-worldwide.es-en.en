Finishing Off Hunger 
ROME - At least 842 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger - a nearly 1.5 % decrease from the 854 million estimated for 2010-2012 . 
Clearly , while some progress has been made , the world still has a long way to go to eradicate under-nutrition . 
As world leaders attempt to determine the best way forward , a report published jointly this year by the Food and Agriculture Organization , the International Fund for Agricultural Development , and the World Food Program , can serve as an important resource . 
&quot; The State of Food Insecurity in the World &quot; ( SOFI 2013 ) provides updated estimates of under-nutrition and progress toward achieving the hunger targets set by the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) and the World Food Summit ( WFS ) . 
Progress on the MDGs has been uneven . 
While many countries in the developing world - home to 827 million of the world &apos;s undernourished ( compared to 838 million in 2010-2012 ) - have moved toward halving , by 2015 , the share of hungry people relative to 1990 , the average rate of decline is inadequate to meet the target in the next two years . 
The more ambitious WFS target of halving the total number of hungry people worldwide is even more distant , with the number of undernourished people having fallen by only 17 % since 1990-1992 . 
As SOFI 2013 points out , progress toward eradicating hunger and undernourishment has slowed since 2000 , when food prices began to rise , following almost a half-century of decline . 
Although rapid economic growth has boosted per capita incomes in much of the developed world , income gains are not spread evenly , leaving hundreds of millions of people to face higher food prices without sufficient increases in income . 
The World Bank originally defined its &quot; dollar a day &quot; extreme-poverty threshold principally in terms of the amount of food one needed to purchase to avoid hunger . 
But subsequent adjustments - such as to $ 1.25 per day for 2005 - appear to have lost this link . 
Today &apos;s extreme-poverty line is inadequate to avoid being undernourished - in Nicaragua , for example . 
Although the share of people living in extreme poverty in 1990 was halved by 2010 , progress will have to accelerate considerably to halve the prevalence of under-nutrition by 2015 . 
Meanwhile , despite declining expatriate employment and incomes in the last half-decade , remittances have helped to fight poverty , reduce hunger , improve diets , and increase agricultural investment . 
Globally , remittances amount to nearly three times the size of official development assistance , which has been an easy target for budget cuts by rich countries in recent years . 
The SOFI 2013 report also describes the persistent and marked disparities among regions . 
East and Southeast Asia and Latin America - which have experienced particularly rapid economic growth in recent decades - have fared the best in terms of reducing hunger . 
Sub-Saharan Africa has , after a quarter-century of economic stagnation , made some progress over the last decade , but it maintains the highest rate of under-nutrition worldwide . 
Gains in South Asia and North Africa have been modest , while conditions in West Asia have actually worsened . 
Hunger and undernourishment ( which reflects only dietary energy supply ) often coexist . 
But , in most places , under-nutrition rates - as indicated by , say , the proportion of stunted children - are much higher than estimates for the prevalence of undernourishment . 
That is why nutrition-enhancing interventions in agriculture , schools , health care , water supplies , and elsewhere - especially targeting women and young children - are needed . 
Efforts to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth are also vital . 
With the protracted economic slowdown of the last half-decade spreading to even the most resilient areas of the developing world , achieving full employment is unlikely in most countries , at least in the foreseeable future . 
But much can still be done to improve workers &apos; employment prospects , and thus their ability to acquire the nourishment that they and their families need . 
In many cases , comprehensive reforms aimed at inducing sufficient agricultural investment and providing adequate social protection could facilitate major reductions in poverty and hunger . 
This includes ensuring that people have reliable access to potable water and adequate sanitation . 
With the right design , the contribution of social-protection measures to reducing malnutrition would increase substantially . 
For example , certain benefits could be conditional on prenatal and postnatal nutrition measures targeting mothers and pre-school children . 
Well-designed school meal programs have enabled children to overcome hunger - including the &quot; hidden hunger &quot; caused by micronutrient deficiencies . 
Related food-procurement policies have spurred the emergence of cooperatives of small family farmers practicing sustainable agriculture . 
Such measures - together with initiatives to enhance poor people &apos;s incomes - also help to spur rural development , stimulate markets , and promote job creation . 
A long-term political commitment to eradicating hunger and undernourishment - backed by decisive action - holds the key to improving health outcomes and supporting sustainable , inclusive economic growth worldwide . 
A good start has been made ; now it is time to finish the job .
