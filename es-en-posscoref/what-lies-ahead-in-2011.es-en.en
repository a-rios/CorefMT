What Lies Ahead in 2011 ? 
NEW YORK - The global economy ends 2010 more divided than it was at the beginning of the year . 
On one side , emerging-market countries like India , China , and the Southeast Asian economies , are experiencing robust growth . 
On the other side , Europe and the United States face stagnation - indeed , a Japanese-style malaise - and stubbornly high unemployment . 
The problem in the advanced countries is not a jobless recovery , but an anemic recovery - or worse , the possibility of a double-dip recession . 
This two-track world poses some unusual risks . 
While Asia &apos;s economic output is too small to pull up growth in the rest of the world , it may be enough to push up commodity prices . 
Meanwhile , US efforts to stimulate its economy through the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; may backfire . 
After all , in globalized financial markets , money looks for the best prospects around the world , and these prospects are in Asia , not the US . So the money won &apos;t go where it &apos;s needed , and much of it will wind up where it &apos;s not wanted - causing further increases in asset and commodity prices , especially in emerging markets . 
Given the high levels of excess capacity and unemployment in Europe and America , quantitative easing is unlikely to trigger a bout of inflation . 
It could , however , increase anxieties about future inflation , leading to higher long-term interest rates - precisely the opposite of the Fed &apos;s goal . 
This is not the only , or even the most important , downside risk facing the global economy . 
The gravest threat comes from the wave of austerity sweeping the world , as governments , particularly in Europe , confront the large deficits brought on by the Great Recession , and as anxieties about some countries &quot; ability to meet their debt payments contributes to financial-market instability . 
The outcome of premature fiscal consolidation is all but foretold : growth will slow , tax revenues will diminish , and the reduction in deficits will be disappointing . 
And , in our globally integrated world , the slowdown in Europe will exacerbate the slowdown in the US , and vice versa . 
With the US able to borrow at record-low interest rates , and with the promise of high returns on public investments after a decade of neglect , it is clear what it should do . 
A large-scale public-investment program would stimulate employment in the short term , and growth in the long term , leading in the end to a lower national debt . 
But financial markets demonstrated their shortsightedness in the years preceding the crisis , and are doing so once again , by applying pressure for spending cuts , even if that implies reducing badly needed public investments . 
Moreover , political gridlock will ensure that little is done about the other festering problems confronting the American economy : mortgage foreclosures are likely to continue unabated ( legal complications aside ) ; small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to continue to be starved of funds ; and the small and medium-sized banks that traditionally provide them with credit are likely to continue to struggle to survive . 
In Europe , meanwhile , matters are unlikely to be any better . 
Europe has finally managed to come to the rescue of Greece and Ireland . 
In the run up to the crisis , both were governed by right-wing governments marked by crony capitalism or worse , demonstrating once again that free-market economics didn &apos;t work in Europe any better than it did in the US . 
In Greece , as in the US , a new government was left to clean up the mess . 
The Irish government that encouraged reckless bank lending and the creation of a property bubble was , perhaps not surprisingly , no more adept in managing the economy after the crisis that it was before . 
Politics aside , property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rectified - especially when politically connected banks resist restructuring mortgages . 
To me , attempting to discern the economic prospects for 2011 is not a particularly interesting question : the answer is bleak , with little upside potential and a lot of downside risk . 
More importantly , how long will it take Europe and America to recover , and can Asia &apos;s seemingly export-dependent economies continue to grow if their historical markets languish ? 
My best bet is that these countries will maintain rapid growth as they shift their economic focus to their vast and untapped domestic markets . 
This will require considerable restructuring of their economies , but China and India are both dynamic , and proved their resilience in their response to the Great Recession . 
I am not so bullish on Europe and America . 
In both cases , the underlying problem is insufficient aggregate demand . 
The ultimate irony is that there are simultaneously excess capacity and vast unmet needs - and policies that could restore growth by using the former to address the latter . 
Both the US and Europe , for instance , must retrofit their economies to address the challenges of global warming . 
There are feasible policies that would work within long-term budget constraints . 
The problem is politics : in the US , the Republican Party would rather see President Barack Obama fail than the economy succeed . 
In Europe , 27 countries with different interests and perspectives are pulling in different directions , without enough solidarity to compensate . 
The bailout packages are , in this light , impressive achievements . 
In both Europe and America , the free-market ideology that allowed asset bubbles to grow unfettered - markets always know best , so government must not intervene - now ties policymakers &quot; hands in designing effective responses to the crisis . 
One might have thought that the crisis itself would undermine confidence in that ideology . 
Instead , it has resurfaced to drag governments and economies down the sinkhole of austerity . 
If politics is the problem in Europe and America , only political changes are likely to restore them to growth . 
Or else they can wait until the overhang of excess capacity diminishes , capital goods become obsolete , and the economy &apos;s internal restorative forces work their gradual magic . 
Either way , victory is not around the corner .
