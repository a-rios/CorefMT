Why Do Smart People Live Longer ? 
EDINBURGH - People with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer . 
This result has been found among people from Australia , Denmark , England and Wales , Scotland , Sweden , and the United States . 
In fact , it has been found within every population that has been studied . 
Indeed , the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well-known risk factors for illness and death , such as high blood pressure , being overweight , high blood glucose , and high cholesterol . 
Its effect is almost as important as that of smoking . 
Differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes . 
An intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wrought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time . 
Babies who have lower birth weights , for example , are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life . 
They also have , on average , slightly lower intelligence . 
But tests of whether birth weight might explain some of the link between intelligence and mortality have found no connection . 
Parents &quot; occupations are also related to their child &apos;s intelligence and later risk of illness : children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health , and to live longer . 
However , there is no convincing evidence that parental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life . 
Other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indicator of an efficient brain . 
After all , the brain is just one organ of the body , so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others . &quot; 
But this &quot; system integrity &quot; idea is somewhat vague and difficult to test . 
The best we have done to date has been to examine whether people &apos;s reaction speeds are related to intelligence and to mortality . 
They are . 
Reaction-time tests involve little thinking , and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli . 
People who react faster have , on average , higher intelligence scores and live longer . 
But we need to think of better measures of the body &apos;s integrity to test this idea more fully . 
A third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision-making . 
Every day , as we live our lives , we make decisions about our health : what , when , and how much to eat ; how much exercise to take ; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness ; and so forth . 
Therefore , the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health , and have healthier behaviors . 
As adults , they tend to have better diets , exercise more , gain less weight , have fewer hangovers , and so on . 
So far , so good . 
But we do not yet have the full story . 
There have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence , lots of subsequent data on adult health behaviors , and then a long-term follow-up for deaths . 
And only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death . 
A fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications , work in more professional jobs , have higher incomes , and live in more affluent areas . 
These variables are related to living longer , too . 
So , perhaps that &apos;s it : higher intelligence buys people into safer and more health-friendly environments . 
Certainly , in some studies , social class in adulthood seems to explain a lot of the link between intelligence and death . 
The problem is that this &quot; explanation &quot; is statistical . 
We are still not sure whether , say , education and occupation &quot; explain &quot; the effect of intelligence on health , or whether they are , in effect , merely surrogate measures of intelligence . 
Researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence-mortality link in specific types of death . 
This has been revealing . 
Lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from , for example , cardiovascular disease , accidents , suicide , and homicide . 
The evidence for cancer is less certain . 
As we have come across these specific findings , we have realized that each link might need a different explanation . 
Finally , we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences . 
There are experimental designs , using twins , that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences . 
Among the most informative exercises we can undertake in cognitive epidemiology is to obtain a large group of twins on whom there is data on early-life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died . 
We haven &apos;t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data . 
Finding one is a priority . 
The ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer . 
Once we know that , we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all .
