Europe &apos;s Misguided Search for Growth 
BRUSSELS - A few months ago , 25 of the 27 members of the European Union solemnly signed a treaty that committed them to enshrining tough deficit limits in their national constitutions . 
This so-called &quot; fiscal compact &quot; was the key condition to get Germany to agree to increase substantially the funding for the eurozone &apos;s rescue funds , and for the European Central Bank to conduct its â‚¬ 1 trillion &quot; long-term refinancing operation &quot; ( LTRO ) , which was essential to stabilizing financial markets . 
Today , however , the eurozone &apos;s attention has shifted to growth . 
This is a recurring pattern in European politics : austerity is proclaimed and defended as the pre-condition for growth , but then , when a recession bites , growth becomes the pre-condition for continued austerity . 
About 15 years ago , Europe endured a similar cycle . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , when the plans for the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) were drawn up , Germany insisted on a &quot; Stability Pact &quot; as a price for giving up the Deutschmark . 
When Europe fell into a deep recession after 1995 , attention shifted to growth , and the &quot; Stability Pact &quot; became the &quot; Stability and Growth Pact &quot; ( SGP ) when the European Council adopted a resolution on &quot; growth and employment &quot; in 1997 . 
The need for growth is as strong today as it was 15 years ago . 
In Spain , the unemployment rate then was as high as it is now , and in Italy , it was higher in 1996 than it is today . 
Politically , too , the background is the same : the &quot; G &quot; was inserted into the SGP under pressure primarily from a new French administration ( at the time headed by Jacques Chirac ) . 
Today , France has again given the political impetus for a shift to growth . 
Making growth a political priority is uncontroversial ( after all , who could be against it ? ) . 
But the real question is : what can Europe do to create growth ? 
The honest answer is : rather little . 
The key elements of a growth strategy discussed among Europe &apos;s leaders these days are actually the same as in 1996-1997 : labor-market reforms , strengthening of the internal market , more funding for the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) for lending to small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) , and more resources for infrastructure investment in poorer member states . 
The last two , in particular , attract a lot of attention because they involve more spending . 
But circumstances are also quite different today . 
The EIB &apos;s business model would have to be radically changed to make it useful to promote growth , because it lends only against government guarantees , whereas southern Europe &apos;s fiscally stressed sovereigns cannot afford further burdens . 
Moreover , contrary to a popular misconception , the EIB cannot lend directly to SMEs . 
The EIB can only provide large banks with funding to lend to local SMEs . 
But the ECB is essentially already doing this with its three-year LTRO loans . 
There is also talk about a &quot; Marshall Plan &quot; for southern Europe . 
Fifteen years ago , there was a clear need for better infrastructure there . 
But , since then , the southern countries have had a decade of rather high infrastructure investment - more than 3 % of GDP in Spain , Greece , and Portugal . 
As a result , most countries in the EU &apos;s south probably have a sufficient stock of infrastructure today . 
In fact , more infrastructure investment would actually make most sense in Germany , where infrastructure spending has been anemic ( only 1.6 % of GDP , or half the rate of Spain ) for almost a decade . 
That is why Germany &apos;s famous Autobahnen are notoriously congested nowadays . 
But one does not need European funding to finance infrastructure in Germany , where the government can raise funds at negative real cost . 
At the rates that it is paying today , the German government should be able to find many investment projects that yield a positive social rate of return . 
Given that Germany is close to full employment , more infrastructure spending there would probably suck in imports ( and attract unemployed construction workers from Spain ) , contributing to much-needed rebalancing within the eurozone . 
Unfortunately , this is unlikely to happen , because infrastructure spending runs up against popular opposition . 
Indeed , such spending is decided at the local and regional level , where grass-roots opposition to any large project is strongest ( it took more than 20 years , for example , to push through the modernization of Stuttgart &apos;s railway station ) . 
The urge to be seen to be &quot; doing something &quot; is leading Europe &apos;s policymakers to rely on the few instruments with which the EU can claim to foster growth . 
But they should recognize that today &apos;s growth crisis is different . 
The real bargain should not be austerity plus a Marshall Plan for the south , but rather continued austerity plus labor-market reforms in the south , combined with more infrastructure investment in Germany and other AAA-rated countries like the Netherlands . 
Deep service-sector reforms in Germany would also help to unlock the country &apos;s productivity potential and open its market to services exports from southern Europe . 
That way , the South would have a chance to find jobs for its rather well-educated young people , whose only choice now is between unemployment and emigration .
