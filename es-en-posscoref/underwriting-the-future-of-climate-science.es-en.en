Underwriting the Future of Climate Science 
LONDON - As the United Nations &quot; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) meets for its plenary session in Busan , South Korea , governments will have a valuable opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to climate science . 
Their charge will be to consider a recent review of the IPCC by the InterAcademy Council ( IAC ) . 
The review , commissioned in March by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the Nobel laureate Rajendra Pachauri , Chairman of the IPCC , to examine the IPCC &apos;s processes and procedures , was published at the end of August . 
Several other inquiries have been held , by institutions such as Penn State University , the British Parliament , the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency , and the United States Environmental Protection Agency . 
All had one thing in common : they all agreed with the IPCC &apos;s fundamental conclusions concerning the major impact of man-made CO2 on climate change . 
This is a crucial outcome . 
These inquiries also helped scientists learn important lessons . 
They now understand that they must open up and be more accepting of critical arguments . 
In addition , science must more effectively communicate its messages to a public that is concerned about climate change , but unclear on how the problem can be addressed . 
National governments need to be able to draw on an accurate and objective assessment of climate science in order to determine what policy decisions should be taken in this area . 
The IPCC provides a risk assessment to the world , and , perhaps even more urgently , surveys the likely impacts of climate change . 
If the IPCC did not already exist , governments would be quick to create it . 
Moreover , the four assessment reports that the IPCC has so far produced have allowed a better understanding of the threat posed by climate change in terms of extreme weather events and natural disasters . 
The IPCC now operates in a political context that did not exist at its inception 21 years ago , and it must be managed in such a way that both the reality and perception of its work provide full confidence to policymakers and the public . 
The IPCC &apos;s leadership has worked hard in the last few years to encourage reforms aimed at achieving these ends . 
However , progress has not gone as far or as fast as Pachauri and others would have liked . 
This failure to strengthen key functions at the IPCC left the organization unable to prevent and respond effectively to the minor mistakes that appeared in its last assessment report , published in 2007 . 
The IPCC has managed the remarkable feat of creating one of the most comprehensive reserves of scientific knowledge on any aspect of the physical world . 
It has achieved this with precious few resources and by relying on its many hundreds of scientists to give their time to work on the reports voluntarily . 
It is remarkable that an organization responsible for summarizing a body of evidence that acts as a cornerstone for national and global policymaking on climate change should be so under-resourced . 
The InterAcademy Council recommendations , focusing on key areas such as transparency , leadership , and communications , were intended for consideration and action at the plenary session in Busan . 
Governments must now rise to the opportunity afforded to them of authorizing the necessary improvements . 
We have a real chance to strengthen the position of the world &apos;s leading source of authoritative climate science . 
Action must be rapid and decisive to provide the direction that the IPCC requires in order to implement long-overdue changes . 
Far from being seen as a rebuke of the IPCC , the IAC report must be used by governments in Busan to strengthen and improve this crucially important organization . 
Doing so would allow the IPCC to get on with its work - and enable governments around the world to focus on the challenges of climate change and the urgency of tackling them .
