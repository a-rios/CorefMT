China &apos;s Real Reform Challenge 
LONDON - It is often assumed that emerging-economy living standards are bound to converge with those in developed countries . 
But , leaving aside some oil exporters and the city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore , only three countries - Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan - have come from far behind to achieve per capita GDP of at least 70 % of the developed-country average over the last 60 years . 
China hopes to do the same , but it faces a distinctive challenge : its sheer size . 
Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan depended on export-led growth to catch up with the developed economies . 
But China - home to almost 20 % of the world population and responsible for 15 % of global output - is simply too large to depend solely on external markets . 
To reach the next stage of development , it will need to forge a different growth path - and that will require more difficult reforms than those on which attention is often focused . 
To be sure , export-led growth has fueled China &apos;s economic rise so far , with its current-account surplus growing to 10 % of GDP in 2008 . 
But such high surpluses are ultimately impossible to sustain . 
There simply is not enough import demand in the world to absorb ever-growing Chinese exports . 
The global financial crisis exposed that reality . 
Before 2008 , China &apos;s massive surpluses were matched by unsustainable credit-fueled deficits in developed economies . 
When boom turned to bust , falling global demand hit China &apos;s export sector , and threatened to increase unemployment . 
In response , China turned to the domestic growth engine of credit-financed investment in infrastructure and real estate . 
Since 2008 , credit has surged from 125 % of GDP to more than 210 % of GDP , enabling investment to increase from 42 % of GDP to nearly 48 % last year . 
Across China , concrete was poured into apartment blocks , multilane highways , convention centers , railway stations , and airports . 
Real-estate investment now accounts for 15 % of China &apos;s GDP , compared to less than 5 % in 2000 ; when related industries like steel and cement are taken into account , that figure rises to one-third of China &apos;s GDP . 
Almost 60 million Chinese workers are employed in construction today , up from just below 20 million in 2007 . 
China &apos;s current growth path stands in stark contrast to that followed by Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan . 
When those countries &quot; per capita GDP stood at current Chinese levels , real estate played only a minor role in their economies ; indeed , the sector was often deliberately starved of credit . 
The investment boom has kept China &apos;s urban employment growing strongly . 
But a country needs only so much housing . 
True , total capital stock per capita in China still lags far behind that of developed countries . 
But a recent International Monetary Fund report reveals the startling fact that China has now surpassed Japan and South Korea in square meters of housing per capita , having reached a level near - or , in some smaller cities , well above - the European average . 
As China &apos;s construction frenzy ends , the economy is experiencing a major slowdown . 
By some estimates , China &apos;s growth stalled almost completely in the first quarter of this year . 
Even official figures indicate that several provinces outside the more dynamic coastal regions are in outright recession . 
This leaves China facing two major challenges . 
One is financial : how to deal with the unsustainable debts of many local governments and state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . 
Fortunately , the solutions here are obvious . 
Local-government debts can be shifted to the central government , or bank loans can be written off and banks recapitalized . 
The second , more profound challenge relates to the real economy : how to redeploy workers and capital from the industrial sectors facing overcapacity and the most overbuilt cities . 
This imperative is sometimes denied . 
Hundreds of millions of people , it is said , have yet to migrate to cities , where they will demand housing . 
But , given that almost half of China &apos;s rural workers are already over 50 years old , many may never migrate . 
And China &apos;s total population will begin to decline within 15 years . 
Far from being on the cusp of a wave of urbanization , China is within 10-15 years of its completion . 
Even if urbanization did continue at a high rate , many workers would not migrate to the second- and third-tier cities where overcapacity is most extreme , but to the major coastal cities . 
Though the government can use its hukou ( household registration ) system to slow that migration , even it cannot direct people to the specific cities with the most excess capacity . 
So what can be done ? 
One option would be to export construction expertise and workers . 
Indeed , this is one rationale for China &apos;s &quot; one belt , one road &quot; initiative , which aims to recreate the ancient overland and maritime Silk Roads connecting China to Europe . 
But , as with any export-based strategy , the impact of this approach would be limited by the size of potential external markets , relative to China &apos;s economy . 
No feasible level of construction exports can fully compensate for faltering domestic investment . 
Domestic consumption , supported by strong wage growth , must instead be the dominant driver of growth . 
The good news is that wages are already growing faster than GDP - a trend that is likely to continue , as demographic change restricts the supply of new labor . 
Over the next decade , the number of Chinese aged 15-30 will fall by almost 25 % . 
But major policy reforms are also needed . 
China must take action to curb overinvestment by SOEs , cutting off such firms &quot; access to subsidized credit and forcing them to pay much higher dividends to the government . 
Those revenues could then be used to improve health services and strengthen the social safety net , thereby removing the need for Chinese households to maintain high precautionary savings . 
Such reforms would challenge powerful vested interests . 
It is far easier to build consensus around efforts , say , to add the renminbi to the basket of currencies that determines the value of the IMF &apos;s reserve asset , the Special Drawing Right - a move that , while appropriate , would do little for medium-term growth . 
But , if China is to replicate the success of Japan , Korea , and Taiwan , there is no alternative to tough reform .
