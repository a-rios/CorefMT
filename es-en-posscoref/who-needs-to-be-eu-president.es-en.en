Who Needs to Be EU President ? 
Whoever steps into Europe &apos;s new top job as President of the European Council will set the mold . 
If it is someone of worldwide renown , the presidency will immediately be established as a post of global importance . 
The key point here is that Europe won &apos;t be able to upgrade the job later . 
If the presidency goes to a politician who lacks fame and charisma , its place will forever be low down in the international pecking order . 
Of the half-dozen candidates to become &quot; Europe &apos;s President , &quot; only Tony Blair needs no introduction anywhere . 
All the other names in the ring have to be accompanied by a description - the former Finnish this or Austrian that . 
Nobody knows whether the current prime ministers of the EU &apos;s 27 member countries will choose Blair . 
There is considerable lingering ill will over his role in the invasion of Iraq , and there is the inconvenient fact that he is from Euro-skeptic Britain , and that many on the left view him as a leader whose &quot; third way &quot; was a betrayal of socialism . 
But choosing a president for Europe isn &apos;t about Blair the man , or about the political records of any of the others who would like the job . 
It is about the job itself . 
Europe &apos;s problem is that it lacks a clearly identifiable leader . 
As a result , despite the EU &apos;s many successes , it still speaks with too many voices . 
This was among the problems that the EU &apos;s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix . 
It is now in the final stages of its long and difficult birth , and by the New Year should be bringing new mechanisms to bear to streamline European decision-making . 
The jewel in its crown is to be the appointment for a 30-month term of a full-time president of the European Council , which groups the heads of EU member governments , along with a foreign policy chief who will be backed by an embryonic EU diplomatic service . 
Now that more than two-thirds of Irish voters have reversed their country &apos;s earlier opposition to the Lisbon treaty - with only the Czech Republic &apos;s Europhobic president , VÃ¡clav Klaus , holding out against it - the focus is on who will fill these two jobs . 
The three Benelux countries , along with a few other smaller EU nations , are opposed to the new European president being from a large nation . 
These are specious arguments . 
The EU &apos;s external relations involve two different types of politics . 
The first is the politics of world theatre , where a political figure of global stature could do much to raise the EU &apos;s profile and ensure that it has a major say in re-ordering the post-crisis global economic rulebook . 
The second is the politics of detail , where the new foreign policy chief &apos;s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wildly different national positions . 
Europe has an international image problem that in part stems from a complex institutional structure that non-EU countries find baffling . 
It is over-represented at G-20 world summits , for instance , but the presence of four European national leaders , plus EU representatives like Barroso , weakens rather than strengthens its political weight . 
The same is true of other global bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
The result is that Europe &apos;s achievements in recent years - its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar - are not accompanied by a significantly greater global standing . 
World leaders from Barack Obama to Hu Jintao address themselves to Berlin , Paris , and London , rather than to Brussels . 
The result is that EU policy proposals that could do much to advance the economic and geopolitical interests of Europeans are not as influential as they could be . 
The text of the Lisbon treaty is studiously vague in its job description of the president &apos;s role - an approach that prevented trouble for treaty &apos;s framers , but merely postponed disagreement . 
The real argument now taking place between Europe &apos;s national governments is about the authority that the EU &apos;s president should have . 
The risk is that Europe &apos;s squabbling politicians will opt for a figurehead and miss this golden opportunity to create a global leader .
