The Right Intervention in Ukraine 
STOCKHOLM - The ongoing Greek drama may have transfixed Europe and the world , but the great crisis in Europe &apos;s east has not gone away . 
Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists , with intermittent fighting still taking place , despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement . 
The on-and-off fighting in Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region since the Minsk deal was signed in February has made one thing clear . 
If Russia is serious about seeking a solution to the conflict , it should be prepared to endorse the deployment of an international peacekeeping mission and force . 
Such a mission could begin the process of rehabilitating the region , allow those displaced by the violence to return , and facilitate the reintegration of the Donbas into Ukraine with appropriate safeguards and devolved powers . 
A useful model for this approach is at hand . 
Two decades ago , the international community was entering the final phase of efforts to secure peace in Bosnia . 
Croatian military offensives , first in early May 1995 , and a second in early August , had taken back three of four United Nations-protected sectors from separatist Serb control . 
And , much like Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Ukraine issue today , Serbia &apos;s then-president , Slobodan Milošević , insisted that the issue could be resolved only by direct talks between the Serb separatists and the Croat government in Zagreb . 
The reality , of course , was that the Serb separatists were entirely dependent on the political , military , and economic support of Milošević &quot; s Serbia . And , in the end , Milošević agreed to the deployment of a UN mission and force , which was tasked with ensuring the region &apos;s demilitarization and return to Croat sovereignty , after implementing the necessary safeguards for the Serbs living there . 
Today , the UNTAES ( United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja , and Western Sirmium ) mission is virtually forgotten - not because it failed , but because it succeeded . 
To be sure , not every issue in Eastern Slavonia was sorted out then or in the years since ; but there is no longer a conflict , and Croatia and Serbia now enjoy constructive bilateral relations . 
This could be a model for the separatist-controlled areas of Donbas if the political will is there to make such an arrangement work . 
At the moment , I strongly doubt it . 
It is worth bearing in mind that Russia has driven every step toward escalation in this conflict - including the establishment of the separatist enclaves . 
Indeed , the Kremlin appears to be waiting for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko &apos;s government to fail and the West to split on the issue and stop taking an interest in its resolution . 
At that point , perhaps , Putin will be ready to move against Ukraine to secure his own desired long-term outcome . 
But if Ukraine &apos;s government and the West remain united , the Kremlin might see that its enclaves in Donbas represent a threat mainly to Russia itself . 
After all , the grim reality is that the separatist enclaves are in economic free-fall , with their societies becoming increasingly criminalized . 
Donbas risks becoming a tar baby for which no one wants to take responsibility . 
As this becomes apparent , Russia &apos;s leaders could start to envisage a UNTAES-type solution for the region . 
Absent any other arrangement , the Kremlin will have to do just that . 
Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell &apos;s doctrine - if you break it , you own it - applies to Putin &apos;s intervention in Ukraine as much as to George W. Bush &apos;s misadventure in Iraq . 
There certainly are very difficult issues that must be sorted out before a peacekeeping mission could go into Donbas , notably the composition and formal mandate of whatever force is deployed . 
Such a mission could then ensure the real implementation of the political provisions of the Minsk II agreement . 
Genuinely free and fair local elections , with the participation of all displaced people and refugees , will never be possible without a substantial international presence . 
Today , this idea is sure to be dead on arrival . 
So was UNTAES in the early discussions on Eastern Slavonia . 
The Milošević regime then sounded exactly like the Kremlin now . 
Such an intervention might work - but only if and when both sides genuinely want a solution . 
But if both Ukraine and the West stand firm and act to block further Russian efforts at destabilization , that day might come . 
We should be ready .
