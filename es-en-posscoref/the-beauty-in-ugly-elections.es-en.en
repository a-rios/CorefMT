The Beauty in Ugly Elections 
Elections in countries that have been strangers to democracy are never pretty , as Afghanistan &apos;s recent vote demonstrated and as any election in Iraq is likely to be . 
But electoral flaws are not always the whole picture . 
Consider Kazakhstan , where five million people cast ballots in September for their parliament &apos;s lower house . 
Western media judged the election a failure . 
CNN reported it &quot; neither equitable nor free . &quot; 
The Economist snidely referred to the &quot; results &quot; in quotation marks . 
Most quoted the OSCE &apos;s finding that the elections were riddled with &quot; serious shortcomings . &quot; 
Those elections were flawed . 
We were there , and visited eight urban and rural polling places , talked with roughly a hundred voters , election officials and observers , as well as officials from six parties . 
The majority of shortcomings resulted from organizational ineptitude . 
The worst cases of outright manipulation occurred when local bureaucrats - all appointed from above - pressured voters to support President Nursultan Nazarbayev &apos;s Otan Party . 
This problem will doubtless persist until more local officials are chosen through elections . 
Many , probably most , of the other problems were managerial in nature . 
Often , voter lists were incomplete or inaccurate . 
The head of the Central Electoral Commission has now proposed that members of the local public join election officials and administrators in compiling the lists . 
Electronic voting , used at 10 % of polling stations , also caused problems . 
Even though voters could choose between electronic and paper ballots , difficulties remained , especially among older voters . 
Another problem was the bar code system designed to prevent duplicate voting . 
Some qualified voters didn &apos;t get their bar codes ; others feared that employers might use them to learn how they voted . 
Despite the new election law &apos;s assurance of equal coverage in the main media , government TV channels devoted more time to the pro-government parties . 
Protests by some parties that could not afford the high cost of TV spots and billboards mirror similar complaints in the US . 
Far more serious was the lack of transparency in the Central Electoral Commission and the political imbalances on some local commissions . 
Some of this may have been deliberate , but incompetence also played a part . 
So how bad was the election ? 
Exit polls suggest that ballot totals fairly closely reflect voter choices . 
But how to explain charges of &quot; gross violations &quot; by the Ak Zhol Party , the largest opposition group , or the decision by the Minister of Information , an Ak Zhol candidate , to resign in protest ? 
Or the 89 charges of violations filed by just one bloc ? 
The ex-minister &apos;s charge is disingenuous . 
He himself presided over many violations , a fact noted by the OSCE back in 1999 . 
He resigned only after winning election to parliament . 
Clearly , Ak Zhol used accusations of impropriety as a weapon against the government parties . 
Indeed , many opposition groups engaged in dirty tricks . 
Nevertheless , the elections represented significant progress . 
First , they were competitive . 
The official registration of ten parties , including opposition groups , surpassed any previous election , and the OSCE admitted that voters had &quot; a real choice . &quot; 
Had systematic manipulation occurred , one-third of the races would not have gone to runoffs . 
Moreover , there were real surprises . 
The Asar Party , founded and led by President Nazarbayev &apos;s daughter , was expected to claim second place , assuring her eventual succession . 
But , despite ample funding and abundant media access , Asar finished third . 
At the same time , 17 % of all candidates were women , far more than in earlier elections . 
Runoff votes will send more women than ever to Kazakhstan &apos;s parliament . 
Turnout was relatively high , at 57 % of registered , particularly given that the OSCE had intoned that &quot; public interest does not seem to be high &quot; ; other experts wrote of &quot; voter fatigue . &quot; 
Defying such sour predictions , voters clearly felt that elections matter . 
For the first time , parties could make their case in seven debates aired on national television . 
Many voters changed their choices after watching these . 
Another first was that observers from all parties monitored the polling . 
Thousands of volunteers took their role seriously , producing the complaints that the Prosecutor is now investigating . 
Another 1,029 foreign observers came from as far away as India and Thailand . 
The government knew monitors would turn up improprieties , but believes that it has nothing to hide , and much to gain , from honest criticism . 
Even the experiment with electronic voting machines was a qualified success . 
The decision to use them should have been made earlier to allow more training , but most voters experienced no problems . 
Equally important , no newspapers were closed , stories suppressed , or journalists harassed , as occurred in earlier Kazakh elections . 
Obviously , the election &apos;s flaws cannot be swept under the carpet . 
But nor is Kazakhstan seeking to do so . 
Public debate about how to improve the system has commenced . 
At the same time , the process as a whole further legitimizes elections in the eyes of people accustomed by Soviet rule to dismissing all votes as charades . 
Kazakhstan deserved the criticism it received from Western election monitors . 
But it also earned kudos that have been withheld . 
Kazakhstan &apos;s elections mark a big step forward . 
Even an ugly election can be beautiful if it advances democracy - an important lesson for countries like Afghanistan and Iraq .
