Three Cheers for Brazil 
World markets seem to be turning up their nose at Brazil right now . 
They may be as mistaken about Brazil as world football experts were earlier this summer . 
When the World Cup began , you will recall , the Brazilian team was deemed talented but flawed . 
Yet somehow Brazil again became the World Cup champion . 
The country , too , may prove equally surprising and resilient . 
Indeed , in recent years , Brazil has created a vibrant democracy with a strong economy . 
It deserves a vote of confidence from investors and political leaders alike . 
As in any vibrant democracy , differences in views exist . 
Not all Americans are enthused about President Bush &apos;s rapid conversion of trillion dollar surpluses into deficits , nor does a majority embrace his proposals to privatize America &apos;s social security system , which has done so much to eliminate poverty among America &apos;s elderly . 
On key issues within Brazil , however , a broad political consensus ( not unanimity , but no one should expect that ! ) exists , and this includes all the major contenders in Brazil &apos;s forthcoming presidential election in October . 
There is a consensus , for instance , on sound fiscal and monetary policies : no one wants to return to the hyperinflation of earlier decades . 
Brazil &apos;s monetary policy has been managed extraordinarily well by Arminio Fraga ( my former student ) , but behind him is a strong institution , with the analytic capacities of a first world Central Bank . 
The initiative that Brazil &apos;s Central Bank made to increase transparency and openness are a model for central banks throughout the world - in the developed world as well as the less developed . 
To be sure , there may be disagreements about fine-tuning the economy , but such are routine in any democracy . 
There is also a broad consensus that while markets are at the center of a successful economy , there is an important role for government . 
Brazil &apos;s government , for instance , pushed one of the most successful telecom privatizations , but also pushed for stronger competition and regulatory policies . 
Unlike America , when the country faced an electricity crisis , it didn &apos;t blithely sit by , saying let market forces ( which in the US , meant market manipulation by Enron and others ) &quot; handle &quot; the matter ; rather , the government came in with strong actions . 
As an American , I looked on in envy as Brazil managed its way through a difficult situation . 
Brazil is a country of extraordinary human and physical resources . 
It may be called an emerging market , but it has first rate financial , educational and research institutions . 
Discussions about economics in Sao Paulo are as sophisticated as in New York . 
University seminars in Rio are as lively as those in Cambridge , Mass or Cambridge U.K. 
It produces one of the finest airplanes in the world - so good that competitors in the more advanced industrial countries have tried to impose trade barriers . 
But Brazil , for all of its strengths , has one critical weakness : a high level of inequality . 
It is a weakness that ( unlike in America ) also carries a broad consensus : most agree that it needs to be addressed , and that government has the obligation to do so . 
The current government has made extraordinary strides in education . 
Ten yeas ago , 20 % of Brazil &apos;s school age children were not attending school ; now that number is down to 3 % . 
Whoever wins the election almost certainly will continue to make further investments in education . 
Similarly , landless peasants are both an economic and a social problem , and the current administration has taken on vested interests to push forward on an exciting market-based land reform , one which has received support from the World Bank . 
Whoever wins the election will in all likelihood pursue a strong land reform program . 
With the AIDS epidemic , Brazil faces challenges to its health system , and while one may agree or disagree with the particular approaches taken by the Brazilian government , this much is clear : everyone recognizes that this is a major responsibility of government . 
Moreover , whoever wins the election almost surely will reflect that broad national consensus . 
Brazil &apos;s debt to GDP ratio is moderate - better than in the US at the time Bill Clinton became president , far better than that of Japan and several European countries . 
Unlike its neighbor to the south ( prior to Argentina &apos;s crisis ) , Brazil has a flexible exchange rate system : its currency is not overvalued - if anything , it is undervalued . 
With strong exports , it should have no problem meeting its debt obligations , so long as interest rates do not soar to levels that turn a problem into a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Brazil has carved out a path that is not based on ideology or over-simplistic economics . 
It seizes opportunities while confronting and dealing with harsh realities , whether these are lack of education , landlessness , or AIDS . 
By successfully charting its own course , Brazil has created a broad domestic consensus behind a balanced , democratic , market economy . 
Brazil &apos;s victory in the World Cup may have no connection with these reforms , but the creativity of that winning team does say a great deal about the spirit of the country .
