The Bourgeois Roots of Tunisia &apos;s Revolution 
PARIS - Tunisia , one of the Arab League &apos;s 22 members , is in the throes of a severe and profound crisis , albeit possibly one with a favorable resolution . 
It is the smallest North African country , covering 163,000 square kilometers - more or less twice the size of Belgium , Netherlands , and Luxembourg - and containing a population of 10.5 million . 
It is also full of charm and moderation in terms of its climate , history , and culture . 
It once was the pillar of the cultural dynamism and influence of the Roman Republic and Empire . 
The first African region to be Christianized , it was the land of Saint Augustine and the main source for Catholic evangelism in Africa . 
Originally mainly Berber , it was conquered by the Arabs , Islamized , and became for centuries a dependency of the Sublime Porte , and therefore Turkish . 
It became a French protectorate , not a colony - as in the case of neighboring Algeria - in the nineteenth century . 
That difference helps explain the relatively greater preservation of Tunisia &apos;s social structures and local traditions . 
Upon achieving independence in 1956 , Tunisia adopted a French-style republican constitution that established a presidential system of government . 
The first president , Habib Bourguiba , was the leader of the liberation movement , which emerged victorious much more quickly - and much less violently - than its counterpart in Algeria . 
A highly Westernized leader , Bourguiba maintained the secular character of the state that he took over from France , as well as many of its economic ties with the West ( particularly France , of course ) , in a much more committed way than Algeria did after it gained independence . 
Some rare attempts over the years by Marxist groups to seize power failed . 
Unlike other African or Middle Eastern countries , Tunisia remained largely a land of free enterprise , allowing for some industrial development . 
In recent years , it has become Africa &apos;s leading exporter of industrial goods , outperforming even South Africa and Egypt . 
In 1987 , the aged Bourguiba became too debilitated to continue in office . 
His interior minister , Zine el Abidine Ben Ali , having been named Prime Minister , soon managed to certify Bourguiba as medically unfit and ousted him from the presidency . 
The new leader was already noted for having repressed the Islamic movement , a policy he intensified after becoming President . 
Non-Muslim and secular Tunisian citizens - and a large part of world opinion , notably in France - were grateful . 
They made excuses for the brutality that lay behind Ben Ali &apos;s policy , endorsing the results without observing and questioning the means by which they were achieved . 
But those means ended up leading to the almost total suppression of any freedom of expression in Tunisia : a censored press , imprisonment of journalists , political trials , and arbitrary arrests within all circles of society , not merely those with ties to the Islamic movement . 
The aim was to suppress any and all forms of democratic opposition . 
Ben Ali &apos;s regime ultimately became a pure dictatorship . 
He and his family built up empires within the local economy , cornering nearly all sectors and making a fortune for themselves . 
But the industrialization policy was maintained . 
A genuine middle class emerged , comparable to Egypt &apos;s , but unlike that in any other Arab country , with the possible exception of Morocco . 
And then , as occurred everywhere else , the global economic crisis that began in 2008 constrained growth , fueling social tensions . 
Since the press and parliament were muzzled , the only way to relieve those tensions was in the streets . 
The police shot at the crowd on several occasions , but proved too weak to intimidate the demonstrators . 
The decisive moment came when the army abstained from suppressing the protests . 
Once the army &apos;s refusal to support his regime became clear , Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia , after France refused to welcome him into exile . 
For a brief moment , there was hope for a national-unity government , in which Ben Ali &apos;s rump cabinet and the opposition would unite to prepare a presidential election . 
The only option left was a coalition comprised of old oppositions , which , given the absence of a respected institutional framework , will make a return to stability slow , difficult , and perilous . 
So Tunisia is in danger . 
Islamism could eventually emerge victorious . 
If so , Tunisia &apos;s uprising could be a game-changing event for the entire region .
