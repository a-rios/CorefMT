Rehab World 
CAMBRIDGE - Perhaps we should call 2013 the year of Winehouse economics . 
As the late English chanteuse Amy Winehouse sang : &quot; They tried to make me go to rehab , but I said &quot; No , no , no . &quot; &quot; 
In 2013 , the singers were the world &apos;s most important central banks , led by the Federal Reserve . 
In the summer , both the Fed and the People &apos;s Bank of China signaled their intention to normalize monetary policy . 
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke talked openly of &quot; tapering &quot; the Fed &apos;s policy of open-ended bond purchases , also known as quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan actually did try to rein in his country &apos;s runaway credit growth . 
It is a problem many a pop singer has encountered : After years of stimulus , rehab is just not that easy . 
True , there remain strong intellectual justifications for continued economic stimulus of one sort or another . 
In November , the man who once seemed poised to succeed Bernanke , Larry Summers , suggested that the US economy might be in the grip of &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
Other economists continue to fret that in Europe , if not in America , the benign disinflation of recent decades could yet turn into malign deflation . 
And yet there are indications that the world economy as a whole is perking up . 
The International Monetary Fund forecasts that annual global growth will accelerate from 2.9 % this year to 3.6 % in 2014 , and will be 4 % or higher for the next four years - above the average growth rates recorded in the 1980 &quot; s , 1990 &quot; s , and 2000 &quot; s . 
The mismatch between advanced-economy under-performance and resurgent growth in the rest of the world raises ( at least ) seven questions , especially for the major central banks themselves . 
Each of these institutions has some kind of national mandate . 
Yet , in our interconnected world , their decisions inevitably have global consequences . 
Question 1 : What exactly will the Fed do under its new boss , Janet Yellen ? 
She certainly sounds as if she favors ongoing medication over cold turkey . 
The tapering of QE has to happen sooner or later , but Yellen &apos;s genuine concern about the state of the US labor market suggests that she will promise lower interest rates for longer than might seem warranted by other indicators . 
The challenge will be to make this new regime of &quot; forward guidance &quot; work if other indicators suggest that recovery is underway ( just ask Mark Carney , Governor of the Bank of England ) . 
The US is on the mend in more ways than one . 
Shale gas and oil have brought an energy bonanza . 
The stock market is hitting record highs . 
And , amazingly , a deeply polarized US Congress has just struck a two-year fiscal deal that will boost spending slightly in the short run , while reducing the deficit in the long run . 
There is a strong possibility that markets will react to this and other good news by ignoring forward guidance , focusing on the tapering of QE and nudging up long-term rates . 
And one short-run consequence of this might be the kind of sharp stock-market correction that we saw in 1980 and 1987 . 
Wall Street likes to test a new Fed chairman . 
Question 2 : How will other central banks react to a changing monetary policy regime in Washington ? 
In Frankfurt , the European Central Bank knows that the eurozone periphery is not ready for higher interest rates yet , even if Spain , Ireland , and Greece are showing signs of economic life . 
Unemployment on the eurozone periphery remains appallingly high . 
Moreover , the biggest political risk in Europe is still populism - and next year &apos;s European parliamentary elections will give the likes of France &apos;s far-right leader , Marine Le Pen , a golden opportunity . 
Question 3 : Will the populists do well enough to disrupt the complex process of establishing a banking union , a prerequisite for the sustainable recovery of Europe &apos;s financial system ? 
Probably not . 
Indeed , populist success may even encourage Social Democrats and Christian Democrats to form a &quot; grand coalition &quot; in the European Parliament - which would represent another step in the European Union &apos;s quiet Germanization . 
Meanwhile , in Japan , there is even less enthusiasm for monetary rehab : the Abe government clearly expects more , not less , stimulus from the Bank of Japan . 
Without it , hopes that &quot; Abenomics &quot; will get Japan &apos;s annual inflation rate up to 2 % will surely be dashed . 
Question 4 : Will Japan be able to maintain QE while the US tapers ? 
Probably , but the extent to which it serves the cause of sustained growth and higher inflation depends on the so-called &quot; third arrow &quot; of structural reform , which has yet to hit real targets . 
The contrast with Japan &apos;s neighbor and strategic rival , China , is striking . 
There is at least some evidence that the PBOC has already resumed monetary tightening in an effort to impose a controlled credit crunch on the country &apos;s shadow banking sector . 
That brings me to the final three questions : 
Question 5 : Can China really sustain growth while simultaneously deflating a credit bubble and implementing the structural reforms announced after the Communist Party Central Committee &apos;s Third Plenum ? 
Question 6 : How will China &apos;s vast new middle class react if the answer to question 5 is &quot; No &quot; ? 
Question 7 : Will the leadership in Beijing respond to domestic discontent with more of the foreign-policy saber rattling that we have seen this year ? 
But they may prove to be the key to how well - or badly - a &quot; Rehab World &quot; turns out .
