Evil Personified 
COLLEGE STATION , TEXAS - Equating war with individual evil has become ubiquitous - if not universal - in contemporary international politics . 
Wars are fights against evil tyrants and the illegitimate governments they control . 
Such rhetoric makes wars easier to justify , easier to wage , and easier to support , especially for elected leaders who must respond directly to swings in public opinion . Such language works equally well for any society in today &apos;s media-obsessed age . 
Little wonder , then , that political leaders consistently personalize international conflicts . 
Alas , such commonplace language also makes wars harder to avoid , harder to end , and arguably more deadly . 
The rhetoric of personified evil is easily seen through American examples , but is hardly a uniquely American phenomenon . 
Chinese leaders blame Taiwanese leaders for cross-straits tensions , and blame the Dalai Lama for all that ails Tibet . 
So , too , have protestors around the world made George W. Bush resemble Hitler , and mullahs throughout the Islamic world ritualistically harangue US presidents as earthly Satans , simultaneously noting their basic affection for the American people . 
Recent American leaders , for their part , find it nearly impossible to deploy military force without first employing such rhetoric as both mantra and crutch . 
The most famous example came in 1917 . 
Woodrow Wilson , asking for a declaration of war against Germany , said , &quot; We have no quarrel with the German people . 
We have no feeling toward them but one of sympathy and friendship . 
It was not upon their impulse that their Government acted in entering this war . &quot; 
Only the Kaiser and his evil henchmen were to blame . 
In 1990 , George H.W. Bush made the same plea : &quot; We have no quarrel with the Iraqi people . &quot; 
His son said the same thing in 2003 , adding , &quot; they are the daily victims of Saddam Hussein &apos;s oppression . &quot; 
George W. Bush had earlier noted that Americans &quot; had no quarrel with the people of Afghanistan , &quot; only with Al Queda and their Taliban supporters . 
He even employed this phrase in his final State of the Union address in 2008 , saying that &quot; Our message to the people of Iran is clear : We have no quarrel with you .... Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear : Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment , so negotiations can begin . &quot; 
Every American president since Wilson has , at least once while in office , uttered the phrase &quot; have no quarrel with &quot; a foreign enemy . 
Such statements are typically made only days , sometimes hours , before the first American bombs fall . 
Bill Clinton promised on the eve of the bombing of Serbia that &quot; I cannot emphasize too strongly that the United States has no quarrel with the Serbian people . &quot; 
Barack Obama promised from the campaign trail that &quot; We have no quarrel with the Iranian people . 
They know that President Ahmadinejad is reckless , irresponsible , and inattentive to their day-to-day needs . &quot; 
Presidents employ such language for good reason . 
They know their public , a self-styled melting pot of peoples , would rather fight dictators than brothers and cousins abroad . 
Indeed , Wilson &apos;s initial formulation grew from a demographic and political quandary . 
More than one-third of Americans in 1917 could trace their heritage back to Germany and its allies . 
Wilson could not implore his people to &quot; kill the Krauts , &quot; as British or French leaders frequently did , because so many of Wilson &apos;s soldiers were , by ethnicity at least , Krauts themselves . 
He instead rhetorically transformed American soldiers from fratricidal killers into liberators of their ancient fatherland . 
Only when foreign enemies looked different from what Americans conceived themselves to be could presidents wage war against a people as a whole . 
Thus , Franklin Roosevelt could simultaneously urge Americans to keep the world from being &quot; dominated by Hitler and Mussolini , &quot; even as he told them that &quot; we are now in the midst of a war against Japan . &quot; 
The war in Europe was a war to liberate oppressed peoples from tyrants . 
The war in the Pacific was a race war . 
Such politically expedient language has a strategic downside . 
First , once you pin blame for a conflict on a single individual , a Saddam Hussein or Kim Jong Il , it is difficult to see a solution to international conflict that does not result from the tyrant &apos;s downfall . 
Imagine Bush parlaying with Saddam Hussein in 2005 or 2006 , if war had never come again to Iraq , after having called him this generation &apos;s Hitler . 
More troubling is the identification of conflict with a single human source , which obscures the more systemic and insidious nature of international conflict . 
Again , imagine if recent history had gone differently , and Saddam had in fact taken the Bush administration &apos;s eleventh-hour offer of exile rather than war . 
If Iraq indeed had weapons of mass destruction , as Bush believed , Hussein &apos;s departure would have left such weapons in the hands of ... whom exactly ? 
Equating war with a solitary tyrant thus imposes strategic limitations for policymakers . 
It also leads , paradoxically , to a greater number of civilian deaths . 
Bombs aimed at foreign dictators or their security apparatus almost invariably kill individuals far from the corridors of power . 
Their deaths are easier to stomach , and to justify , so long as airmen and soldiers , and the public watching at home , believe the violence was at least directed against evil incarnate . 
Such rhetoric clearly works . 
But it also helps make the world a more dangerous place by obscuring the real reasons for war , and by allowing peoples around the world to justify violence and conflict not as a means to an end , but rather as a holy mission of liberation , freedom , and the eradication of tyranny . 
Until political leaders reject the rhetoric of evil as a justification for war , war itself is unlikely to disappear .
