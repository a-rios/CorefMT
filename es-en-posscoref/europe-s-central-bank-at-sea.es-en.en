Europe &apos;s Central Bank at Sea 
NEWPORT BEACH - Central bank purists are confused . 
How can the European Central Bank , a Germanic institution , now be in the business of buying government bonds issued by five of its 17 members ? 
Why is this monetary authority acting like a fiscal agency ? 
Isn &apos;t the ECB supposed to be a politically independent and operationally autonomous institution committed to fighting inflation and safeguarding the currency ? 
Well , yes and no . 
And that answer speaks to the disturbing realities of modern-day central banking ( or , to be more exact , central banking in the post-bubble world of debt overhangs and sovereign-debt concerns ) . 
It also sheds light on the endgame now taking shape in a confused and unsettled eurozone . 
A sea-faring analogy simplifies some of the complexity . 
Imagine that a highly agile coast-guard vessel is called out to rescue a floundering boat . 
As the rescue is taking place , the vessel finds that it must also rescue two other , larger boats . 
It does so , but not before the captain receives assurances that a larger ship is coming to assist . 
As the crew of the now-burdened rescue vessel waits for relief , they are forced to deal with restless passengers . 
With the ocean getting rougher , the once-agile rescue vessel is now so overburdened that some officers are second-guessing the captain , who again calls for the larger ship to help . 
Unfortunately , this ship seems hostage to a confused sense of mission and a distinct lack of urgency . 
The overwhelming hope is that the larger ship will come and save the day . 
The fear is that it may not . 
And the question then becomes whether the crew of the struggling rescue vessel will decide that they can stabilize the situation only through a once-unthinkable action - throwing someone overboard to lighten the vessel and save the rest . 
In a nutshell , this is the ECB &apos;s situation today . 
The outcome is both uncertain and highly consequential - for Europe , of course , but also for a global economy that is in the midst of a synchronized slowdown and operating with a weakened anchor , owing to America &apos;s recent debt-ceiling debacle and the humiliating loss of its AAA sovereign credit rating . 
The ECB has already purchased almost a â‚¬ 100 billion of peripheral government bonds , and it is committed to buying a lot more . 
Less visibly , it has acquired many times the current volume in so-called &quot; repo operations , &quot; through which the ECB provides euros to struggling banks in a &quot; temporary and reversible &quot; exchange for the government bonds on their balance sheets . 
Clearly , back in 2009 , the ECB did not make the controversial call that Greece was insolvent , not illiquid . 
My own sense is that it was able but unwilling , owing to its fear of collateral damage for the rest of the eurozone . 
It opted for delay in the hope that the eurozone &apos;s most vulnerable members would reinforce their defenses against Greek contagion . 
In that sense , the ECB may have been too trusting . 
It believed that the peripheral economies would deliver serious fiscal austerity , notwithstanding their dreadful growth outlook and general lack of competitiveness . 
It also believed that the core countries would relieve the ECB burden of mounting bailout costs . 
But , even if the ECB has limitless patience , the rest of the world does not . 
Markets understand that the ECB cannot forever substitute for other government agencies , so they repeatedly call into question its bridging strategy . 
Without these other agencies &quot; help , the ECB &apos;s unprecedented actions will end up being a bridge to nowhere . 
Whichever way you look at it , the ECB - and with it Europe - is being forced into an endgame with three once-improbable outcomes . 
That endgame will play out in weeks and months , not quarters and years . 
The first alternative is a disorderly breakup of the eurozone . 
Only chaos-lovers wish for such an outcome , but it is possible if core governments continue to hesitate in engaging their balance sheets ; if peripheral governments abandon their fiscal-reform efforts ; and / or if societies can no longer tolerate economic stagnation , high and rising unemployment , and budget austerity . 
The second is the one preferred by political scientists and European visionaries : greater fiscal union among the 17 eurozone members , or , in blunt terms , German willingness to do for the eurozone what it did for eastern Germany - namely , write large checks for years to come . 
In return , Germany would insist on economic-governance reforms that force other eurozone members to surrender some of their national fiscal prerogatives . 
The third alternative is the one embraced by several economists . 
It involves creating a smaller and more economically coherent eurozone , which would consist of core and near-core countries within a tighter fiscal union and more credible defenses against contagion . 
In the process , 2-3 peripheral economies would take a sabbatical from the euro , underwriting immediate economic uncertainty with access to a much wider range of instruments to deal with their debt overhangs and lack of competitiveness . 
Although the endgame is close , it is impossible to predict which alternative will prevail . 
That will depend on decisions taken by politicians with low approval ratings , noisy oppositions , and inadequate coordination . 
Moreover , implementation will likely prove far from automatic , thereby testing the resolve of governments and institutions . 
My sense is that politicians will opt for a weak variant of greater fiscal union , but that , ultimately they will fail to execute it for the eurozone as we know it today . 
After some considerable volatility , a smaller and more robust currency union will emerge ; and , importantly , Europe will avoid the euro &apos;s demise and a total breakdown of the eurozone . 
No matter how you view it , the coming endgame will be neither simple , nor orderly . 
Had the ECB known this at the start of Europe &apos;s debt crisis , it might have resisted taking so many risks with its balance sheet and reputation . 
Then again , it probably could not have done otherwise - just as our once-agile rescue vessel never really had the choice of remaining safely in port .
