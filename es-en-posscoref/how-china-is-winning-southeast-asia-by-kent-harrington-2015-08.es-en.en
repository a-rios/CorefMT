How China Is Winning Southeast Asia 
WASHINGTON , DC - With preparations for Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s September visit to Washington , DC , underway , officials in both countries are predictably playing down their differences over China &apos;s outsize territorial claims , backed by the construction of military facilities on previously uninhabited islands and atolls , in the South China Sea . 
And this diplomatic de-escalation , following months of recriminations and veiled threats , suits Southeast Asian leaders just fine . 
Of course , no one in Southeast Asia is ignoring China &apos;s strategic designs . 
The region &apos;s defense spending has increased by more than 50 % in the last decade , and some $ 60 billion has been earmarked for new weapons , especially naval hardware , over the next five years . 
The white paper on military strategy that China released in May , which touted plans to expand the country &apos;s defense perimeter , intensified neighbors &quot; concerns , making even more military spending likely . 
Leaders in the region are now welcoming a stream of US military officials and defense manufacturers to see what America &apos;s Asian &quot; pivot &quot; has to offer . 
Beyond new frigates and security guarantees , however , Southeast Asian leaders have refrained from reacting too strongly to China &apos;s offshore ambitions . 
The economic facts on the ground demand prudence . 
In only two decades , China has become Southeast Asian countries &quot; leading economic partner , boosting its influence throughout the region . 
Chinese leaders &quot; constant effort to expand economic cooperation stands in stark contrast to America &apos;s approach to the region . 
Consider trade . 
Since 2000 , bilateral trade between China and the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has grown tenfold , from $ 32 billion to $ 350 billion last year , and could reach $ 500 billion in 2015 . 
As China has risen to become Southeast Asia &apos;s largest trading partner , the US has slipped to fourth place , with only $ 206 billion in total trade with ASEAN last year . 
Given Southeast Asia &apos;s growing economic importance , the implications of this trend could not be weightier . 
The ASEAN countries &quot; combined annual GDP is already $ 2.4 trillion and growing fast , owing to their rapidly expanding middle class , highly skilled workers , and increasingly upscale markets . 
If the current trend holds , China &apos;s trade with ASEAN could reach $ 1 trillion by 2020 . 
The picture for direct investment - the financial flows that support the construction of factories , offices , warehouses , mines , and farms - is equally striking . 
From 1995 to 2003 , Chinese companies invested a mere $ 631 million in ASEAN countries ; in 2013 , they invested $ 30 billion . 
Though China remains well behind Japan , Europe , and the US on this front , it certainly has the potential to catch up , as Chinese private-equity firms increasingly look abroad . 
Indeed , from agriculture to information technology , the Chinese are diversifying their stakes across the region and embedding their companies in ASEAN &apos;s advanced and frontier economies . 
China &apos;s Southeast Asian partners cannot afford to ignore these efforts . 
That is one reason why all ten ASEAN countries signed on as founding members of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , despite US opposition . 
China , which has pledged $ 100 billion in initial investment , has positioned the AIIB as a rival to the US-dominated World Bank , promising to help Asian countries meet their extensive infrastructure needs . 
Clearly , when it comes to its role in Asia , China is thinking big . 
And there is more . 
At last year &apos;s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) meeting , regional leaders agreed to begin work toward possible adoption of a Chinese-backed free-trade pact - one that is clearly meant to push back against US President Barack Obama &apos;s Trans-Pacific Partnership , which excludes China . 
Whether or not Xi realizes his free-trade ambition , there is no denying China &apos;s commitment to deepening its economic ties in Asia and beyond . 
The country has pledged some $ 60 billion to its &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; initiative , which entails the construction of a Silk Road Economic Belt running through Central Asia , and a Maritime Silk Road connecting China to Southeast Asia , the Indian Ocean , the Middle East , and eventually Europe . 
The US , meanwhile , is struggling to cobble together a domestic consensus on trade . 
To be sure , China has had its setbacks , too . 
Canceled railway and hydroelectric projects in Myanmar , and riots in Vietnam over China &apos;s move to drill for oil in disputed waters , reflect the backlash that the country &apos;s resource hunger can generate . 
At a time when partisan divisions are undermining America &apos;s economic leadership , China &apos;s growing influence in Southeast Asia should raise a question : If push comes to shove in the South China Sea , will the US find allies in its corner , or will they just be holding Uncle Sam &apos;s coat ?
