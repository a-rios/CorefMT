Perfect Losers 
LONDON - Economics , it seems , has very little to tell us about the current economic crisis . 
Indeed , no less a figure than former United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently confessed that his entire &quot; intellectual edifice &quot; had been &quot; demolished &quot; by recent events . 
Scratch around the rubble , however , and one can come up with useful fragments . 
One of them is called &quot; asymmetric information . &quot; 
This means that some people know more about some things than other people . 
Not a very startling insight , perhaps . 
But apply it to buyers and sellers . 
Suppose the seller of a product knows more about its quality than the buyer does , or vice versa . 
Interesting things happen - so interesting that the inventors of this idea received Nobel Prizes in economics . 
In 1970 , George Akerlof published a famous paper called &quot; The Market for Lemons . &quot; 
The buyer doesn &apos;t know whether what is being offered is a good car or a &quot; lemon . &quot; 
His best guess is that it is a car of average quality , for which he will pay only the average price . 
Because the owner won &apos;t be able to get a good price for a good car , he won &apos;t place good cars on the market . 
So the average quality of used cars offered for sale will go down . 
Another well-known example concerns insurance . 
This time it is the buyer who knows more than the seller , since the buyer knows his risk behavior , physical health , and so on . 
The insurer faces &quot; adverse selection , &quot; because he cannot distinguish between good and bad risks . 
He therefore sets an average premium too high for healthy contributors and too low for unhealthy ones . 
This will drive out the healthy contributors , saddling the insurer with a portfolio of bad risks - the quick road to bankruptcy . 
There are various ways to &quot; equalize &quot; the information available - for example , warranties for used cars and medical certificates for insurance . 
But , since these devices cost money , asymmetric information always leads to worse results than would otherwise occur . 
All of this is relevant to financial markets because the &quot; efficient market hypothesis &quot; - the dominant paradigm in finance - assumes that everyone has perfect information , and therefore that all prices express the real value of goods for sale . 
But any finance professional will tell you that some know more than others , and they earn more , too . 
Information is king . 
But just as in used-car and insurance markets , asymmetric information in finance leads to trouble . 
A typical &quot; adverse selection &quot; problem arises when banks can &apos;t tell the difference between a good and bad investment - a situation analogous to the insurance market . 
The borrower knows the risk is high , but tells the lender it is low . 
The lender who can &apos;t judge the risk goes for investments that promise higher yields . 
This particular model predicts that banks will over-invest in high-risk , high-yield projects , i.e. , asymmetric information lets toxic loans onto the credit market . 
Other models use principal / agent behavior to explain &quot; momentum &quot; ( herd behavior ) in financial markets . 
Although designed before the current crisis , these models seem to fit current observations rather well : banks lending to entrepreneurs who could never repay , and asset prices changing even if there were no changes in conditions . 
But a moment &apos;s thought will show why these models cannot explain today &apos;s general crisis . 
They rely on someone getting the better of someone else : the better informed gain - at least in the short-term - at the expense of the worse informed . 
In fact , they are in the nature of swindles . 
So these models cannot explain a situation in which everyone , or almost everyone , is losing - or , for that matter , winning - at the same time . 
The theorists of asymmetric information occupy a deviant branch of mainstream economics . 
They agree with the mainstream that there is perfect information available somewhere out there , including perfect knowledge about how the different parts of the economy fit together . 
They differ only in believing that not everyone possesses it . 
In Akerlof &apos;s example , the problem with selling a used car at an efficient price is not that no one knows how likely it is to break down , but rather that the seller knows perfectly well how likely it is to break down , and the buyer does not . 
And yet the true problem is that , in the real world , no one is perfectly informed . 
Those who have better information try to deceive those who have worse ; but they are deceiving themselves that they know more than they do . 
If only one person were perfectly informed , there could never be a crisis - someone would always make the right calls at the right time . But only God is perfectly informed , and He does not play the stock market . 
&quot; The outstanding fact , &quot; John Maynard Keynes wrote in his General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , &quot; is the extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to be made . &quot; 
There is no perfect knowledge &quot; out there &quot; about the correct value of assets , because there is no way we can tell what the future will be like . 
Rather than dealing with asymmetric information , we are dealing with different degrees of no information . 
Herd behavior arises , Keynes thought , not from attempts to deceive , but from the fact that , in the face of the unknown , we seek safety in numbers . 
Economics , in other words , must start from the premise of imperfect rather than perfect knowledge . 
It may then get nearer to explaining why we are where we are today .
