The American Consumer is Not Okay 
NEW HAVEN - The spin-doctors are hard at work talking up America &apos;s subpar economic recovery . 
All eyes are on households . 
Thanks to falling unemployment , rising home values , and record stock prices , an emerging consensus of forecasters , market participants , and policymakers has now concluded that the American consumer is finally back . 
Don &apos;t believe it . 
First , consider the facts : Over the 21 quarters since the beginning of 2008 , real ( inflation-adjusted ) personal consumption has risen at an average annual rate of just 0.9 % . 
That is by far the most protracted period of weakness in real US consumer demand since the end of World War II - and a massive slowdown from the pre-crisis pace of 3.6 % annual real consumption growth from 1996 to 2007 . 
With household consumption accounting for about 70 % of the US economy , that 2.7-percentage-point gap between pre-crisis and post-crisis trends has been enough to knock 1.9 percentage points off the post-crisis trend in real GDP growth . 
Look no further for the cause of unacceptably high US unemployment . 
To appreciate fully the unique character of this consumer-demand shortfall , trends over the past 21 quarters need to be broken down into two distinct sub-periods . 
First , there was a 2.2 % annualized decline from the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009 . 
This was crisis-driven carnage , highlighted by a 4.5 % annualized collapse in the final two quarters of 2008 . 
Second , this six-quarter plunge was followed , from mid-2009 through early 2013 , by 15 quarters of annualized consumption growth averaging just 2 % - an upturn that pales in comparison with what would have been expected based on past consumer-spending cycles . 
That key point appears all but lost on the consumer-recovery crowd . 
In recent speeches and discussions with current and former central bankers , I have been criticized for focusing too much on the 0.9 % trend of the past 21 quarters and paying too little attention to the 2 % recovery phase of the post-crisis period . 
At least it &apos;s a recovery , they claim , and a sign of healing that can be attributed mainly to the heroic , unconventional efforts of the US Federal Reserve . 
This brings us to the second part of the argument against optimism : analytics . 
One of the first concepts to which an economics student is exposed in a basic macro course is &quot; pent-up &quot; consumer demand . 
Discretionary consumption is typically deferred during recessions , especially for long-lasting durable goods such as motor vehicles , furniture , and appliances . 
Once the recession ends and recovery begins , a &quot; stock-adjustment &quot; response takes hold , as households compensate for foregone replacement and update their aging durable goods . 
Over most of the postwar period , this post-recession release of pent-up consumer demand has been a powerful source of support for economic recovery . 
In the eight recoveries since the early 1950 &quot; s ( excluding the brief pop following the credit-controls-induced slump in the 1980 &quot; s ) , the stock-adjustment response lifted real consumption growth by 6.1 % , on average , for five quarters following business-cycle downturns ; spurts of 7-8 % growth were not uncommon for a quarter or two . 
By contrast , the release of pent-up demand in the current cycle amounted to just 3 % annualized growth in the five quarters from early 2010 to early 2011 . 
Moreover , the strongest quarterly gain was a 4.1 % increase in the fourth quarter of 2010 . 
This is a stunning result . 
The worst consumer recession in modern history , featuring a record collapse in durable-goods expenditures in 2008-2009 , should have triggered an outsize surge of pent-up demand . 
Yet it did anything but that . 
Instead , the release of pent-up consumer demand was literally half that of previous business cycles . 
The third point is more diagnostic : The shockingly anemic pattern of post-crisis US consumer demand has resulted from a deep Japan-like balance-sheet recession . 
With the benefit of hindsight , we now know that the 12-year pre-crisis US consumer-spending binge was built on a precarious foundation of asset and credit bubbles . 
When those bubbles burst , consumers were left with a massive overhang of excess debt and subpar saving . 
The post-bubble aversion to spending , and the related focus on balance-sheet repair , reflects what Nomura Research Institute economist Richard Koo has called a powerful &quot; debt rejection &quot; syndrome . 
While Koo applied this framework to Japanese firms in Japan &apos;s first lost decade of the 1990 &quot; s , it rings true for America &apos;s crisis-battered consumers , who are still struggling with the lingering pressures of excessive debt loads , underwater mortgages , and woefully inadequate personal saving . 
Through its unconventional monetary easing , the Fed is attempting to create a shortcut around the imperative of household sector balance-sheet repair . 
This is where the wealth effects of now-rebounding housing prices and a surging stock market come into play . 
But are these newfound wealth effects really all that they are made out to be ? 
Yes , the stock market is now at an all-time high - but only in current dollars . 
In real terms , the S P 500 is still 20 % below its January 2000 peak . 
Similarly , while the Case-Shiller index of US home prices is now up 10.2 % over the year ending March 2013 , it remains 28 % below its 2006 peak . 
Wealth creation matters , but not until it recoups the wealth destruction that preceded it . 
Sadly , most American households are still far from recovery on the asset side of their balance sheets . 
Moreover , though the US unemployment rate has fallen , this largely reflects an alarming decline in labor-force participation , with more than 6.5 million Americans since 2006 having given up looking for work . 
At the same time , while consumer confidence is on the mend , it remains well below pre-crisis readings . 
In short , the American consumer &apos;s nightmare is far from over . 
Spin and frothy markets aside , the healing has only just begun .
