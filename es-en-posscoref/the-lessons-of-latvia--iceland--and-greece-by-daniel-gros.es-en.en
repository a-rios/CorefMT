Austerity in Small Places 
BRUSSELS - Interest in small countries &quot; economic policies is usually confined to a small number of specialists . 
But there are times when small countries &quot; experiences are interpreted around the world as proof that a certain policy approach works best . 
Nowadays , Greece , the Baltic states , and Iceland are often invoked to argue for or against austerity . 
For example , the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman argues that the fact that Latvian GDP is still more than 10 % below its pre-crisis peak shows that the &quot; austerity-cum-wage depression &quot; approach does not work , and that Iceland , which was not subject to externally imposed austerity and devalued its currency , seems to be much better off . 
Others , however , have noted that Estonia pursued strict austerity in the wake of the crisis , avoided a financial crisis , and is now growing again vigorously , whereas Greece , which delayed its fiscal adjustment for too long , experienced a deep crisis and remains mired in recession . 
Both sides in these disputes usually omit to mention the key idiosyncratic characteristics and specific starting conditions that can make direct comparisons meaningless . 
For starters , Latvia , like the other Baltic states , was running an enormous current-account deficit when the crisis started . 
This implies that the pre-crisis level of GDP simply was not sustainable , as it required capital inflows in excess of 20 % of GDP to finance outsize consumption and construction booms . 
Thus , when the inflows stopped at the onset of the financial crisis , it became inevitable that GDP would contract by double-digit percentages . 
Seen in this light , it is not at all surprising that Latvia &apos;s GDP is now still more than 10 % below its pre-crisis peak ; after all , no country can run a current-account deficit of 25 % of GDP forever . 
Any comparison of the Baltics with the Great Depression ( or the United States today ) is thus meaningless . 
The Baltics simply had to adjust to a sudden stop in external financing . 
That was not the problem of the US during the 1930 &quot; s ; nor is it America &apos;s problem today . 
A better way to judge post-crisis performance is to look at the output gap - that is , actual GDP relative to potential GDP . 
According to a European Commission estimate , Latvian GDP was almost 14 % above potential at the peak of the boom , then fell to 10 % below potential when the boom went bust . 
The recovery , however , was equally rapid , with GDP now back to potential ( albeit below the unsustainable peak of the boom ) . 
Latvia &apos;s government increased taxes during the bust to keep revenues roughly constant as a share of GDP , but a sizeable fiscal deficit emerged nonetheless as social-security expenditure , such as unemployment benefits , soared while demand and output collapsed . 
With a V-shaped recovery , however , this expenditure fell again , reducing the deficit rapidly . 
The recovery could only be partial , because the previous level of output was unsustainable , but it was enough to allow the government to balance its books again . 
Thus , Latvia today enjoys a sustainable fiscal position , with output close to its potential and growing . 
Austerity might have worsened the slump temporarily , but it did deliver fiscal sustainability without permanent damage to the economy . 
By contrast , output in Greece , which was slow to adopt austerity , is still 12 % below its estimated potential and continues to fall . 
Does Iceland constitute a counter-example to Latvia ? 
After all , its GDP fell much less , although it ran similarly large current-account deficits before the crisis - and ran much larger fiscal deficits for longer . 
In contrast to Latvia , Iceland let its currency , the krona , devalue massively . 
But , the devaluation was much less important than is widely assumed . 
While exports did indeed perform very well , Iceland &apos;s main exports are natural resources ( fish and aluminum ) , demand for which held up well during the post-2008 global crisis . 
That sustained demand provided an important stabilizer for the domestic economy , which the Baltic states did not have . 
Indeed , Latvia was particularly hard hit by the slump in global trade in 2008-2009 , given its dependence on exports . 
Iceland &apos;s superior economic performance should thus not be attributed to the devaluation of the krona , but rather to global warming , which pushed the herring farther North , into Icelandic waters . 
Nor is Iceland a poster child for the claim that avoiding austerity works . 
In small , open economies , higher deficits are unlikely to sustain domestic output , because most additional expenditure goes toward imports . 
So it is not surprising that , despite its large devaluation , Iceland continues to run a high current-account deficit , adding to its already-large foreign debt . 
Moreover , Iceland &apos;s public debt / GDP ratio now stands at 100 % , compared to only 42 % in Latvia . 
Part of the difference , of course , reflects different starting conditions and the cost of bank rescues . 
But there can be no doubt that , by keeping deficits under control , Latvia &apos;s public finances are in much better shape today , with debt sustainability no longer a problem . 
By contrast , Iceland &apos;s debt has become so large that it is likely to constrain future growth . 
One must be careful when attempting to draw lessons from the experience of small countries that sometimes have very particular characteristics . 
The one conclusion that appears to hold generally is that shunning austerity does not allow one to avoid the problem of achieving both fiscal and external sustainability .
