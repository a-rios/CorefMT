Getting Governance Right 
CAMBRIDGE - Economists used to tell governments to fix their policies . 
Now they tell them to fix their institutions . 
Their new reform agenda covers a long list of objectives , including reducing corruption , improving the rule of law , increasing the accountability and effectiveness of public institutions , and enhancing the access and voice of citizens . 
Real and sustainable change is supposedly possible only by transforming the &quot; rules of the game &quot; - the manner in which governments operate and relate to the private sector . 
Good governance is , of course , essential insofar as it provides households with greater clarity and investors with greater assurance that they can secure a return on their efforts . 
Placing emphasis on governance also has the apparent virtue of helping to shift the focus of reform toward inherently desirable objectives . Traditional recommendations like free trade , competitive exchange rates , and sound fiscal policy are worthwhile only to the extent that they achieve other desirable objectives , such as faster economic growth , lower poverty , and improved equity . 
By contrast , the intrinsic importance of the rule of law , transparency , voice , accountability , or effective government is obvious . 
We might even say that good governance is development itself . 
Unfortunately , much of the discussion surrounding governance reforms fails to make a distinction between governance-as-an-end and governance-as-a means . 
The result is muddled thinking and inappropriate strategies for reform . 
Economists and aid agencies would be more useful if they turned their attention to what one might call &quot; governance writ small . &quot; 
Poor countries suffer from a multitude of growth constraints , and effective reforms address the most binding among them . 
Poor governance may , in general , be the binding constraint in Zimbabwe and a few other countries , but it was not in China , Vietnam , or Cambodia - countries that are growing rapidly despite poor governance - and it most surely is not in Ethiopia , South Africa , El Salvador , Mexico , or Brazil . 
As a rule , broad governance reform is neither necessary nor sufficient for growth . 
It is not necessary , because what really works in practice is removing successive binding constraints , whether they are supply incentives in agriculture , infrastructure bottlenecks , or high credit costs . 
It is not sufficient , because sustaining the fruits of governance reform without accompanying growth is difficult . 
As desirable as the rule of law and similar reforms may be in the long run and for development in general , they rarely deserve priority as part of a growth strategy . 
Governance writ small focuses instead on those institutional arrangements that can best relax the constraints on growth . 
Suppose , for example , that we identify macroeconomic instability as the binding constraint in a particular economy . 
In a previous era , an economic adviser might have recommended specific fiscal and monetary policies - a reduction in fiscal expenditures or a ceiling on credit - geared at restoring macroeconomic balances . 
Today , that adviser would supplement these recommendations with others that are much more institutional in nature and fundamentally about governance . 
So he or she might advocate making the central bank independent in order to reduce political meddling , and changing the framework for managing fiscal policy - setting up fiscal rules , for example , or allowing only an up-or-down legislative vote on budget proposals . 
Macroeconomic policy is an area in which economists have done a lot of thinking about institutional prerequisites . 
The same is true in a few other areas , such as education policy and telecom regulation . 
But in other areas , such as trade , employment , or industrial policies , prevailing thinking is either na√Øve or non-existent . 
That is a pity , because economists &quot; understanding of the substantive issues , professional obsession with incentives , and attention to unanticipated consequences give them a natural advantage in designing institutional arrangements to further the objectives in question while minimizing behavioral distortions . 
Designing appropriate institutional arrangements also requires both local knowledge and creativity . 
What works in one setting is unlikely to work in another . 
While import liberalization works fine for integrating with the world economy when import-competing interests are not powerful and the currency is unlikely to become overvalued , export subsidies or special economic zones will work far better in other circumstances . 
Similarly , central bank independence may be a great idea when monetary instability is the binding constraint , but it will backfire where the real challenge is poor competitiveness . 
Unfortunately , the type of institutional reform promoted by , among others , the World Bank , IMF , and the World Trade Organization is biased toward a best-practice model , which presumes that a set of universally appropriate institutional arrangements can be determined and views convergence towards them as being inherently desirable . 
But best-practice institutions are , by definition , non-contextual and cannot take local complications into account . 
Insofar as they narrow rather than expand the menu of available institutional choices , they serve the cause of good governance badly . 
Good governance is good in and of itself . 
It can also be good for growth when it is targeted at binding constraints . 
Too much focus on broad issues , such as rule of law and accountability , runs the risk that policymakers will end up tilting at windmills while overlooking the particular governance challenges most closely linked to economic growth .
