Libya &apos;s Lord of the Flies 
LONDON - &quot; I am a glory that will not be abandoned by Libya , the Arabs , the United States , and Latin America ... revolution , revolution , let the attack begin , &quot; said the self-described King of African Kings , Dean of Arab Leaders , and Imam of all Muslims , Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi . 
The statement summarizes the Libyan regime &apos;s extremely repressive response to the popular uprising against Qaddafi &apos;s 42-year dictatorship . 
But Qaddafi &apos;s tactics have boxed him in . 
Should he be defeated , finding refuge abroad , as Tunisia &apos;s former President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali did , will be difficult . 
Although the regime &apos;s capacity to commit large-scale massacres has shrunk , Qaddafi &apos;s defeat will come at a high cost in terms of human life . 
In an extreme scenario , the regime could use chemical weapons , as Saddam Hussein did against the Kurds of Halabja in 1988 , or it could launch an intensive aerial bombardment campaign , as Syria &apos;s Hafez al-Assad &apos;s did in Hama in 1982 . 
At that point , international intervention would be more likely than ever . 
One and a half million Egyptians and many other foreign nationals , including British citizens , are in Libya and now are in an extremely vulnerable position . 
In his first speech during the crisis , Saif al-Islam al-Qaddafi , the Colonel &apos;s supposedly &quot; moderate &quot; son , alleged an international conspiracy against the regime , involving Egyptians , Tunisians , and other foreign agents . 
The response of father and son has been to incite violence against foreigners . 
Another possible scenario is a move by the army , or a significant part of it , against Qaddafi and his sons . 
The problem is that the Libyan army has not been able to act cohesively since the protests began , in contrast to the Egyptian and Tunisian armed forces . 
Senior and junior army officers have defected , often with their troops , to the regime &apos;s opponents . 
Two air-force pilots diverted to Malta , followed by a navy warship - all in defiance of Qaddafi &apos;s orders to bomb the eastern city of Benghazi . 
But , at least so far , there have been no splits reported among the Revolutionary Committees , Qaddafi &apos;s diehard loyalists , who are estimated to total around 20,000 fighters . 
The same is true of Brigade 32 , which is headed by another of Qaddafi &apos;s seven sons , Khamis al-Qaddafi . 
This brigade is in charge of protecting the Bab al-Aziziya area in Tripoli , where the Colonel lives in his ersatz Bedouin tent . 
Libyan military Intelligence , headed by Abdullah al-Sonosi , the Internal Security Forces , led by al-Tuhami Khaled , and the Jamahiriya Security Apparatus also remain intact , with no reported splits . 
True , the deep , ingrained rivalry and mistrust between Libya &apos;s military-security apparatuses is likely to give rise to splits that will be a key factor in undermining the regime . 
Tribal allegiances will play a pivotal role if Qaddafi is defeated in the coming days . 
Historical rivalries , vendettas , and weapons are widespread among Libya &apos;s tribesmen , which suggest that tribal warfare in the post-Qaddafi era is likely . 
Yet signs from Libya &apos;s East , now a &quot; Qaddafi-free &quot; zone , indicate otherwise . 
Of course , inter-tribal rivalries are strong in eastern Libya . 
Security , medical , and other committees were rapidly established , just as similar rudimentary institutions of order were created in Egypt by rebellious protesters a few weeks ago . 
Moreover , when Ahmed Qaddaf al-Dam and Said Rashwan , two leading figures in the regime , visited Egypt and attempted to recruit tribes with Libyan branches to attack the Qaddafi-free East from Egypt &apos;s western desert , they came away with nothing . 
Awlad Ali and the other tribes refused the generous bribes offered to them . 
Libyan civil society is not as developed as its Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts , which further suggests that Qaddafi &apos;s downfall could result in tribal warfare . 
Libya &apos;s people may be more politically mature and sophisticated than many observers believe . 
The international community has a fundamental legal duty towards Libya . 
The names of those who head the forces responsible for the killings that have occurred are well known . 
If generals and colonels like Abdullah al-Sonosi , Abdullah Mansour , and al-Tuhami Khaled , as well as Qaddafi and his sons , were placed on international watch lists , or if arrest warrants were issued against them , many of their subordinates would think twice before ordering their soldiers to shoot or bombard . 
The West has known about crimes against humanity and terrorist plots committed by Qaddafi &apos;s regime for decades , most notably the June 1996 Abu Selim massacre , in which more than 1,200 political prisoners were gunned down after protesting against prison conditions . 
Yet there was no international inquiry , mainly because oil interests trumped moral outrage . 
The West owes it to Libyans to protect them from another massacre . 
So far , the Obama administration and European leaders have said all the right words .
