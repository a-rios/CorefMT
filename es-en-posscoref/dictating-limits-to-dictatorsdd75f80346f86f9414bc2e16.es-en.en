Dictating Limits to Dictatorsdd75f80346f86f9414bc2e16 
Robert Mugabe is an aging tyrant who is single-handedly destroying Zimbabwe &apos;s economy and social stability . 
Like many other tyrants , he seems ready to do anything to extend his 22 years in power , including resorting to violence and rigging elections . 
His corrupt cronies and military officials who benefitted during his lawless regime stand by him - not only to preserve their own corrupt incomes , but also out of fear of the retribution that might follow their fall from power . 
Despite protests from the US and Europe , Mugabe has so far had his way despite his thuggery . 
Tyranny is of course one of the oldest political stories . 
But in an interconnected world , isn &apos;t it possible for the international community to do more to restrain tyrants in order to ensure a more stable global environment ? 
A tricky question , no doubt . 
No country is ready to cede political sovereignty to outside powers or electoral monitors . 
Yet the high costs of tyranny spill over to the rest of the world , in the forms of uncontrolled disease , refugee movements , violence , and criminality . 
The world has a stake in preventing the continued misrule of Mr. Mugabe and others like him . 
One plausible idea is regional monitoring - that a country &apos;s neighbors would help forestall such tyranny . 
This is plausible , since neighbors are the biggest direct losers when instability spills across borders . 
Yet neighbors are also the most fearful of challenging one of their own . 
So far , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) has been acquiescent in the face of Mugabe &apos;s abuses . 
If that silence continues , it will gravely undermine SADC institutions , and will cast a deep pall over the most important leader in SADC , South Africa &apos;s President Thabo Mbeki . 
Sanctions offer another approach . 
America , Europe , and other democracies should not continue to do &quot; business as usual &quot; with Zimbabwe . 
Mugabe and his henchmen have stashed millions of dollars abroad in the past year according to plausible press accounts . 
These accounts should be frozen , despite the difficulty in doing so in a world rife with secret banking and nominee accounts that disguise true ownership . 
Mugabe &apos;s phony elections , moreover , should go unrecognized , and Mugabe denied a welcome as a legitimate head of state in international gatherings . 
Sanctions , however , are clumsy , costly , and often ineffective . 
They are insufficient to stop abuses ( after all , sanctions were threatened before the elections ) and risk pushing Zimbabwe &apos;s economy deeper into crisis , hurting millions of innocent people , especially during a period of intensifying hunger and drought . 
Sanctions are also unlikely to secure wide acclamation . 
Africans will no doubt feel that Africa is being singled out unfairly when such abuses exist throughout the world . 
An alternative approach , giving positive inducements to a tyrant to leave office , might work in some circumstances . 
Some long-time leaders have been coaxed from office through blandishments , high-profile international positions , or even amnesties and comfortable exiles in safe locations . 
A more general , perhaps more powerful approach , is for the international community to agree on general , enforceable political standards . 
One such standard , which might conceivably win international consent , would be an &quot; international term limit &quot; on heads of government . 
The world community would agree that no individual should serve as the head of government ( president , prime minister , or other equivalent position ) for more than &quot; X &quot; years . 
International agencies such as the World Bank and the IMF would automatically stop making loans to countries where the head of government exceeds that limit . 
Many countries already have such limits . 
In America , presidents are limited to two terms in office . 
In other countries , there is a single presidential term , usually of 5 to 8 years . 
The world as a whole might agree on a weaker , but globally acceptable minimum standard , say a term limit of no more than 20 years . 
Any head of government who stays in power for more than two decades would automatically lose international recognition . 
Even non-democracies such as modernized China could accept this rule , because it would apply to heads of government , not ruling parties . 
China routinely rotates the highest executive positions , as it realizes that a change of power prevents tyrants from gaining excessive power , a lesson learned painfully during Mao &apos;s long and often disastrous reign . 
Corruption is limited by the frequent alternation of power , since tyrants typically need many years to build up systems of mega-corruption , usually involving family and business associates . 
An international term limit , of course , could infringe the right of a real democracy to keep a popular leader for more than 20 years . 
Some parliamentary leaders of Western democracies have approached to this limit , such as Helmut Kohl and his 16 years in office in Germany . 
But even in strong democracies , the final years of a long rule are typically the worst . 
Kohl &apos;s last years , for example , were marked by electoral corruption . 
Given the incredible advantages that incumbents have over challengers in nearly every political system , a firm time limit would strengthen even the strongest of existing democracies . 
An international term limit would have put Zimbabwe ( and its neighbors ) on notice early on : Mugabe &apos;s continued rule after 22 years would be tantamount to international isolation . 
Mugabe &apos;s challengers would have been given the upper hand in the political conflict , and it might have been taken for granted inside Zimbabwe and the SADC that Mugabe would not and should not contest this round of elections . 
In looking at the roster of long-serving heads of government in the second half of the twentieth century - such as Stalin , Mao , Franco , Kim Il Sung , and Ceausescu - it is clear that an enforced international term limit would have spared the world considerable grief and turmoil . 
In our much more democratic and interconnected world , it is possible that a clear international norm limiting time in power could spare the world from dictatorship and destabilization in the future .
