Global Warming Without Fear 
MALMÖ - On September 26 , the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will present the summary of its most recent assessment report , the fifth in 23 years . 
Although the IPCC is not perfect - it famously predicted that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone in 2035 , when the more likely year is 2350 - its many experts generally give us the best information on the fractious issue of global warming . 
Because of extensive leaks , the report &apos;s contents are mostly known . 
And , because we have done this four times already , how the report will play out politically is also mostly known . 
But , because 20 years of efforts to address climate change have not amounted to anything serious , it might be worth exploring a different strategy this time . 
The new report &apos;s fundamental conclusion will be that global warming is real and mostly our own doing . 
Much will be said and written about the fact that the IPCC is now even more certain ( 95 % , up from 90 % in 2007 ) that humans have caused more than half of the global rise in temperature since 1950 . 
But this merely confirms what we have known for a long time - that burning fossil fuels emits CO2 , which tends to warm the planet . 
As climate scientist Andrew Dessler of Texas A &amp; M University tweeted : &quot; Summary of upcoming IPCC report : &quot; Exactly what we told you in 2007 , 2001 , 1995 , 1990 reports ... &quot; &quot; 
More specifically , the report &apos;s June draft shows &quot; similar &quot; temperature rises to the earlier reports , at about 1.0-3.7oCelsius by the end of the century . 
For sea-level rise , the IPCC now includes modeling of glacier responses of 3-20 centimeters , leading to a higher total estimate of 40-62 cm by century &apos;s end - much lower than the exaggerated and scary figure of 1-2 meters of sea-level rise that many environmental activists , and even some media outlets , bandy about . 
Similarly , the IPCC has allowed for lower temperature rises by reducing the lower end of its estimate of so-called climate sensitivity . 
It is also less certain now that humans have caused hurricane and drought events since 1950 . 
In the 2007 report , it was more than 50 % certain that they have ; now it is less than 21 % certain . 
Yet these sensible and moderate findings will be met with a predictable wall of alarmism . 
Many will mimic the blogger Joe Romm , who has declared that &quot; this ultra-conservative and instantly obsolete report ignores the latest science , &quot; and continues to claim 5º C temperature rises and six-foot ( 1.83 meters ) sea-level rises . 
Romm and many others made similar arguments following the release of the 2007 IPCC report , claiming that the latest , much more alarming , research had been left out . 
The bigger problem for the IPCC is that global temperature has risen little or not at all in the last 10-20 years . 
To be clear , this slowdown does not mean that there is no global warming - there is ; but it does call into question how much . 
To its credit , the IPCC admits that &quot; models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in the surface warming trend over the last 10-15 years . &quot; 
This matters , because if the models overshoot for recent decades , the century-long forecasts are open to doubt . 
Compared to the actual temperature rise since 1980 , the average of 32 top climate models ( the so-called CMIP5 ) overestimates it by 71-159 % ( see graph ) . 
A new Nature Climate Change study shows that the prevailing climate models produced estimates that overshot the temperature rise over the last 15 years by more than 300 % .

Global warming is real , but it has probably been exaggerated in the past , just as it is being underestimated now . 
This highlights the fact that the IPCC has always claimed only that more than half of the temperature rise is due to humans , although in public discussion it has usually been interpreted as all . 
As the IPCC emphasizes , climate change is a problem ; but the report contains none of the media &apos;s typical apocalyptic scenarios , no alarmism , and no demands from natural scientists to cut emissions by X % or to lavish subsidies on solar panels . 
All of this is almost certain to be lost in the hullabaloo from lobbyists clamoring for action and media organizations hungry for bad news . 
Indeed , though the IPCC , according to its own principles , is a policy-neutral organization , its head , Rajendra Pachauri , will explicitly feed the frenzy by insisting that &quot; humanity has pushed the world &apos;s climate system to the brink , &quot; and that we need to complete a &quot; transition away from fossil fuels , &quot; maybe with some kind of &quot; price of carbon . &quot; 
As a result , the likely outcome of the report &apos;s release will be more of the same : a welter of scary scenarios , followed by politicians promising huge carbon cuts and expensive policies that have virtually no impact on climate change . 
Maybe we should try to alter this scenario . 
We should accept that there is global warming . 
But we should also accept that current policies are costly and have little upside . 
The European Union will pay $ 250 billion for its current climate policies each and every year for 87 years . 
For almost $ 20 trillion , temperatures by the end of the century will be reduced by a negligible 0.05ºC. 
The current green-energy technologies still cost far too much and produce far too little to replace existing energy sources . 
To insist on buying these expensive non-solutions is to put the cart before the horse . 
What we need is investment in research and development to reduce green energy &apos;s cost and boost its scale . 
When solar and other green technologies can take over cheaply , we will have addressed global warming - without the angst .
