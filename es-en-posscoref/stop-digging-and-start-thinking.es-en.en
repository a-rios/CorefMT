Stop Digging And Start Thinking 
October 9 , 2006 will become a day to remember . 
North Korea probably exploded a nuclear bomb on that day . 
Was it a test that failed ? 
The future may provide answers , but the political fallout is clear and the impact substantial . 
First , international pressure , led by the US , China , Russia , and Japan was not enough to prevent North Korea from taking this fateful step . 
A terrible dictatorship , a regime without a future and a dwarf in terms of power-politics defied the international giants . 
There is now justifiable outrage , and a call for sanctions is heard everywhere . 
But what will be the effect of sanctions against a regime whose goal is survival through self-isolation - a regime that will have no qualms in ruthlessly sacrificing its people ? 
Also , can China really permit strong sanctions against its neighbor , a regime fighting for survival , one equipped with nuclear arms and missiles , and a humanitarian disaster of the highest order among its population ? 
Just how credible and effective can sanctions be ? 
Second , the Security Council now looks like a paper tiger because its authority was successfully challenged by a worn-out regime . 
This fact will be noted everywhere , particularly in Teheran . 
If the boundaries between nuclear haves and have-nots becomes more permeable , or even dissolves altogether , the entire multilateral security system could be called into question . 
On October 9 , the gate leading down this path was thrown open . 
Third , the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) regime , which was on the brink of toppling even before North Korea &apos;s actions , is threatening to disintegrate . 
A number of small and mid-sized powers will now ask themselves a radically new question : if North Korea can be a nuclear power , why not us ? 
If in these times of militarily-accomplished regime change real sovereignty can only be guaranteed by nuclear arms , why not go this route ? 
A collapse of the non-proliferation regime will increase not only the risk of regional nuclear arms races , but also of a transfer of nuclear know-how and technology , increasing the risk of nuclear confrontation . 
Fourth , the nuclear crisis triggered by North Korea demonstrates that the US - for the first time since the Cold War &apos;s end - is no longer the main player on the international scene and that its options are both limited and problematic . 
Following the hand-over from Clinton to Bush , the US gave up its strategy of engaging the North Korean regime to moderate its behavior and thus unnecessarily reduced its own options . 
China has now become the main player in the North Korean crisis , and in the region as a whole . 
This will have a serious impact across the Pacific and cause America to focus its strategic attention there . 
Europe might thus be called on to take up the slack in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East , both sooner and on a much larger scale than Europeans suspect . 
So what is to be done ? 
There is no way around a strategy of engagement and containment with regard to North Korea or the crisis will escalate . 
The US will have to enter talks - direct and bilateral if necessary . 
Indeed , it looks like that is what will be needed . 
China , humiliated by Kim Jong Il , will for the first time have to assume leadership in the region and resolve , or at least contain , the crisis . 
Looking to the future , the whole approach to nuclear non-proliferation must change . 
It is no use lamenting the real danger of nuclear proliferation , while in practice standing idle as the Non-Proliferation Treaty falls apart . 
If the world is not one day to consist of a few big nuclear powers and many mid-sized and small ones , then the big nuclear powers must now undertake a serious disarmament and non-proliferation initiative . 
Part of this initiative must be to provide , as a corollary to new disarmament requirements and control mechanisms , the assurance of non-discriminatory access to nuclear know-how , research , and technology . 
This will require an international institutional solution to the problem of enrichment , with participation in the enrichment process entailing new obligations , above all , the willingness to assure transparency through verification and intensive inspections . 
Moreover , only new strides towards disarmament by the big nuclear powers , and a guarantee of access to technology and know-how under international control , can stop the trend toward &quot; nuclear sovereignty . &quot; 
Five years after President Bush called Iraq , Iran , and North Korea an &quot; axis of evil , &quot; developments in these countries remain depressing . 
Iraq is a disaster , and nothing indicates that the situation can be turned around . 
With each day , questions about the fallout for the region become more pressing . 
Civil war ? 
Disintegration and thus the &quot; Balkanization &quot; of Iraq ? 
Will it really be possible to limit the disaster to Iraq itself ? 
Now North Korea seems to have the Bomb . 
Iran is intensively working toward the same end , while continuing to expand its hegemonic position in the region . 
If to the &quot; axis of evil , &quot; we add Afghanistan , Pakistan , Lebanon , Syria , Israel and the Palestinians , along with terrorism , the resulting picture is anything but hopeful . 
Should the US be tempted now , in response to the failure of its policy , to consider a military &quot; option &quot; against Iran , the nuclearization of the international system will not be arrested . 
Indeed , such a step will only push the Middle East into an explosive mega-conflict with unpredictable and uncontrollable consequences .
