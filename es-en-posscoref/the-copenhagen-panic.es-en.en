The Copenhagen Panic 
COPENHAGEN - A sense of panic is setting in among many campaigners for drastic cuts in global carbon emissions . 
It is becoming obvious that the highly trumpeted meeting set for Copenhagen this December will not deliver a binding international treaty that will make a significant difference to global warming . 
After lofty rhetoric and big promises , politicians are starting to play the blame game . 
Developing countries blame rich countries for the lack of progress . 
Many blame the United States , which will not have cap-and-trade legislation in place before Copenhagen . 
The United Nations Secretary General says that &quot; it may be difficult for President Obama to come with strong authority &quot; to reach agreement in Copenhagen . 
Others blame developing countries - particularly Brazil , China and India - for a reluctance to sign up to binding carbon cuts . 
Wherever you turn , somebody is being blamed for Copenhagen &apos;s apparent looming failure . 
Yet , it has been clear for a considerable time that there is a more fundamental problem : immediate promises of carbon cuts do not work . 
Seventeen years ago , industrialized nations promised with great fanfare in Rio de Janeiro to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 . 
Emissions overshot the target by 12 % . 
In Kyoto , leaders committed to a cut of 5.2 % below 1990 levels by 2010 . 
The failure to meet that target will likely be even more spectacular , with emissions overshooting by about 25 % . 
The plan was to convene world leaders in Copenhagen and renew vows to cut carbon while committing to even more ambitious targets . 
But it is obvious that even a last-minute scramble to salvage some form of agreement will fare no better in actually helping the planet . 
With such a poor track record , there is a need for soul-searching and openness to other approaches . 
A realistic &quot; Plan B &quot; does not mean plotting a second meeting after Copenhagen , as some have suggested . 
It means re-thinking our strategy . 
This year , the Copenhagen Consensus Center commissioned research from top climate economists examining feasible ways to respond to global warming . 
Their research looked at how much we could help the planet by setting different levels of carbon taxes , planting more trees , cutting methane , reducing black soot emissions , adapting to global warming , or focusing on a technological solution to climate change . 
The Center convened an expert panel of five of the world &apos;s leading economists , including three Nobel Prize winners , to consider all of the new research and identify the best - and worst - options . 
The panel found that expensive , global carbon taxes would be the worst option . 
This finding was based on a groundbreaking research paper that showed that even a highly efficient global CO2 tax aimed at fulfilling the ambitious goal of keeping temperature increases below 2oC would reduce annual world GDP by a staggering 12.9 % , or $ 40 trillion , in 2100 . 
The total cost would be 50 times that of the avoided climate damage . 
And if politicians choose less-efficient , less-coordinated cap-and-trade policies , the costs could escalate a further 10 to 100 times . 
Instead , the panel recommended focusing investment on research into climate engineering as a short-term response , and on non-carbon-based energy as a longer-term response . 
Some proposed climate-engineering technologies - in particular , marine cloud-whitening technology - could be cheap , fast , and effective . 
( Boats would spray seawater droplets into clouds above the oceans to make them reflect more sunlight back into space , reducing warming ) . 
Remarkably , the research suggests that a total of about $ 9 billion spent implementing marine cloud-whitening technology might be able to offset this entire century &apos;s global warming . 
Even if one approaches this technology with concerns - as many of us do - we should aim to identify its limitations and risks sooner rather than later . 
It appears that climate engineering could buy us some time , and it is time that we need if we are to make a sustainable and smooth shift away from reliance on fossil fuels . 
Research shows that non-fossil fuel energy sources will - based on today &apos;s availability - get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050 , and only a tiny fraction of the way towards stabilization by 2100 . 
If politicians change course and agree this December to invest significantly more in research and development , we would have a much greater chance of getting this technology to the level where it needs to be . 
And , because it would be cheaper and easier than carbon cuts , there would be a much greater chance of reaching a genuine , broad-based - and thus successful - international agreement . 
Carbon pricing could be used to finance research and development , and to send a price signal to promote the deployment of effective , affordable technology alternatives . 
Investing about $ 100 billion annually would mean that we could essentially resolve the climate-change problem by the end of this century . 
While the blame game will not solve global warming , the mounting panic could lead to a positive outcome if it means we re-consider our current approach . 
If we want real action , we need to pick smarter solutions that will cost less and do more . 
That would be a result for which every politician would be happy to accept responsibility .
