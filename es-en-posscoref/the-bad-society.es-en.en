The Bad Society 
LONDON - How much inequality is acceptable ? 
Judging by pre-recession standards , a great deal of it , especially in the United States and Britain . 
New Labour &apos;s Peter Mandelson voiced the spirit of the past 30 years when he remarked that he felt intensely &quot; relaxed &quot; about people getting &quot; filthy &quot; rich . 
Getting rich was what the &quot; new economy &quot; was all about . 
And the newly rich kept an increasing part of what they got , as taxes were slashed to encourage them to get still richer , and efforts to divide up the pie more fairly were abandoned . 
The results were predictable . 
In 1970 , the pre-tax pay of a top American CEO was about 30 times higher than that of the average worker ; today it is 263 times higher . 
In Britain , the basic pay ( without bonuses ) of a top CEO was 47 times the average worker &apos;s in 1970 ; in 2010 , it was 81 times more . 
Since the late 1970s , the post-tax income of the richest fifth has increased five times as fast as the poorest fifth in the US , and four times as fast in the UK . 
Even more important has been the growing gap between average ( mean ) and median income : that is , the proportion of the population living on half or less of the average income in the US and Britain has been growing . 
Although some countries have resisted the trend , inequality has been increasing over the last 30-40 years in the world as a whole . 
Inequality within countries has increased , and inequality between countries increased sharply after 1980 , before leveling off in the late 1990 &quot; s and finally falling back after 2000 , as catch-up growth in developing countries accelerated . 
The growth of inequality leaves ideological defenders of capitalism unfazed . 
In a competitive market system , people are said to be paid what they are worth : so top CEOs add 263 times more value to the American economy than the workers they employ . 
But the poor , it is claimed , are still better off than they would have been had the gap been artificially narrowed by trade unions or governments . The only secure way to get &quot; trickle-down &quot; wealth to trickle faster is by cutting marginal tax rates still further , or , alternatively , by improving the &quot; human capital &quot; of the poor , so that they become worth more to their employers . 
This is a method of economic reasoning that is calculated to appeal to those at the top of the income pyramid . 
After all , there is no way whatsoever to calculate the marginal products of different individuals in cooperative productive activities . 
Top pay rates are simply fixed by comparing them to other top pay rates in similar jobs . 
In the past , pay differentials were settled by reference to what seemed fair and reasonable . 
The greater the knowledge , skill , and responsibility attached to a job , the higher the acceptable and accepted reward for doing it . 
But all of this occurred within bounds that maintained some connection between the top and the bottom . 
Top business salaries were rarely more than 20 or 30 times higher than average wages , and for most people differentials were far less . 
Thus , the income of doctors and lawyers used to be about five times higher than that of manual workers , not ten times or more , as they are today . 
It is the breakdown of non-economistic , common-sense ways of valuing human activities -framing them in larger social contexts - that has led to today &apos;s spurious methods of calculating pay . 
There is a strange , though little-noticed , consequence of the failure to distinguish value from price : the only way offered to most people to boost their incomes is through economic growth . 
In poor countries , this is reasonable ; there is not enough wealth to spread round . 
But , in developed countries , concentration on economic growth is an extraordinarily inefficient way to increase general prosperity , because it means that an economy must grow by , say , 3 % to raise the earnings of the majority by , say , 1 % . 
Nor is it by any means certain that the human capital of the majority can be increased faster than that of the minority , who capture all of the educational advantages flowing from superior wealth , family conditions , and connections . 
Redistribution in these circumstances is a more secure way to achieve a broad base of consumption , which is itself a guarantee of economic stability . 
The attitude of indifference to income distribution is in fact a recipe for economic growth without end , with the rich , very rich , and super-rich drawing ever further ahead of the rest . 
This must be wrong for moral and even practical reasons . 
In moral terms , it puts the prospect of the good life perpetually beyond reach for most people . 
And , in practical terms , it is bound to destroy the social cohesion on which democracy - or , indeed , any type of peaceful , contented society - ultimately rests .
