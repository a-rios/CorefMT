South Korea &apos;s Growing Soft Power 
CAMBRIDGE - When the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met in Thailand last month , South Korea was an important presence . 
Quietly , South Korea has moved away from being defined by its problematic North Korean neighbor , and is becoming an important middle-ranking power in global affairs . 
A South Korean is Secretary-General of the United Nations ; 
Seoul will host next year &apos;s G-20 summit ; and the country has just reached a free-trade agreement with the European Union . 
This was not always so . 
If geography is destiny , South Korea was dealt a weak hand . 
Wedged into an area where three giants - China , Japan , and Russia - confront each other , Korea has had a difficult history of developing sufficient &quot; hard &quot; military power to defend itself . 
Indeed , at the beginning of the twentieth century , such efforts failed and Korea became a colony of Japan . 
After World War II , the peninsula was divided along the lines of Cold War bipolarity , and American and UN intervention was necessary to prevent South Korea &apos;s subjugation in the Korean War . 
More recently , despite its impressive hard-power resources , South Korea has found that an alliance with a distant power like the United States continues to provide a useful insurance policy for life in a difficult neighborhood . 
In a recent survey of G-20 nations published in the newspaper Chosun Ilbo , the Hansun Foundation ranked South Korea 13th in the world in terms of national power . 
South Korea ranked 9th in hard power resources but performed more poorly in terms of soft power . 
In the newspaper &apos;s words , &quot; state of the art factories , high-tech weapons , advanced information communications infrastructure are the key components that a country must have for stronger international competitiveness . &quot; 
But for these &quot; hard power &quot; ingredients to become true engines of the country &apos;s growth and prosperity , they must be backed by more sophisticated and highly efficient &quot; soft power . &quot; 
South Korea has impressive soft-power potential . 
Sometimes , Koreans compare their country of 50 million to a neighbor like China or a superpower like the US and believe that they cannot compete with such giants . 
That may be true in the domain of hard military power , but it is not true of soft-power resources . 
Many countries that are smaller than South Korea do well with soft power . 
The political clout of countries such as Canada , the Netherlands , and the Scandinavian states is greater than their military and economic weight , owing to the incorporation of attractive causes such as economic aid or peacemaking in their definitions of their national interest . 
For example , in the past two decades , Norway , a country of only five million people , has taken a lead in peace talks . 
Similarly , Canada and the Netherlands have enhanced their soft power not only by their policies in the UN , but also by overseas development assistance . 
Such legitimizing policies are readily available to South Korea . 
Moreover , in terms of attractive values , South Korea has a compelling story to tell . 
In 1960 , it had approximately the same level of economic wealth as Ghana , one of the more prosperous of the newly independent countries in Africa . 
Today , the two countries are vastly different . 
Over the next half-century , South Korea became the world &apos;s 11th largest economy , with per capita income reaching more than $ 15,000 . 
It joined the OECD and is an important member of the G-20 . 
It has become the home of world-famous brands and a leader in the adoption of the Internet and information technology . 
Even more important , South Korea also developed a democratic political system , with free elections and peaceful transfer of power between different political parties . 
Human rights are well protected , as is freedom of speech . 
South Koreans often complain about the disorderliness of their political system , and the Hansun Foundation Report rated South Korea 16th among the G-20 in the efficiency of legislative activities , and 17th in political stability and efficiency . 
According to the survey , &quot; The low standings are not surprising , given habitually violent clashes between governing and opposition parties over sensitive bills and unending bribery scandals involving politicians . &quot; 
Nevertheless , while improvement in these areas would certainly enhance South Korea &apos;s soft power , the very fact of having an open society that is able to produce and discuss such criticisms makes South Korea attractive . 
Finally , there is the attractiveness of South Korean culture . 
The traditions of Korean art , crafts , and cuisine have already spread around the world . 
Korean popular culture has also crossed borders , particularly among younger people in neighboring Asian countries , while the impressive success of the Korean diaspora in the US has further enhanced the attractiveness of the culture and country from which they came . 
Indeed , the late 1990 &quot; s saw the rise of &quot; Hallyu , &quot; or &quot; the Korean wave &quot; - the growing popularity of all things Korean , from fashion and film to music and cuisine . 
In short , South Korea has the resources to produce soft power , and its soft power is not prisoner to the geographical limitations that have constrained its hard power throughout its history . 
As a result , South Korea is beginning to design a foreign policy that will allow it to play a larger role in the international institutions and networks that will be essential to global governance .
