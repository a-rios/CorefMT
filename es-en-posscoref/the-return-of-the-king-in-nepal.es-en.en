The Return of the King in Nepal 
Every time we in Nepal think things can &apos;t get worse , they do . 
In 2001 , as our Maoist insurgency intensified and casualties soared , almost the entire royal family - including King Birendra - were massacred by one of Nepal &apos;s princes . 
The next year , parliament was dissolved and local elected bodies were disbanded . 
As political parties bickered , King Gyanendra , who succeeded his murdered brother , sacked the prime minister in 2002 and ruled through an appointed cabinet . 
Last week , King Gyanendra sacked his prime minister again , declared a state of emergency , and suspended civil liberties . 
Nepal &apos;s 15-year experiment with democracy now seems over . 
Since February 1 , the Nepali media have been subjected to absolute censorship . 
Nothing that goes against the &quot; letter and spirit &quot; of the king &apos;s dismissal of his government is allowed to be printed and broadcast , and &quot; action will be taken against anyone violating the notice . &quot; 
Armed soldiers now sit in newsrooms , vetting the galleys before they go off to press . 
Sometimes , they change headlines that they think are critical of the royal move . 
Nepal &apos;s vibrant FM radio stations - once models for decentralized public-service broadcasting and community radio - have been prohibited from broadcasting current affairs . 
Some FM stations have been locked down and are silent . 
The BBC &apos;s Nepalese service , which used to be relayed through a network of 12 FM stations all over the country , has been stopped . 
All Indian news channels have been dropped from cable networks . 
On Saturday , two senior journalists were detained for issuing statements critical of the crackdowns . 
Newspapers and magazines are blandly reproducing official pronouncements and reports from the state-run news agency . 
Some have taken the risk of resorting to metaphors and allegory , while others poke fun at the whole thing by writing editorials on ballet or bee-keeping . 
At least one newspaper came out with its news pages completely blank . 
Most young journalists , especially those in radio , have been shocked by the censorship . 
The freedoms that they were so accustomed to , and maybe even took for granted , have now been snatched away . 
But , for older journalists like me , there is a strong sense of déjà vu - the controls hark back to the times of the partyless absolute monarchy that existed here before 1990 , when self-censorship was the order of the day . 
Back then , irrational news decisions , sycophancy , and propaganda were passed off as journalism . 
In those days , editors , reporters , and columnists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities , resorting to satire , humor , or metaphor . 
But punishment could be harsh . 
Many journalists spent time behind bars , and there was a price to be paid when the morning newspapers contained even accidental typos , such as occurred when a headline concerning a royal birthday read &quot; suspicious &quot; instead of &quot; auspicious . &quot; 
Old jokes from the pre-1990 days have returned , like this one : a man was walking down a Kathmandu street , shouting , &quot; Down with dictatorship in Pakistan . &quot; 
A policeman grabbed him and took him in . At the police station , he asked the protestor , &quot; Why are you denouncing dictatorship in Pakistan when it exists here ? &quot; 
To be sure , many Nepalis have welcomed King Gyanendra &apos;s move this week . 
Much of the public is disenchanted by the instability caused by fractious and corrupt parliamentary leaders and by the Maoist insurgency , which has cost 12,000 lives in nine years . 
If this is what the king had to do to restore peace , they say , so be it . 
After all , the king has staked all and gambled his own throne by taking over power . 
They have a point . 
Many expect the king to pull a rabbit out of his hat , to restore peace and start raising the living standards of Nepal &apos;s 25 million people , most of whom live below the poverty line . 
In his speech on February 1 , King Gyanendra said the Nepali people would have to temporarily give up democracy in order to save democracy , and many Nepalese will go along with that , at least for a while . 
The king has a window of opportunity to deliver on his promises . 
Perhaps King Gyanendra does have something up his sleeves . 
In the long run , however , the answer to Maoist totalitarianism is greater and more inclusive democracy , a vibrant free press , and civil liberties . 
Curtailing freedom merely polarizes society . 
Indeed , even as a short-term strategy against the Maoists , it may well prove counterproductive .
