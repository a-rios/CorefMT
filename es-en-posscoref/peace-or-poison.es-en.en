Peace or Poison 
HAIFA - Contrary to the hopes of many , the end of the Second World War and the shock of the Nazi atrocities did not mean the end of war and genocide . 
Indeed , the decades following it have been rife with bloody conflicts in which entire population groups have been murdered . 
Remember Angola &apos;s civil war , the Khmer Rouge &apos;s massacre of millions of Cambodians , Rwanda &apos;s tribal wars , the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia , and the extermination of Christians in Southern Sudan . 
Nor should we forget the Stalinist crimes against the peoples of the former Soviet Empire . 
And yet there is something unique about the Holocaust that made the United Nations single it out and devote a special day to its commemoration . 
The difference lies not only in the mind-boggling number of victims and the ferocity with which it was perpetuated , but also in the absence of the usual motives found in other massacres and genocides . 
The Nazis did not kill the Jews because they wanted their territory - the Jews had none ; or because the Jews were followers of a rival religious faith - the Nazis and their henchmen were atheists and enemies of all religion . 
Even less did the Nazis kill Jews because of their ideological differences - Jews had no peculiarly &quot; Jewish &quot; ideology . 
Nor did the Nazis exterminate the Jews in order to take their property - most Jews were poor , and those who owned anything probably would have given it up gladly in order to save themselves . 
The Nazis looked at Jews as a strain of &quot; microbes , &quot; and it was for this reason that they wanted to destroy them so brutally and meticulously . 
The Holocaust was born of an absurd and hallucinatory mechanism that associated the Jews with an invented congenital threat , and that gave rise to a deranged , burning , irrational hatred . 
It is a hatred that did not disappear with Nazism , and that one can still , 65 years after the liberation of Auschwitz , glimpse in terrifying manifestations . 
The world must therefore be alert , so that this hatred does not reawaken and direct itself against Jews or other peoples . 
Israel &apos;s leaders , in particular , have sought to reinforce the defenses against the anti-Semitism that still persists in the world . 
That is why they have tried to obtain political support against the nuclear ambitions of Iran , which periodically threatens Israel , at times proclaiming its desire to wipe it off the face of the earth . 
Iran is not Nazi Germany . 
Its political regime , its ideology , and its military and economic potential are very different from that of Hitler &apos;s state . 
Modern Israel is also not like the weak Jewish communities dispersed throughout Europe in the past . 
Still , Iran &apos;s rulers have adopted a bizarre and total opposition to Israel &apos;s very existence , a position that can revive the same nefarious mechanism that led to the genocidal hatred of the Holocaust . 
If Iran gains nuclear weapons , it may , like Nazi Germany before it , be engulfed by murderous folly , threatening disaster for Israel . 
What can be done to prevent this ? 
The sanctions directed by the international community against Iran are not guaranteed to convince its leaders to desist from developing nuclear weapons . 
And any attempt to destroy militarily Iran &apos;s nuclear potential could entangle Israel in a prolonged and exhausting struggle that might unite all the enemies of the Jewish state . 
The bleakness of these alternatives has led many to believe that the best and most moral way of neutralizing the Iranian threat would be for Israel to sign a peace treaty with the Palestinians . 
Last month , during a public prayer in Ramallah , the Palestinian Minister of Religion , Mahmoud Habash , delivered a speech that gives hope to proponents of this solution . 
Before TV cameras and in the presence of the Palestinian Authority &apos;s senior leaders , he lambasted Iran &apos;s interference in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Essentially , what he said to the Iranians was this : &quot; Why are you entering this conflict ? 
We don &apos;t need your patronage or your support . 
Instead of helping us and the Israelis reach a solution acceptable to all - two states for two peoples - you do everything to exacerbate the conflict . 
For your own reasons that have nothing to do with our struggle , you encourage the extremism of Hamas , thus provoking Israel &apos;s violent reaction , aggravating our suffering , and pushing back the solution that we all want . 
Not one Iranian soldier has ever shed his blood for our people the way the soldiers of Egypt and Jordan did , yet their governments later signed peace agreements with Israel . &quot; 
The Palestinian leadership knows that if Iran ever launches a nuclear attack against Israel , their people would suffer terribly as well . 
On the other hand , peace between Israel and the Palestinians might neutralize the poison of Iranian hatred and break the hallucinatory political mechanism that identifies Israel with absolute evil - the &quot; small Satan &quot; that should be annihilated at all cost . 
The conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be far more effective than any military undertaking . 
A united front of Israelis and Palestinians could push the Iranian people , who until recently maintained good relations with the Jewish state , to rebel against the folly that seems to have taken hold of their leaders . 
By contrast , Israeli or American military action against Iran would risk worsening the situation , prolonging and intensifying the suffering in this very sensitive region of the world .
