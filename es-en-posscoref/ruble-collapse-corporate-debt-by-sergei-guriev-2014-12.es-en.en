Running From the Ruble 
PARIS - In recent weeks , the fall in the Russian ruble and Russian stock markets closely tracked the declines in global oil prices . 
But everything changed on December 15 . 
The oil price remained stable , but the ruble and the stock-price indices lost 30 % in the subsequent 24 hours . 
An unprecedented effort by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) in the wee hours of December 16 to stabilize the ruble , by hiking the interest rate from 10.5 % to 17 % , proved useless . 
The cause of Russia &apos;s &quot; Black Monday &quot; was readily apparent : the government bailout of state-owned Rosneft , the country &apos;s largest oil company . 
Usually , bailouts calm markets ; but this one recalled early post-Soviet experiments , when the CBR issued direct loans to enterprises - invariably fueling higher inflation . 
The CBR &apos;s governor at the time , Viktor Gerashchenko , was once dubbed the world &apos;s worst central banker . 
In 2014 , the CBR is more constrained than it was in Gerashchenko &apos;s era : it cannot lend directly to firms . 
Yet it has also become more sophisticated at achieving the same ends that Gerashchenko sought . 
In October , Rosneft issued $ 11 billion worth of ruble-denominated bonds ( an unparalleled amount for the Russian market , equivalent to 70 % of the total value of corporate bonds issued in Russia this year ) . 
The coupon on these bonds was actually 1.5 percentage points below sovereign bonds of similar maturity , which is also unusual , especially given that Rosneft currently is subject to Western sanctions . 
Then , unnamed investors ( allegedly the largest Russian state banks ) benefited from the CBR &apos;s decision on December 12 to allow these bonds to be used as collateral for three-year CBR ruble loans at the policy rate . 
Moreover , the CBR scheduled a special auction for such loans on December 15 - with the total amount of the loans similar to that of Rosneft &apos;s bond issue . 
Thus , the CBR would be able to provide a massive pile of rubles to Rosneft at below-market rates . 
So why did the deal trigger a panic ? 
At first glance , this deal was intended to meet contemporary Russia &apos;s most important economic challenge . 
Sanctions have cut off Russian banks and companies from Western financial markets . 
Some of this debt is owed to Russian companies &quot; offshore owners , who will certainly be happy to roll it over . 
But in most cases , firms &quot; liabilities comprise real debt owed to major international banks . 
The best example is Rosneft , which borrowed about $ 40 billion in 2013 to buy its competitor , TNK-BP . 
About $ 10 billion of this debt has to be repaid in the fourth quarter of 2014 , including a $ 7 billion payment on December 21 ( $ 20 billion more will have to be repaid in 2015 ) . 
Financial-market investors have been waiting patiently for the government to announce a strategy for addressing the issue of external corporate debt . 
The CBR did introduce a 12-month dollar facility for up to $ 50 billion , but this will barely last until the end of 2015 . 
Given that the price of oil is likely to remain low , Asian financiers - even the Chinese - do not seem eager to refinance Russian companies , and sanctions are unlikely to be lifted , investors clearly wanted a bigger and bolder solution . 
Rosneft had repeatedly asked for $ 40 billion from Russia &apos;s sovereign wealth fund . 
But , with that money already committed to other purposes , the government opted for a non-transparent and non-market-based solution that would have made Gerashchenko proud . 
Unfortunately , this solution poses several immediate problems . 
For starters , the risk of Rosneft defaulting - as well as the cost of providing subsidized loans - rests with the bondholders . 
If the bondholders are indeed the largest state-owned banks , the deal actually hurts the banking system : it increases the concentration of risk and implies additional losses from buying bonds with below-market interest rates . 
Second , because Rosneft must repay its external debt , it is likely to use its bailout cash to buy dollars , which can only result in further downward pressure on the ruble . 
Rosneft has denied this publicly , but the markets nonetheless seem to expect that the newly printed rubles will flood the currency markets . 
Third , the non-transparent structure of the deal undermines trust in the CBR &apos;s integrity and independence . 
The day after Black Monday , Minister of Economy Alexey Ulyukaev said that the CBR should have increased interest rates sooner . 
This immediately raised suspicion that the CBR delayed the interest-rate hike in order to complete the deal at the lower rate . 
Finally , this bailout fails to answer the question it was supposed to address . 
Investors do not know whether the Rosneft bailout is a one-off deal and , if it is not , which companies can hope to receive similar treatment from the CBR . 
Thus , they do not understand how ( and whether ) Russian corporate debt will be repaid or refinanced - or how much trust they can place in the ruble .
