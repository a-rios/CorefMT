Politics With a Human Face 
Without anyone much noticing , Russia has become the most liberal country in Europe - at least insofar as taxes are concerned . 
Today , no one here pays more than 13 % in personal income taxes . 
As a result , people pay their taxes more willingly and state revenues are increasing . 
Russia &apos;s President Putin may be few people &apos;s idea of a liberal , but his policies are undoubtedly such . 
Only for reasons that are peculiar to Russia , his is a liberalism that dare not speak its name . 
I have opposed Putin in the past , and may oppose him in the future , but credit should be given where it belongs . 
Serious judicial reform is under way . 
At long last , Russia &apos;s &quot; third branch of government &quot; is becoming less Leninist and less corrupt . 
Land sales , too , have moved beyond the talking stage , with a Land Code near to adoption . 
Labor relations are becoming more predictable , serving both employers and employees . 
Indeed , a new Labor Code was approved on its first reading in the Duma . 
Many of Putin &apos;s social policies are also quite sensible . 
Expenditures on education are to increase by almost 60 % . 
Pensions are rising . 
Of course , there is a need to update the pension system , or else many of the elderly will remain indigent . 
We also need a more effective system of social security : after all , 100 million Russians are nowadays entitled to various privileges , and far from all of them are poor . 
Reform should give everyone a chance to make a decent living , but not subsidize those who are not really eligible . 
Thus , for the most part , Putin and his ministers know what needs to be done . 
The problem they face in creating viable policies is that too many Russians want to live simultaneously under both market conditions and socialism . 
Blame our traditional and deeply ingrained belief in miracles for this . 
Think about it : Christmas is the main Catholic holiday , but we put more emphasis on the miraculous Resurrection of Christ at Easter . 
What is our favorite advertisement ? 
One in which a simple potato is turned into gold . 
It is the lack of realism and a belief in a miraculous &quot; free lunch &quot; that made Russians so susceptible to the various financial pyramid schemes run by a variety of unscrupulous individuals . 
People believed that they could &quot; just sit on the bank with a fishing pole and reel in the money . &quot; 
Many soon learned that criminals had reeled in their small savings . 
A similar belief in miracles also bedevils Russian politics and makes it very difficult for political parties to play their normal role in a democratic society . 
It is the purpose of political parties to run on political programs , and , if elected , to transform their programs into government policy . 
But Russians , because of their belief in miracles that are expected to get them what they want without effort , fall prey not only to financial speculators , but also to politicians who will play on their wishes as unscrupulously as the criminals who ran the pyramid schemes . 
How then can serious parties run on their political programs and agendas ? 
Instead of being governed by the electorate choosing between parties and policies , Russian politics are ruled by a type of pendulum effect . 
People get sick and tired of looking at the same faces in power , become disillusioned with politics , and demand change . 
The paradox is that the only party that seems to survive no matter what are the Communists . 
They retain the biggest faction in parliament and control government in 20 regions . 
Even more control is exercised at the municipal level . 
People say that liberal democrats held power during the Yeltsin years , and that this is the reason why liberal groupings , such as the Union of Right Forces of which I was the leader , could not garner mass support . 
Russia &apos;s liberals are thus blamed for the woes of the last decade , not the Communists who had created the crushing system that the liberals sought to change . 
That , of course , is nonsense . 
Viktor Chernomyrdin , an apparatchik from the gas industry , was premier for five-and-a-half years during the Yeltsin presidency . 
I have a good relationship with him , and think him a good man , but he is neither a democrat nor a liberal , and he was more concerned with not rocking the boat than with building a better future for Russians . 
Meanwhile , Yegor Gaidar , whom many still vilify as the man who took all security out of their lives , actually held power only for a brief nine months . 
People complain that in that time he managed to arouse so much hatred toward the idea of reform that he strengthened the Communists &apos; position . 
That may be true , but Russia was in a coma when his premiership began , and he brought the country back to life . 
This history lesson is important for understanding Putin &apos;s presidency . 
He has been consistent in pursuing many liberal policies , but without portraying himself as liberal . 
Instead , he satisfies the Russian people &apos;s craving for a figure of authority and order , and so enjoys colossal support . 
That support , however , is for the man , not his policies . 
History , though not the rigid construct of Marx , does follow a type of logic . 
The rebellious Yeltsin had to be followed by an even-tempered individual . 
In this light , Putin &apos;s arrival on the scene seems almost predestined . 
Some people like him , and some do not , but the stabilization he brought was overwhelmingly desired . 
Meanwhile my associates - Gaidar , Anatole Chubais , and Irina Khakamada - and I are establishing a new democratic party with an explicit platform to assure that , together with others , we provide checks and balances to President Putin . 
Although Russian voters remain more likely to judge political forces by personalities and not devote time to scrutinizing their platforms , we believe in the political education of Russia &apos;s people . 
Just as no revolution lasts forever , political ignorance and disillusion can also be overcome .
