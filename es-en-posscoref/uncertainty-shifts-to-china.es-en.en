Uncertainty Shifts to China 
Now that the dollar has dropped 43 % from its high against the euro , the process of global financial rebalancing is seriously underway . 
The United States &quot; trade and current account deficits have begun to shrink relative to American and world GDP . 
Asian current account surpluses are about to start to shrink as well , especially if growth slows markedly in America in the aftermath of the end of its housing boom . 
At the moment , Europe is feeling most of the pain , as the euro &apos;s value has risen furthest and fastest against the dollar . 
But Latin America and Asia will start to feel distress as well , as the decade-long US role as the global economy &apos;s importer of last resort comes to an end . 
As long as imbalances of world trade and capital flows unwind slowly and smoothly , the magnitude of any global economic distress should be relatively small . 
Of course , it will not seem small to exporters and their workers who lose their American markets , or to Americans who lose access to cheap capital provided by foreigners . 
But the next few years are certain to bring up a more threatening and more serious political-economic problem than the unwinding of global imbalances . 
Yes , the US might enter a small recession - the odds are roughly 50-50 of that happening . 
Yes , an American recession might spill over to the rest of the world and cause a worldwide recession . 
And yes , global economic growth over the next five years is unlikely to be as rapid as growth in the last five years . 
A formal recession , however , is not an overwhelming probability , and is likely to be small . 
The prospect of a truly hard landing - that global investors wake up one morning , suddenly recognize the US current account &apos;s cannot be sustained , dump dollars , and bring about a crash of the global economy - is becoming less likely with each passing day . 
Under two plausible scenarios - both concerning China - the unwinding of global imbalances could cause regional if not global depression . 
In the first scenario , China continues to attempt to maintain full employment in Shanghai , Guangzhou , and elsewhere not by stimulating domestic demand but by trying to boost exports further by keeping the renminbi stable against the dollar and falling in value against the euro . 
The effort to maintain the dollar-renminbi exchange rate at a level approved by China &apos;s State Council has already led to an enormous increase in the Chinese economy &apos;s financial liquidity . 
The consequences of this are now manifested in property and stock market inflation , but not yet in rampant and uncontrolled consumer price inflation - at least for now . 
But if China does not accelerate the renminbi &apos;s revaluation , the world might see a large burst of consumer inflation in China in the next two or three years . 
If so , the consequences will be a choice between the destructive runaway inflation familiar from much of post-WWII Latin America and stagflation . 
The fall-out from this scenario , however , would be largely confined to Asia . 
The second scenario is more dangerous for the entire world . 
In this scenario , once again China continues to attempt to maintain full employment by keeping the renminbi undervalued . 
But this time , the Chinese government manages to restrain domestic inflation , so America &apos;s trade deficit with Asia stops falling and starts rising again , as does Europe &apos;s , while Latin America finds itself priced out of its export markets . 
Five or six years hence , the world economy faces the danger that it faced two years ago , although the fear this time is not of a sudden crash in the dollar &apos;s value , but of a sudden crash in the value of the dollar and the euro against Asian currencies . 
Four years ago , I would have said that the principal source of international economic disorder was made in America . 
That has passed as a result of the dollar &apos;s decline and the ebbing political strength of right-wing populist factions in the US that seek ever-greater redistribution to the rich fueled by ever-increasing tax cuts and ever-rising long-term deficits . 
Today , the principal source of international economic disorder is made in China , owing to factions inside its government that hope to avoid a more-rapid appreciation of the renminbi &apos;s value . 
I cannot judge the strength of these factions , or whether they know that the falling US current account deficit and dollar may lessen the urgency of adjustment in the rest of the world , but not in China . 
Richard Nixon &apos;s treasury secretary , John Connally , once told a group of European leaders that while the dollar was America &apos;s currency , its misalignment was Europe &apos;s problem . 
Today , the misalignment of the dollar - and the euro - against the renminbi and other Asian currencies is increasingly becoming Asia &apos;s problem .
