Poland \ u0027s House Divided 
WARSAW : Voters can be merciless judges . 
Ten years after leading Poland to freedom , Lech Walesa received less than 1 % of the vote in Sunday &apos;s presidential elections , in which President Aleksander Kwasniewski romped to a second term in office . 
Like Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia , Walesa is now a prophet without honor - indeed , invisible - in his own country . 
In the years to come , both Walesa and Gorbachev may yet be recognized for the gifts of liberty they delivered . 
For now , the verdict of voters is for complacency . 
Of course , Poland &apos;s presidential elections provoked heated discussions about the state of the country . 
According to various estimates , between 35 % and 50 % of Poles are excluded from the economic benefits of Poland &apos;s new society . 
Some of these people are old and uneducated and don &apos;t realize that they are excluded . 
But my neighbor in the country , who is twenty-years-old , also has no chance : no chance to go to university ; no chance of getting a decent job ; no chance of even buying a slice of pizza in the local village . 
He , however , belongs to that half of the excluded who understand what is happening to them and who have no illusions . 
For him , all the days and years ahead look black ; for him , there is only resentment and controlled rage . 
In that balance between &quot; fear of falling &quot; and &quot; hope of rising &quot; which Alexis de Tocqueville saw as the driving force of free societies , fear of having fallen into an abyss beyond hope is carrying the day and paralyzing millions . 
Even those who claim to represent the Left avoid mentioning inequality and do not offer the excluded , like my neighbor , any reason to hope . 
Why is this happening ? 
First , ( and here I speak about all postcommunist democracies ) we accepted - almost unanimously and with little debate , for even the postcommunists accept the basic rules of the market - the neo-liberal package . 
In Poland , this is called the politics of Balcerowicz , after the architect of our reforms of the early 1990s , Leszek Balcerowicz . 
We uncritically accepted the idea that maximizing economic growth is the best medicine for society &apos;s problems . 
Supposedly , the more money we the people have , the less poverty and exclusion there will be . 
After ten years of implementing these policies , we know this is false . 
Morally neutral , free markets are heedless of the fact that those who have the most - and grabbed what they have first - keep getting more . 
Those that cannot pass the market &apos;s starting line , either because they are too poor or too uneducated , and who lack modern skills , are politically free but consigned to a kind of permanent second class citizenship . 
The shame in this is obvious . 
Those of us who have prospered are now so pleased with our new money and new toys that we explain away poverty and exclusion by saying that the excluded lack an entrepreneurial spirit . 
Poverty is a personal flaw . 
Somewhere in the recesses of our consciences we know that we should think about those left behind , but we are so happy rushing forward that we fail to look back at what is happening in our new democratic ghettoes . 
Luckily for us , the excluded and the poor tend not to revolt , precisely because they are so excluded . 
To revolt requires you to be active . 
Being able to revolt means being able to work together and fight together . 
But when you are excluded , you are permanently alone . 
We must not delude ourselves that this situation is stable . 
We must understand that exclusion is bad for our economy and national well-being because about 40 % of society cannot participate in the market economy we are building . 
This fact is known in the boardrooms of foreign companies that invest in Poland ; these foreign bosses recognize that there are nowhere near 40 million Poles able to buy their cars , TV sets and mobile phones . 
Mass exclusion also has its political side . 
Today , we do not fear primitive populism or peasant protests ; we should , however , begin to fear for the future of Polish democracy , indeed for all the postcommunist democracies . 
For in every democracy the excluded retain certain inalienable rights , including the right to vote . 
The excluded - as most sociological research shows - vote at about the same rate as other adults . 
Whom do they vote for ? 
They never vote &quot; for &quot; anyone ; they only vote against . 
Against Balcerowicz ; against the free market ; against democracy . 
As their votes today are dispersed , they pose no immediate danger . 
Eventually , their exclusion will rot our democratic culture from within . 
Ten years ago &quot; Solidarity &quot; represented an ideal &quot; political community . &quot; 
Now the idea of a political community in any form , of a demos offering all its citizens equality of opportunity , is patently ridiculous . 
We - the new democracies of Eastern Europe - are becoming more and more like those countries that provide opportunity only for the rich , leaving everyone else to fend for themselves . 
Perhaps we are slightly more civilized than those countries . 
Like the rich in Jakarta and Rio de Janeiro , isolated behind steel doors at night and with armed guards on the watch , perhaps we too should begin to fear the everyday squalor from which we avert our eyes . 
On the eve of America &apos;s civil war , Abraham Lincoln said that his country could not long endure if it remained a society half-free and half-slave . 
&quot; A House divided against itself , &quot; said Lincoln , &quot; cannot stand . &quot; 
Can our postcommunist democracies continue to stand if they remain divided against themselves , half-rich and half without hope ?
