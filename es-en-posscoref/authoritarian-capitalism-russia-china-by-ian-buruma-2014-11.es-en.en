Russia and China : The Movie 
NEW YORK - The times we live in are often most clearly reflected in the mirror of art . 
Much has been written about post-communism in Russia and China . 
Jia &apos;s movie is episodic ; four loosely linked stories about lone acts of extreme violence , mostly culled from contemporary newspaper stories . 
Leviathan is about a decent man whose life is ruined by the mayor of his town in collusion with the Russian Orthodox Church and a corrupt judiciary . 
Both films are visually stunning , despite their stories &quot; bleakness . 
The dark skies over the northern Russian coast in Leviathan look ravishing , and Jia even manages to make the concrete and glass jungle of Shenzhen , the monster city between Guangzhou and Hong Kong , look gorgeous . 
The other thing both films share is a fascination with mythical stories , the Book of Job in Leviathan , and martial-arts fiction in A Touch of Sin . 
Real estate plays a major part in both movies . 
In the first episode of A Touch of Sin , the local boss has become a private-plane-owning billionaire by stripping and selling all of his region &apos;s collective assets . 
Everything in this new China - where the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) still rules , but the ideas of Karl Marx are as dead as they are in Russia - is for sale , even the trappings of its Maoist past . 
In one scene , we see prostitutes in a nightclub titillating overseas Chinese businessmen by parading up and down in sexy People &apos;s Liberation Army uniforms . 
The story of Leviathan focuses on the house built by a simple mechanic named Nikolay . 
Nikolay is disposed of by having him framed for his wife &apos;s murder and tried by a crooked court . 
The importance of real estate in both films is no coincidence . 
Property , construction , and land are the common currencies of power in mafia societies - in China and Russia no less than in Sicily . 
One reason China has been transformed into a gigantic building site , with huge new cities emerging almost overnight , is that this drives a red-hot and highly corrupt economy , ruled by a Leninist party that has monetized political power by asset-stripping and construction . 
It is irrelevant that President Vladimir Putin &apos;s United Russia Party , unlike the CCP , makes no claim to any form of Marxist ideology . 
The way both governments operate is quite similar : party bosses , tycoons , and corrupt bureaucrats divide the spoils , while promoting chauvinism and &quot; traditional values &quot; - whether those of the Orthodox Church or Confucianism . 
Judges are bought or intimidated to ensure that bosses remain above the law . 
Putin &apos;s party was elected in Russia , as was President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s Justice and Development Party in Turkey , Prime Minister Viktor Orbán &apos;s Fidesz in Hungary , and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi &apos;s military regime in Egypt . 
The CCP was not . 
But this , too , is largely irrelevant . 
What these governments share is the fusion of capitalist enterprise and political authoritarianism . 
This political model is now seen as a serious rival to American-style liberal democracy , and perhaps it is . 
But during the Cold War , authoritarian capitalism , usually under military regimes , was anti-Communist and very much on America &apos;s side . 
South Korea &apos;s strongman , Park Chung-hee , current President Park Geun-hye &apos;s father , was in many ways a pioneer of the type of society that we now see in China and Russia . 
So was Chile &apos;s General Augusto Pinochet . 
Because the dictatorships in America &apos;s client states ended more or less when the Cold War did , and were replaced by liberal democracies , many were lulled into the comforting belief that liberal democracy and capitalism would naturally - even inevitably - come together everywhere . 
Political freedom is good for business , and vice versa . 
This great twentieth century myth has now been shattered . 
Orbán claimed earlier this year that liberal democracy was no longer a viable model . 
There are reasons to doubt this , of course . 
The Russian economy is far too dependent on oil and other natural resources , and the legitimacy of China &apos;s one-party system could collapse quickly in an economic crisis . 
The way that illiberal regimes use the law for their own ends will not inspire the confidence of investors , either - at least not in the long run . 
And yet , for now , the societies depicted so acidly in Leviathan and A Touch of Sin continue to look good in the eyes of many people who are disillusioned with Europe &apos;s economic stagnation and America &apos;s political dysfunction . 
Western businessmen , artists , architects , and others who need large amounts of money for expensive projects enjoy working with authoritarian regimes that &quot; get things done . &quot; 
Illiberal thinkers on the far right and left admire strongmen who stand up to America . 
A Touch of Sin has been shown to great acclaim all over the world , but not in China . 
Leviathan , by contrast , has been submitted as the official Russian entry for the Oscars . 
Perhaps China &apos;s rulers are less sure of themselves than Putin . 
His followers in Russia are unlikely to see , let alone be influenced by , an art film , and this sliver of Russian free expression might just persuade foreigners that there is still some liberalism left in Putin &apos;s authoritarian democracy - at least until that , too , ends up as a shattered illusion .
