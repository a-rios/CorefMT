Leaders and Managers 
CAMBRIDGE - For the first time in decades , a United States senator will become the next American president as all three of the remaining candidates - Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John McCain - are members of the Senate . 
While legislators have many leadership skills , their management ability is usually unproven . 
Senators manage a roughly 100-member staff , and a campaign staff of several hundreds . 
But can they manage an executive branch employing millions ? 
Contemporary management theory tends to distinguish between leadership and management , and places greater emphasis on leaders . 
Managers are described as those who merely embrace processes and seek stability , while leaders tolerate risk and create change . 
Organizations need both , but leaders are more important . 
As one expert puts it , a guiding coalition with good managers but poor leaders will not succeed . 
Good leaders construct teams that combine these functions , making sure to hire subordinates who can compensate for the leader &apos;s managerial deficiencies . 
More recently , there has been renewed interest in leaders as managers . 
After all , vision without implementation is ineffective . 
Leaders need enough managerial skill to assure that systems are in place to provide the information required for good decisions as well as effective implementation . 
An effective leader manages and shapes the context of decisions by creating and maintaining well-designed systems . 
Organizational skill is the ability to manage the structures , information flows , and reward systems of an institution or group . 
Leaders directly manage those who report to them , and they manage indirectly by establishing and maintaining systems for their institutions . 
This includes the encouragement of leadership at lower levels in their organizations . 
Good leaders must manage their inner circle of advisers to ensure an accurate flow of information and influence . 
They must avoid the &quot; emperor &apos;s trap &quot; of hearing only about the beauty of their new clothes . 
Ironically , George W. Bush , the first president with an MBA , was weaker on this dimension than his father , who knew how to manage an able group of advisers . 
Stephen Hadley , Bush &apos;s second National Security Adviser is quoted as saying about Bush &apos;s first term , &quot; I give us a &quot; B- &quot; for policy development and a &quot; D- &quot; for policy execution . &quot; 
Experts argue that well designed systems are like stage directions in a play . 
They encourage actors to make correct entrances and exits without being told . 
But stage directions are not enough . 
People always try to bend systems to their own purposes , and good leaders play a critical role in maintaining their systems &quot; integrity . 
If top leaders do not monitor their systems to ensure that they are producing full and accurate information flows , the systems are likely to become distorted by the most powerful subordinates . 
For example , President George H. W. Bush &apos;s National Security Adviser , Brent Scowcroft , made sure that powerful cabinet secretaries had full access to the president . 
Under Bush the younger , many of the same strong personalities were involved , but the formal National Security Council system became distorted , producing a truncated flow of information . 
Secretary of State Colin Powell &apos;s chief of staff described the situation as furtive and camouflaged by the inefficiency of the formal decision-making process . 
Or , in the words of Army General Wayne Downing , who worked in the White House , &quot; over the years , the interagency system has become so lethargic and dysfunctional that it inhibits the ability to apply the vast power of the US government on problems . 
You see this inability to synchronize in our operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan , across our foreign policy , and in our response to Katrina . &quot; 
The organizational skills required for leaders as managers should not be confused with the efficiency or tidiness of a well-run organization . 
Nor should it be restricted to hierarchical bureaucratic organizations . 
Leaders of social movements also need to manage the inward and outward flows of information . 
In this broad sense , organization and management refer to leaders &quot; ability to ensure an accurate inflow and outflow of information for making and implementing decisions . 
Effectiveness is more important than efficiency . 
Franklin Roosevelt , for instance , ran an inefficient organization with overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities . 
It was costly in many ways , but it assured him of multiple , competing flows of information . 
Roosevelt never thought that staffs had a monopoly on judgment or information , and has been described as seeking advice from anybody he could : cabinet members , congressmen , newspaper columnists , interest groups , citizens , and friends . 
Dwight Eisenhower ran an efficiently organized presidency that some at the time believed lacked leadership , but historians later discovered his hidden hand behind most important decisions . 
Ronald Reagan practiced extreme delegation , which worked when he had an able team in place , but turned into a disaster when Donald Regan , John Poindexter , and Oliver North took over . 
While Reagan excelled in vision , communication , and emotional intelligence , he lacked the skills of leadership as management . 
Successful leaders combine these skills so that unfiltered bad news can reach them and be acted upon promptly . 
Looking at the three senators running for president , John McCain has military experience , but as an aviator rather than a commander . 
Hillary Clinton has experience living close to decision-making in the White House , but not as the decision-maker . 
Barack Obama has experience living overseas and working as a community organizer in Chicago , but not in the executive branch . 
As elected legislators , all have demonstrated the &quot; soft power &quot; skills of attracting others to vote for them , but as for whether they will also be manager-leaders , the jury is still out .
