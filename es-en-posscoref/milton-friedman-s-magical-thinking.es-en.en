Milton Friedman &apos;s Magical Thinking 
CAMBRIDGE - Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of Milton Friedman &apos;s birth . 
Friedman was one of the twentieth century &apos;s leading economists , a Nobel Prize winner who made notable contributions to monetary policy and consumption theory . 
But he will be remembered primarily as the visionary who provided the intellectual firepower for free-market enthusiasts during the second half of the century , and as the Ã©minence grise behind the dramatic shift in the economic policies that took place after 1980 . 
At a time when skepticism about markets ran rampant , Friedman explained in clear , accessible language that private enterprise is the foundation of economic prosperity . 
All successful economies are built on thrift , hard work , and individual initiative . 
He railed against government regulations that encumber entrepreneurship and restrict markets . 
What Adam Smith was to the eighteenth century , Milton Friedman was to the twentieth . 
As Friedman &apos;s landmark television series &quot; Free to Choose &quot; was being broadcast in 1980 , the world economy stood in the throes of a singular transformation . 
Inspired by Friedman &apos;s ideas , Ronald Reagan , Margaret Thatcher , and many other government leaders began to dismantle the government restrictions and regulations that had been built up over the preceding decades . 
China moved away from central planning and allowed markets to flourish - first in agricultural products and , eventually , in industrial goods . 
Latin America sharply reduced its trade barriers and privatized its state-owned firms . 
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 , there was no doubt as to which direction the former command economies would take : towards free markets . 
But Friedman also produced a less felicitous legacy . 
In his zeal to promote the power of markets , he drew too sharp a distinction between the market and the state . 
In effect , he presented government as the enemy of the market . 
He therefore blinded us to the evident reality that all successful economies are , in fact , mixed . 
Unfortunately , the world economy is still contending with that blindness in the aftermath of a financial crisis that resulted , in no small part , from letting financial markets run too free . 
The Friedmanite perspective greatly underestimates the institutional prerequisites of markets . 
Let the government simply enforce property rights and contracts , and - presto ! - markets can work their magic . 
In fact , the kind of markets that modern economies need are not self-creating , self-regulating , self-stabilizing , or self-legitimizing . 
Governments must invest in transport and communication networks ; counteract asymmetric information , externalities , and unequal bargaining power ; moderate financial panics and recessions ; and respond to popular demands for safety nets and social insurance . 
Markets are the essence of a market economy in the same sense that lemons are the essence of lemonade . 
Pure lemon juice is barely drinkable . 
To make good lemonade , you need to mix it with water and sugar . 
Of course , if you put too much water in the mix , you ruin the lemonade , just as too much government meddling can make markets dysfunctional . 
The trick is not to discard the water and the sugar , but to get the proportions right . 
Hong Kong , which Friedman held up as the exemplar of a free-market society , remains the exception to the mixed-economy rule - and even there the government has played a large role in providing land for housing . 
The image most people will retain of Friedman is the smiling , diminutive , unassuming professor holding up a pencil in front of the cameras in &quot; Free to Choose &quot; to illustrate the power of markets . 
It took thousands of people all over the world to make this pencil , Friedman said - to mine the graphite , cut the wood , assemble the components , and market the final product . 
No single central authority coordinated their actions ; that feat was accomplished by the magic of free markets and the price system . 
More than 30 years later , there is an interesting coda to the pencil story ( which in fact was based on an article by the economist Leonard E. Read ) . 
Today , most of the world &apos;s pencils are produced in China - an economy that is a peculiar mix of private entrepreneurship and state direction . 
A modern-day Friedman might want to ask how China has come to dominate the pencil industry , as it has so many others . 
There are better sources of graphite in Mexico and South Korea . 
Forest reserves are more plentiful in Indonesia and Brazil . 
Germany and the United States have better technology . 
China has lots of low-cost labor , but so does Bangladesh , Ethiopia , and many other populous low-income countries . 
Undoubtedly , most of the credit belongs to the initiative and hard work Chinese entrepreneurs and laborers . 
But the present-day pencil story would be incomplete without citing China &apos;s state-owned firms , which made the initial investments in technology and labor training ; lax forest management policies , which kept wood artificially cheap ; generous export subsidies ; and government intervention in currency markets , which gives Chinese producers a significant cost advantage . 
China &apos;s government has subsidized , protected , and goaded its firms to ensure rapid industrialization , thereby altering the global division of labor in its favor . 
Friedman himself would have rued these government policies . 
Yet the tens of thousands of workers that pencil factories in China employ would most likely have remained poor farmers if the government had not given market forces a nudge to get the industry off the ground . 
Given China &apos;s economic success , it is hard to deny the contribution made by the government &apos;s industrialization policies . 
Free-market enthusiasts &quot; place in the history of economic thought will remain secure . 
But thinkers like Friedman leave an ambiguous and puzzling legacy , because it is the interventionists who have succeeded in economic history , where it really matters .
