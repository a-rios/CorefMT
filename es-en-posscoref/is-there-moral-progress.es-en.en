Is There Moral Progress ? 
MELBOURNE - After a century that saw two world wars , the Nazi Holocaust , Stalin &apos;s Gulag , the killing fields of Cambodia , and more recent atrocities in Rwanda and now Darfur , the belief that we are progressing morally has become difficult to defend . 
Yet there is more to the question than extreme cases of moral breakdown . 
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly &apos;s adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
In response to the crimes committed during World War II , the Declaration sought to establish the principle that everyone is entitled to the same basic rights , irrespective of race , color , sex , language , religion , or other status . 
So , perhaps we can judge moral progress by asking how well we have done in combating racism and sexism . 
Assessing the extent to which racism and sexism have actually been reduced is a daunting task . 
Nevertheless , recent polls by WorldPublicOpinion.org shed some indirect light on this question . 
The polls , involving nearly 15,000 respondents , were conducted in 16 countries , representing 58 % of the world &apos;s population : Azerbaijan , China , Egypt , France , Great Britain , India , Indonesia , Iran , Mexico , Nigeria , the Palestinian Territories , Russia , South Korea , Turkey , Ukraine , and the United States . 
In 11 of these countries , most people believe that , over their lifetimes , people of different races and ethnicities have come to be treated more equally . 
On average , 59 % say this , with only 19 % thinking that people are treated less equally , and 20 % saying that there has been no change . 
People in the US , Indonesia , China , Iran , and Great Britain are particularly likely to perceive greater equality . 
Palestinians are the only people of whom a majority sees less equality for people of different racial or ethnic groups , although opinion is relatively evenly divided in Nigeria , Ukraine , Azerbaijan and Russia . 
An even stronger overall majority , 71 % , regards women as having made progress towards equality , although once again , the Palestinian territories are an exception , this time joined by Nigeria . 
Russia , Ukraine , and Azerbaijan again have significant minorities saying that women are now treated less equally than they once were . 
In India , although only 53 % say that women have gained greater equality , an additional 14 % say that women now have more rights than men ! 
( Presumably , they were thinking only of those females who are not aborted because prenatal testing has shown them not to be male . ) 
Overall , it seems likely that these opinions reflect real changes , and thus are signs of moral progress toward a world in which people are not denied rights on the basis of race , ethnicity , or sex . 
On average , 90 % of those asked said that equal treatment for people of different races or ethnic origins is important , and in no country were more than 13 % of respondents prepared to say that equal treatment is not important . 
When asked about equal rights for women , support was almost as strong , with an average of 86 % rating it important . 
Significantly , these majorities existed in Muslim countries as well . 
In Egypt , for example , 97 % said that racial and ethnic equality is important , and 90 % said that equality for women is important . 
In Iran , the figures were 82 % and 78 % , respectively . 
Compared to just a decade before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , this represents a significant change in people &apos;s views . 
Equal rights for women - not simply suffrage , but also working outside the home or living independently - was still a radical idea in many countries . 
Openly racist ideas prevailed in Germany and the American South , and much of the world &apos;s population lived in colonies ruled by European powers . 
Today , despite what happened in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia - and appeared to be on the verge of happening after the recent disputed election in Kenya - no country openly accepts racist doctrines . 
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said about equal rights for women . 
In Saudi Arabia , women are not even permitted to drive a car , let alone vote . 
In many other countries , too , whatever people may say about gender equality , the reality is that women are far from having equal rights . 
This may mean that the surveys I have quoted indicate not widespread equality , but widespread hypocrisy . 
Nevertheless , hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue , and the fact that racists and sexists must pay this tribute is an indication of some moral progress . 
Words do have consequences , and what one generation says but does not really believe , the next generation may believe , and even act upon . 
Public acceptance of ideas is itself progress of a kind , but what really matters is that it provides leverage that can be used to bring about more concrete progress . 
For that reason , we should greet the poll results positively , and resolve to close the gaps that still exist between rhetoric and reality .
