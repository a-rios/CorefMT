Stalin , Our Contemporary 
NEW HAVEN - Eighty years ago , in the autumn of 1930 , Joseph Stalin enforced a policy that changed the course of history , and led to tens of millions of deaths across the decades and around the world . 
In a violent and massive campaign of &quot; collectivization , &quot; he brought Soviet agriculture under state control . 
Stalin pursued collectivization despite the massive resistance that had followed when Soviet authorities first tried to introduce the policy the previous spring . 
The Soviet leadership had relied then upon shootings and deportations to the Gulag to preempt opposition . 
Yet Soviet citizens resisted in large numbers ; 
In the autumn , the shootings and deportations resumed , complemented by economic coercion . 
Individual farmers were taxed until they entered the collective , and collective farms were allowed to seize individual farmers &quot; seed grain , used to plant the next year &apos;s harvest . 
Once the agricultural sector of the USSR was collectivized , the hunger began . 
By depriving peasants of their land and making them de facto state employees , collective farming allowed Moscow to control people as well as their produce . 
Yet control is not creation . 
It proved impossible to make Central Asian nomads into productive farmers in a single growing season . 
Beginning in 1930 , some 1.3 million people starved in Kazakhstan as their meager crops were requisitioned according to central directives . 
In Ukraine , the harvest failed in 1931 . 
&quot; How can we be expected to build the socialist economy , &quot; asked a Ukrainian peasant , &quot; when we are all doomed to hunger ? &quot; 
We now know , after 20 years of discussion of Soviet documents , that in 1932 Stalin knowingly transformed the collectivization famine in Ukraine into a deliberate campaign of politically motivated starvation . 
Stalin presented the crop failure as a sign of Ukrainian national resistance , requiring firmness rather than concessions . 
As famine spread that summer , Stalin refined his explanation : hunger was sabotage , local Communist activists were the saboteurs , protected by higher authorities , and all were paid by foreign spies . 
In the autumn of 1932 , the Kremlin issued a series of decrees that guaranteed mass death . 
One of them cut off all supplies to communities that failed to make their grain quotas . 
Meanwhile , the Communists took whatever food they could find , as one peasant remembered , &quot; down to the last little grain , &quot; and in early 1933 the borders of Soviet Ukraine were sealed so that the starving could not seek help . 
Dying peasants harvested the spring crops under watchtowers . 
More than five million people starved to death or died of hunger-related disease in the USSR in the early 1930 &quot; s , 3.3 million of them in Ukraine , of which about three million would have survived had Stalin simply ceased requisitions and exports for a few months and granted people access to grain stores . 
These events remain at the center of East European politics to this day . 
Each November , Ukrainians commemorate the victims of 1933 . 
But Viktor Yanukovych , the current Ukrainian president , denies the special suffering of the Ukrainian people - a nod to Russia &apos;s official historical narrative , which seeks to blur the particular evils of collectivization into a tragedy so vague that it has no clear perpetrators or victims . 
Rafal Lemkin , the Polish-Jewish lawyer who established the concept of &quot; genocide &quot; and invented the term , would have disagreed : he called the Ukrainian famine a classic case of Soviet genocide . 
As Lemkin knew , terror followed famine : peasants who survived hunger and the Gulag became Stalin &apos;s next victims . 
The Great Terror of 1937-1938 began with a shooting campaign - directed chiefly against peasants - that claimed 386,798 lives across the Soviet Union , a disproportionate number of them in Ukraine . 
Collectivization casts a long shadow . 
When Nazi Germany invaded the western Soviet Union , the Germans kept the collective farms intact , rightly seeing them as the instrument that would allow them to divert Ukrainian food for their own purposes , and starve whom they wished . 
After Mao made his revolution in 1948 , Chinese communists followed the Stalinist model of development . 
This meant that some 30 million Chinese starved to death in 1958-1961 , in a famine very similar to that in the Soviet Union . 
Maoist collectivization , too , was followed by mass shooting campaigns . 
Even today , collective agriculture is the basis for tyrannical power in North Korea , where hundreds of thousands of people starved in the 1990 &quot; s . 
And in Belarus , Europe &apos;s last dictatorship , collective farming was never undone , and a former collective farm director , Aleksandr Lukashenko , runs the country . 
Lukashenko is running for a fourth consecutive presidential term in December . 
Controlling the land , he also controls the vote . 
Eighty years after the collectivization campaign , Stalin &apos;s world remains with us .
