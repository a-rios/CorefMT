Who Wants Peace in the Middle East ? 
Forty years after the Six Day War peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems as distant as ever . 
Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government . 
What is the cause of this seeming paradox ? 
Is there any hope ? 
The Palestinian government is united administratively , but divided politically . 
The Palestinians have one government with two policies . 
Politically , Palestine &apos;s Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh remains against recognizing Israel and respecting the existing agreements . 
He declared that he is for the continuation of resistance in all forms . 
What kind of guarantee of a good faith effort to reach a peace agreement can come from such a stance ? 
That is the question the European Union needs to ask itself as it debates whether to resume providing financial aid to the Palestinian Authority . 
The EU should make it clear to Hamas that the Union is not going to finance terror and is not going to finance a refusal to make peace . 
If the Palestinians want to have European help - which I support completely - it must be ready to make peace , not to break peace . 
After all , it is not Hamas as a party that is objectionable ; what is objectionable are the politics and policies which Hamas pursues . 
We have nothing against Hamas ; we are against their belligerent policies , which service in government has not changed . 
There was a time when the PLO held positions that were the same as those of Hamas . 
Then the PLO changed . 
If the current Palestinian leadership changes its position , there will be no problem from our side . 
We will have nothing against negotiations . 
We are for negotiations . 
We are for the &quot; two-state solution . &quot; 
We accept the Middle East &quot; road map . &quot; 
What we are against is terror . 
Where we cannot agree , however , is on a &quot; right of return &quot; for Palestinians . 
If such a right were recognized , there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish majority , which would mean the end of the Jewish state . 
This is a demographic , not a religious , question : an Arab state is where the Arabs are the majority , and the Jewish state is where the Jews are the majority . 
Indeed , the &quot; right of return &quot; contradicts the very idea of a two-state solution , as it would mean one state - a Palestinian state . 
Nobody in Israel will accept this . 
But there are other problems in the region that Israel - and the world - must face . 
The Palestinians &quot; current unity government resulted from Saudi mediation , which came in response mainly to Iran &apos;s ambition to increase its influence , not only in Iraq , but also in Lebanon , Gaza , and the West Bank . 
Of course , that issue is completely outside Israel &apos;s control . 
The ongoing fight in the Muslim world between Sunnis and Shi &apos;a recalls the struggle between Protestants and Catholics in seventeenth-century Europe . 
So it is little wonder that the Saudis , Jordanians , Egyptians , and the Gulf states are seeking to resist Iran &apos;s hegemonic ambitions in the region . 
Nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than in the seventeenth century , because Iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons . 
Indeed , Iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the United Nations . 
That is a threat that every country is obliged to take seriously . 
When a country &apos;s president delivers crazy speeches , denies the Holocaust , and does not hide his ambition to control the Middle East , who can guarantee that the threat is not serious ? 
The issue is not one of restoring nuclear &quot; balance &quot; to the Middle East , as Iran &apos;s leaders maintain . 
First of all , Israel does not threaten anybody . 
Israel never said that it wants to destroy Iran ; 
Israel never openly proclaimed that it would enrich uranium and build nuclear bombs in order to destroy another country . 
On the contrary , Israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East . 
But that does not mean that we can afford to ignore an obvious threat from countries that want to destroy us . 
Despite the current unfavorable situation , the path to stabilizing the Middle East still leads through joint economic projects . 
Even now , Israel is planning to build a new &quot; corridor of peace , &quot; which will comprise the Jordanians , the Palestinians , and us . 
Within the framework of this project , we are seeking to halt the dehydration of the Dead Sea , build a joint airport and a joint water network with Jordan , and develop tourism infrastructure , at a cost of up to $ 5 billion . 
We have the donors , so there is no shortage of money to finance our efforts , which , I am sure , will be realized . 
Israel wants - indeed , desperately needs - peace and stability in the Middle East , and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it . 
But we cannot reach that goal alone , much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel .
