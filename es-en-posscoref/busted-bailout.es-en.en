Busted Bailout 
CAMBRIDGE - Spend in haste ; repent at leisure . 
With minds concentrated by fears of another 1930 &quot; s-style Great Depression , America &apos;s political leaders developed , virtually overnight , a $ 700 billion bailout plan to resuscitate the country &apos;s rapidly deflating financial sector . 
Perhaps they were right to be skeptical . 
The plan &apos;s central conceit is that government ingenuity can disentangle the trillion-dollar &quot; sub-prime &quot; mortgage loan market , even though Wall Street &apos;s own rocket scientists have utterly failed to do so . 
To boot , we have been told that government is so clever that it might even make money on the whole affair . 
Perhaps , but let &apos;s not forget that a lot of very smart people in the financial industry thought the same thing until quite recently . 
Just a year ago , the United States had five major freestanding investment banks that stood atop its mighty financial sector . 
Collectively , their employees shared more than $ 36 billion dollars in bonuses last year , thanks to the huge profits these institutions &quot; earned &quot; on their risky and aggressive business strategies . 
These strategies typically involve far more risk - and sophistication - than the activities of traditional commercial banks . 
In mid-August , I had the temerity to predict that risks had come home to roost , and that a large US investment bank might soon fail or be forced into a highly distressed merger . 
Little did I imagine that today , there would be no freestanding investment bank left on Wall Street . 
Indeed , after years of attracting many of the world &apos;s best and brightest into ultra-high paying jobs , collapsing investment banks are now throwing them out left and right . 
One such victim , a former student , called me the other day and asked , &quot; What am I supposed to do now , get a real job ? &quot; 
This brings us back to the US Treasury &apos;s plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to unclog the sub-prime mortgage market . 
The idea is that the US government would serve as buyer of last resort for the junk debt that the private sector has not been able to price . 
Who , exactly , would the Treasury employ to figure all this out ? 
Why , unemployed investment bankers , of course ! 
Let &apos;s ponder this . 
Investment bankers have been losing their cushy jobs because they could not figure out any convincing way to price distressed mortgage debt . 
Otherwise , their firms would have been able to tap the trillions of dollars now sitting on the sidelines , held by sovereign wealth funds , private equity groups , hedge funds , and others . 
Now , working for the taxpayer , these same investment bankers will suddenly come up with the magic pricing formula that has eluded them until now . 
Little wonder that academics across the political spectrum have expressed considerable skepticism . 
True , the Treasury would take equity stakes in some firms , so there would be some upside potential . 
Does such nitpicking fail to recognize the urgency of fixing the financial system ? 
Isn &apos;t any plan better than none ? 
I , for one , am not convinced . 
Efficient financial systems are supposed to promote growth in the real economy , not impose a huge tax burden . 
Thus , unlike in the 1930 &quot; s , the US faces a hypertrophied financial system . 
Isn &apos;t it possible , then , that rather than causing a Great Depression , significant shrinkage of the financial sector , particularly if facilitated by an improved regulatory structure , might actually enhance efficiency and growth ? 
I am not suggesting that the government should sit on its hands . 
It needs to provide an expanded form of deposit insurance during this time of turmoil , so that there are no more Northern Rock-style bank runs . 
That was a big lesson of the 1930 &quot; s . 
The government may also need to consider injecting funds more directly into the mortgage sector while the private sector reconstitutes itself . 
Certainly , the government must also find better ways to help homeowners and their lenders work out efficient bankruptcy proceedings . 
It makes no sense for banks to foreclose on homes when there are workout options whereby people could stay in their homes and banks could recover far more money . 
Eventually , after further twists , turns , and huge expenditures , the US will emerge from its epic financial crisis . 
The proposal that was defeated was not sufficiently targeted at pruning back insolvent banks , but it will almost certainly not be the last word , regardless of how Congress now proceeds .
