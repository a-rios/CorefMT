The Truth about NATO Burden-Sharing 
BRUSSELS - When discussing Afghanistan , many newspapers continue to suggest that some of Europe &apos;s NATO allies are under-performing in Afghanistan , and are either unable or unwilling to make a greater effort . 
Naturally , these allies feel that their efforts are under-valued . 
What is a fair and equitable burden ? 
First of all , the debate about burden-sharing should not be reduced solely to today &apos;s force levels in Afghanistan , because , however important these force levels are , they tell only part of the story . 
So let me broaden the debate and offer a more holistic perspective by covering three interconnected elements : defense transformation , operations , and the wider context of the international community &apos;s efforts . 
Defense transformation is a key aspect of burden-sharing . 
It is a golden rule within the alliance that the bulk of NATO &apos;s forces and capabilities are owned by individual nations - the alliance &apos;s fleet of Airborne Warning and Command System ( AWACS ) aircraft is a rare exception . 
As I don &apos;t expect nations to abandon this principle , NATO will continue to depend on individual allies and their willingness to commit resources . 
Contrary to popular opinion , the type of forces and capabilities needed by NATO are not as widely available in national inventories as one might think . 
Large proportions of NATO allies &quot; armed forces are still better suited for static territorial defense than for the expeditionary type of operation needed in Afghanistan . 
And , when the right type of forces and capabilities do exist , operations led by the United Nations , the European Union , or ad hoc coalitions , as well as national requirements , place additional demands on these assets . 
Developing the necessary expeditionary capabilities is a major feature of NATO &apos;s transformation process . 
But it is not possible to convert territorial forces into expeditionary forces overnight , and the costs of transformation often must compete with the costs of deploying forces for operations . 
Many allies face the dilemma of either spending money on operations or investing in new acquisition programs . 
Moreover , many allies &quot; failure to respect the 2 % -of-GDP target for their defense budgets exacerbates this dilemma , and also widens the capability gap with those allies that are investing in usable and deployable forces . 
But , while there is no substitute for appropriate defense budgets , we could get more from current spending levels , especially through a smarter approach to defense acquisition . 
Unfortunately , despite the efforts of NATO and the EU , Europe &apos;s defense sector remains fragmented , which leads to duplication , unhelpful competition from too many rival systems , and , significant capability gaps or incompatibilities . 
In Afghanistan , for example , national systems for friendly-force tracking , which are vital to preventing accidental attacks on one &apos;s own forces or allies , are not compatible . 
Extra time and money has therefore had to be invested in the acquisition of these capabilities . 
In Europe , many national defense budgets can no longer sustain both fully-fledged national forces and a national defense industry . 
Only smarter multinational and transatlantic cooperation will give us forces that are capable of dealing with today &apos;s security challenges . 
In an alliance founded on the principle of &quot; all for one , and one for all , &quot; it is vital that all nations are seen to contribute fairly to operations . 
Thus , NATO , developed a burden-sharing mechanism to assess members &quot; manning commitments for critical operational activities relative to their gross national income . 
This sort of arithmetic has the merit of giving some indications about burden-sharing , but it has also been shown that burden-sharing cannot be fully captured in graphs and spreadsheets . 
How does one decide what is a fair contribution from a country of 50 million people compared to a country with only four million ? 
How can you evaluate a contribution of light infantry against the provision of critical enablers such as helicopters or air-to-air refueling tankers ? 
Over what time period do you make your calculations ? 
Common funding , with all members paying a share according to their GDP , is one instrument that can be used to achieve more equitable burden-sharing . 
Traditionally , NATO applied a policy of &quot; costs lie where they fall &quot; : each member picked up all the costs for the operational contribution that it made to an Alliance operation . 
During the past couple of years , NATO &apos;s funding policy has been updated to allow common funding to be used as an incentive for the provision of certain theater-level enabling capabilities , like medical facilities , airports handling troops and supplies , or intelligence . 
Burden-sharing is a sensitive issue , for both NATO and the international community , and passions sometimes run high . 
By stepping back and looking at the broader picture , it is clear that it is not just a matter of having the right capabilities , but also of having the money and political will to deploy them . 
No single measure can resolve the burden-sharing problem . 
But the range of initiatives now underway within NATO should help : transformation efforts to increase the pool of usable and deployable forces ; wider use of multinational initiatives ; greater reliance on common funding to assist force generation ; and a comprehensive approach for sharing burdens more equitably across the entire international community . 
An alliance like NATO , in contrast to many &quot; coalitions of the willing , &quot; has the political consultation structures , proven planning mechanisms , effective command and control , and legitimacy that encourages nations to contribute to an operation . 
Alliance solidarity is not just a slogan . 
The sense of keeping one &apos;s obligations and commitments to other allies , upon whom one &apos;s own security ultimately depends , is a powerful motive for equitable burden-sharing . 
Totally fair burden-sharing may not be possible , but a security organization like NATO undoubtedly allows us to come closer to it than any other approach .
