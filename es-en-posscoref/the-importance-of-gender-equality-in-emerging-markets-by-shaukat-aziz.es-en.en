Emerging Markets &quot; Feminine Future 
LONDON - According to the United Nations , 70 % of women worldwide experience violence in their lifetime . 
The World Bank adds that women aged 15-44 are more likely to experience rape or domestic violence than cancer , car accidents , war , or malaria . 
Such indicators are even more alarming in emerging markets , where discrimination and gender inequality are particularly prevalent . 
This partly reflects the failure of public policy to ameliorate the distributive consequences of rapid economic growth . 
With the informal sector continuing to play a major role in emerging economies , women often have access to only unreliable and transitory employment that offers casual and irregular wages . 
Meanwhile , unprecedented urbanization has disrupted traditional family structures , further undermining the role that women can play in economies and societies . 
The damaging impact of active gender discrimination - such as bride burning and female infanticide - is clear . 
In all of its forms , gender discrimination makes women vulnerable to sexual slavery , trafficking , and forced marriage , deprives women of their inalienable rights , and diminishes their quality of life . 
At the same time , it stunts the capacity of boys and men to understand women &apos;s plight , thus diminishing their motivation to change the situation . 
While these issues are global , they are most urgent in emerging markets , where they are undermining the social and economic progress on which the rest of the world increasingly relies . 
In the wake of the global economic crisis , emerging markets have become the engines of worldwide growth . 
Failure to make full use of women &apos;s talents undermines emerging markets &quot; economic development , while the marginalization and abuse of women threatens their social advancement and impairs their political stability . 
With most countries worldwide facing continued economic uncertainty , the international community has a vested interest in emerging economies &quot; resilience , collective capacity to sustain global demand for goods and services , and ability to confront the challenges , such as gender inequality , that threaten their success . 
The importance of overcoming these barriers to development was emphasized at a recent symposium ( of which I was the chair ) at Green Templeton College , Oxford . 
Fifty leaders from government , business , civil society , and academia identified gender inequality as the most urgent constraint to sustainable growth , social cohesion , and political stability , and agreed on the steps needed to address the issue effectively . 
First and foremost , national policymakers must take concrete , comprehensive action to ensure that women are forced to abandon neither productive nor reproductive activities . 
To this end , governments should implement measures that guarantee , directly or indirectly , affordable child- and elder-care support systems for working parents . 
Moreover , private employers should be encouraged to build supportive workplaces by implementing creative solutions to common constraints . 
For example , MAS Holdings in Sri Lanka has incorporated into the workplace nursing stations , on-site banking , and company buses that ease employees &quot; commutes and facilitate participation in sports programs . 
Such measures not only lead to increased productivity ; they also bolster loyalty , morale , and thus employee retention . 
At the same time , it is crucial that women enjoy total reproductive autonomy and sexual sovereignty . 
But even healthy reproduction has a dark side . 
Neonaticide ( killing infants that are less than one day old ) , infanticide ( killing infants that are more than one day old ) , and the practice of disposing of female children in favor of male offspring are not only barbaric ; they have led to imbalanced gender ratios in many emerging markets . 
Policymakers must enforce criminal sanctions against these practices . 
Subsequently , educational programs for children and adults should be launched , in collaboration with religious groups , in order to improve public understanding of gender inequality . 
By promoting a shift in public perceptions , such programs can catalyze fundamental behavioral changes . 
International action is also crucial . 
The World Bank and regional development banks should be encouraged to incorporate gender-equality criteria into their eligibility criteria for loans and credit to emerging-market governments and private-sector corporations . 
Such a clear economic link would help to motivate local policymakers to take strong action , while helping to bolster public support for policies promoting gender equality . 
The international community has a profound stake in the future performance of emerging markets . 
In order to bolster these countries &quot; social and economic advancement , the development agenda in the coming years should include a robust commitment to promoting gender equality .
