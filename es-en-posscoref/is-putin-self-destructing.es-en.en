Is Putin Self-Destructing ? 
With the arrest of Russia &apos;s richest man , oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky , Russia has lurched into a deep political crisis . 
Unwittingly , President Vladimir Putin has opted for an all-or-nothing victory over the oil oligarch . 
At stake is nothing less than Russia &apos;s frail democracy . 
The legal charges against Khodorkovsky concern old privatization and tax evasion cases . 
But the charges against Khodorkovsky are as flimsy as they are tendentious : the privatization case had been amicably settled previously , and Khodorkovsky has merely used tax avoidance schemes that are commonplace in Russia - and that have been upheld in court . 
Putin &apos;s real problem is that Khodorkovsky is too powerful and independent for the straitened politics he wants . 
During his four years in power , Putin has advanced four major policies . 
The first three - free market reform , the rule of law , and a pragmatic foreign policy - have been widely acclaimed , while the fourth -  &quot; managed democracy &quot;  - has been tolerated because it has brought political stability . 
But &quot; managed democracy &quot; now threatens to unravel all three of his real achievements . 
Khodorkovsky is the fourth major businessmen taken out of action by the authorities . 
Four independent TV channels have also been taken over by the state , and no criticism of Putin is permitted in significant media . 
The main polling organizations have also been brought under Kremlin control . 
Regional elections are regularly manipulated , often by disqualifying leading opposition candidates . 
The pattern is evident : a systematic authoritarian drive is underway . 
Russia &apos;s oligarchs are undoubtedly unpopular , and Khodorovsky &apos;s arrest was evidently aimed at boosting Putin &apos;s prospects in the looming parliamentary and presidential elections . 
But although Russians dislike the powerful , and cherish underdogs and martyrs , a man in jail no longer looks strong . 
With Khodorkovsky &apos;s arrest , the authorities flaunted their extralegal and arbitrary powers in such a way that they have aroused widespread public worry . 
Previously , Putin had enigmatically appealed to most Russians . 
By balancing between ex-KGB people and big businessmen , he seemed independent of both . 
Now he has antagonized all big businessmen ; he even refuses to meet them . 
Suddenly , he has reduced himself to KGB President , jeopardizing the very political stability he sought to guarantee . 
Putin has spoken continuously about the need for the rule of law , but in his TV statement on October 27 , he effectively stated his preference for law enforcers . 
Indeed , in the Khodorkovsky affair , all procedural requirements have been blithely neglected . 
For example , although prosecutors control the relevant courts , they did not bother to secure the necessary court orders for the Yukos raids and arrests . 
The obvious conclusion that even ordinary Russians are drawing is that neither property rights nor people are safe . 
Investments are likely to be stopped or delayed . 
Those who can export capital will do so . 
An emerging panic seems certain to dampen today &apos;s strong growth . 
The fallout from Khodorkovsky &apos;s arrest is felt abroad as well . 
The world &apos;s business press has roundly condemned the authorities &apos; behavior , especially the impounding of Yukos shares worth many times more than possible state claims , which smacks of expropriation . 
Foreign governments are voicing their fears . 
In one stroke , Putin has jeopardized his considerable accomplishments . 
With his public bluntness , he has discarded his prior coyness and deprived himself of deniability . 
As the KGB culprits keep quiet , the President must do most of the talking , exposing himself further . 
But why defend the arrest in a televised statement ? 
Why refuse to meet Russia &apos;s business elite , while meeting with foreign investment bankers ? 
Why seize Yukos shares and licenses ? 
A couple of weeks before his arrest , Khodorkovsky told me : &quot; I do not understand how they can win , given how many mistakes they make . &quot; 
His words seem prescient . 
The situation in the Kremlin appears reminiscent of the spring of 1996 , when a group of KGB men , led by President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s chief bodyguard , General Alexander Korzhakov , almost seized power . 
But the oligarchs mobilized behind Anatoly Chubais , who ousted Korzhakov and his circle by June . 
Once again , Russia &apos;s big businessmen have united behind Chubais . 
If Putin wants to save his own skin , he must act fast and sack his top KGB aides in the Kremlin and the Prosecutor General . 
It is worth recalling that in 1999 former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov were seen as a shoo-in ticket for the presidency . 
But , having curried favor with Russia &apos;s media , they were unaccustomed to criticism - and rendered helpless when it appeared . 
The taboo against criticizing Putin is already powerless . 
The main liberal parties - the Union of Rightist Forces and Yabloko - are attacking him ferociously , while the faceless parties that supposedly support him are silent and confused . 
They are presumed to be on the verge of winning an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections due on December 7 , yet like Korzhakov and his clique , they could be routed . 
Indeed , by alienating big business and letting his wily chief of staff , Alexander Voloshin , resign , Putin has deprived himself of crucial electoral resources . 
His former chief political advisor has even accused him of using &quot; Stalinist measures . &quot; 
If Putin falls short of the high expectations in the upcoming parliamentary election , his fortunes in the March 14 , 2004 , presidential vote may be jeopardy . 
By arresting Khodorkovsky , Putin has revealed his authoritarian nature to the entire world . 
He has thrown a gauntlet in the face of Russia &apos;s civil society and business elite . 
They have little choice but to resist , and their strength should not be underestimated . 
The battle for Russian democracy is joined anew .
