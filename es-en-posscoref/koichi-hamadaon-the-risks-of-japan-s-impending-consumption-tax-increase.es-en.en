Japan &apos;s Tax-Hike Test 
TOKYO - As October began , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that his government would raise the country &apos;s consumption-tax rate from 5 % to 8 % next April , and presumably to 10 % 18 months after that . 
The contrast with what is now happening in the United States could not be sharper . 
As US President Barack Obama &apos;s domestic opponents resist his signature health-care legislation , owing to the wealth transfers that it implies , Japanese bureaucrats are trying to recover the authority to administer tax revenue to support social-welfare programs . 
There are many arguments for raising Japan &apos;s consumption-tax rate . 
Japan &apos;s government has a huge debt burden , and its consumption-tax rate is far lower than the value-added-tax rates that prevail in Europe . 
At the same time , the effective corporate-tax rate in Japan is higher than it is elsewhere , making it difficult for Japan to attract investment , foreign or domestic . 
In order to survive international tax competition - and thus be able to rely on corporate taxes as a source of revenue - Japan &apos;s corporate-tax rate should be lowered in the long run . 
Nonetheless , with Japan &apos;s economy just beginning to recover from more than 15 years of stagnation , such a steep consumption-tax hike is not advisable . 
In fact , such a large increase has seldom - if ever - been attempted , owing to the risk that it would spur consumers to spend before it takes effect , thereby reducing future consumption . 
Moreover , any sudden rise in the tax burden results in deadweight losses . 
A consumption-tax hike should be timed in such a way that it does not suffocate the economic recovery that Abe &apos;s bold economic program , dubbed &quot; Abenomics , &quot; is facilitating . 
Western economists typically favor gradual tax increases ; 
Jeffrey Frankel , for example , recommends a pre-announced plan to increase the tax rate by , say , one percentage point annually for five years . 
But Japanese policymakers , media , and academics largely continue to favor a sudden and substantial hike . 
Last year , when Japan &apos;s Diet passed the legislation to raise the consumption tax , it included a provision calling for the plan to be reevaluated if economic conditions required it . 
When the Cabinet Office called upon 60 business leaders , academics , and economists ( including me ) to perform such an evaluation , more than 70 % favored the hike . 
But the selection of experts reflected a clear bias toward the finance ministry &apos;s views . 
In fact , the ministry has used its &quot; informational campaign &quot; to shape public discussion , convincing scholars , business economists , and the general public to be more concerned about keeping the budget deficit under control than about the effects of a negative demand shock . 
This is a typical example of what economists like Joseph Stiglitz call &quot; cognitive capture . &quot; 
For more than two decades - a period characterized by chronic recession and deflation - Japan has retained its position as the world &apos;s richest country in terms of net wealth abroad . 
At the end of last year , Japan &apos;s net international wealth amounted to Â¥ 296 trillion ( $ 3 trillion ) . 
But Japan &apos;s government is believed to be the world &apos;s poorest , with the finance ministry reporting that the gross debt / GDP ratio exceeds 200 % . 
That is an exaggeration . 
For example , Ichizo Miyamoto , a former senior finance-ministry official , claims that , accounting for the government &apos;s assets , Japan &apos;s net debt / GDP ratio is below 100 % , similar to that of the United States . 
The validity of the finance ministry &apos;s position on the tax increase was called into question by the decline in Japan &apos;s Nikkei index of stock futures after Abe &apos;s October 1 announcement . 
To be sure , the budget crisis in the US caused most stock futures to decline on that day . 
But , if the ministry &apos;s view of the consumption tax was correct , Nikkei futures would have gained more - or at least lost less - than futures in other countries . 
Instead , the index declined three times more steeply than others . 
And yet , while the consumption-tax increase is not ideally timed , I am not entirely pessimistic about its impact . 
The Mundell-Fleming framework - which describes the short-run relationship between the nominal exchange rate , interest rates , and output in an open economy - indicates that , under Japan &apos;s flexible exchange-rate regime , the post-hike decline in demand could be addressed relatively easily with more expansionary monetary policy . 
That is why Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda should respond accordingly if the tax increase has a deflationary impact . 
In doing so , he would avoid the criticism that former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King faced for supporting a consumer-tax hike in 2011 but failing to use monetary policy to offset its recessionary effects . 
Just a year ago , former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda attempted , despite a deep recession , to raise the consumption tax without monetary easing - a strategy that could have brought only continued economic stagnation . 
Abe must not make the same mistake . 
If Japan &apos;s government can overcome a demand setback after the tax increase takes effect - leaving the economy functioning smoothly and initiating a recovery in government revenue - Abe will be able to declare Abenomics an unequivocal success .
