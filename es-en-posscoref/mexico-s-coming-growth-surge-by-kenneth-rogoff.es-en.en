Mexico Breaking Good ? 
MEXICO CITY - For a glimpse of the average American &apos;s understanding of the relationship between the United States and Mexico , one only has to watch the critically acclaimed television series Breaking Bad . 
Set in Albuquerque , New Mexico , a few hundred miles from the border , the series chronicles the rise and fall of Walter White , a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a methamphetamine tycoon . 
Most of the characters on the US side of the border are portrayed with sympathy and depth . 
The main protagonist &apos;s step-by-step descent into the drug underworld unfolds with such subtlety that each individual decision he makes along the way seems almost reasonable . 
Unfortunately , the other side of the border receives more superficial treatment . 
In one scene , two Mexican hit men ruthlessly slaughter a dozen innocent compatriots who could bear witness to their border crossing . 
In another episode , members of the Mexican Federal Police are seen assaulting a drug lord in his hacienda , with the implication that they are only doing the bidding of a rival dealer . 
&quot; Breaking Bad &quot; is brilliant television , but it is regrettable that so many Americans see only this side of things . 
Mexico has profound security problems in some regions , but it is also a country that just might be on the threshold of a huge political and economic transformation . 
Indeed , for a couple of years now , Mexico &apos;s GDP growth rates have been near the top of the OECD , and recently above Brazil &apos;s . 
Rather than continue fighting ( as in the US ) after a heated presidential election , Mexico &apos;s major political parties appear poised to cooperate on a number of critical structural reforms that could energize economic growth for decades to come . 
The agenda includes an expansion of the tax base to reduce dependency on oil , an initiative to increase competition in media and telecommunications , and a constitutional change that will permit the state-owned oil company Pemex to enter into joint ventures with foreign firms . 
This last reform is critical , because much of Mexico &apos;s geology is very similar to that of the southwestern US . 
In principle , Mexico &apos;s economy should be benefiting from the same shale-gas revolution that is providing a huge boost to the US , where natural-gas prices are now less than one-quarter of what Europeans pay . 
Mexico is already enjoying a manufacturing boom that has increased its exports to the US , following a long secular decline . 
With China &apos;s wages soaring and rising oil prices driving up shipping costs , production in Mexico is suddenly looking much more attractive , even taking security concerns into account . 
Of course , any number of things can go wrong . 
First and foremost , the political elite might suddenly back away from essential structural reforms , and the Mexican business community &apos;s current optimism could collapse . 
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time . 
There is also a risk that foreign investors , who already are starting to like Mexico , might come to love it a little too much . 
A huge influx of capital could lead to a significant appreciation of the peso &apos;s exchange rate , causing an increase in Mexico &apos;s currently very attractive labor costs . 
Or the US could slip into recession ( though modest growth is certainly the central scenario nowadays ) . 
Then there is the matter of security , which constitutes a huge tax on business in many parts of Mexico . 
For example , one important achievement of former President Felipe Calderón &apos;s administration was to push through a 140-mile highway connecting the interior city of Durango and the Pacific port at Mazatlán . 
Traversing extremely rough terrain with 200 tunnels and bridges , it promises to cut the transit time by three or four hours . 
Except for the weather , the highway has the feel of Switzerland . 
But the new road has raised concerns , particularly in the US , that it could serve as a smuggling route for drugs and weapons , so the military feels obliged to set up checkpoints . 
Unfortunately , early anecdotal evidence suggests that these safeguards may ultimately slow down traffic by roughly the same amount of time that the project was meant to speed it up ! 
Mexican leaders acknowledge the country &apos;s internal problems , but place three of them at America &apos;s doorstep . 
First and foremost , the US generates the huge demand for illicit drugs that sustains the entire Latin American mafia , just as the US experiment with alcohol prohibition in the 1920 &quot; s fueled the rise of gangsters like Al Capone . 
No one knows precisely the Mexican drug cartels &quot; annual profits , but they certainly amount to billions of dollars . 
Second , the US , with its incredibly lax restrictions on gun purchases , serves as a veritable arms depot for rich Mexican drug lords . 
True , they could arguably acquire similar weapons elsewhere , but not necessarily as cheaply and conveniently . 
Finally , the US could do more to curtail money laundering . 
One simple step would be to restrict the circulation of $ 100 bills , which are mostly used in the underground economy . 
Many of the problems that characterize the complex US-Mexican relationship will be ameliorated if Mexico can sustain rapid economic growth . 
Net immigration to the US , which has already tapered off , might reverse . 
The US stands to benefit as much as Mexico if conditions south of the border begin breaking good .
