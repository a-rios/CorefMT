After Chernobyl 
KIEV : Chernobyl , the world &apos;s most notorious nuclear power plant , will be shut down today , fourteen years after it spewed clouds of radioactive dust into the atmosphere . 
Back then , Ukraine became the focus of global attention , but Ukrainians learned of the disaster much later than the rest of the world . 
I recall that fateful Saturday afternoon with utter clarity , strolling through Kiev with my six-year-old daughter , oblivious to the danger . 
Chernobyl changed Ukraine forever , and was a catalyst for the downfall of the Soviet Union . 
Ultimately , Chernobyl changed the world . 
Now that Chernobyl will be permanently shut down , world attention again turns to Ukraine , this time in hope , not fear . 
Shutting down a vital source of electrical energy , which Chernobyl remains , is no an easy task , particularly with winter upon us . 
Ukraine &apos;s energy infrastructure is weak ; losing 8-10 % of our electricity production and $ 100 million in revenues will strain the system even more . 
We also bear the responsibilities involved in laying off Chernobyl &apos;s workers and depriving the adjacent city of Slavutych ( population 28,000 ) , of its main source of income . 
Moreover , we must continue dealing with the technical and ecological issues surrounding the Chernobyl sarcophagus , as well as maintain nuclear safety in the remaining nuclear plants in operation in Ukraine , including what is left of Chernobyl . 
In recent years , Ukraine alone financed all the costs of dealing with the Chernobyl disaster , consistently spending 5-10 % of our state budget revenues to this end . 
Dealing with the aftermath of the disaster will remain a financial burden even with the plant closed . 
Yet closing the plant proves that we keep our promises . 
We committed to shut down Chernobyl this year in an agreement with the G-7 countries and the European Commission . 
Closure of the last remaining reactor at Chernobyl , I believe , must mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation with the European Union and G-7 countries . 
Closing Chernobyl may be the most dramatic , but it is only a single episode in our reform efforts . 
When we gained independence , the world expected great things from Ukraine . 
Over the course of a decade , the world appeared to forget about us . 
Now we finally have a chance to break out of the downward spiral of economic decline . 
At long last , our society and economy are set on the path to growth and development . 
After pro-reform forces secured victory in last year &apos;s presidential elections , all of the branches of government began cooperating to entrench democracy and the market economy in Ukraine . 
For the first time since independence , Ukraine recorded growth in industrial output of 12.5 % in the first 11 months of 2000 , and GDP has grown by 5.4 % this year . 
Tough decisions were made , not least involving the energy sector . 
Barter payments ,  -  which stifled the energy market  -  were eliminated . 
So too tax breaks and other privileges that skewed the playing field in favor of a select few . 
In the energy sector , we are privatizing state-owned energy distributors . 
To ensure complete transparency in the tender process , and eliminate problems experienced in the past , Western advisors are assisting us . 
For our intention is to attract large Western energy companies with experience in this field as strategic investors . 
Ten leading international energy companies , indeed , will participate in the privatization of the first group of companies . 
By the end of next year , we will privatize 12 additional energy companies . 
In its sheer scale , this may be the largest single energy privatization ever attempted in Europe . 
Our energy companies service a territory the size of France ; they will all be privatized . 
Of course , these reforms are resisted , primarily by the oligarchs who thrive on a lack of transparency and use privileged access to state resources to enhance their business interests . 
By eliminating barter and requiring monetary payment , we curtailed their opportunities to profit at the state &apos;s expense . 
Although we can and will continue the fight against corruption , we cannot do everything alone . 
International support for our efforts is crucial . 
A positive sign here is the recent decision by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) to provide $ 215 million to complete the nuclear power stations at Rivne and Khmelnytsky , which will compensate for the loss of Chernobyl &apos;s generating capacity . 
Euroatom is also helping with a loan of $ 585 million to finance repairs at Ukraine &apos;s functioning nuclear power plants . 
In return , Ukraine will uphold its end of the deal : in addition to closing Chernobyl , we will introduce Western nuclear safety standards and renew cooperation with the IMF via the Extended Fund Facility program . 
We still need other potential creditors to confirm their involvement . 
Closing Chernobyl will not eliminate the Chernobyl threat . 
Our people will be unable to live on thousands of acres of contaminated earth for hundreds of years . 
The concrete sarcophagus built over the destroyed reactor must be renovated . 
We are grateful to all the donor countries who , with contributions from our own state budget , helped raise the $ 760 million needed to make the sarcophagus safer . 
In the end , Chernobyl &apos;s legacy does not belong solely to Ukraine , for ours is a country located in the heart of Europe . 
We are a European nation . 
We realize that no one will implement reforms for us . 
The West can , however , help speed up and facilitate our efforts , as it did with the closure of Chernobyl . 
Cooperation between Ukraine and the West , without a disaster to concentrate everyone &apos;s minds , will benefit all concerned .
