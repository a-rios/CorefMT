A Europe of Women ? 
PARIS - Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine for political change ? 
In economic-development circles , experience and common sense suggest that progress , accountability , and hard work start with and depend on women . 
Micro-credits , for example , are much more efficient when women receive and repay them . 
Perhaps because they bear children and must find the means to feed them , women are now perceived as the best and most determined &quot; agents of change . &quot; 
That seems to be as true now of European politics as it has been of economics in parts of Africa and Asia . 
The results of Italy &apos;s recent municipal elections could be a signal of an incipient electoral dynamic : it was women who voted Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s party out of power in Milan , a city that he has long controlled ( and the original seat of his power ) . 
No direct link exists between that result and the dramatic Dominique Strauss-Kahn scandal in New York , but in the immediate aftermath of DSK &apos;s arrest , Italian women and young voters decisively mobilized to defeat Berlusconi &apos;s party ( led in Milan , ironically , by a woman ) . 
These voters could no longer stand the combination of machismo and vulgarity that had once served so well the man Italian humorists now call &quot; Berlus-Kahn . &quot; 
When Berlusconi first came to power 17 years ago , he had the support of a majority of women . 
They were not discouraged by his ambivalent perception of them ( by turns celebrating their traditional domesticity and glorifying their sexual objectification ) . 
Italian men may pity the aging , isolated leader , who looks increasingly like his wax effigy at Madame Tussaud &apos;s . 
Women , of course , are not alone in their opposition to Berlusconi , but they made the difference in Milan . 
They are the incarnation of modernity , animated by a yearning for simple dignity and respect . 
They are not alone in the vanguard of a new Europe of women . 
As Iceland spiraled into bankruptcy , owing the irresponsible behavior of its mostly male political and financial elites , the people of Iceland decided that only a strong and responsible woman could redress the country &apos;s problems . 
The depth and gravity of the current economic and social crisis in countries like Greece , Portugal , and Spain present women with a new opportunity . 
Confronted with what many of them perceive as the equivalent of an &quot; economic war , &quot; women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families &quot; financial security . 
Of course , women &apos;s changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence . 
Similarly , regardless of the outcome of DSK &apos;s trial in New York , the case might represent a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe . 
Public and private displays of atavistic machismo , one hopes , will no longer be considered acceptable . 
In the Arab world , too , from Tunis to Cairo , young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process . 
Their appetite for change - understandable , given the treatment of women in traditional Muslim societies - appears to be one of the main causes underlying the force of the revolutionary impulse in Tunisia and Egypt . 
None of this is to argue that &quot; women &quot; are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world . 
Consider , for example , Marine Le Pen , the new head of France &apos;s National Front , Elena Ceaucescu , the sordid wife of the former Romanian dictator , or , more recently , Tunisian ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali &apos;s wife , Leila Trabelsi , who fled to Dubai with 1.5 tons of gold plundered from the central bank . 
The point , simply , is that with so many people in so many countries demanding far-reaching change , the politics of gender is very much in play - in Europe and beyond . 
The main question is whether the growing number of women in politics will deliver the different perspectives and modes of leadership that many voters ( or protesters ) now seem to crave .
