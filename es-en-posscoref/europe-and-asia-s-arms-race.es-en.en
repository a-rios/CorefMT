Europe and Asia &apos;s Arms Race 
When European unification was launched , it was thought that &quot; ever closer union &quot; would establish a community that would protect Europeans from political blackmail . 
Now we see - though the lifting of the Union &apos;s arms embargo may now be delayed thanks to US pressure and Chinese aggressiveness - that the European Union has become merely a tool for corruption when France and China draw up joint action plans . 
The strategy is simple and ruthless . 
The world &apos;s largest dictatorship is preparing to crush and occupy the first Chinese democracy in history - Taiwan . 
In order to do so , the People &apos;s Republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those it possesses today . 
The United States naturally does not export such arms to China . Instead , the US is trying to deter China &apos;s rulers from launching a military attack on the democrats in Taiwan . 
But if the EU ever begins to offer China extensive exports of powerful and offensive weapons systems , the military power of the People &apos;s Liberation Army would be able to defeat Taiwan &apos;s defense forces . 
Over 600 missiles , already deployed on the mainland , are aimed at cities and military bases on the island . 
The threat is more apparent than real - for now . 
Russia currently sells certain arms to China , but avoids exporting its most sophisticated systems , since the Kremlin views China as a potential future threat . 
However , if EU countries start competing for a share of the Chinese market , the Russians could soon be tempted to sell their best arms to the communist regime in Beijing . 
China &apos;s new armaments , together with the North Korean crisis , will probably force half a dozen countries in the region to renew their armed forces . 
Thus , by whenever the Union should decide to lift its ban on weapons exports to China , the EU could help fuel an arms race in East Asia . 
How did China and France manage to fool the EU into thinking that it should ever take part in this ? 
When Jacques Chirac &apos;s government decided to expound its economic co-operation with China , arms became an important component in the strategy . 
Just as a ruthless Prime Minister Chirac sold a nuclear reactor to Saddam Hussein in the 1970 &quot; s , so the President Chirac of today is being lured into doing big business with another aggressive dictatorship . 
The rest is a question of economic blackmail . 
French diplomats have of course informed China about the reluctance of other European countries about lifting the arms embargo , which was imposed after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989 . 
China then simply threatened to abandon or never to conclude trade deals with these EU members . 
To the Germans , the Chinese probably murmur something about Siemens and Volkswagen . 
To the Dutch their whispers are most likely about Philips . 
China follows the power game within the EU through its French friends , and therefore knows which governments need to be whipped into line . 
In Sweden , it has probably been enough to whisper &quot; Ericsson &quot; and &quot; Volvo &quot; to make Primer Minister GÃ¶ran Persson understand what is at stake for his country commercially . 
What European nation , indeed , dares to put at risk a Chinese order for several billion euros ? 
Typically enough , no EU-country has mentioned Taiwan as a reason not to resume arms exports . 
Instead , the EU talks of a &quot; code of conduct &quot; ( which probably does not mean very much , but sounds nice ) and &quot; free trade &quot; ( another charming euphemism for arms exports to dictatorships . 
This silence gives a hideous signal . 
For what the EU in practice says to China is this : &quot; Taiwan &apos;s cause in not our own . &quot; 
If and when the Union lifts the embargo , Europe will be refusing to take responsibility for the catastrophe that may be approaching . 
As usual , it is up to America to protect a free nation that may otherwise be destroyed . 
Compare this situation to the drama 60 years ago . 
Then it was American troops and arms that liberated Western Europe from Nazism . 
Now it may be European arms in the hands of the Chinese that will be aimed at American troops protecting a democracy with 23 million inhabitants ( in other words , as many people as in all the Nordic countries combined ) . 
As Tom Lantos , a Democratic US Congressman from California , put it , the move to lift the ban on arms exports to China clearly shows that the EU has &quot; lost its moral compass . &quot; 
Lantos knows about moral compasses : as a boy , he was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg from being deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis in Budapest . 
Wallenberg was a Swede . 
Several friends of mine in the Conservative party &apos;s parliamentary group have long been engaged in supporting a free Taiwan . 
Over the past ten years , we have held Scandinavian conferences on Taiwan in the parliaments in Copenhagen , Oslo , and Stockholm . 
But a call from Prime Minister Persson was enough to render the Conservative party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt docile . 
Persson had discovered that he lacked a majority in the Swedish parliament to lift the arms embargo on China . 
By whispering &quot; Ericsson &quot; into Reinfeldt &apos;s ear , it seems , Persson achieved the desired result . 
Reinfeldt became the first Conservative party leader in Swedish history to encourage arms exports to a Communist dictatorship . 
But Reinfeldt , like Jacques Chirac , has forgotten something . 
Liberal-minded people may very well prefer not just to exchange one cynical prime minister for another at the next election . 
They may prefer a clear choice .
