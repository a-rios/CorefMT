Turning the Corner in Eastern Europe 
LONDON - There are various kinds of facts , the Russian satirist Mikhail Saltykov- Shchedrin once quipped : &quot; There are convenient facts and inconvenient ones ; and there are some that aren &apos;t even facts . &quot; 
As we enter 2010 , a convenient fact is that the world economy has stopped its dramatic decline and started to recover . 
An inconvenient fact is that the recovery remains fragile . 
On the contrary , serious challenges remain , and they must be addressed with urgency . 
The region covered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - Central , Eastern and South-Eastern Europe , Russia , the Caucasus and Central Asia - has been hit particularly hard by the financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 . 
Massive and determined state intervention ( Russia and Kazakhstan ) , or unprecedented coordinated support by international financial institutions ( Ukraine , Hungary , and Latvia ) , has been necessary to prevent even more dramatic falls . 
As the real economy adjusts to changed circumstances and much weaker domestic and global demand , we at the EBRD expect an increase in non-performing loans in our region . 
In addition , companies will be forced to restructure in order to cut costs and increase competitiveness . 
As credit markets remain squeezed , retaining liquidity , and rolling over and refinancing debt , will also pose serious challenges . 
Credit growth has already fallen close to zero in many countries and is contracting in many others as debts levels are reduced for households and companies . 
In addition , some governments in the region are under the double pressure of having to reduce their budget deficits and pay back debt ; precious little will be left for expenditure that could stimulate economic activity , such as investments in infrastructure or energy efficiency . 
All this will put further strain on the financial sector , which to a large degree in Central and Eastern Europe is owned by major Western banking groups . 
Thanks to a coordinated effort by all major players under the Vienna Initiative , these banks &quot; large-scale withdrawal - with potentially far-reaching consequences for the region - was averted in 2009 . 
Another unresolved issue is the foreign-currency burden that many financial institutions still carry . 
Many local currencies in the EBRD region ( such as the Hungarian forint , the Ukrainian hryvnia , and the Russian ruble ) have suffered severe depreciation since in the last quarter of 2008 . 
In Hungary , for example , foreign-currency lending amounted to 34 % of the country &apos;s GDP at the end of June 2008 . 
With such vulnerability to adverse currency movements , Hungary was forced four months later to sign an IMF-led rescue package worth $ 25 billion as the financial crisis reached Eastern Europe . 
One answer to this challenge is to strengthen domestic capital markets . 
This will be one of the EBRD &apos;s strategic priorities in 2010 . 
We intend to take a two-pronged approach : significantly increase our local-currency lending and explore new avenues within the framework of the Vienna Initiative to tackle the crisis and prevent its recurrence . 
Developing local-currency capital markets is a long-term endeavor that requires the commitment and resolve of a larger group of players . 
Drawing on our experience with the Vienna Initiative , we have seen that there are crucial benefits to be gained from coordinating our efforts and involving the private sector as much as possible . 
One element that central banks and regulators frequently mention is a new regulatory regime : the crisis revealed that institutional and regulatory frameworks in the EBRD region need to be reformed to introduce macro-prudential standards more systematically and effectively . 
These could include higher capital or provisioning requirements as buffers for more difficult times , or the stipulation of liquidity standards and special requirements for systemically important banks in order to avoid a recurrence of the &quot; too big to fail &quot; dilemma that many countries - not only in the EBRD region - have been facing . 
It is , however , beyond doubt that in a financially integrated Europe , attempts at new and better regulation will be effective only if such reforms are not limited to the national level . 
International solutions are critical to prevent cross-border &quot; regulatory arbitrage &quot; - for example , the circumvention of host-country regulation by borrowing directly from the parent bank . 
International financial institutions such as the EBRD and supranational bodies such as the European Union and the G-20 will play a key role in tackling such challenges in coming years . 
Within the framework of enhanced and improved integration and cooperation , we will have to find solutions to put recovery on a safer and more sustainable footing . 
As Saltykov- Shchedrin would say : convenient or not , that is a fact .
