President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina is often portrayed as an anti-capitalist radical for proposing a &quot; haircut &quot; of over 90 % on the value of Argentina &apos;s defaulted external debt . 
Economic development involves financial flows and the buildup of debt . 
In a domestic setting , bankruptcy and default are common . 
Indeed , one characteristic sign of economic vitality is the frequency of bankruptcy , for business failures indicate a willingness to gamble and take risks on innovation . 
Today , there is a higher level of bankruptcy in the United States than in the European Union , and it is easier for bankrupt Americans to embark on new ventures . 
As a result , Americans are more prepared to be innovative . 
But in the history of international finance over the past sixty years , bankruptcy and default are almost unheard of . 
One consequence is that international markets are not as dynamic as they might be , and prosperity not as widespread . 
In the 19th century , and in the interwar and depression years of the 20th century , international default came in buckets . 
Borrowing countries such as Argentina or the Ottoman Empire regularly defaulted . 
They were then punished for a few years by not having access to international capital markets . 
Lenders to defaulting countries were also punished , as their instruments ( mostly bonds ) became worthless . 
The market thus punished bad risks . 
In some cases , as in the Ottoman Empire or Egypt , creditors restructured finances by force or the threat of it . 
Argentina , for example , reached a voluntarily negotiated agreement in 1893 . 
Such a system worked as long as events in one country did not have a negative impact on other borrowers and there was no systemic risk or systemic contagion . 
When Argentina defaulted in the 1890 &apos;s , European investors simply discovered a new fashion : investment in Russia . 
After Russia &apos;s crisis of 1901 , investors turned to the US and Australia . 
The Great Depression of the late 1920 &apos;s and early 1930 &apos;s put an end to such behavior , which was suitable for a moderately crisis-prone world . 
Crises were no longer moderate . 
The defaults of that time were not confined to one country , but swept across the globe in a contagious panic that destroyed financial systems in lending as well as borrowing countries . 
Politicians reacted by devising an international financial system after WWII in which default and bankruptcy were more or less impossible . 
Since there were no substantial capital flows for a long time , this did not matter at first . 
Then , in the 1970 &apos;s , capital flows started up again , and there were again threats to the stability of the system . 
Latin America had a big debt crisis that broke out in 1982 , but in fact there were almost no defaults ( with the exception of Peru and , for a few months in late 1987 , Brazil ) . 
Instead of defaulting , countries arranged rescue packages with the IMF . 
Money from the international financial institutions was complemented by new money that creditor banks were supposed to put up as part of the price of being &quot; rescued &quot; by the IMF . 
The IMF was given a privileged legal position , and only devastated and wrecked &quot; failed states &quot; such as Sudan would default on loans from the Fund . 
The notion of &quot; concerted lending &quot; was applied in the big Mexican crisis of 1994-95 and in the East Asian crisis of 1997-8 . 
The whole point of crisis management was to avoid risks to the system and thus bankruptcy . 
But in the second half of the 1990 &apos;s , this system began to unravel . 
The sums required from the international financial institutions were so large that it began to be possible for currency speculators to envisage circumstances in which there would be no help . 
Private-sector lending became hard to mobilize , because there were many more creditors than in the bank-dominated world of the 1980 &apos;s , when negotiations could be conducted by just a few big players . 
The first major shock came with Russia &apos;s default and devaluation of August 1998 . 
After that , the IMF began to encourage some countries to renegotiate debt rather than seek new money , at least if they were relatively small scale borrowers such as Ukraine or Pakistan and thus could not endanger the whole system . 
The second major shock came with Argentina &apos;s currency collapse of 2002-3 , after which Argentina &apos;s government demanded an extremely large debt write-off . 
Argentina &apos;s other threat , not to repay the IMF , challenged the old system just as profoundly and seemed for some to be a justified response to years of bad policy advice from the IMF and the G-7 countries . 
In the 21st century , we are returning to the ways of the 19th century . 
Our aim should be to invent financial mechanisms for segmenting and spreading risk , so that one bad case no longer has the potential to destroy the whole system . 
By being less concerned with preventing default , we can make risk and reward more congruent with each other . 
Creditors in cases like that of Argentina need to be made to pay a penalty . 
Argentina &apos;s current actions may drive us back to the 19th century more quickly than some investors would like .
