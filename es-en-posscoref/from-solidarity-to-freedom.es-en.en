From Solidarity to Freedom 
Although the rise 25 years ago of Solidarity , the first independent civic movement in the former Soviet empire , had huge political consequences , Solidarity was , primarily , neither a political movement nor a labor union . 
First and foremost , Solidarity was a cry of dignity . 
We simply had reached the end of our endurance with the omnipresent and all-powerful communist apparatchiks who ruled in our workplaces , neighborhoods , even places of rest . 
Writers , journalists , and artists could no longer stand the heavy-handed censorship and supervision . 
In factories as well , Party bureaucrats wanted to know everything and decide everything . 
Every civic initiative , every activity of any kind was subject to ideological evaluation and control . 
All who were tempted to disobey were certain to be &quot; taken care of &quot; by the secret police . 
Last winter , I saw a similar cry for dignity in Ukraine . 
Those hundreds of thousands of people who camped for weeks on the freezing streets of Kiev did so because they were demanding their dignity . 
Both the Polish and the Ukrainian experiences have convinced me that the will to live in dignity is the most powerful engine of human action , an engine that is capable of overcoming even the greatest fear . 
But the desire for dignity is not enough to secure it . 
Something else is needed as well . 
Second , Solidarity was a social movement . 
Some passionately discussed economic reform , others talked about developing culture , while still others planned to reform education and the scientific establishment or assure the defense of the environment . 
Solidarity created a public space for all of these discussions , while protecting us all against the party apparatus . 
But Solidarity was still something more . 
It was a Polish version of the ancient Greek agora , a meeting place of all citizens , a locus of a free conversation about our communal and individual future , about all kinds of problems and their solutions . 
We did not yet have a free state , but we already had something more important than that : a free civil society engaged in discussing the common condition of its members . 
The society embraced by Solidarity counted 10 million members ; indeed , 10 million real citizens . 
Third , Solidarity was an institution ; indeed , a unique one given the conditions under which we lived , and it is to its special institutional form that we owe our ultimate victory . 
Between the organizational structure of Solidarity and the official state and party organizations there was what might be called a &quot; gap between civilizations . &quot; 
Against the authoritarian and hierarchical structures of the regime , we raised a decentralized institution , a huge organism striving to achieve consensus about its aims and the methods of action . 
It was an institution committed to respecting the integrity of all individuals and all other institutions . 
This may not be extraordinary in old democratic communities ; but in our authoritarian environment , it was strikingly new . 
So what is left of all this today ? 
To be sure , Solidarity achieved a stunning political success . 
Poland is a free country , a member of NATO and of the EU , while the Soviet Union is no more . 
But recent history has not been kind to the victors . 
The leaders of the democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe quickly faded in the new environment . 
Democratic elections brought out new and savvier politicians , often from among those who were part of the old regime . 
More strikingly , some of our hopes for a new social order also crashed against the rocks of the new rules of the game . 
True , Poland &apos;s democratic institutions , despite their flaws , function rather well . 
Economic growth has been impressive , and life is definitely getting better . 
But the vibrancy of civil society , the sense of common purpose , the universal manifestations of social solidarity that our union stood for in its time - all these things are largely gone . 
The union itself is a shell of its own former self , a partisan and mostly right-wing movement of workers buffeted by the new economic reality . 
Most notably , the unifying character of Solidarity gave way to social divisions and , among many of Poland &apos;s people , a large dose of alienation from both politics and civic engagements . 
Is this what normalcy always means ? 
Do heady times of struggle always give way to a somewhat deflating taste of victory ? 
Am I merely a veteran wistfully reminiscing about the old days of struggle ? 
Perhaps . 
I know that we have come a long way , and I do not want to go back .
