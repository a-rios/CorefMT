The Big Blink 
CHICAGO - World growth is likely to remain subdued over the next few years , with industrial countries struggling to repair household and government balance sheets , and emerging markets weaning themselves off of industrial-country demand . 
As this clean-up from the Great Recession continues , one thing is clear : the source of global demand in the future will be the billions of consumers in Africa , China , and India . But it will take time to activate that demand , for what is now being produced around the world for industrial-country consumers cannot simply be shipped to emerging-market consumers , especially the poorer ones among them . 
If we want to talk about billions of new consumers , rather than the tens of millions who have incomes similar to the middle classes in industrial countries , we must recognize that many emerging-market consumers have much lower incomes than industrial-country consumers , and live in vastly different conditions . 
Their needs are different , and producers around the world have , until recently , largely ignored them . 
But times are changing . 
Increasingly , producers are focusing on people who , if not at the bottom of the income pyramid , comprise the vast numbers nearer the base . 
For example , an Indian company , Godrej , is making an innovative refrigerator targeted at poor villagers . 
Village women typically are forced to cook multiple times during the day because the food that they prepare in the morning spoils in the heat . 
They would like to be able to refrigerate uneaten food , which would limit waste as well as time spent cooking . 
Unfortunately , with electricity supply intermittent even when available , compressor-based electric refrigerators , which consume a lot of power , have not been an option . 
Godrej &apos;s engineers observed that if the objective was only to keep food from spoiling , and not necessarily to make ice , it would be sufficient if the refrigerator cooled to a few degrees above zero centigrade . 
This would allow the use of a less power-hungry fan instead of a compressor , and the fan could run on batteries rather than relying on the power grid . 
This is the kind of frugally engineered product that can create enormous new consumer demand in emerging markets . 
Companies in the industrial world are taking note . 
General Electric , for example , is cutting down the functions provided by its medical equipment to only what is strictly useful in order to supply remote rural clinics across the developing world . 
&quot; Just-enough &quot; functionality makes the equipment affordable without compromising quality . 
Over the next decade , growth in this kind of developing-country demand will help offset the slow growth of demand in industrial countries . 
But the process cannot be rushed . 
Unfortunately , with high levels of unemployment in industrial countries , policymakers want to do something - anything - to increase growth fast . 
The aggressive policies that they are following , however , could jeopardize the process of adjustment . 
Consider the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s foray into quantitative easing . 
Clearly , the Fed &apos;s objective is to increase bond prices , in the hope that lower long-term interest rates will propel corporate investment . 
In addition , the Fed hopes that lower long-term interest rates will push up asset prices , giving households more wealth and greater incentive to spend . 
Finally , by demonstrating a willingness to print money , the Fed hopes to increase inflationary expectations from their current low levels . 
Even though the markets seem to be anticipating substantial levels of quantitative easing , US corporate investment remains subdued . 
And US households seem wary of splurging again as they did in the past , no matter how wealthy they feel . 
The Fed has , however , succeeded in enhancing expectations of inflation in the US . 
With its anticipated bond purchases keeping a lid on interest rates , the net effect is that investors do not see an adequate real return from holding dollar assets , which is perhaps one reason the dollar has been depreciating . 
Emerging markets are worried because they believe that the Fed &apos;s ultra-aggressive monetary policy will have little effect in expanding US domestic demand . 
Instead , it will shift demand towards US producers , much as direct foreign-exchange intervention would . 
In other words , quantitative easing seems to be as effective a method of depreciating the dollar as selling it in currency markets would be . 
Because they know that it will take time for domestic demand to pick up , emerging markets are unwilling to risk a collapse in exports to the US by allowing their currencies to strengthen against the dollar too quickly . 
They are resisting appreciation through foreign-exchange intervention and capital controls . 
As a result , we might not see steady growth of demand in emerging markets . 
Instead , excess liquidity and fresh asset bubbles could emerge in the world &apos;s financial and housing markets , impeding , if not torpedoing , growth . 
In the ongoing showdown over currencies , who will blink first ? 
The US ( and other industrial countries ) could argue that it has high levels of unemployment and should be free to adopt policies that boost growth , even at the expense of growth in emerging markets . 
These countries , in turn , could argue that even very poor US households are much better off than the average emerging-market household . 
Rather than bickering about who has the stronger case , it would be better if all sides compromised - if everyone blinked simultaneously . 
The US should dial back its aggressive monetary policy , focusing on repairing its own economy &apos;s structural problems , while emerging markets should respond by allowing their exchange rates to appreciate steadily , thereby facilitating the growth of domestic demand . 
Is it too much to hope that the G-20 can achieve such a commonsensical compromise ?
