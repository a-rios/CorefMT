The Gallic Heart of Europe 
MADRID ‒ Europe needs a France that is proud , prosperous , and able to overcome its gloomy suspicions . 
We need the great country that was and will be - the France that inspired the entire world with its revolution , culture , and values . 
Alain Peyrefitte , the scholar , politician , and confidant of Charles de Gaulle , said that &quot; without Europe , France will be nothing &quot; ; but , without France , Europe , too , would be nothing . 
In this year of anniversaries , it is worth reflecting on France &apos;s future . 
On July 14 , France &apos;s national holiday , which this year marked the 225th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille , Algerian soldiers paraded down the Champs-Élysées for the first time since Algeria &apos;s war for independence a half-century ago , a moving symbol of historic transcendence . 
It has also been one hundred years since the outbreak of the First World War , and 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall quickly led to German reunification . 
Europe has changed much since then . 
Twenty-five years ago , France and the Federal Republic of Germany had similar populations of about 60 million inhabitants ( like Italy and the United Kingdom ) . 
German reunification added more than 16 million new citizens from the former East Germany , making the enlarged Federal Republic the most populous country in the European Union by far . 
This upset the balance of the Franco-German axis around which the EU as a whole had long turned . 
To avoid negative political consequences , Germany agreed to be underrepresented in weighted voting on EU matters - an imbalance in its own right that was not substantially corrected until the Lisbon Treaty entered into effect in 2009 . 
Over time , and in a process accentuated by the recent economic crisis , size and economic might meant that Germany began to set the tempo of European affairs . 
Today , Germany has clearly become the point of reference for shaping policy on the most important issues facing the EU . 
But the logic of how Europe was constructed requires that France complement Germany - and now that other major EU countries , including Italy , Spain , the United Kingdom , and Poland , do so as well . 
Indeed , today &apos;s Europe can no longer be the two-country affair - if it ever was that ‒ of 30 years ago . 
But , for many of the EU member states , France remains a model . 
So when France suffers , Europe suffers . 
Healing Europe and healing France are two parts of the same equation , with the same unknowns in play . 
Because of its very relevance , historical heft , and cultural baggage , France mistrusts the changes taking place around it - as though the weight of its nationhood were keeping it from taking flight and narrowing its horizons . 
But no country today can remain isolated from globalization , tame it , or lead it alone . 
So France must look again to Europe , which in turn needs both France and Germany if it is to be balanced and successful . 
France is still burdened by the consequences of its &quot; no &quot; vote in 2005 on the proposed European Constitution - clearly not its finest hour . 
Ten years on , France should not be afraid of exchanging some of its sovereignty for political union in Europe . 
On the contrary , France should be one of the leaders of that effort , adding its voice and centrality as a country halfway between Europe &apos;s north and south and acting as a model for many other countries on social issues . 
Just as Germany took a step forward by giving up its Deutshce Mark in favor of the euro , France must evolve beyond the classical framework of the nation-state . 
As Germany &apos;s economic preponderance translates into greater political power , it becomes increasingly important to supplement this with France &apos;s unique point of view . 
This is particularly true in view of today &apos;s unstoppable progress toward closer economic integration , which will lead , happily or haphazardly , to greater political integration . 
France &apos;s solid economic foundation furnishes it with the means to face up to the reforms that it urgently needs . 
Its per capita income is more than € 30,000 ( $ 40,000 ) per year , and it has a strong welfare state and an educated society . 
Yet its GDP growth is stagnant . 
Europe and the world cannot afford to allow dynamic France to succumb to static France , the France that resists all change . 
For example , France &apos;s cooperation on the construction of a common European market for energy is crucial for Spain ; indeed , this relationship could be enormously beneficial both for France and all of Europe . 
France should consider Europe its own . 
French republican values find their expression in the EU . 
Liberty , equality , and fraternity are enemies of the nationalist , extremist , and europhobic visions benighting Europe today . 
These dark visions must be met with France &apos;s commitment to integration , the rule of law , and secularism . 
France has taken on important international commitments recently that all must appreciate , with the hope that France &apos;s political , economic , and social reawakening continues . 
There should be no U-turn in the course toward modernization , especially now , when political forces that exploit fear and hatred are on the rise , betraying republican values . 
This is the moment for France , along with the rest of Europe , to overcome its pessimism , doubt , and mistrust .
