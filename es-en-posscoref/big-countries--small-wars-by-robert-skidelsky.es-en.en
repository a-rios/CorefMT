Big Countries , Small Wars 
LONDON - US President Barack Obama has vowed to avenge the murder of J. Christopher Stevens , America &apos;s former ambassador to Libya . 
How he proposes to do this is unclear - historical precedent is of little use . 
In 1864 , the Emperor of Abyssinia took hostage the British consul , together with some missionaries , in the country &apos;s then-capital , Magdala . 
Three years later , with Emperor Tewodros still refusing to release them , the British dispatched an expeditionary force of 13,000 troops , 26,000 camp followers , and 44 elephants . 
In his book The Blue Nile , Alan Moorehead described the expedition thus : &quot; It proceeds first to last with the decorum and heavy inevitability of a Victorian state banquet , complete with ponderous speeches . &quot; 
Yet it was a fearsome undertaking . 
After a three-month journey through the mountains , the British reached Magdala , released the hostages , and burned the capital to the ground . 
Emperor Tewodros committed suicide , the British withdrew , and their commander , Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier , was made Baron Napier of Magdala . 
Today &apos;s great powers have relied on similar methods , also heavy with rhetoric , against puny opponents , but with far less convincing results . 
The United States put 500,000 troops into Vietnam in the 1960 &quot; s , but withdrew before North Vietnam overran the South in 1975 . 
The Russians began pulling their 100,000 troops from Afghanistan in 1987 , after nine years of fighting had failed to subdue the country . 
Now , 25 years and $ 500 billion later , roughly 100,000 NATO troops , mainly American , are about to leave Afghanistan , with the Taliban still controlling much of it . 
Meanwhile , the US has withdrawn 150,000 troops from Iraq , after nine years of frustration . 
The evidence is clear : big countries can lose small wars . 
So , if massive use of force fails , how is a big country , believing that its interests or moral duty compel it to intervene in the affairs of a small one , to do so successfully ? 
Gillo Pontecorvo &apos;s brilliant 1966 film The Battle of Algiers spelled out the dilemma for the occupying colonial power . 
The FLN ( National Liberation Front ) uprising against French rule in Algeria started in 1954 with assassinations of policemen . 
In 1957 , the French sent in paratroopers . 
Their commander in the film , Colonel Mathieu ( based on General Jacques Massu ) , explained the logic of the situation from the French point of view . 
Eliminate that and the result would be a leaderless mass . 
This required the use of torture to identify and locate the leaders , followed by their capture or assassination . 
Torture was illegal , but , as the Colonel explained , &quot; If you want France to stay , you must accept the consequences . &quot; 
Colonel Mathieu is the unsung hero of current counter-insurgency orthodoxy , which requires a minimum military presence in the target country , mainly of intelligence agencies like the CIA and &quot; special forces . &quot; 
Through &quot; rendition , &quot; a captured suspect can be handed over to a friendly government to be tortured , and , on the basis of the information thus gathered , &quot; kill lists &quot; can be compiled . 
The killing of Osama bin Laden last year required an actual hit squad to verify its success , but normally assassinations can be left to drones - unmanned aircraft , mainly used for surveillance , but which can be armed with computer-guided missiles . 
Not surprisingly , the US is the leading developer and user of drones , with a fleet of 7,500 . 
An estimated 3,000 drone killings have taken place , mostly in Pakistan , but also in Yemen and Somalia . 
The other half of the counter-insurgency strategy is to win the &quot; hearts and minds &quot; of populations that are susceptible to terrorist propaganda . 
The Americans did this in Vietnam by pouring in consumer goods and building up infrastructure . 
The civilian side of &quot; nation building , &quot; it is reckoned , will be made easier by the absence of a heavy-handed foreign military presence . 
Trying to win hearts and minds is certainly an improvement over bombing or shooting up the local population . But the new way of conducting &quot; asymmetrical warfare &quot; does raise uncomfortable ethical and legal issues . 
The United Nations Convention on Torture explicitly forbids &quot; cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment , &quot; so their use must be denied . 
Also , assassination by drones inevitably leads to the killing of innocent civilians - the very crime that defines terrorism . 
Even putting aside moral and legal questions - which one should never do - it is doubtful whether the strategy of torture and assassination can achieve its pacifying purpose . 
It repeats the mistake made in 1957 by Massu , who assumed that he faced a cohesive organization with a single command structure . 
Relative calm was restored to Algiers for a couple of years after his arrival , but then the insurgency broke out again with redoubled strength , and the French had to leave the country in 1962 . 
Today , the international community similarly misconceives the nature of the &quot; war &quot; that it is fighting . 
There is no single worldwide terrorist organization with a single head . 
Insofar as Al Qaeda still exists at all , it is a Hydra that sprouts new heads as fast as the old ones are cut off . 
Trying to win &quot; hearts and minds &quot; with Western goods simply corrupts , and thus discredits , the governments established by those intervening . 
It happened in Vietnam , and it is happening now in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
We are being driven slowly but ineluctably to the realization that the people whom we are fighting will , to a significant extent , inherit the shattered countries that we leave behind . 
Blame the French Revolution for having bequeathed to us the idea that self-government is always better than good government .
