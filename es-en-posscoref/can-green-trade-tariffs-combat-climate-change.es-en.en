Can Green Trade Tariffs Combat Climate Change ? 
BERKELEY - In recent months , China has taken center stage in the international debate over global warming . 
It has surpassed the United States as the world &apos;s largest source of greenhouse gases , and it became developing nations &quot; diplomatic champion at the recent United Nations climate negotiations in Bali . 
Now China may become the target of a full-fledged trade war that could destroy - or perhaps rescue - the chances of bringing rich and poor nations together to fight global warming . 
The focus on China intensified late last year , when new data from the International Energy Agency and other research organizations revealed that China had overtaken the US as the largest source of greenhouse gases - and , more ominously , that its emissions are growing at a rate that exceeds all wealthy nations &quot; capacity to decrease theirs . 
Even if China met its own targets for energy conservation , its emissions would increase by about 2.3 billion metric tons over the next five years - far larger than the 1.7 billion tons in cutbacks imposed by the Kyoto Protocol on the 37 developed &quot; Annex 1 &quot; countries , including the US . 
After the inconclusive end of the UN led Bali talks on the global environment , worry has grown among US and European industries - especially iron , steel , cement , glass , chemicals , and pulp and paper - that any new climate treaty would put them at a big disadvantage against their fast-growing competitors in China . 
In response , the US Congress is moving to create a system of trade sanctions that would levy heavy taxes on imports from other major greenhouse gas emitters . 
Ironically , the American plan is taking shape even before the US takes any action to reduce its own emissions , inviting charges of hypocrisy , violation of international law , and threatening a major trade war . 
The tariff proposal - contained in the central piece of global warming legislation now before Congress - would impose emission controls on domestic industries starting in 2012 . 
It would also levy punitive tariffs on greenhouse-gas-intensive products imported from countries that lack &quot; comparable action &quot; to that of the US , starting in 2020 . 
Industrial lobbies and labor unions are pushing hard for these sanctions to take effect more quickly . 
European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and industrial chambers of commerce strongly advocate a similar tariff system , leading many analysts to predict that the EU will also adopt some sort of green tariff system in the next few years . 
Warning of an &quot; all-out trade war &quot; if the sanctions go forward , US Trade Representative Susan Schwab argues that green trade sanctions would violate World Trade Organization rules . 
In a recent letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee , she wrote , &quot; We believe this approach could be a blunt and imprecise instrument of fear , rather than one of persuasion , that will take us down a dangerous path and adversely impact US manufacturers , farmers , and consumers . &quot; 
Developing nations &quot; allies , meanwhile , are warning that the sanctions plan could destroy the chances of a post-Kyoto treaty . 
Chinese diplomats have not responded directly , but they have noticeably hardened their stand on climate talks . 
In February , China &apos;s top climate negotiator , Yu Qingtai , said at the UN that rich nations , which &quot; caused the problem of climate change in the first place , &quot; must be treated as &quot; culprits , &quot; and developing countries as &quot; victims . &quot; 
Despite China &apos;s official hard line , some Chinese environmental officials privately express alarm at run-away carbon emissions , and suggest that foreign green tariffs would actually strengthen their hand in domestic policy struggles over controlling greenhouse gases by helping to win political support for emissions cuts . 
Pan Yue , vice-director of the State Environmental Protection Administration , recently argued in a China Daily article in favor of stronger emissions regulations and a more &quot; green-oriented China , &quot; warning that &quot; China &apos;s image among the international community &quot; was in jeopardy . 
The growing dispute over trade sanctions brings to the fore not only the fundamental ethical question of whether wealthy nations should bear the burden of emissions reduction alone , but also the strategic question of whether sticks as well as carrots should be used to induce green behavior in developing countries . 
Although China may not like it , the international trading system may provide more leverage than any other post-Kyoto mechanism over developing countries &quot; environmental policies . 
Despite the threat of trade wars , trade sanctions could emerge as the most effective means of forcing international action on global warming .
