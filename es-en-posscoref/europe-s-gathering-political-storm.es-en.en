Europe \ u0027s Gathering Political Storm 
Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos;s breakthrough in the French presidential elections is a slap in the face for mainstream French political parties , as well as a stark warning of the drawbacks of the constitution of the Fifth French Republic . 
But the lessons of Le Pen &apos;s rise go beyond the specifics of French politics , because far-right parties have been on the march in many European countries of late , from Austria to Portugal , from Italy to Denmark . 
The questions we must ask are , first , whether this upsurge of far-right , anti-immigrant , law-and-order parties is part of an evolving crisis in Europe &apos;s traditional model of parliamentary democracy ; and second , whether it represents the precursor of a major crisis about the future of the European Union . 
I believe the answer to both questions to be yes . 
On the surface , the crisis in France may seem short-lived . 
All mainstream parties are rallying round Jacques Chirac to keep out Monsieur Le Pen . 
In the second round of voting , Chirac will undoubtedly defeat Le Pen , possibly with a record majority . 
But the figures from the first round tell a different story . 
Chirac got less than 20 % of the vote ; 
Chirac , Le Pen , and the socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin , got little more than 50 % between them , and an unusually large number of voters stayed home . 
In short , France does not want any of these people to be President , and Chirac &apos;s large eventual victory will not correspond to any large degree of legitimacy . 
Moreover , the presidential election will not be the last word , since it will be followed by parliamentary elections . 
If the socialists can pull themselves together behind a new leader , President Chirac , despite re-election , could once again face a left-wing majority in parliament . 
What seems clear from Sunday &apos;s vote is that France &apos;s mainstream parties are enduring a crisis of legitimacy . 
Part of the problem is that most leading French politicians are tiresomely familiar and uninspiring . 
It is not just that Chirac is corrupt , or that Jospin is dull , but that they have been around for decades . 
But the deeper problem is that , in contrast with the populist simplicities of extremists like Le Pen , France &apos;s mainstream parties lack clear policies . 
When a politician goes to his electorate , he needs to be able to say what he wants to do and why ; and a party needs to have a program on which its members all more or less agree . 
Communism &apos;s collapse undermined the credibility of traditional left-wing ideologies , and the policy problems of national political parties have been made more difficult by the tidal wave of globalization . 
In the French presidential campaign , everyone knew what Le Pen stood for ; but neither Chirac nor Jospin had a clear program to offer , just vague , abstract generalities . 
Chirac did better , mainly because he was better at glad-handing voters . 
The French socialist party can still , probably , rely on the loyalty of a substantial minority for atavistic or tribal reasons ; but it does not propose to introduce socialism . 
On the contrary , everyone knows that Lionel Jospin &apos;s government pursued a slow , covert process of privatization and liberalization , because such a process is unavoidable in today &apos;s global economy . 
The dilemma is similar in all European parliamentary democracies which evolved to express some version of the left-right choice and which are now gasping for lack of oxygen . 
In Britain , Tony Blair &apos;s government claims to be &quot; New Labour . &quot; 
It is only recently , with a promise to spend more on the National Health Service , that it has started to return to its social-democratic roots . 
No doubt a key factor behind Le Pen &apos;s breakthrough is popular anxiety - especially among the old , the unemployed and the unskilled - about globalization and its pressures for change . 
These fears incite anger and xenophobia , even though everyone knows that globalization cannot be conquered by kicking out foreigners . 
What is most dismaying about the French presidential campaign is how little either mainstream leader had to say about Europe . 
After all , the EU has embarked on a year-long exercise which will likely culminate , at next year &apos;s end , in a new constitutional treaty for Europe . 
Not long after that , the EU will take in ten or more new members from Eastern Europe . 
The new constitution will take Europe in a more federal direction , which is essential if the Union is to function with 25 or 30 members and which implies serious adjustments in notions of national sovereignty . 
Enlargement , bringing in a large number of much poorer countries , will have a seismic effect on Union policies , implying losses of benefits in richer members . 
The next French president cannot control or prevent the forces of globalization ; but he can have a major influence on the EU &apos;s development . 
So what did Chirac and Jospin say on the subject ? 
Not a word . 
Why ? 
Because they fear the crises that lie ahead .
