Russia \ u0027s Great Gas Game 
BERLIN - Russia and the European Union are geopolitical neighbors . 
Whether or not their relationship is in fact neighborly , rather than tense and confrontational , is of critical importance to both . 
Unless it modernizes its economy and society , Russia can forget its claim to status as a world power in the twenty-first century and will continue to fall behind both old and newly emerging powers . 
Moreover , Russia needs partners for its modernization , because its population and economic potential are too small for it to play an important role by itself in the emerging new world order . 
Russia &apos;s strategic nuclear weapons will be insufficient to ensure it a place among first-rank powers . 
But where can Russia turn ? 
Towards East Asia ? 
To the south and the Islamic world ? 
Neither of these is a serious option . 
As it is , Russia can turn only towards the West , and to Europe in particular . 
For Europe , however , Russia &apos;s role is of critical strategic importance . 
Even a partial revision of the post-Soviet order in the direction of an increased Russian grip on ex-Soviet states or satellites would drastically change EU strategy and security policy . 
Both sides claim to want improved bilateral relations , but there is room for doubt about whether Russians and Europeans actually think about their relations in the same terms . 
A look beyond the cordial rhetoric reveals profound differences . 
When Russia &apos;s former president and current prime minister , Vladimir Putin , declared several years ago that the greatest disaster of the twentieth century was the demise of the Soviet Union , he didn &apos;t just speak for himself but arguably for the majority of Russia &apos;s political elite . 
The overwhelming majority of Europeans , however , probably view the USSR &apos;s breakup as a cause for celebration . 
Indeed , today &apos;s Russia avowedly seeks to reverse the post-Soviet order in Europe that emerged after 1989 / 1990 , at least in parts of its neighborhood , while the Europeans and the West want to maintain it at all costs . 
So long as Moscow doesn &apos;t understand these fundamental differences and draw the right conclusions from them , Europeans won &apos;t view Russia &apos;s opening towards the West as an opportunity , and Russia will always encounter deep mistrust in Europe . 
Russia today has retained its strength only as a supplier of energy and other natural resources . 
It is therefore no surprise that Putin has sought to use this lever to rebuild Russia &apos;s power and to revise the post-Soviet order . 
Russia &apos;s natural gas supplies to Europe play a vital role in this regard , because here , unlike in the case of oil , Russia &apos;s bargaining position is very strong . 
Even more importantly , its direct neighbors are either completely dependent on Russian gas supplies - Ukraine and Belarus - or , like Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan , are dependent on Russia &apos;s pipeline system to sell their gas output . Russia certainly pursues economic interests with its gas-export policy - all the more so when gas prices are trending down - and it wants to expand its role on the European gas market to intensify the dependencies that now exist . 
But this is unlikely : Russia &apos;s disruption of gas supplies in January 2009 made clear to the EU in no uncertain terms what price might have to be paid . 
That is why &quot; diversification of gas-supplier countries &quot; has since been EU policy - including , first and foremost , the Nabucco pipeline project , which would open a southern corridor between the Caspian Sea , Central Asia , northern Iraq , and Europe . 
Nabucco would reach Europe via Turkey and would drastically reduce Caspian supplier countries &quot; dependence on Russia &apos;s pipelines , and the new southeastern EU members &quot; dependence on Russian gas supplies . 
So it comes as no surprise that the Kremlin is trying to scupper Nabucco . 
Two other developments promise to prevent increased European dependence on Russia : massive expansion of liquefied gas imports into the EU and - linked to this and to deregulation of the European gas market - the transition from long-term supply agreements and the oil-price peg to market-dependent spot prices . 
Nonetheless , the primary goal of Russian gas policy isn &apos;t economic , but political , namely to further the aim of revising the post-Soviet order in Europe - a quest that is not about the EU as much as it is about Ukraine . 
Ukraine &apos;s new prime minister , Mykola Azarov , was stunned when Putin unexpectedly confronted him during a joint press conference with a suggestion to merge the Ukrainian and Russian gas companies . 
Unlike the Ukraine government &apos;s assent to extending the Russian Black Sea fleet &apos;s deployment in Crimea - a decision that led to physical violence in Ukraine &apos;s parliament - this was not a prolongation of the status quo , but a public demand for its revision . 
With the Nordstream pipeline in the Baltic and the exorbitantly expensive South Stream pipeline in the Black Sea , Russia is not just trying to create direct gas connections between Russia and the EU that bypass Ukraine and undermine Nabucco . 
The main goal is to put pressure on Ukraine , as well as on Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan , which want to supply Europe with gas independently of Russia . 
Once those aims are achieved and / or Nabucco goes ahead , South Stream will be shelved because it doesn &apos;t make economic sense . 
In Europe and the United States , this challenge has been understood . 
Now it is necessary to stand by those in Ukraine who see a European future for their country , to open the southern corridor via Nabucco , and to accelerate development of a common European energy market . 
A decisive European policy will improve , rather than strain , relations with Russia , because it will result in more clarity and predictability .
