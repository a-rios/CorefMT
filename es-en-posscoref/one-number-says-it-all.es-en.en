One Number Says it All 
NEW HAVEN - The number is 0.2 % . 
It is the average annualized growth of US consumer spending over the past 14 quarters - calculated in inflation-adjusted terms from the first quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2011 . 
Never before in the post-World War II era have American consumers been so weak for so long . 
This one number encapsulates much of what is wrong today in the US - and in the global economy . 
There are two distinct phases to this period of unprecedented US consumer weakness . 
From the first quarter of 2008 through the second period of 2009 , consumer demand fell for six consecutive quarters at a 2.2 % annual rate . 
Not surprisingly , the contraction was most acute during the depths of the Great Crisis , when consumption plunged at a 4.5 % rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 . 
As the US economy bottomed out in mid-2009 , consumers entered a second phase - a very subdued recovery . 
Annualized real consumption growth over the subsequent eight-quarter period from the third quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2011 averaged 2.1 % . 
That is the most anemic consumer recovery on record - fully 1.5 percentage points slower than the 12-year pre-crisis trend of 3.6 % that prevailed between 1996 and 2007 . 
These figures are a good deal weaker than originally stated . 
As part of the annual reworking of the US National Income and Product Accounts that was released in July 2011 , Commerce Department statisticians slashed their earlier estimates of consumer spending . 
The 14-quarter growth trend from early 2008 to mid-2011 was cut from 0.5 % to 0.2 % ; the bulk of the downward revision was concentrated in the first six quarters of this period - for which the estimate of the annualized consumption decline was doubled , from 1.1 % to 2.2 % . 
I have been tracking these so-called benchmark revisions for about 40 years . 
This is , by far , one of the most significant I have ever seen . 
We all knew it was tough for the American consumer - but this revision portrays the crisis-induced cutbacks and subsequent anemic recovery in a much dimmer light . 
The reasons behind this are not hard to fathom . 
By exploiting a record credit bubble to borrow against an unprecedented property bubble , American consumers spent well beyond their means for many years . 
When both bubbles burst , over-extended US households had no choice but to cut back and rebuild their damaged balance sheets by paying down outsize debt burdens and rebuilding depleted savings . 
Yet , on both counts , balance-sheet repair has only just begun . 
While household-sector debt was pruned to 115 % of disposable personal income in early 2011 from the peak of 130 % hit in 2007 , it remains well in excess of the 75 % average of the 1970-2000 period . 
And , while the personal saving rate rose to 5 % of disposable income in the first half of 2011 from the rock-bottom 1.2 % low hit in mid-2005 , this is far short of the nearly 8 % norm that prevailed during the last 30 years of the twentieth century . 
With retrenchment and balance-sheet repair only in its early stages , the zombie-like behavior of American consumers should persist . 
The 2.1 % consumption growth trend realized during the anemic recovery of the past two years could well be indicative of what lies ahead for years to come . 
Such an outcome would have three profound implications for the economic outlook : First , since consumer demand still accounts for 71 % of real GDP , a protracted shortfall in trend consumption represents a major headwind for overall US economic growth . 
The heavy artillery of monetary and fiscal stimulus is being wasted on attempts to short-circuit balance-sheet repair . 
Second , persistent weakness in consumption and GDP growth puts the US economy on a much weaker growth trajectory than that which is built into the government &apos;s long-term budget estimates . 
The Congressional Budget Office is assuming 3.4 % average growth in real GDP over the 2013 to 2016 period . 
If the growth trend is one percentage point lower - a distinct possibility in an era of protracted consumption weakness - budget deficits would be a significantly higher . 
Indeed , a CBO rule of thumb equates a sustained one-percentage-point shortfall in real GDP growth with budget deficits that are roughly $ 3 trillion larger over a ten-year period . 
Needless to say , such an outcome would spell serious trouble for America &apos;s already-contentious deficit-and-debt debate . 
Finally , no other economy is capable of filling the void left by a protracted shortfall of US consumption . 
Europe and Japan are in no position to take up the slack , and consumer sectors in the world &apos;s major developing economies - especially China - lack the scale and dynamism to take over . 
So enduring weakness in US consumption implies pressure on the growth of export-led developing economies . The good news is that will force them to embrace long-overdue rebalancing strategies aimed at stimulating domestic consumer demand . 
What can be done ? 
While measures adapted in the depths of the crisis - massive fiscal and monetary stimuli - were effective in placing a bottom under the free-fall , they have been ineffective in sparking meaningful recovery . 
That should hardly be surprising in an era of balance-sheet repair . 
Instead , the US needs a menu of policies tailored to the needs and pressures bearing down on American consumers . 
Some possibilities : debt forgiveness to speed up the deleveraging process ; creative saving policies that restore financial security to crisis-battered Americans ; and , of course , jobs and the income they generate . 
The US economy - as well as the global economy - cannot get back on its feet without the American consumer . 
It is time to look beyond ideology - on the left as well as on the right - and frame the policy debate with that key consideration in mind .
