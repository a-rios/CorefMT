The Looming Lost Decade 
PRINCETON - As 2013 comes to an end , it looks like the world economy will remain stuck in low gear . 
For those reading the tea leaves of global recovery , the third-quarter GDP numbers offered no solace . 
While the United States is ahead of the pack , some of its gains could soon be lost , as accumulating inventories begin eroding profits . 
Despite glimmers of hope , the eurozone and Japan are struggling to cross the 1 % threshold for annual economic growth . 
And the major emerging economies are all slowing , with Russia practically at a standstill . 
Not surprisingly , a catchphrase in economic-policy debates nowadays is &quot; secular stagnation , &quot; the idea that excess savings chronically dampen demand . 
The economist Robert Gordon has also argued that the world is low on economically productive ideas . 
But before we despair , there is work to be done . 
The coordinated fiscal stimulus that saved the world from economic collapse in 2009 disappeared too quickly , with governments shifting their focus to domestic politics and priorities . 
As domestic policy options have been exhausted , economic prospects have dimmed . 
A renewed emphasis on stimulus must be augmented by global coordination on the timing and content of stimulus measures . 
The crisis was and remains global . 
Trade data tell the story : after increasing by about 7 % annually in the decade before 2008 , world trade fell faster than global GDP in 2009 ( and more sharply than during the Great Depression ) . 
Once the brief stimulus-fueled recovery faded , growth in world trade again slowed quickly , falling to 2 % year on year over the past 18 months . 
Disappointing export performance is largely responsible for the recent weakening of economic-growth prospects . 
At the end of 2008 , when the scale of the impending economic destruction was not yet apparent , Olivier Blanchard , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s chief economist , boldly called for a global fiscal stimulus , stating that , in these &quot; not normal times , &quot; the IMF &apos;s usual advice - fiscal retrenchment and public-debt reduction - did not apply . 
He warned that if the international community did not come together , &quot; vicious cycles &quot; of deflation , liquidity traps , and increasingly pessimistic expectations could take hold . 
Fortunately , world leaders listened , agreeing in April 2009 at the G-20 Summit in London to provide a total of $ 5 trillion in fiscal stimulus . 
The US and Germany added stimulus amounting to about 2 % of GDP . 
And China &apos;s banks pumped massive amounts of credit into the country &apos;s economy , enabling it to sustain import demand , which was critical to the global recovery . 
But hubris rapidly set in , and parochial interests took over . 
Before the wounds had fully healed , the treatment was terminated . 
The worst offenders were the US and Germany , which shirked the responsibility to protect the global common good that accompanies their status as economic hegemons . 
The United Kingdom , with its contrived rationale for fiscal austerity , was not much better . 
Fiscal stimulus by these three countries - together with smaller contributions from France and China - could have continued the necessary healing . 
Countries now seem to think that monetary-policy measures are their only option . 
But , whereas fiscal stimulus boosts growth at home and abroad , enabling mutual reinforcement through world trade , monetary policy is guided primarily by domestic goals , and , in the short term , one country &apos;s gain can be another &apos;s loss . 
America leads the world in monetary-policy ambition . 
The researchers Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia estimate that the US Federal Reserve &apos;s open-ended asset purchases ( so-called quantitative easing , or QE ) have led to an effective US policy rate of -1.6 % . 
QE helped American exports by weakening the dollar relative to other currencies . 
Once the Japanese engineered their own QE , the yen promptly depreciated . 
That has kept the euro strong . 
The weakest of the &quot; big three &quot; developed economies - the eurozone - has thus been left with the strongest currency . 
In the third quarter of 2013 , Germany &apos;s export growth slowed and French exports fell . 
After a spike earlier in the year , Japan &apos;s exports have also contracted . 
Only US exports have maintained some traction , thanks to the weaker dollar . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , after the gold standard broke down , world leaders could not agree on coordinated reflation of the global economy . 
In his book Golden Fetters , the economist Barry Eichengreen argued that the lack of coordinated action dragged out the global recovery process . 
Such delays are costly , and risk allowing pathologies to fester , prolonging the healing process further . 
Now , despite unfavorable political circumstances , Blanchard should make an even bolder call . 
These are still not &quot; normal &quot; times , and the &quot; vicious cycles &quot; persist . 
Another global fiscal stimulus - focused on public investment in infrastructure and education - would deliver the adrenaline shot needed for a robust recovery . 
More public investment is twice blessed . 
It can shake the world out of its stupor ; and it can safeguard against &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
The US , Germany , the United Kingdom , France , and China should act together to provide that boost . 
Otherwise , a sustainable global recovery may remain elusive , in which case 2014 could end in low gear as well .
