A New Agenda for China &apos;s New Leaders ? 
STANFORD - Political leadership transitions typically signal either a change in direction or continuity . 
But the mere prospect of such a transition usually postpones some important political decisions and freezes some economic activity , pending the resolution of the accompanying uncertainty . 
China &apos;s decennial leadership transition , culminating at the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s 18th Congress , is a case in point . 
And , while many will remember when a Chinese leadership transition was a political and cultural curiosity that had few direct economic implications for the world &apos;s major powers , those days are long gone . 
China is now the world &apos;s second-largest economy , and , despite a recent slowdown to 7 % annual GDP growth , it is outperforming all other major players . 
It remains the vital assembly center of the global supply chain for many manufactured goods , such as computers and cell phones , enabling lower prices for the world &apos;s consumers . 
That has made China a key trade partner for the United States , most European countries , and many other economies , in addition to placing it at the center of intra-Asian trade and supply-chain dynamics . 
Moreover , China sits on roughly $ 3.3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves - much of it in dollars , but also in other major currencies - owing to its large trade surplus in recent decades . 
It helps to finance other countries &quot; trade deficits and domestic investment ( many of its beneficiaries have large budget deficits that decrease national saving below domestic investment ) . 
Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reforms ignited the most rapid economic improvement in human history and , with it , the emergence of a large and growing middle class . 
That makes China an important market opportunity for a broad range of foreign firms - including car producers , technology suppliers , financial institutions , energy companies , and agricultural exporters . 
And Chinese firms - too often state-owned - are seeking greater investment opportunities abroad in major industries , particularly energy . 
A byproduct of China &apos;s spectacular growth has been rising economic tensions with other countries . 
China &apos;s exchange-rate policy and its bilateral trade surplus with the US were major issues in America &apos;s presidential election , and concerns over Chinese foreign investment are ubiquitous . 
The World Trade Organization upheld America &apos;s duties on Chinese tires , and Canada has extended its review of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation &apos;s bid to acquire Nexen , a Canadian oil and gas producer . 
Despite China &apos;s WTO membership , many foreign companies face restrictions on expanding in China or must cooperate with a Chinese company . 
The Chinese , for their part , complain about foreign trade practices and are taking some cases ( for example , a long-running dispute with the European Union over solar panels ) to the WTO , where cases brought against China by other countries are proliferating . 
All sides , however , must bear in mind that China is too important to the global economy and trading system to allow these disputes to spin out of control . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s economic slowdown - the result of global weakness and efforts to cool the country &apos;s inflation and overheated asset markets - threatens to slow the pace of job creation for the millions moving annually from rural poverty to greater prosperity in China &apos;s expanding urban areas . 
And it comes at a time when the pace of market opening and reduction of state control has slowed , following substantial reforms under former President Jiang Zemin and former Premier Zhu Rongji . 
While outgoing President Hu Jintao and Premier 
Thus , incoming President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang are being watched closely for signs of what they will do . 
It is rare for a successor - in business or government - to usurp the current leader &apos;s lame-duck status by tipping his hand , so no one can yet say with any certainty whether the new leadership will push for a reformist leap forward or seek to maintain the status quo . 
In addition to a new president and premier , other members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo have been named and a vast array of ministerial positions are beingfilled . 
With China &apos;s &quot; up or out &quot; system for senior leaders , those who are not promoted will be replaced . 
From the new governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China to the cabinet and leading regulators , the new cohort has an opportunity to move China forward by promoting competition , decreasing the power of state enterprises , boosting household consumption , and reducing reliance on exports . 
Earlier this year , the China Development Research Center of the State Council and the World Bank issued an excellent report on opportunities for , and challenges to , China &apos;s policy agenda . 
They concluded that China should complete its transition to a market economy with land , labor , financial , and enterprise reforms . 
Opening markets to greater competition and rebalancing the roles of government and markets is the most promising strategy to achieve high-income status in the coming decades . 
It would be hard to find a better framework for Xi and Li as they put their imprint on China &apos;s economic policy . 
In particular , Chinese consumption as a share of GDP is very low by international standards and relative to the historical experience of other countries at a similar stage of development . 
Two important options for raising consumption are social insurance - which is developing , but too slowly - and reducing state-owned enterprises &quot; huge savings by paying dividends to citizens , much as privately owned companies routinely pay dividends to shareholders . 
Managers , workers , consumers , investors , and governments in every corner of the world , many reeling from their own economic problems , have a lot riding on China &apos;s new leadership navigating reform sensibly , now and in years to come . 
Theworld will soon know more about what to expect .
