Getting Industrial Policy Right 
DAVOS - At a time of lackluster global economic growth , developing countries are dusting off some old strategies - particularly the use of industrial policy to drive the development of particular sectors and turn them into engines of growth and employment . 
In the 1950s and 1960s , many Latin American and Caribbean countries embraced industrial policy enthusiastically . 
By substituting imports with domestic production , relying on government planning to target priority sectors , and implementing selective trade protection ( for example , by imposing tariffs , quotas , and import licensing ) , they attempted to accelerate their transitions from raw-materials suppliers to manufacturing-based economies . 
While East Asian countries like South Korea used such policies to enable selected industries to compete on a global scale , Latin American and Caribbean countries rarely got it right . 
Despite some notable successes , such as the aircraft manufacturer Embraer in Brazil and salmon farming in Chile , governments largely picked losers - not least because political pressure , not firms &quot; competitive potential , drove the selection process . 
In the 1980s and 1990s , Latin America abandoned such policies in favor of a more cautious approach . 
Rather than backing individual sectors , some countries promoted innovation with across-the-board subsidies and tax breaks , while opening their economies to foreign competition and embracing market-oriented reforms . 
But these changes , though necessary , were insufficient to deliver growth in productivity and output . 
Almost two decades later , with Latin American governments again exploring the potential of activist industrial policy , avoiding the mistakes of the past will require a thorough understanding of why previous attempts failed - and a concrete strategy to guide future efforts . 
A recent report by the Inter-American Development Bank ( of which I am President ) does precisely that . 
Beyond assessing what went wrong previously , the report identifies three fundamental questions that policymakers in any emerging economy should answer before pursuing industrial policy : 
· 
· 
· 
Consider sectoral policies in Costa Rica and Argentina . 
In Costa Rica , the rice industry took the traditional route of lobbying for protection . 
By contrast , farmers in the Argentine province of Entre Ríos requested that the National Institute of Agricultural Technology ( INTA ) ramp up research into new rice varieties , even agreeing to pay a tax to augment INTA &apos;s research budget ( thereby overcoming what economists call private-sector coordination problems ) . 
Unsurprisingly , the intervention in Argentina passed all three tests : the market suffered a coordination failure that was addressed effectively through public policy carried out by appropriate institutions . 
Instead of coddling an entire industry with subsidies or import restrictions , the provincial government and INTA provided a public good that bolstered production in a specific sector . 
Other successful examples of this approach include sanitary certifications of agricultural products and training programs for the software industry . 
Once governments identify an opportunity that passes these three tests , they are in a much better position to use measures like temporary subsidies or targeted incentives effectively . 
In Mexico &apos;s Mayan Riviera , for example , public support for investments in lodging and transportation helped create a world-class tourist destination . 
Costa Rica , despite its rice-industry failure , has also had some success with such policies . 
When the medical-device industry was blocked from producing lucrative products like heart valves , owing to the lack of specialized firms to provide sterilization services , the government used incentives to attract such companies . 
As a result , exports of more sophisticated , higher-value-added medical devices soared . 
Ensuring adequate institutional capacity is essential to prevent private and political interests from shaping policy , as occurred in the 1950s and 1960s . 
Ireland , often praised for its success in picking winners , relied on the technical competence of its renowned Industrial Development Agency to safeguard the integrity and effectiveness of the selection process . 
Chile , despite possessing reasonably strong institutions , turned to a third party , the Boston Consulting Group , to ensure that the most promising sectors were selected objectively . 
Fostering industrial development is a complex challenge . 
Policymakers must periodically reassess their efforts and promptly abandon failures . 
There will be hits and misses , but , if officials consistently ask the right three questions , their chances of success will be much higher .
