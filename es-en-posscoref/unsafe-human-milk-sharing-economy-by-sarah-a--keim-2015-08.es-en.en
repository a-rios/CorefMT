The Dangers of the Milk-Sharing Economy 
COLUMBUS - For millennia , infants have sometimes been fed another mother &apos;s breast milk . 
Whether to ensure the infant &apos;s survival following the death or illness of its own mother , or as part of a wet-nursing arrangement ( common for high-status families in some cultures ) , sharing breast milk has long been acceptable , if not lifesaving . 
But , over the last 5-10 years , a new kind of Internet-fueled milk-sharing economy has emerged - one that magnifies certain risks to recipient infants . 
Numerous websites now exist to connect lactating women with excess milk and mothers who , unable to meet their own child &apos;s needs , are seeking it . 
In 2011 , more than 13,000 women posted on such websites with the intention of providing or obtaining milk , either for free or for payment . 
Today , that figure has grown to over 55,000 . 
Moreover , though these websites have so far been most popular in the United States , they are beginning to appear in numerous other countries . 
And , of course , many more women are probably sharing milk offline with friends , relatives , and acquaintances . 
The recent upsurge in milk-sharing can be explained by shifting attitudes toward breastfeeding in many countries , with the public-health and medical communities sending the message that breastfeeding is the best option for babies . 
It is a message that the millennial generation has taken to heart . 
In the US , women giving birth today are more likely to breastfeed than any generation since World War II , with 79 % of infants being breastfed at least once . 
Nowadays , many young mothers report feeling significant social , not to mention self-imposed , pressure to breastfeed as part of an &quot; all-natural &quot; approach to child-rearing - one that eschews commercial infant formulas produced by &quot; untrustworthy &quot; corporations . 
The problem is that many women have difficulty with breastfeeding , lack access to high-quality and timely lactation support , and face heavy demands , especially from work , that make lactation difficult to sustain . 
It is these factors that may lead some women to turn to milk-sharing - a process that is often facilitated by social media . 
The problem is that the public lacks an adequate understanding of the risks and benefits of milk-sharing . 
Public-health messaging has given some women the impression that human milk is an infallible substance , often described in online breastfeeding communities with terms like &quot; liquid gold . &quot; 
But raw human milk can carry infectious diseases like HIV , syphilis , and hepatitis . 
Pathogenic bacteria in milk , such as salmonella and coliforms , can cause food-borne illness . 
If a lactating woman uses prescription or recreational drugs , her milk can transmit drug metabolites . 
And , of course , it is possible that some breast-milk sellers adulterate their product to boost volumes and profits . 
In 2010 , the US Food and Drug Administration cautioned the public against feeding infants milk from unfamiliar sources , citing a series of risks , many of which my own research team has since confirmed . 
Three-quarters of the milk samples that we purchased online were so contaminated with bacteria that they were not safe to feed to an infant in unpasteurized form . 
Moreover , 21 % of samples contained cytomegalovirus , which can cause long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in susceptible infants . 
And one in ten samples contained significant amounts of added cow &apos;s milk or formula . 
Yet the FDA has not taken steps to regulate the exchange of human milk , and the &quot; buyer beware &quot; approach is simply inadequate to protect infants who are being fed shared milk . 
After all , unless you have a laboratory in your kitchen , you cannot know for sure that what you are getting is healthy and 100 % human milk . 
Even if parents had the means to choose healthy milk donors , the benefits of milk-sharing remain dubious . 
Existing scientific evidence for the benefits of breast milk over formula has emerged from studies that assume that mothers are feeding their own children from their own breasts . 
We do not know whether these findings apply when an infant is fed another mother &apos;s milk from a bottle . 
In this sense , though breastfeeding remains the best choice for able mothers , the single-minded focus on breastfeeding that prevails today could have adverse effects - at least in advanced countries where safe alternatives are available . 
Indeed , in countries like the US , strong regulations ensure that mothers who cannot breastfeed can access infant formula that is as safe and nutritious as possible , based on existing scientific knowledge - not to mention clean drinking water to prepare it . 
Where breastfeeding is absolutely critical - often by any means necessary - is in environments where formula or clean water is not available , affordable , or reliable . 
This is not to say that advanced-country mothers who struggle to meet their babies &quot; needs should necessarily defer to formula . 
On the contrary , governments can take steps - from promoting more flexible workplace policies , including better options for maternity and paternity leave , to expanding the availability of high-quality lactation support - to help ensure that mothers who want to breastfeed can do so . 
Moreover , public-health campaigns should expand their message to support women who are struggling to breastfeed . 
This includes helping women feel more comfortable seeking lactation support early , while recognizing that some women will be unable to fulfill their child &apos;s feeding needs with their own milk , and that they should not be made to feel guilty for using formula . 
Pediatricians should reinforce these messages , in order to help families make feeding decisions that account for the particular needs of each mother and child . 
An awareness of the prevalence of milk-sharing , and a willingness to foster an open discussion about it , could go a long way toward achieving that goal .
