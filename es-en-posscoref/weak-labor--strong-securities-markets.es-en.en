Weak Labor , Strong Securities Markets 
A vital distinction between market economies is the degree to which ownership of large firms is separate from a firm &apos;s day-to-day management . 
What makes a company &apos;s owners willingly hand over control to professional managers ? 
That question is increasingly urgent as wealthy countries-as well as many transition and developing economies-attempt to create the robust securities markets needed to boost investment , productivity , and growth . 
Separation of ownership from management and effective securities markets reinforce each other . 
The underlying theory is straightforward : if bosses can steal , distant owners will not buy shares . 
The formalistic civil-law systems that prevail in continental Europe supposedly provide inadequate protection , so ownership remains concentrated . 
By contrast , Anglo Saxon common-law systems empower judges to interpret open-ended fiduciary rules on a case-by-case basis , thereby establishing legal precedents that are binding on managers . 
But this is a weak explanation . 
Before World War I , Europe &apos;s civil-law countries were developing securities markets as fast as the US and the UK . 
Indeed , regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) arose because common-law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners . 
Insider trading , for example , was generally legal under the rules governing fiduciary duties in America &apos;s states , which back then played a dominant role . 
By contrast , the SEC is a rule-generating institution of the type that civil-law countries like France or Germany would have little difficulty creating if they wished to . 
Moreover , fiduciary duties only aspire to prevent insiders from stealing . 
They do not control the main costs that shareholders face when they do not manage the company themselves , such as unprofitable expansion , shirking , retention of free cash flow , and empire building . 
Unless there is a conflict of interest between a company &apos;s management and its board , owners in common-law countries have no legal recourse when managers &apos; operational or strategic decisions are bad , stupid , or otherwise harmful to shareholders . 
Throughout the rich world , institutions that raise the costs to shareholders of turning over control to professional managers play a powerful role in determining outcomes . 
But these institutions reflect the political power of social forces , not the differences between civil-law and common-law systems . 
In particular , ownership separation in the wealthy continental European nations and the US can be linked with the role of labor inside the firm and within society . 
In some nations , labor greatly influences the firm through politics-i.e. , opposing mass lay-offs and resisting restructuring plans that change the nature of the workplace . 
Consider a simple scenario : a nation bars firms and owners from laying off employees for economic reasons . 
Faced with a no-fire rule , shareholders have reason to be very cautious : if expansion is not profitable , they cannot reduce labor costs . 
France , for example , is notorious for forcing foreign firms like Britain &apos;s Marks and Spencer to keep redundant workers on the payroll . 
Of course , no nation completely bans lay-offs , but flexibility varies greatly and can be central to profitability . 
In a nation like the US , where employees can be fired easily , shareholders have less to fear . 
But in a labor-strong society , dominant shareholders-those with the most to lose if expansion goes awry-have reason to keep managers on a short leash . 
Italy &apos;s Fiat illustrates the problem : even a conservative government seeks to impede downsizing . 
A second factor should also make owners want to stay close to the firm if labor is politically strong . 
Bargaining over the economic surplus is often open-ended , especially if competition is weak . 
Where employees have high bargaining power , the profits pie is constantly up for re-division , both within the firm and at the national level . 
If managers are only loosely tied to shareholders , they could more willingly give up a bigger share of the pie to labor . 
Similarly , where shareholder interests do not come first , say , in a corporatist system , dominant owners have greater reason to keep financial information private , lest labor use it to press for more favorable terms . 
Both considerations support concentrated ownership and work against securities markets . 
So , where political and social values strongly favor labor , managers &apos; loyalty to shareholder interests will be weaker . 
Managers in such &quot; left &quot; societies are no less technically capable , but their organizational constraints , incentives , and goals are less pro-shareholder . 
When forced to cut employment , they are more likely to think that they are destroying lives rather than raising economic efficiency and increasing wealth . 
Such societies should have fewer public firms , and narrower or no ownership separation . 
So they do . 
The OECD has indexed how easy it is to fire an employee in member countries . 
Employees enjoy the least protection in the US , and a high degree of protection in Italy , France , and Germany . 
The correlation with ownership separation is striking : a sample of the 20 largest firms in each country shows that , whereas 90 % of the US companies have no shareholder with more than a 20 % stake , none of the Italian , French , or German firms have such highly dispersed ownership . 
True , with only 16 countries rich enough to be included in the survey , the correlation isn &apos;t perfect . 
The United Kingdom is in seventh place in terms of labor-market flexibility , but a higher proportion of its largest companies have widely dispersed ownership than sixth-place Switzerland-and double the share of fifth-place Denmark and fourth-place Australia . 
But whatever measures of &quot; political &quot; qualities and ownership separation we use , the index of employment protection appears to be the best predictor of ownership separation in the wealthy West . 
More fundamentally , creating the regulatory institutions conducive to ownership separation may be impossible unless a society &apos;s political orientation towards labor and capital is more favorable to capital .
