The Myth of Green Energy Security 
COPENHAGEN - Turmoil across the Middle East and Northern Africa has refocused attention on the impact that political tensions or interference can have on the price and availability of energy imports . 
Against consumer fears of gas-price hikes , energy security ranks high on many Western governments &quot; policy agendas . 
Of course , this is hardly a new phenomenon : Europe started trying to build up its energy reserves back in the 1960 &quot; s . 
Likewise , every American president since Richard Nixon in the early 1970 &quot; s has tried , and failed , to reduce dependence on foreign oil . 
A new trend , though , is that policies that just a few years ago were being touted to fight climate change are being presented as a necessary way to increase energy security . 
Against the backdrop of the financial crisis , and as public support for climate-change policies scrapes new lows in many developed countries , we hear less from leaders about the threat of global warming , and more about the supposed economic benefits of climate policies . 
This shift is hardly surprising , given the increasing number of analyses that demonstrate that current - unilateral - climate policies will have virtually no impact on the rise in global temperature . 
The European Union offers a classic illustration of this point . 
Its &quot; 20-20-20 &quot; climate plan - by far the most comprehensive climate-change policy in effect anywhere - aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 % from 1990 levels by 2020 , ensure that renewable energy delivers 20 % of energy consumption , and cut primary energy use by 20 % . 
An analysis of the costs and benefits of the policy in 2010 by climate economist Richard Tol showed that the annual price tag would be around € 210 billion . 
Running the policy through the RICE climate-economic model reveals that by the end of this century , it will reduce temperature rises by just 0.05 ° C ( 0.1ºF ) . 
Undaunted by the policy &apos;s utterly feeble impact on global warming , politicians have declared that the policy will at least enhance the EU &apos;s energy security . 
So the Copenhagen Consensus Center asked Professor Christoph Böhringer and Andreas Keller of the University of Oldenburg to test this claim . 
Of course , the notion of energy security is fuzzy . 
In their research paper , &quot; Energy Security : An Impact Assessment of the EU Climate and Energy Package , &quot; Böhringer and Keller note that the EU has never set itself a clear metric for energy security . 
Despite - or because of - this lack of definition and measurability , policymakers , write Böhringer and Keller , &quot; exploit the energy security argument to justify a myriad of measures . &quot; 
Such measures even include bans on light bulbs and patio heaters , tax breaks for bicycle owners , standards for tire pressure , and tests for fuel-efficient driving - none of which would appear to have much impact on the level of Russian or Middle Eastern oil imports . 
What is clear , according to Böhringer and Keller , is that the EU Climate and Energy Package violates basic principles of cost-effectiveness , if the sole objective is emission reduction . 
The package stands out for its tangle of instruments - and thus the risk of counterproductive , overlapping regulation , which will substantially increase costs compared to an effective climate policy . 
The researchers measure the impact of the 20-20-20 package through independent energy-security indices . 
Without implementation of the package , slightly more than half of Europe &apos;s energy needs would be met by imported fossil fuel by 2020 , compared to 50 % today . 
If the EU is successful in reducing CO2 emissions by 20 % by 2020 , Böhringer and Keller find that its reliance on imported fossil fuel would be reduced by just two percentage points . 
This is an awfully long way from self-reliance . 
Of course , the EU 20-20-20 plan aims to do more than just reduce emissions ; it also attempts to increase renewable-energy use and cut overall energy consumption . 
The researchers find that the full 20-20-20 plan would actually mean &quot; increased energy imports as well as increased price risks &quot; - mainly because the tax imposed on electricity to achieve the efficiency target of the 20-20-20 plan will affect nuclear power the most . 
In other words , the very policy that was supposed to achieve greater energy security is in fact likely to hike prices and lead to greater reliance on foreign energy imports . 
It is worth noting that these outcomes are based on the optimistic reference scenario used in the US Department of Energy &apos;s International Energy Outlook , under which renewable-energy use will grow at a higher rate than in the past . 
Without this expectation , the EU &apos;s policy would likely be even more costly . 
In many Western countries , policies are increasingly being wrapped in promises of greater energy security rather than in threats of climate catastrophes . 
But , because energy security is such a vague concept , these policies are seldom subjected to rigorous scrutiny to determine whether they will live up to politicians &quot; claims . 
As the new research shows , we should be especially cautious about the claims of politicians who use current events to justify the old , ineffective climate-change policies on the new and equally problematic basis of energy security .
