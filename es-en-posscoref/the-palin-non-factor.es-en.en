The Palin Non-Factor 
LONDON - Senator John McCain is a genuine American hero . 
He was a brave airman , with a fine war record . 
Unlike the so-called &quot; chicken hawks &quot; who avoided service in the Vietnam War themselves but could barely wait to send young Americans into Iraq to fight , McCain &apos;s life is not at odds with his politics . 
In the Senate , while supporting President Bush &apos;s war of choice in Iraq , he has been prepared to stand up for his independent judgment on issues such as campaign finance reform and climate change . 
So when , as a presidential candidate , McCain said that , if elected , he would seek to work with Democrats and independents , and that he would search for consensus , it was easy to believe him . 
After all , this is exactly how he had behaved as a senator . 
There seemed every chance that he would apply this approach to the choice of his running mate . 
His friend Senator Joseph Lieberman , a former Democrat and a hawk on the Iraq war , appeared to be the most likely pick . 
We know what happened . 
With his campaign apparently dead in the water , McCain reached out all right - to the right-wing fundamentalists in his own party . 
Governor Sarah Palin strode onto the national stage , rhetorical guns blazing . 
Whatever else you say about the governor &apos;s views , no one could call the choice of the &quot; hockey mom &quot; from Alaska a bold bid for consensus . 
She was chosen , to borrow the commentators &quot; jargon , to energize the party base , which comprises hard-liners suspicious of McCain &apos;s lack of enthusiasm for the causes that fire them up , such as creationism and a ban on abortion . 
According to the McCain campaign &apos;s calculus , a political outsider with redneck views would appeal to white working-class voters . 
Moreover , a woman on his ticket might attract some of those disappointed by Senator Hillary Clinton &apos;s loss to Senator Barack Obama in the Democratic race . 
So far , the selection of Palin seems to have paid off . 
Questions about her record have been sidestepped ; her inexperience is lauded as a virtue ; any criticism is dismissed as sexism . 
Speaking as a one-time campaign manager in British politics , there seem to be three important points for the Democrats to remember . 
First , Palin is not at the top of the ticket . 
It is impossible to imagine her surviving a primary campaign . 
She would never have withstood the searching inquiries of months of campaigning . 
Second , it is McCain whom the Democrats should attack . 
He would be president , not the Alaskan . 
It is McCain &apos;s views on the economy and foreign policy , not Palin &apos;s on Darwin and the wickedness of sex education , which should be the targets . 
The economy is not McCain &apos;s strong suit . 
He was arguing as Wall Street went into meltdown that the American economy &apos;s fundamentals were still strong . 
McCain &apos;s solution seems to be more of Bush &apos;s policies - tax cuts for the rich plus promises to curb public spending . 
How credible is that ? 
The Republicans under Bush have turned huge surpluses into terrifyingly large deficits . 
The mortgage crisis and the credit crunch have led to bailouts for the banks and the nationalization of housing finance and insurance . 
America needs to rein in its household and fiscal spending , so that it can cut the amount of money that it borrows and owes . 
It is not easy to do this when the rich get richer - enjoying their biggest spree since the Roaring Twenties - and average household income remains stagnant for the third decade running . 
Social equity is not irrelevant even in America , the land of opportunity . 
When they get into the polling booth in November , will Americans vote on &quot; culture wars &quot; issues - sex and guns - or on the basis of whether they can afford to pay their mortgages ? 
As for foreign policy , it is Obama who has rightly said that America needs to switch the focus of its military operations from Iraq to Afghanistan . 
His opponent originally derided what has rapidly become the conventional wisdom . 
Al-Qaeda still has bases with the Taliban on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . 
A serious effort to contain them and stamp them out requires an effective campaign in Helmand Province , North and South Waziristan , and the troubled areas between the poppy fields of Afghanistan and the madrasas of Pakistan . 
Finally , if America wants change , why vote for a ticket that has embraced the very attitudes that gave the Bush years their character , and exemplifies some of the reasons for its unpopularity and failures , from partisan bigotry and the assault on reason and science to the &quot; America First &quot; dismissal of the opinions of the rest of mankind ? 
If I were a Democrat , I would leave Palin to the mercies of the investigating bloggers . 
The election is too important to all of us to begin and end with her . 
I would get back to the central issues .
