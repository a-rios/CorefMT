A Jobless Recovery ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Who will suffer the longest and the most from the implosion in 2008-2009 of Wall Street and the ensuing world recession ? 
Not the bankers and financiers who created the disaster . 
Some financiers , like Bernard Madoff , will go to prison for fraud . 
But , although Madoff was only the tip of the iceberg of rampant financial malfeasance , most suspect financiers need not fear arrest , either because their behavior merely skirted the law , or because financial impropriety more subtle than outright fraud is often difficult to prove . 
Some bank bosses will retire in shame , but with huge payments to ease their pain - such as the $ 55 million golden parachute handed to Bank of America &apos;s Ken Lewis , with his , and the Â£ 25 million pension bestowed on Royal Bank of Scotland &apos;s Fred Godwin . 
But , buoyed by government bailout money , guarantees , and low interest rates , many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bonuses while fighting vigorously against reforms designed to restrain their risk-taking and compensation . 
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism . 
From 2007 to October 2009 , the United States lost nearly eight million jobs , which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63 % to 58.5 % . 
The unemployment rate at the end of 2009 was above 10 % , duration of joblessness was the longest since the Great Depression , millions had had their working hours cut , and millions more were too discouraged by a lack of jobs to seek work . 
Advanced Europe , Canada , and Japan also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time . 
Spain , which allows for widespread temporary contracts , has had the biggest increase in unemployment , because Spanish workers can be fired as quickly as those in the US . 
Some countries - for example , Germany , Sweden , and South Korea - have &quot; hidden &quot; their joblessness by paying firms to keep workers on the payroll . 
This can work in the short term , but it cannot be sustained over time . 
From the 1980 &quot; s through the mid-2000 &quot; s , employment has increasingly lagged GDP in economic recoveries . 
In the US , there was a jobless recovery under President Bill Clinton until the dot.com boom in the latter part of the 1990 &quot; s , and there was a jobless recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 slowdown . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , Sweden suffered a huge recession precipitated by a housing bubble and a banking crisis . 
Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8 % in 1990 to 9.6 % in 1994 , before bottoming out at 5 % in 2001 . 
Sixteen years after the crisis , the unemployment rate was 6.2 % - more than triple the rate in 1990 . 
In 1997 , Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis , but also from insistence by the US and the International Monetary Fund that it raise interest rates and undertake &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; -style reforms to receive aid . 
Employment recovered , but primarily in &quot; non-regular &quot; jobs with limited benefits , low wages , and little job security . 
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest ( behind the US ) among advanced OECD countries . 
Weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being . 
Young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives . 
Studies of happiness show that unemployment reduces happiness by as much as the loss of a family member . 
It is difficult to see the US re-attaining full employment anytime soon . 
From 1993 to 1998 , the US created millions of jobs , which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points . 
If employment began rising at this rate in 2010 , it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-recession level . 
And slow recovery in the US will drag down recovery in other advanced countries , reducing their employment as well . 
A long , painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce . 
From the early 1990 &quot; s on , many analysts viewed America &apos;s weak unionization , at-will employment , limited legal job protection , and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries . 
Many OECD countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along US lines . 
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable . 
In its 2009 Employment Outlook , the OECD took a hard look at its favored policy reforms and found them deficient in helping countries adjust to a finance-driven recession . 
According to the OECD , &quot; there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that OECD labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic downturns . &quot; 
So the lesson from the recession is clear . 
The weak reed in capitalism is not the labor market , but the financial market . 
At worst , labor-market failures impose modest inefficiency costs on society , whereas capital-market failures harm society greatly , with workers , rather than the perpetrators of financial disaster , suffering the most . 
Moreover , globalization means that the US capital market &apos;s failure spreads misery around the world . 
We owe it to workers victimized by this recession to reinvent finance so that it works to enrich the real economy , instead of enriching only the financiers . 
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector . 
Since other countries &quot; economies and jobs are also at stake , they owe it to their citizens to press the US to deliver meaningful financial reforms .
