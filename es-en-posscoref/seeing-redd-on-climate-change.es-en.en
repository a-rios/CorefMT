Seeing REDD on Climate Change 
CANCÚN - The official communiqué from the Cancún climate-change conference cannot disguise the fact that there will be no successor to the Kyoto Protocol when it expires at the end of 2012 . 
Japan , among others , has withdrawn its support for efforts simply to extend the Kyoto treaty . 
This sounds like bad news , because it means that there will be no international price on carbon , and , without a market price , it is difficult to see how the reduction of carbon emissions can be efficiently organized . 
Even as the top-down approach to tackling climate change is breaking down , a new bottom-up approach is emerging . 
Instead of a single price for carbon , this bottom-up approach is likely to produce a multiplicity of prices for carbon emissions . 
The market price of anything is always equal to the marginal cost . 
When there is a single price , all the various cost curves are merged into one and low-cost projects enjoy large rents . 
This was amply demonstrated by the working of the Kyoto Protocol in practice . 
The carbon-trading scheme that it established gave rise to many abuses . 
For example , formerly communist countries earned emission credits at zero cost on the heavy industries that they had to shut down and reaped windfall profits by selling them . 
So the demise of the Kyoto Protocol will be no great loss . 
The same applies to the protracted negotiations between developed and developing nations . 
The developed nations promised to pay reparations for their past sins at the Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992 but kept deferring their obligations by negotiating . 
Meanwhile , conditions changed with the passage of time : China , following decades of booming growth , replaced the United States as the largest emitter . 
The negotiations have taken on an increasingly unreal air . 
Currently , the dispute revolves around how governments will deliver $ 100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries confront climate change , given that even the $ 10 billion Fast Track Fund cannot be cobbled together without using smoke and mirrors . 
By failing to make any progress beyond keeping the talks alive , the Cancún summit has given the impression that nothing is happening , and that the situation is hopeless . 
That is not the case . 
Individual countries like Germany are making binding unilateral commitments that are not conditional on what other countries do , and &quot; coalitions of the willing &quot; are being formed to tackle particular sectors . 
The REDD + partnership ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ) , an effort to create financial value for the carbon stored in forests , is the prime example here . 
Indeed , the greatest progress is now being made where the problem is the most urgent : it is much easier to preserve forests than to restore them . 
The case of Indonesia deserves special attention . 
Indonesia has become the third largest polluter in the world , after China and the US , because much of its forest grows on peatlands . 
When the trees are cut and peatlands drained , the carbon accumulated over millennia is exposed and oxidized - often in the form of fires that envelope neighboring Singapore and Malaysia in smoke . 
Today , half of Indonesia &apos;s peatlands remain intact ; if they were exposed , emissions would double . 
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is determined to prevent this , and he has received financial support for his efforts from Norway . 
Their partnership has already been joined by Australia , and others will soon follow . 
The partnership is path-breaking in several ways . 
Yudhoyono is introducing a moratorium on the exploitation of peatlands and virgin forests . 
A REDD + agency will be charged with treating rain forests as a natural resource that is to be preserved and restored rather than exploited and destroyed . 
This will also transform governance and the delivery of official development assistance ( ODA ) . 
The REDD + agency will have a domestic governing board that will coordinate the activities of all the governmental units concerned with rain forests , and an international board that will authorize and monitor the spending of ODA funds . 
These efforts can serve as a prototype for assisting other countries such as Guyana , where the current forest-preservation scheme does not work so well . 
Eventually , it should lead to the establishment of a global fund for rain forests and agricultural adaptation because the benefits of carbon abatement accrue to mankind as a whole , not to individual countries . 
The global fund would introduce two prices : one for carbon saving by restoring forests and one for avoiding carbon emissions by preserving them . 
This in turn sets an example for other sectors . 
In this way , carbon pricing will be introduced and international cooperation established from the bottom up , on a sectoral basis rooted in demonstrated results . 
Thus , despite the widespread impression that the climate-change agenda has stalled , there are grounds for hope .
