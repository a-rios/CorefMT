The Bigger Issue in Sudan 
TEL AVIV - The most immediate result of the arrest warrant issued for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir by the International Criminal Court last month was the expulsion of most aid agencies from the country . 
What is most needed now is to build an international consensus on a strategy to implement fully the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) for Sudan . 
The CPA ended Africa &apos;s longest civil war , which had left behind over two million dead . 
That agreement not only contains benchmarks that should lead to self-determination for Sudan &apos;s South ; it also spells out a democratization process in Sudan itself . 
After all , the oppressive nature of the regime in Khartoum is at the root of the many conflicts that have torn the country apart . 
If the government in Khartoum persists in undermining the reform process and derailing the referendum on self-determination promised for the South in January 2011 , a return to full-scale civil war , with calamitous consequences for the peoples of Sudan and the entire region , is a real possibility . 
The commitment of Sudan &apos;s government to the CPA has always been equivocal . 
Indeed , since the civil war &apos;s end in 2005 , the Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) in the South has frequently had to confront militias that operate as government proxies . 
Moreover , Sudanese security forces continue to arm Arab tribes straddling the North-South border with the aim of destabilizing the mostly Christian South . 
The arrest warrant for al-Bashir should not be allowed to spur further attempts by his government to sabotage the CPA and the fragile process leading to the 2011 referendum . 
Nor should the international neglect that has for too long allowed the Darfur genocide to go unpunished recur when it comes to sustaining the quest for peace in Sudan . 
The South &apos;s drive for independence has gained momentum because of the North &apos;s failure to make unity attractive through reform and elections , as stipulated by the CPA . 
A second factor pushing secession forward is the SPLA &apos;s lack of commitment to the New Sudan ideology of its founder , John Garang , who had negotiated the CPA and died in a plane crash in 2005 . 
Garang fought for a united , secular , and democratic Sudan , a lofty dream that the Islamist regime in Khartoum admittedly has had no intention of implementing . 
Self-determination for the South has thus become the only practical way out of the country &apos;s dilemma , and one fully consistent with the 2005 peace agreement . 
Because the North possesses the capacity , but not the political will , to implement the CPA , and the South has the will but not the capacity , continued disengagement by the international community might doom the prospects for peace . 
The Government of Southern Sudan suffers from serious financial constraints , owing to unrealistic assumptions about its oil revenues . 
As a result , its ability to maintain services - and the military capacity to respond to any maneuver by the Khartoum government aimed against the peace agreement - is seriously compromised . 
Only the United States appears to be committed to creating the conditions needed to implement the CPA . 
President George W. Bush , who twice received Southern Sudanese president Salva Kiir at the White House , approved a program in 2006 to transform the SPLA into a professional army . 
More recently , leading American congressmen have been impressing on President Barack Obama the need for a muscular effort to implement the CPA . 
Recommendations presented recently to the Senate &apos;s Foreign Relations Committee , suggested that security guarantees for Southern Sudan be given in order to deter a renewal of the civil war . 
Financial assistance is of course vital , but the political commitment of the international community is just as important . 
For example , although the United Nations Mission in Sudan is supposed to monitor implementation of the CPA , Darfur has practically monopolized its attention . 
Moreover , whatever monitoring is taking place is rarely followed by action . 
The secession of a Southern Sudanese Christian state from a Muslim country , a major member of the Arab League , would have far-reaching strategic implications . 
China , a close ally of the government in Khartoum , is now carefully weighing its oil interests and its strategic concerns in the South . 
A high-powered Russian delegation recently arrived in Juba , the South Sudanese capital , with the proclaimed aim of &quot; playing a more active role on the African continent . &quot; 
And Japan , a major consumer of Middle East oil , has recently invited President Kiir to Tokyo . 
Sadly missing in this diplomatic action is the European Union . 
International law and the indictment of war criminals are important for a civilized world order , but they are no substitute for active financial and political engagement to support an internationally legitimate , and urgently needed , peace accord such as the CPA in Sudan .
