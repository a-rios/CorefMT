America the Hypocritical 
In commemorating the 230th anniversary of America &apos;s independence last July , President George W. Bush noted that the patriots of the Revolutionary War believed that all men are created equal , and with inalienable rights . 
Because of these ideals , he proclaimed , the United States &quot; remains a beacon of hope for all who dream of liberty and a shining example to the world of what a free people can achieve . &quot; 
But , at the same time , his administration was holding approximately 400 prisoners at the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba . 
Some of them have now been there for more than five years . 
Last month , a highly reputable source confirmed that the Guantánamo prisoners are suffering from more than indefinite detention . 
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation released documents showing that an FBI agent witnessed &quot; on several occasions &quot; detainees who were &quot; chained hand and foot in &#91; a &#93; fetal position to &#91; the &#93; floor , &quot; without a chair , or food or water . 
In these conditions , &quot; most urinated or defecated on &#91; them &#93; selves . &quot; 
They were left there for 18 or 24 hours , or more . 
On one of these occasions , the agent reported , &quot; the air conditioning was turned up so low that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold . &quot; 
On another occasion the room was unventilated , the temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit , and the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him - &quot; he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night . &quot; 
Another FBI agent was laughingly told by a civilian contractor , &quot; &#91; Y &#93; ou have to see this . &quot; 
He was then taken to an interrogation room where he saw a longhaired man with a full beard who was gagged with duct tape that &quot; covered much of his head . &quot; 
When the agent asked how the tape would be removed , he was not given any answer . 
Other FBI agents reported seeing prisoners left in shackles for 12 hours or more , again in cold conditions , being subjected to strobe lights and loud rap music for many hours , or being forced to wrap themselves in an Israeli flag . 
The FBI report noted these incidents with the comment : &quot; doesn &apos;t seem excessive given Department of Defense policy . &quot; 
Several of the detainees told the FBI agents that they had no connection with terrorism and had no idea why they had been abducted and taken to Guantánamo . 
Many prisoners were not captured fighting in Afghanistan . 
Some were picked up in Bosnia , Indonesia , Thailand , Mauritania , and Pakistan . 
The Bush administration says that the detainees are &quot; enemy combatants &quot; in the global war against terror - a war that is being waged around the world , and that could last for decades . 
The commander of the Guantánamo task force , Rear Admiral Harry B. Harris , Jr . , recently defended harsh treatment of his prisoners , claiming , &quot; They &apos;re all terrorists ; they &apos;re all enemy combatants . &quot; 
But the CIA has made mistakes before . 
For example , Murat Kurnaz , a German-born Turkish man , was held in Guantánamo for four years before being released last August . 
The case of Khaled el-Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent , appears to be another of these errors . 
Seized by the CIA in Macedonia , he was taken to Afghanistan and interrogated for five months before being released without charge . 
A German court has now issued arrest warrants for those involved in his abduction . 
If there are any human rights at all , the right not to be locked up indefinitely without trial is surely one of them . 
The US Constitution &apos;s Bill of Rights puts considerable emphasis on that right , specifying in the Sixth Amendment that in all criminal prosecutions , &quot; the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury &quot; and &quot; to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him . &quot; 
None of the Guantánamo inmates has been granted these rights . 
So it has never been proved , by the standards laid down in the US Constitution that any of them really are terrorists . 
But the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the Guantánamo prisoners , because they are not US citizens and are in a facility that , technically , is not part of US territory , although it is under the full control of the US government . 
Whatever US courts say about it , abducting people all over the world , locking them up for years without establishing that they are guilty of anything , and subjecting them to harsh and abusive treatment is a flagrant violation of international law . 
By any standard of justice , it is also just plain wrong .
