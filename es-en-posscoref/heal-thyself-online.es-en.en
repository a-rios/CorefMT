Heal Thyself Online 
NEW YORK - An interesting phenomenon is happening to health care in the United States , quite apart from all the noise about changes to the country &apos;s system of health insurance : individuals are starting to take charge of their own health and trying to avoid needing care in the first place . 
Just as people long ago moved from institutional , mainframe computers to personal computers , they are starting to make the same move from institutional to individual tools with their health - not for treating serious diseases such as cancer , to be sure , but for everyday monitoring and prevention . 
A variety of trends are coming together to make this happen . 
First , it is becoming apparent that many health problems are self-induced : too much unhealthy food and drink , too much smoking , too little sleep or exercise . 
There is nothing new about that insight , but now it is easier to keep track of personal behavior . 
Just as we can use financial software to manage our money , we can now use a variety of software tools to monitor our own behavior and bodily statistics . 
Many of these tools are things people first designed for themselves . 
For example , J.J. Allaire founded the weight-loss Lose It ! iPhone app for himself and has gone from 195 to 170 pounds ( 88 to 77 kilos ) and gained some 4.5 million users in the process . 
Like the founders of the Homebrew Computer Club , a seminal group of Berkeley computer geeks who got together in the 1980 &quot; s , many started by rigging up gadgets and later realized that they had come across a commercial opportunity . 
Many of these new &quot; homebrew health &quot; people meet at so-called Quantified Self Meetups , where some people demonstrate their software and others come to learn or compare data with others . 
The tools they use include everything from pedometers / accelerometers that monitor footsteps and motion ( from Nike , FitBit and others ) to sleep monitors ( MyZeo ) , pulse and heart monitors , and glucose monitors ( mostly for diabetics ) . 
People also count and calculate their food consumption . 
Just as you can use your computer to manage your finances according to a budget , so can you use it to manage your body . 
The hope is that the data may help you to modify your behavior in the right direction . 
In my own case , I behave pretty well already : I swim for 50 minutes a day , I floss regularly , I eat sensibly , and so forth . 
But now that I use the MyZeo sleep monitor ( I sleep fine ! ) , I have noticed a marginal change in my own behavior when I am out at night . 
Sometimes , I am more motivated to leave early , anticipating extra sleep points in the morning ! 
It is a small thing , but the kind of change that adds up over time . 
Potentially even more effective are social tools , using so-called &quot; game dynamics . &quot; 
These are services that make health into a serious game where others can reinforce your willpower . 
Imagine a health club that does not threaten you , but rather sends a message : &quot; Juan and Alice will be waiting for you to join them lifting weights today at 4 p.m. &quot; 
Or &quot; Your team is only four points behind the Blue team . 
Please come and help us win . &quot; 
An existing service in which I plan to invest , www.GetUpandMove.me , allows you to challenge a friend : &quot; I will swim for 50 minutes if Alice runs around the block four times . &quot; 
The challenge is posted on Facebook or Twitter , ideally soliciting encouragement from your friends . 
Right now , this market is incoherent , much like the early days of the personal computer . 
The different applications do not talk to one another ; it is difficult to match your exercise against your sleeping patterns , or to share data with other people . 
But that is the excitement : there are many companies at early stages , all looking for money and partners . 
Not all of them will survive ; with luck , some of them may merge . 
Those with great technology and lousy marketing will find others with lousy technology and great marketing . 
The companies with back-end standards will create interfaces to a couple of the leading applications ; then other applications will tie themselves into those back-ends . 
How will all this be paid for ? 
In the beginning , early adopters will pay for most of these tools and services directly ; others will be sponsored by advertisers . 
It would be good to believe that they will be effective , but so far we have little proof . 
A vendor &apos;s testimonial that nine out of 10 , or 99 out of 100 , customers are satisfied with the results will hardly be convincing , because those who fail to improve will have less interest in participating . 
More convincing will be data shared by individuals and collected ( with permission ) by third parties . 
At some point , employers , who are interested in healthy , motivated employees and lower health costs ( but demand a lower level of proof than insurance companies and governments ) , are likely to come in , based on these informal data-collection efforts and their own pilot programs . 
One part of me resists that : good health should be something that people do for themselves . 
As a taxpayer , I would rather pay to foster other people &apos;s good behavior than pay more for the consequences of their bad behavior .
