A Hard Look at a Soft Global Economy 
MILAN - The global economy is settling into a slow-growth rut , steered there by policymakers &quot; inability or unwillingness to address major impediments at a global level . 
Indeed , even the current anemic pace of growth is probably unsustainable . 
The question is whether an honest assessment of the impediments to economic performance worldwide will spur policymakers into action . 
Since 2008 , real ( inflation-adjusted ) cumulative growth in the developed economies has amounted to a mere 5-6 % . 
While China &apos;s GDP has risen by about 70 % , making it the largest contributor to global growth , this was aided substantially by debt-fueled investment . 
And , indeed , as that stimulus wanes , the impact of inadequate advanced-country demand on Chinese growth is becoming increasingly apparent . 
Growth is being undermined from all sides . 
Leverage is increasing , with some $ 57 trillion having piled up worldwide since the global financial crisis began . 
And that leverage - much of it the result of monetary expansion in most of the world &apos;s advanced economies - is not even serving the goal of boosting long-term aggregate demand . 
After all , accommodative monetary policies can , at best , merely buy time for more durable sources of demand to emerge . 
Moreover , a protracted period of low interest rates has pushed up asset prices , causing them to diverge from underlying economic performance . 
But while interest rates are likely to remain low , their impact on asset prices probably will not persist . 
As a result , returns on assets are likely to decline compared to the recent past ; with prices already widely believed to be in bubble territory , a downward correction seems likely . 
Whatever positive impact wealth effects have had on consumption and deleveraging cannot be expected to continue . 
The world also faces a serious investment problem , which the low cost of capital has done virtually nothing to overcome . 
Public-sector investment is now below the level needed to sustain robust growth , owing to its insufficient contribution to aggregate demand and productivity gains . 
The most likely explanation for this public investment shortfall is fiscal constraints . 
And , indeed , debt and unfunded non-debt liabilities increasingly weigh down public-sector balance sheets and pension funds , eroding the foundations of resilient , sustainable growth . 
But if the best way to reduce sovereign over-indebtedness is to achieve higher nominal GDP growth ( the combination of real growth and inflation ) , cutting investment - a key ingredient in a pro-growth-strategy - is not a sound approach . 
Instead , budget rules should segregate public investment , thereby facilitating a differential response in fiscal consolidation . 
Increased public-sector investment could help to spur private-sector investment , which is also severely depressed . 
In the United States , investment barely exceeds pre-crisis levels , even though GDP has risen by 10 % . 
And the US is not alone . 
Clearly , deficient aggregate demand has played a role by reducing the incentive to expand capacity . 
In some economies , structural rigidities adversely affect investment incentives and returns . 
Similarly , regulatory opacity - and , more broadly , uncertainty about the direction of economic policy - has discouraged investment . 
And certain types of shareholder activism have bred short-termism on the part of firms . 
There is also an intermediation problem . 
Large pools of savings in sovereign wealth funds , pension funds , and insurance companies could be used , for example , to meet emerging economies &quot; huge financing needs for infrastructure and urbanization . 
But the channels for such investment - which could go a long way toward boosting global growth - are clogged . 
Meanwhile , technological and market forces have contributed to job polarization , with the middle-income bracket gradually deteriorating . 
Automation , for example , seems to have spurred an unexpectedly rapid decline in routine white- and blue-collar jobs . 
This has resulted in stagnating median incomes and rising income inequality , both of which constrain the private-consumption component of aggregate demand . 
Even the one factor that has effectively increased disposable incomes and augmented demand - sharply declining commodity prices , particularly for fossil fuels - is ultimately problematic . 
Indeed , for commodity-exporting countries , the fall in prices is generating fiscal and economic headwinds of varying intensity . 
Inflation - or the lack of it - presents further challenges . 
Price growth is well below targets and declining in many countries . 
If this turns to full-blown deflation , accompanied by uncontrolled rising real interest rates , the risk to growth would be serious . 
Even very low inflation hampers countries &quot; ability to address over-indebtedness . 
And there is little sign of inflationary pressure , even in the US , which is near &quot; full &quot; employment . 
Given such large demand shortfalls and output gaps , it should surprise no one that even exceptionally generous monetary conditions have proved insufficient to bolster inflation . 
With few options for fighting deflation , countries have resorted to competitive devaluations . 
But this is not an effective strategy for capturing a larger share of tradable global demand if everyone is doing it . 
And targeting exchange-rate competitiveness doesn &apos;t address the aggregate demand problem . 
If the global economy remains on its current trajectory , a period of intense volatility could destabilize a number of emerging economies , while undermining development efforts worldwide . 
That &apos;s why policymakers must act now . 
For starters , governments must recognize that central banks , however well they have served their economies , cannot go it alone . 
Complementary reforms are needed to maintain and improve the transmission channels of monetary policy and avoid adverse side effects . 
In several countries - such as France , Italy , and Spain - reforms designed to increase structural flexibility are also crucial . 
Furthermore , impediments to higher and more efficient public- and private-sector investment must be removed . 
And governments must implement measures to redistribute income , improve the provision of basic services , and equip the labor force to take advantage of ongoing shifts in the economic structure . 
Generating the political will to get even some of this done will be no easy feat . 
But an honest look at the sorry state - and unpromising trajectory - of the global economy will , one hopes , help policymakers do what &apos;s needed .
