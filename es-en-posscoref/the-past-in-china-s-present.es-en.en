The Past in China \ u0027s Present 
What is a reasonable view of China &apos;s recent history ? 
To put it crudely : does it matter that the Chinese Communist Party killed millions upon millions people , desecrated the environment and deeply wounded China &apos;s traditional culture ? 
Chinese intellectuals tend to avoid the issue , shrugging it off as irrelevant and anyway too unpleasant to contemplate . 
We need to look ahead and not back , they say . 
Things are finally moving in the right direction and let &apos;s not , please , do anything that may upset that hopeful movement . 
I don &apos;t think it is that simple . 
The party in power in China today is the same as the one that did so much harm to China and to millions of Chinese . 
It no longer practices the policies that led to multiple disasters . 
But it has not formally reneged on its core beliefs or canonical texts , and the man responsible for more deaths than most people in history is still officially revered ( though it is nowadays admitted that he did in fact commit a few &quot; mistakes &quot; ) . 
The party &apos;s leadership technique , a form of Leninism , remains basically unchanged . 
There are millions of people in China today whose lives were devastated by the Communist regime . 
If you include parents , children and relations of the prime victims , you probably get a hundred million or more . 
It is reasonable to believe that they are angry , feel humiliated or wronged , or all of the above . 
A lot of people feeling this way is not good for any society . 
To say , as surprisingly often happens , at least outside China , that this may be an issue in the Baltics and the Balkans but not in China because &quot; the Chinese &quot; somehow do not feel such things , seems to me , frankly , to be racist . 
No nation that so energetically suppresses so many things about its recent past , which everyone knows to be true , can be a great nation . 
Such actions demand that a government habituate its people to a level of hypocrisy that will eventually find its way into other aspects of life . 
Nor will China attain that genuine respect from the outside world that its leaders and its people ( on that score , at least , there seems to be agreement ) so desperately crave , until a genuine and open reassessment of the past takes place . 
Not until then can China be truly at peace with itself and with the world . 
While much of the communist party &apos;s view of history is now discredited , it is also true that competing views of the past are not allowed . 
So the past continues to fester . 
Some say that reassessing the past would be too dangerous because in China so many people did so many appalling things to so many others . 
The place would explode if the truth came out about what actually happened in villages during land reform and the various stages of collectivization during and after the revolution ; or about who persecuted whom during the &quot; anti-rightist campaign &quot; in 1957 ; or about how many millions died during the great famine induced by the disastrous policies of the &quot; great leap forward &quot; a few years later ; or who denounced whom in the universities and residence committees during the &quot; cultural revolution &quot; of the late sixties . 
Reassessing the past is certainly difficult and doubtless painful . 
No country &apos;s history can be written in black and white . 
But in the long run China cannot avoid this reckoning . 
It finally happened even in the USSR , where - to take but one example - disclosure of the secret protocols of the Molotov / Ribbentrop pact was both a result of and a further catalyst of democratization in the late 1980 &apos;s . 
Such a process has now started in Taiwan . 
Compared to China , it must be said to have started even in Japan . 
What reason is there to believe that China might forever keep itself exempt ? 
One may well despair about getting these points across in China , but as outsiders we must insist on not betraying ourselves - at least . 
In dealing with official China it is often necessary to &quot; sup with the devil , &quot; yes , but we need not also flatter him and pretend that we do not know his past .
