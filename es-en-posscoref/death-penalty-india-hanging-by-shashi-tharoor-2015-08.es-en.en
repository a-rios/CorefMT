A Hanging in India 
NEW DELHI - On July 30 , Yakub Memon , a chartered accountant and the brother of a notorious gangster now living in self-imposed exile , was hanged for complicity in the planning and execution of serial bomb blasts that killed 257 people in Mumbai in 1993 . 
The hanging , India &apos;s first in three years , has prompted reactions ranging from dismay to scarcely concealed bloodlust . 
To be sure , no one suggests that India &apos;s judicial system did not function properly in Memon &apos;s case . 
He was convicted according to due process of law , and his punishment was in accordance with valid statutes . 
During his 21 years behind bars , Memon exhausted every possible appeal available to him , including one for presidential clemency . 
The Supreme Court even held an emergency hearing at 2 : 30 in the morning , just hours before the execution was set to occur , before deciding to allow it to proceed . 
But the question remains : Should capital punishment be on the books at all ? 
As an opposition legislator , I attracted considerable opprobrium for voicing my opinion , on the morning of Memon &apos;s hanging , that it should not be . 
I expressed my sadness that our government has killed a human being , whatever his crimes may have been . 
State-sponsored killing diminishes us all , I added , by reducing us to murderers , just like those we are punishing . 
My view is not popular in India , and my own party disclaimed my statement . 
Data collected by the Death Penalty Project at Delhi &apos;s National Law University demonstrate conclusively that there is no statistical correlation between applying the death penalty and preventing murder . 
This evidence echoes similar findings in other countries . 
My statements were also motivated by problems with the way capital punishment is imposed in India . 
The Supreme Court has declared that the death penalty should be applied only in the &quot; rarest of the rare &quot; cases . 
And , indeed , the last three executions in the country stemmed from terrorist offenses that threatened or took a large number of lives . 
But the decision to impose capital punishment remains highly subjective . 
Indeed , whether the death penalty is meted out depends on a number of variables , beginning with judicial and social biases . 
Public outrage - potentially fueled by inflammatory media coverage - can push for a harsher sentence , especially in cases relating to terrorism or crimes against women . 
Economic status also comes into play , with poor criminals being executed much more often than wealthy ones , not least because they cannot afford high-quality legal representation . 
And the president &apos;s decision to commute a sentence is subjective . 
A 1983 case held that one way to determine whether a crime meets the &quot; rarest of the rare &quot; requirement is whether the community &apos;s &quot; collective conscience &quot; has been &quot; so shocked &quot; that it expects those wielding judicial power to inflict the death penalty , regardless of their personal opinions . 
From 2010 to 2013 , 436 death sentences were handed down by lower courts . 
Of those , 280 were commuted to life imprisonment , with many of the other cases likely to remain in limbo for decades . 
As for the death sentences that have already been carried out - two in that four-year period - it is impossible to ascertain the objective criteria that made the crimes in question more heinous or &quot; rarer &quot; than those that did not merit execution . 
Ambiguity and subjectivity have no place in matters of life and death . 
Yet , when it comes to the imposition of capital punishment , both are prominent . 
Just a couple of weeks before Memon &apos;s execution , India &apos;s Law Commission , a government body composed of retired judges and legal experts that works for legal reform , organized consultations to assess the effectiveness of the provisions governing the death penalty in India and the purpose of the penalty itself . 
Unsurprisingly , based on the evidence and the opinions presented at the Law Commission &apos;s hearings , there was a general consensus that the courts are unable to adopt a fair and non-discriminatory approach to the death penalty , and support for its abolition was overwhelming . 
That will not happen any time soon . 
The Indian public overwhelmingly supports the death penalty , especially for convicted terrorists . 
The debate over Memon &apos;s hanging was often emotional , with media interviewing survivors of the Mumbai blasts . 
Moreover , it has been suggested that the alternative to the death penalty - life imprisonment - would make India vulnerable to hijackings and other assaults by terrorist groups attempting to free their jailed comrades . 
In the face of such security concerns , my argument that taking a human life is wrong , and that the state should not compound criminal wrongdoing with its own , found little resonance . 
Globally , India is part of a dwindling minority . 
More than 130 countries have abolished the death penalty . 
Twenty-five countries have it on the books , but have not executed anyone for decades . 
That leaves roughly 30 countries that still apply it . 
India &apos;s membership in this group has international repercussions ; for example , European Union countries will not extradite criminals to countries where they may face execution . 
It may be tempting to declare that anyone who kills ( or participates in killing ) innocent people does not deserve to live . 
India &apos;s greatest son Mahatma Gandhi observed that &quot; an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind . &quot; 
For now , India remains blind to the case for abolishing the death penalty . 
One day , I am sure , it will see the light . 
Until then , the lonely battle for its abolition must continue .
