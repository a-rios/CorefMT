The Emerging World &apos;s Vaccine Pioneers 
SEATTLE - Vaccines work wonders . 
They prevent disease from striking , which is better than treating it after the fact . 
They are also relatively cheap and easy to deliver . 
Yet millions of children do not get them . 
This has always been stunning to me . 
When we started the Gates Foundation 15 years ago , we assumed that all of the obvious steps were already being taken , and that we would have to go after the expensive or unproven solutions . 
In fact , delivering basic vaccines is still one of our top priorities . 
As I look ahead to 2014 , I am more optimistic than ever about the progress that we can make using the power of vaccines to give all children - wherever they live - a healthy start to life . 
We have new resources from generous donors worldwide . 
We are developing new and better vaccines to protect kids from deadly diseases . 
One of the most exciting - and often overlooked - developments in the global push to give all children access to immunization is the growing role of emerging-country vaccine suppliers . 
Countries like Brazil , China , and India have faced many health and development challenges of their own , and they have made tremendous progress . 
Now they are using their experience and technical capacity to help other countries make similar progress . 
You have probably never heard of many of the pharmaceutical companies - Serum Institute of India , Bharat Biotech , Biological E , China National Biotec Group , and Bio-Manguinhos , to name just a few - that have become some of our most valuable partners in global health . 
By harnessing the same innovative spirit that transformed emerging markets into manufacturing hubs for everything from cars to computers , these companies have become leaders in supplying the world with high quality , low-cost vaccines . 
The increased competition and new manufacturing approaches created by these companies have made it possible to protect a child against eight major diseases - including tetanus , whooping cough , polio , and tuberculosis - for less than $ 30 . 
Serum Institute produces a higher volume of vaccines than any other company in the world and has played a key role in cutting costs and boosting volumes . 
Thanks to the efforts of these suppliers and their close partnerships with the GAVI Alliance , multinational vaccine manufacturers , and international donors , more than 100 million children a year - more than ever before - are being immunized . 
As more suppliers enter the market and stimulate competition with innovative manufacturing techniques , prices will likely drop even further . 
Consider the progress that has been made with the lifesaving pentavalent vaccine , which protects a child against diphtheria , tetanus , whooping cough , hepatitis B , and haemophilus influenza type b ( Hib ) - all in one dose . 
When the GAVI Alliance first introduced it in 2001 , there was one supplier and the cost was $ 3.50 per dose . 
As demand for the vaccine grew , GAVI encouraged other suppliers to enter the market , and the price tumbled . 
Now there are five suppliers , and Biological E , an Indian pharmaceutical company , announced earlier this year that it would offer the vaccine for just $ 1.19 per dose . 
We have also seen major emerging countries invest in biomedical technology to supply developing countries with new vaccines . 
India &apos;s Department of Biotechnology and Bharat Biotech announced plans this year to release a new vaccine against rotavirus - which kills hundreds of thousands of children - for $ 1 per dose , significantly cheaper than existing vaccines . 
Likewise , a Chinese biotech company won approval in October from the World Health Organization to bring to market an improved vaccine protecting children against Japanese encephalitis . 
The same month , Brazil &apos;s top biomedical research and development center , Bio-Manguinhos , in partnership with the Gates Foundation , announced plans to produce a combined measles and rubella vaccine . 
When I first got involved in global health more than 15 years ago , these kinds of announcements were rare . 
The vaccine field was dominated by a handful of multinational pharmaceutical companies in rich countries , and the entire sector suffered from a lack of competition . 
Today , emerging-country manufacturers produce about 50 % of vaccines purchased by United Nations agencies for use in the developing world , up from less than 10 % in 1997 . 
The contributions of emerging-country vaccine producers often complement the work of their counterparts in developed countries . 
In fact , some of the most innovative ideas have come from their combined efforts . 
The Gates Foundation supported a major partnership between the Serum Institute of India and SynCo Bio Partners , a Dutch vaccine producer , to produce a low-cost vaccine to protect more than 450 million people in Africa from meningitis . 
This year , Biological E announced two major partnerships with multinational vaccine manufacturers . 
A joint partnership with GlaxoSmithKline will produce a six-in-one vaccine protecting children against polio and other infectious diseases ; another , with Novartis , will produce two vaccines that will protect millions of people in the developing world from typhoid and paratyphoid fevers . 
Despite all of this progress , more must be done to target the 22 million children , mainly in the poorest countries , who do not have access to lifesaving vaccines . 
Without protection against deadly diseases like measles , pneumonia , and rotavirus , many of these children are being denied a chance to grow up healthy , attend school , and lead productive lives . 
Their countries lose , too . 
Disease robs a poor country of the energy and talents of its people , raises treatment costs , and stymies economic growth . 
We live in a world where we have the power to correct this injustice . 
We have the knowhow to produce effective vaccines , make them affordable , and deliver them to the children who need them . 
Emerging-country vaccine suppliers are a critical part of this process . 
Thanks to their contributions , we are moving closer to the day when all children can have a healthy start to life .
