The United States and the Test Ban Treaty 
Two weeks before President George W. Bush takes office , the uncertainty that surrounded his election has been replaced by concerns about the impact his presidency will have on America &apos;s foreign policy . 
America &apos;s allies and adversaries alike are looking for evidence of continuity or change in the new president &apos;s approach . 
One key test will be the new administration &apos;s actions on nuclear nonproliferation in general and on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in particular . 
A year ago , President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright asked me to serve as their Special Advisor for the Test Ban Treaty . 
The US Senate had recently voted against the Treaty &apos;s ratification . 
I was asked to conduct a quiet , low-key dialogue with Senators in order to sort out the complex issues in the debate and think about what should be done . 
To this end , I met with Democratic and Republican Senators and consulted with senior administration representatives , laboratory officials , scientists and other experts with widely disparate views on ratification . 
I listened to their concerns and sought their suggestions . 
My consultations assured me that there is broad bipartisan support within the US for strengthening American leadership of a comprehensive international response to the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
I am more convinced than ever that the Test Ban Treaty is an integral - even indispensable - component of global nonproliferation efforts . 
I hope that the Bush administration will revisit the Treaty in the context of its importance to combating the spread of nuclear weapons . 
This week , I submitted to President Clinton a series of recommendations that may help the incoming administration give favorable consideration to revisiting the Treaty . 
These recommendations focus on four principal concerns raised by Treaty opponents : questions about its value to the non-proliferation regime ; the potential for cheating ; its impact on the US nuclear deterrent ; and the uncertainties associated with the Treaty &apos;s indefinite duration . 
Although too numerous to list here , the broad objectives of these recommendations are to : 
路 Increase bipartisan and allied support for a carefully coordinated comprehensive nuclear nonproliferation program ; 
路 Enhance US capabilities to detect and deter nuclear testing and other aspects of nuclear proliferation ; 
路 Improve the management of potential risks associated with the long-term reliability and safety of the US nuclear deterrent ; 
路 Address concerns about the Test Ban Treaty &apos;s indefinite duration through a joint legislative-executive review of its net value for national security ten years after US ratification and at regular intervals thereafter . 
America recognizes that it has a deep responsibility to join with like-minded nations in leading global nonproliferation efforts . 
US leadership is essential to the success here , as is the Test Ban Treaty . 
Banning nuclear tests contributes to an effective nonproliferation policy predicated on the skillful use of a variety of political , diplomatic and economic responses to proliferation problems . 
It helps to constrain further development and proliferation of advanced nuclear weapons and strengthens political support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
It will make it easier for America and its friends to mobilize international support for other important nonproliferation measures , including tighter export controls and strengthened safeguards on civilian nuclear programs if the US were part of the Test Ban Treaty regime . 
The spread of nuclear weapons is unquestionably among the greatest threats to global security . 
Now more than ever , proliferation threatens to heighten regional tensions and multiply devastation should war break out . 
One need look no further than the Middle East or South Asia to see the potential for catastrophe . 
If unthinkable disasters in these and other regions are to be averted , America must exercise clear and consistent leadership to sustain global support for nonproliferation efforts . 
Around the world , some viewed the Senate vote against the Test Ban Treaty as a sign that the US might be walking away from its traditional leadership . 
I am confident that this is not the case . 
The Senate and the Clinton administration have demonstrated their support for nuclear test restraints by maintaining the US moratorium on nuclear testing begun under President Bush in 1992 and by continuing to fund and participate in efforts to complete the Treaty &apos;s verification regime . 
These efforts should be continued by the incoming administration . 
Ultimately , this will not be enough . 
The global community &apos;s initial reaction to the Senate vote was muted somewhat by signs that the administration and key senators wanted to build bipartisan support for eventual reconsideration of the Treaty . 
Other nations will , of course , afford the new administration time to review these issues . 
But they will soon want to see concrete signs of progress toward ratification . 
Extended delay is unlikely to be met with extended tolerance . 
Whether this can be averted depends in part on whether the Bush administration decides to pursue a bipartisan and deliberate reconsideration of the Treaty by the Senate and whether the Treaty will be viewed in isolation or within the context of a comprehensive nonproliferation strategy . 
Ratification should not be expected to happen quickly , as the Bush administration and the Senate will need to become convinced that the benefits of the Treaty &apos;s impact on nonproliferation outweigh the potential risks . 
I am confident that the recommendations included in my report set forth a balanced , responsible approach to mitigating these risks without renegotiating the Treaty . 
I hope that the new administration and Congress will consider implementing my recommendations at the earliest date possible as a means of facilitating a bipartisan approach to nonproliferation while reassuring the international community of America &apos;s continued leadership in this area .
