Central Banking &apos;s New Face 
LONDON - A changing of the guard is underway at many of the world &apos;s leading central banks . 
Haruhiko Kuroda is now installed as the governor of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , faced with the daunting task of ending two decades of stagnation . 
Mark Carney , the Bank of Canada &apos;s current governor , who is set to take over as the governor of the Bank of England ( BoE ) in July , is already making his presence felt in British monetary-policy debates . 
And in the United States , the expected conclusion of Ben Bernanke &apos;s term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in January is already inviting speculation about his successor . 
The only holdouts among the world &apos;s leading economies are the eurozone and China . 
But that does not necessarily imply constancy . 
Mario Draghi has been the president of the European Central Bank for barely a year , and the governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China , Zhou Xiaochuan , was almost replaced when he reached retirement age in February . 
Twenty years ago , such developments would have interested mostly bankers and businesspeople . 
But , since the global financial crisis , the need to revive and sustain economic growth in the US , the United Kingdom , and Japan - and to avoid financial collapse in the eurozone - has prompted major central banks to be more outspoken and pursue more aggressive monetary policies , including unconventional measures like quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
As a result , many central bankers have become household names ; some even have tabloid nicknames , like &quot; super Mario &quot; Draghi . 
This new prominence has also forced some central bankers to reassess their decision-making processes . 
In Japan , outsiders recently got a rare glimpse into the BOJ &apos;s activities when minutes of a policy meeting were leaked . 
Likewise , the accidental release a day early of the minutes from the Fed &apos;s March rate-setting meeting to more than 100 people , including banking executives , congressional aides , and bank lobbyists , raised questions about how the bank controls the disclosure of privileged information . 
In fact , the Fed has been under increasing scrutiny since 2008 , when near-zero nominal interest rates drove it to become the first central bank to adopt QE . 
In a push to reduce the cost of borrowing , the Fed purchased long-term assets in the market , injecting liquidity into the financial system . 
The BoE and the ECB have since adopted similar measures . 
In early April , the BOJ announced plans to unleash the most aggressive bond-buying program of all , promising to inject $ 1.4 trillion into the economy over the next two years in order to meet an inflation target of 2 % . 
This is monetary policy on steroids , and , to opponents of inflation-inducing money creation , it amounts to playing with fire . 
But , for Japan , which has been struggling with deflation for a generation , it is a risk worth taking . 
Whether Kuroda &apos;s assault will bolster domestic consumption and investment remains to be seen . 
Unconventional measures are part of a broader transformation of monetary policymaking . 
In addition to becoming bolder and more expansive , it has become increasingly intertwined with fiscal policy . 
This is most explicit in Japan , where monetary policy is a central component of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s economic strategy , dubbed &quot; Abenomics , &quot; implying collaboration between the government and the central bank . 
Does this undermine central-bank independence by amounting to a de facto subordination of unelected technocrats to elected politicians ? 
Arguably , Japan is an exceptional case , with the constraint of the zero bound on nominal interest rates demanding , at long last , a deviation from conventional measures . 
In Europe , however , Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has criticized the ECB for overstepping its mandate with its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program , through which Draghi aims to fulfill his pledge to guarantee the euro &apos;s survival . 
As a result , questions about the role of monetary policy and the independence and accountability of central banks , once confined to rarefied academic discussions , are fixtures of broad policy debate . 
But , rather than try to define a single approach , central bankers should aim to develop individualized approaches within the orthodox monetary-policy framework , which revolves around price stability and independence . 
For example , the Fed &apos;s mandate dictates that price stability can be explicitly linked to active support for GDP growth and employment ; for the BoE and the ECB , it can be a condition for achieving the broader goal of sustainable growth and employment . 
As long as politicians observe the rule of non-interference - at least publicly - central banks will be perceived as unconstrained by political interests . 
The BOJ , by demonstrating that aggressive money creation is a legitimate approach to fighting deflation , has broken previously sacrosanct conventions . 
At the same time , it has taken the unprecedented step of incorporating monetary policy into a comprehensive economic strategy based on coordination among different policy areas and their associated institutions . 
This integrated approach could prove effective in countries where the real economy and the financial sector are closely linked , ensuring the timely , orderly implementation of policies , while preventing adverse spillovers . 
Such coordination would infringe on central-bank independence no more than multilateral cooperation undermines the sovereignty of the countries involved . 
While the impact of Abenomics on Japan &apos;s economy remains to be seen , its impact on debates about monetary policy and the relationship between central banks and governments is already becoming apparent . 
One hopes that Carney will follow this trend of challenging conventional wisdom at the BoE . 
A new era of active and varied monetary policy may have begun , with potential benefits for all .
