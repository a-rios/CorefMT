America &apos;s Election and the Global Economy 
STANFORD - As America &apos;s elections approach , with President Barack Obama slightly in front of his Republican challenger , former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , pollsters still rate the races for control of the presidency and the United States Senate too close to call , with the House of Representatives likely to remain in Republican hands . 
The differences between the candidates are considerable , and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy , although enactment of their programs will depend on the makeup of Congress . 
The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarized as follows : 
Spending . 
Obama has dramatically increased spending . 
He would likely continue many of his temporary programs ( as Milton Friedman once observed , &quot; There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program . &quot; ) ; double down on having government pick winners and losers in green energy ; expand spending on education and infrastructure ; and substantially reduce defense expenditures . 
Romney , by contrast , favors limiting overall federal spending , currently 24 % of GDP , to 20 % , and keeping defense at 4 % . 
He wants private markets , not government , to choose winning firms and technologies . 
Democrats oppose most nondefense spending cuts , arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract . 
That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy . 
If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers , as Romney proposes , thrift would likely be expansionary . 
For example , federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980 &quot; s to the late 1990 &quot; s in the US , and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada - that is , through periods of strong economic growth . 
Taxes . 
Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages , capital gains , dividends , interest , and estates , especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses . 
Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax . 
By contrast , Romney would reduce America &apos;s corporate tax rate ( the highest in the OECD ) to 25 % and tax American multinationals on a territorial , rather than a worldwide , basis in order to increase their tax competitiveness . 
He would also lower personal tax rates by 20 % , and make up lost revenue by limiting tax deductions and credits , particularly at the upper end , thereby raising about 18.5 % of GDP , just above the historical average , at full employment . 
Romney &apos;s fiscal plan thus reduces deficits sufficiently to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio . 
He favors a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution , and hopes to balance the budget over eight years . 
Obama , by contrast , would run larger deficits - his spending increase is much larger than his tax increase - which imply large tax hikes in the future . 
Moreover , he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney , because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending . 
Entitlements . 
Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and Social Security , whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt . 
Vice President Joe Biden has even said that &quot; no changes &quot; to Social Security are to be made . 
Romney supports gradually increasing retirement ages , a premium-support model for Medicare , and shifting Medicaid ( health insurance for the poor ) to the states via block grants . 
The Obama campaign is pummeling Romney on Medicare , and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution . 
The Obama policy would thus lead to ever-higher deficits and debt ratios well over 100 % of GDP , a level that numerous studies imply would reduce US economic growth by one-third or more and might induce a sovereign-debt crisis . 
Some observers suggest that Obama &apos;s unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax . 
Trade . 
Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization . 
The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled , and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office . 
Romney is a proponent of free trade , but has said that he would be tougher on China &apos;s trade practices and currency policies . 
Regulation . 
Obama wants to expand federal command-and-control regulation further ( though the courts have stopped his extension of some regulatory powers ) . 
Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama &apos;s major health-care , environmental , and financial-services regulations . 
Appointments . 
Every US president appoints thousands of officials , many with considerable power . 
Romney has said that he would not reappoint Ben Bernanke as Fed Chairman ( likely candidates : economists Glenn Hubbard , Greg Mankiw , John Taylor , and Martin Feldstein ) . 
Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms , industries , or the entire economy . 
For example , Obama &apos;s appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina , despite the state &apos;s anti-union &quot; right to work &quot; legislation . 
These policies would affect US economic growth , the budget deficit , national saving , and hence global trade and capital flows . 
With larger deficits under Obama than under Romney , America would need more capital from Europe , Latin America , and Asia , while higher taxes and debt would impede US growth and thus undermine these regions &quot; exports . 
Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states ; 
Whoever wins , a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012 . 
Previous legislation , if not reversed , will lead to large abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts , which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts would likely cause a recession in 2013 . 
While a post-election , lame-duck session of Congress will address the fiscal cliff , the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending remain wide and difficult to bridge . 
With uncertainty plaguing Europe &apos;s finances and China slowing , the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy . 
But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it .
