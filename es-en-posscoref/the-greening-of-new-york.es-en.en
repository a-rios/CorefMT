The Greening of New York 
In the coming days , the United States will make a critical decision that has the potential to change America &apos;s standing in the world : whether to approve a $ 537 million grant that will help make New York City the first environmentally sustainable megacity in the twenty-first century . 
Officials at the US Department of Transportation must appreciate that their decision to fund Mayor Michael Bloomberg &apos;s visionary project , called PlaNYC , will determine the quality of air that more than 10 million New Yorkers breathe daily and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions the city coughs into the atmosphere . 
Already , New York City produces more CO2 emissions than all of Norway . 
More importantly , officials must realize that their actions will shape America &apos;s response to the global challenge of unparalleled urbanization and carbon-induced climate change . 
This year , for the first time in human history , more people will live in urban areas than rural communities . 
In the US , the urban population has grown from 97 million in 1950 to 222 million in 2000 . 
Today , nearly 80 % of Americans live in urban areas . 
Such unprecedented and unplanned urbanization wreaks environmental havoc by increasing carbon emissions , since higher population density results in greater automobile and energy use . 
PlaNYC encourages the use of public transportation systems by creating powerful disincentives to automobile use . 
The plan &apos;s proposed congestion charge on automobile use during peak times in certain parts of the city would reduce traffic and generate revenue that would go toward improving public transportation . 
Mayor Bloomberg &apos;s plan comes at the right time for a city burdened by worsening traffic and pollution problems . 
Vehicles cause nearly a fifth of New York City &apos;s CO2 emissions . 
Traffic congestion , in particular , is not only environmentally detrimental ; it also imposes substantial time and resource costs on drivers . 
Americans lose around 3.7 billion hours and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel sitting in traffic jams . 
Due to congestion , New Yorkers face the longest commutes in the US , and their children have the highest rate of asthma hospitalization . 
PlaNYC would impose the congestion charge on the 4.6 % of New York City residents who drive to work , while its benefits would accrue to everyone . 
New Yorkers would enjoy cleaner air , shorter average commuting time , and better public transportation . 
Neither the economy in general , nor the retail sector in particular , should be adversely affected . 
In fact , service and delivery providers in Manhattan , among others , would benefit from shorter travel times and fewer delays . 
However , despite its many advantages , congestion charges face some skepticism . 
Fortunately , we can learn from other cities such as Stockholm , Singapore , and London , which have successfully implemented them . 
In all of these cities , CO2 emissions declined sharply and congestion was significantly reduced , with Singapore experiencing an immediate 45 % drop in traffic . 
These cities have also benefited from more efficient public transportation . 
In London , bus-travel rose by 46 % . 
According to an independent report , almost 60 % of the businesses in London judged the program &apos;s impact on the economy as positive or neutral . 
Automobile dependent countries like America need smart solutions to ensure environmentally sustainable development . 
Having one of the largest urban populations and the highest per capita CO2 emissions , the US has the responsibility - and the means - to lead the world on this front . 
If the US does not act soon , American cities will lag behind not only European capitals , but also developing country cities such as Bogota ( Colombia ) and Curitiba ( Brazil ) , which are already implementing innovative environmentally friendly solutions . 
New York City has always been a global leader in finance , the arts , and many other fields . 
It is an ideal candidate for creating a blueprint for cleaner and more efficient urbanization in the US and the world .
