A Global Civics Lesson 
ISTANBUL - The reality of the world &apos;s epic interdependence is well known . 
We have seen how financial engineering in the United States can determine economic growth in every part of the world ; how carbon-dioxide emissions from China end up influencing crop yields and livelihoods in Vietnam , Bangladesh , the Maldives , and beyond ; how an epidemic in Mexico endangers the rhythm of public life in the US ; or how volcanic ash from Iceland affects travel across Europe . 
We are also familiar with the inherent difficulties of devising and implementing solutions to global problems through nation-states , and have relied on two broad models to deal with this predicament . 
The first is composed of a wide range of creative ad hoc alliances and solutions . 
When standard global public health instruments proved insufficient , for example , we built the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis , AIDS , and Malaria . 
When the Internet became global , its management was turned over to ICANN , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , which enlists the voices of individual Internet users in its governance - a significant departure from intergovernmental multilateralism . 
The US , as the most powerful member of the international system , tends to prefer ad hoc approaches to global governance . 
With its vast resources and alliances , ad hoc solutions allow the US to advance its interests effectively without the entanglements of more enduring rules , customs , and structures . 
Europeans prefer a more systematic reliance on the rule of law , and also on what has come to be known as the global public-goods paradigm . 
Adherents of this view point first and foremost to the existence of certain vital global public goods , climate being the most obvious example . 
By definition , public goods mean a collective-action problem . 
The global public-goods paradigm also implies some commensurability , if not uniformity , in the way we respond to various global collective-action challenges . 
Americans tend to find this expectation of commensurability suffocating , while Europeans find it reassuring and liberating . 
( The developing world has been largely absent in this debate , with notable exceptions in the form of indignation about unfairness built into the status quo , peppered with obstructionism . ) 
Like many other cardinal questions , the tension between these approaches is unlikely to be resolved conclusively . 
We are more likely to live with this tension for a long time , with emphasis shifting back and forth between approaches . 
It would thus be much more worthwhile to focus on a neglected issue : what responsibilities do we all have toward people who happen not to be our compatriots ? 
Both the ad hoc and the global public-goods schools shy away from this question , and yet without at least some working answer , we will lack the compass needed to navigate our increasing global interdependence . 
We need to recognize that global governance is not a technocratic puzzle to be solved by clever institutional design . 
We cannot establish an effective social contract without an explicit understanding of our responsibilities towards each other - and of the rights that emerge alongside those responsibilities . 
The answers are to be found not only in the speeches given at the United Nations General Assembly or at the Davos World Economic Forum , but in the conversations we have with our friends , families , and colleagues . 
We must all consider what responsibilities we are willingly ready to accept , and then discuss our answers with others . 
This will mean starting to imagine - without panic or rush , and with all the care and thoughtfulness that this conversation requires - a global civics . 
Current and probable future levels of global connectivity and interdependence enable and require us to commence this conversation . 
Whether or not we realize it , we have comparable conversations every day . 
For example , every day millions of people drive at high speeds encased in a ton of metal , and they do so extremely close to others who are doing the same thing . 
A slight move of the steering wheel in the wrong direction would wreak havoc , but we cruise carefree , because we have reasonable expectations about the behavior of other drivers . 
Our expectations of other drivers , which serve to mitigate the theoretical risks of driving , can exist because people adhere to a framework of laws , habits , and conventions about how to operate automobiles . 
In an increasingly interdependent world , we need a corresponding global framework to put our minds at relative ease . 
To imagine the shape of global civics , a worthwhile exercise would be to take 15 minutes to consider what we would say to the seven billionth human being - who will join us in less than a thousand days - about the human condition awaiting her . 
This hypothetical conversation would help us take stock of global conditions that we have all helped produce , and would set us on a path toward discovering our core responsibilities to each other and the next generation - the essence of global civics .
