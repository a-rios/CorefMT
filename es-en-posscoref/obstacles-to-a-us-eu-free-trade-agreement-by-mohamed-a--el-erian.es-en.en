Transatlantic Trade &apos;s Transformative Potential 
NEWPORT BEACH - After instant and seemingly coordinated fanfare in Europe and the United States , the proposal for a European Union-US free-trade area has been generating little media attention . 
There are three reasons for this , and all three highlight broader constraints on good national economic policymaking and productive cross-border coordination . 
In his &quot; State of the Union &quot; address in February , US President Barack Obama proposed a &quot; comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership &quot; with Europe based on trade that is &quot; fair and free . &quot; 
His administration regards this as part of a comprehensive approach to generating &quot; good-paying American jobs . &quot; 
Obama &apos;s bold proposal received an immediate and enthusiastic reception in Europe . 
Taking to the airwaves within hours , European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy called the proposal &quot; ground-breaking . &quot; 
Arguing that it could increase Europe &apos;s annual economic growth rate by half a percentage point , they declared that formal negotiations would start quickly . 
At first , there was quite a bit of general interest , and understandably so . 
The proposal involves the world &apos;s two largest economic areas , with national , regional , and global implications . 
Yet , despite the realization that an agreement could fundamentally alter the nature of global trade and production networks , it only took a few weeks for interest to drop off . 
One reason is rooted in initial conditions that limit direct gains from increased trade while widening the scope for tension and conflict . 
Free-trade agreements that promise the greatest benefits are those that link economies characterized by high tariffs , low levels of trade , and little overlap in consumption and production patterns . 
This is not the case for the EU and the US . 
Average tariff levels are only 3 % . 
The EU already accounts for almost 20 % of US imports , and the US for 11 % of EU imports . 
And , given similar per capita income levels and cultural orientations , overlaps in production and consumption are considerable . 
Having said this , there would be immediate upside potential , owing to better resource allocation , more harmonized investment regimes , stronger standards , and the elimination of outdated non-tariff and regulatory barriers . 
Aerospace , auto manufacturing , biotechnology , cosmetics , and pharmaceuticals are among the sectors that stand to gain . 
There is also the potential for reforming inefficient approaches to food and agriculture , particularly in Europe . 
The second reason for waning attention to the proposed partnership speaks to a broader issue : A seemingly endless stream of short-term political dramas has made it extremely difficult for both Europe and the US to focus for long on any secular and structural initiative . 
In Europe , broad-based discussion was undermined by the outcome of the Italian election - just the latest sign of how frustrated citizens in a growing number of countries are rejecting conventional political parties and the political status quo . 
With that , it becomes more difficult to pursue longer-term policy objectives , which merely adds further uncertainty about the precise path of European economic and financial integration . 
In the US , the disruption took the form of yet another fiscal mini-drama . 
With a dysfunctional Congress again letting down the American people , the country is now on the receiving end of a budgetary sequester - another self-manufactured headwind to economic growth , job creation , and progress on reducing income and wealth inequalities . 
Put the two together and you get a barrier to EU-US trade negotiations - one that renders ambitious ( though not entirely unrealistic ) the two-year timeline that has been set for completing the deal . 
The third reason concerns the poor state of global policy dialogue , notwithstanding all the happy talk about global challenges and shared responsibilities . 
Last month &apos;s G-20 meeting ended up as yet another expensive summit lacking sufficient content and follow through . 
Rather than catalyzing constructive policy coordination , it has inadvertently encouraged complacency . 
All three reasons are highly regrettable . 
They underscore the West &apos;s seeming inability to break out of a short-term mindset in order to respond to the risks and opportunities related to historic national and global re-alignments . 
The real promise of freer transatlantic trade consists in its potential to transform global trade , production networks , and multilateral organizations to the benefit of all . 
At the most general level , it would act to rationalize the current system of four poorly functioning blocs - centered on China , Europe , the US , and the rest - to three , and eventually ( and perhaps quite quickly ) to two better-functioning blocs that would have little choice but to work well together : one dominated by China , and the other by the EU / US . 
Such a global structure has the potential to encourage better medium-term alignments to reduce trade barriers , set proper standards , and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation . 
It would facilitate coordination on stronger global rules and principles , including those pertaining to intellectual-property rights and trade in services . 
And it would force multilateral organizations to reform if they wish to retain even the limited relevance that they have now . 
The proposal for freer transatlantic trade is potentially transformational . 
It comes at a time when the West is increasingly being dragged down by short-term disruptions and continued policy inertia . 
Yet the implementation prospects are far from promising . 
The proposal has the capacity to act as a catalyst for adapting policy approaches to current realities ; but it is subject to the dulling forces of twentieth-century mindsets and institutions that are too slow to adapt to twenty-first-century challenges and opportunities .
