The Great American Mirage 
NEW HAVEN - In September 1998 , during the depths of the Asian financial crisis , Alan Greenspan , the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s chairman at the time , had a simple message : the US is not an oasis of prosperity in an otherwise struggling world . 
Greenspan &apos;s point is even closer to the mark today than it was back then . 
Yes , the US economy has been on a weak recovery trajectory over the past three years . 
But at least it &apos;s a recovery , claim many - and therefore a source of ongoing resilience in an otherwise struggling developed world . 
Unlike the Great Recession of 2008-2009 , today there is widespread hope that America has the capacity to stay the course and provide a backstop for the rest of the world in the midst of the euro crisis . 
Think again . 
Since the first quarter of 2009 , when the US economy was bottoming out after its worst postwar recession , exports have accounted for fully 41 % of the subsequent rebound . 
That &apos;s right : with the American consumer on ice in the aftermath of the biggest consumption binge in history , the US economy has drawn its sustenance disproportionately from foreign markets . 
With those markets now in trouble , the US could be quick to follow . 
Three regions have collectively accounted for 83 % of America &apos;s export-led growth impetus over the past three years - Asia , Latin America , and Europe . 
( Since regional and country trade statistics assembled by the US Department of Commerce are not seasonally adjusted , all subsequent comparisons are presented on the basis of a comparable seasonal comparison from the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2012 . ) 
Not surprisingly , Asia led the way , accounting for 33 % of the total US export surge over the past three years . 
The biggest source of this increase came from the 15-percentage-point contribution of Greater China ( the People &apos;s Republic , Taiwan , and Hong Kong ) . 
Needless to say , China &apos;s unfolding slowdown - even under the soft-landing scenario that I still believe is most credible - is taking a major toll on the largest source of America &apos;s export revival . 
The remainder of the Asian-led US export impetus is spread out , led by South Korea , Japan , and Taiwan - all export-led economies themselves and all heavily dependent on a slowing China . 
Latin America provided the second-largest source of America &apos;s export resurgence , accounting for another 28 % of the total gains in US foreign sales over the past three years . 
Brazil and Mexico collectively accounted for 19 percentage points of that increase . 
Growth in both economies is now slowing significantly , especially in Brazil . 
But , given the close linkages between Mexican production and US consumption ( which is now sputtering again ) , any resilience in the Mexican economy could be short-lived . 
Finally , there is the sad case of Europe , which has accounted for 21 % of the cumulative growth in US exports over the past three years . 
Here , the US Commerce Department statistics are not as helpful in pinpointing the source of the impetus , because only a partial country list is published . 
What we do know is that the United Kingdom , Germany , and France - the so-called core economies - collectively accounted for just 3.5 % of total US export growth since early 2009 , with the UK grabbing the bulk of that increase . 
That suggests that most of America &apos;s European export gain was concentrated in the region &apos;s so-called peripheral economies . 
And that is clearly a serious problem . 
Forecasts are always hazardous , but some &quot; what-if &quot; scenarios shed considerable light on what all of this means for the world &apos;s largest economy . 
Since the second quarter of 2009 , US annualized real GDP growth has averaged 2.4 % . 
With roughly 40 % of that increase attributable to exports , that means the remainder of the economy has grown at an anemic 1.4 % pace . 
Under a flat-line export scenario , with no rise in US exports , and if everything else remains the same ( always a heroic assumption ) , overall real GDP growth would converge on that 1.4 % bogey . 
That is a weak growth trajectory by any standard - likely to result in rising unemployment and further deterioration in consumer confidence . 
Alternatively , in a moderate export-downturn scenario , with real exports falling by 5 % over a four-quarter period , real GDP growth could slip below the 1 % &quot; stall speed &quot; threshold - leaving the US economy vulnerable to a recessionary relapse . 
By way of reference , the assumption of a 5 % export downturn pales in comparison with the precipitous 13.6 % decline in real exports that occurred in 2008-2009 . 
As such , this &quot; what if &quot; is a cautiously optimistic assessment of the downside risks stemming from weak external demand . 
All of this underscores one of the more obvious , yet overlooked , implications of an increasingly interdependent world : we are all in it together . 
The euro crisis is a serious shock , and is now producing ripple effects around the world . 
Europe is export-led China &apos;s largest source of external demand ; as China goes , so goes the rest of China-centric Asia ; and , from there , the ripples reach the shores of an increasingly export-dependent US economy . 
As recent weakness in employment and retail sales suggests , that may already be happening . 
Greenspan &apos;s warning in 1998 came at a time when US exports accounted for only about 10.5 % of GDP . 
Today , that share stands at a record-high 14 % , as post-crisis America has made a big bet on an export-led revival . 
The current global slowdown is not on a par with what occurred in the late 1990 &quot; s or the more wrenching shocks of 3-4 years ago - at least not yet . 
But today &apos;s global downturn can hardly be dismissed as unimportant for the US or anyone else . 
In an era of globalization , there are no innocent bystanders . 
There are certainly no oases of prosperity in the face of yet another major shock in the global economy . 
America &apos;s growth mirage is an important case in point .
