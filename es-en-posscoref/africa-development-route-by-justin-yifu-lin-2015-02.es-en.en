Africa &apos;s Path from Poverty 
BEIJING - All low-income countries have the potential for dynamic economic growth . 
We know this because we have seen it happen repeatedly : a poor , agrarian economy transforms itself into a middle- or even high-income urban economy in one or two generations . 
The key is to capture the window of opportunity for industrialization arising from the relocation of light manufacturing from higher-income countries . 
That was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , and it remains true today . 
Japan seized its opportunity in the years following World War II , using labor-intensive industries , such as textiles and simple electronics , to drive its economy until rising labor costs eroded its comparative advantage in those sectors . 
That shift then allowed other low-income Asian economies - South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , and to some extent Malaysia and Thailand - to follow in Japan &apos;s footsteps . 
China , of course , is the region &apos;s most recent traveler along this well-trodden path . 
After more than three decades of breakneck economic growth , it has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries on earth to the world &apos;s largest economy . 
And now that China , too , is beginning to lose its comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries , other developing countries - especially in Africa - are set to take its place . 
Indeed , ever since the Industrial Revolution , the rise of light manufacturing has driven a dramatic rise in national income . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s economic transformation started with textiles . 
In Belgium , France , Sweden , Denmark , Italy , and Switzerland , light manufacturing led the way . 
Similarly , in the United States , cities like Boston , Baltimore , and Philadelphia became centers for producing textiles , garments , and shoes . 
Until recently , few believed that Africa , too , could become a center for modern manufacturing . 
But , with the right policies , there is no reason why African countries could not follow a similar trajectory . 
Consider land-locked Ethiopia , which only ten years ago seemed to be an especially bad bet . 
But then the country built an industrial park near Addis Ababa and invited the Chinese shoemaker Huajian to open a factory there . 
Huajian opened its doors in January 2012 with two production lines and some 600 workers . 
By the end of the year , it had employed 2,000 Ethiopians and doubled the country &apos;s exports of leather shoes . 
Today , the company has 3,500 workers in Ethiopia producing more than two million shoes a year . 
In 2013 , spurred by Huajian &apos;s success , the Ethiopian government created a new industrial park , with space for 22 factory units . 
Within three months , all of them had been leased by export-oriented companies from Turkey , Korea , Taiwan , China , and elsewhere . 
The World Bank has provided $ 250 million to support the continued construction of these industrial parks . 
The Ethiopian success story is just the start . 
As investors learn more about Africa , they will increasingly see what it has to offer . 
Indeed , the cost of labor in Africa is competitive enough that Ethiopia could attract companies from countries as poor as Bangladesh . 
Africa has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs . 
As foreign firms launch operations in the labor-intensive sectors in which Africa has a comparative advantage , they will train the local workforce . 
Some workers will become managers . 
They will become familiar with the technology and learn how to maintain consistent quality in the production line . 
They will establish contacts with international buyers and investors . 
And , eventually , some of them will be able to raise capital and start firms of their own - export companies owned and operated by Africans . 
Mauritius shows the path ahead . 
In the 1970s , the government set up industrial parks to process textiles and garments for export . 
At the time , most of the owners were from Taiwan or Hong Kong ; today , more than 70 % of the island &apos;s industrial companies are locally owned . 
A carefully focused export strategy is crucial . 
The international development community and many African governments want to work toward regional integration , linking the markets of 55 African countries . 
This might have its advantages , but it should not be a priority . 
Africa today accounts for just 1.9 % of global GDP , compared to 21 % for the United States and 23 % for Europe . 
Developing countries must use their limited resources in the most effective way , and there is no question where the most attractive opportunities in Africa are to be found . 
For example , instead of investing heavily in the infrastructure needed for regional integration , a country like Ethiopia would be better off building industrial parks and linking them by road to ports in Djibouti . 
With the right growth strategy , far-reaching change can come within a person &apos;s lifetime - sometimes more than once . 
My native Taiwan is now a high-income economy . 
But when I was born there , in 1952 , the island was poorer than almost every country in Africa . 
Then it happened to me again . 
I moved to mainland China in 1979 , when the country &apos;s per capita income was less than one-third of Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s . 
Today , China has become an upper-middle-income country , and it is on track to become a high-income country by 2020 . 
My hope is that I can witness a third economic transformation in my lifetime , this time in Ethiopia and other countries in Africa . 
If they stay on the tried and tested path of those who have gone before , there is every chance that I will .
