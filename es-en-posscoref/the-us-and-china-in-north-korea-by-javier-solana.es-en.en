The Sino-American Test in North Korea 
MADRID - Repeated threats from North Korea have turned the Korean Peninsula into one of the world &apos;s most dangerous hotspots . 
But the situation also offers an important opportunity : a gain in strategic trust between China and the United States , the two countries with the capacity to resolve the tensions once and for all . 
If they manage to cooperate constructively in order to shape a peace acceptable to all sides , this would make not only Korea , but also the region and the world , a safer place . 
Ten years after opting out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , North Korea clearly possesses nuclear weapons . 
The regime &apos;s nuclear test in February - its third since 2006 - was likely a miniaturized device , which makes the situation even more worrying , given that successful miniaturization is critical for using nuclear weapons in ballistic missiles . 
February &apos;s test provoked another round of United Nations sanctions , drafted by the US and China , triggering an escalation of threats and provocations from the North . 
The tension on the peninsula increased further with the annual joint military exercises conducted by the US and South Korea - especially when American nuclear-capable B-52 and B-2 bombers were added to the drills . 
Nobody wants war on the Korean Peninsula . 
For the North , it would be suicide ; for the South , with its vibrant economy and widening free-trade agreements , the opportunity cost would be particularly high . 
Likewise , regional stability is a prerequisite of China &apos;s stellar economic growth , and military conflict would be a setback for US economic rebirth as well . 
Indeed , with US defense spending finally set to decline after a decade of debt-financed war in Iraq and Afghanistan , America has little fiscal room for an unforeseen military entanglement . 
The US &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia is built on economic opportunities there ; a conflict with unpredictable fallout does not fit the scheme . 
China is the key geostrategic player in resolving the conflict , because it provides North Korea with 90 % of its energy , 80 % of its consumer goods , and 40 % of its food . 
But it is unclear how much influence China &apos;s government holds over Kim Jong-un &apos;s regime . 
Sino-North Korean relations have borne a significant scar since 1991 , when China recognized South Korea without insisting that the US formally recognize the North . 
The North Koreans believe that China sacrificed them for commercial interests , and bilateral relations have yet to recover . 
Nonetheless , China continues to regard North Korea as an important strategic asset , because it serves as a buffer state shielding China &apos;s border from American troops on the peninsula - which has historically been used as an entry point by invading troops . 
China &apos;s ideal solution would therefore be to maintain the status quo while persuading the North to open up - a path of gradual change that avoids open conflict or the regime &apos;s collapse . 
Either of these traumatic outcomes would spell disaster , for both the region and the world . 
First , the regime &apos;s implosion would unleash a massive refugee flow , implying enormous social and economic costs . 
Moreover , Asia remains a continent defined by balance-of-power diplomacy , border conflicts , and historic mistrust , with no multilateral security structures to soften regional tensions . 
Given these conditions , even a small spark could ignite a wildfire . 
In this environment , mistrust of China &apos;s rise as a regional hegemon in much of East Asia only intensifies the need for active Chinese participation in promoting regional stability and peace - a peace framework with Asian roots , acceptable to all parties . 
Only through such efforts will China be able to increase its international legitimacy , thereby minimizing the risk of future conflict . 
It is essential that China and the US work together to resolve the current crisis . 
The US must reiterate clearly that indefinitely prolonging the status quo on the Korean Peninsula would imply a strategic loss for China , and that China must join the international community in its efforts to halt North Korea &apos;s nuclear program . 
This cooperation is the only way to force the North &apos;s hand and put an end to the incessant cycle of crisis and mounting risk . 
The current crisis offers a unique test case for joint handling of international affairs - or , in this case , regional affairs with global consequences - by the world &apos;s two biggest powers . 
During US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s trip to China this month , the two countries pronounced their shared goals : denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and durable peace in the region . 
This is a good starting point . 
Sino-US cooperation on this flashpoint could be a huge step forward in building much-needed bilateral strategic trust . 
While the US tends to segment problems in order to find solutions to each part within a finite period of time , China relies on broad , long-term perspective and views issues as extended , relative processes . 
That is why , in dealing with impoverished , isolated , nuclearized North Korea , where Sino-US cooperation is the only option , the US and China face both a challenge and an opportunity . 
To make the most of it requires a significant boost in mutual strategic trust .
