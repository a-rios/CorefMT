The Hamas Moment 
Hamas &apos;s capture of the Gaza Strip has created , along with Iran , a second radical Islamist state in the Middle East . 
The region , probably the Arab-Israeli conflict , and certainly the Palestinian movement , will never be the same . 
Fatah &apos;s defeat in Gaza is not due to American foreign policy , Israel , or anyone but Fatah itself . 
It is Yasir Arafat &apos;s ultimate legacy , for he encouraged not only terrorist violence against Israel , but also anarchy and corruption within his own organization . 
Most importantly , Arafat failed to resolve the conflict or give his people an alternative vision to one of extreme radicalism and endless fighting . 
By rejecting a compromise peace solution in 2000 that would have created an independent Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem and $ 23 billion in international aid , Arafat made clear that there would be no alternative , moderate scenario for resolving the Palestinians &quot; problems . 
It was clear before the January 2006 elections that Hamas was heading toward a victory . 
Under weak leadership , Fatah did nothing to address its deep-seated divisions and corruption . 
Competing Fatah candidates split the vote , ensuring that Hamas nominees won . 
Even after the defeat , Fatah implemented not a single reform or leadership change . 
Its leaders squabbled , regarding themselves as the sole possible rulers and engaging in wishful thinking that some external factor would hand them whatever they wanted . 
Meanwhile , like communist and fascist parties in the past , Hamas moved forward , with a clear doctrine , relative discipline , and grim determination . 
Fatah &apos;s ideology and practice laid the basis for Hamas to advance . 
With Fatah demonizing Israel , rejecting compromise , demanding total victory , glorifying terrorist violence , and portraying moderation as treason , Hamas merely needed to prove that it was better at pursuing this course . 
No one should underestimate Hamas &apos;s extremism . 
Indeed , the only difference between Hamas and al-Qaeda - though the two groups do not generally work together - is that the latter emphasizes attacks on Western targets , while the former has until now focused on Israel . 
Consequently , Hamas will not moderate its stance , and its victory sets back the chances of Israel-Palestinian peace for decades . 
Buoyed by its triumph , enjoying backing from Syria ( where its headquarters are located ) and Iran , Hamas will pursue its genocidal and openly stated goal : the extinction of Israel and its people . 
Any thought of concession or compromise is gravely mistaken . 
Four specific issues now move to center-stage : the fate of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip , the future of the Fatah-ruled West Bank , the world &apos;s attitude toward Israel , and the strategic impact of Hamas &apos;s victory on the Middle East . 
Until now , while Gazans have suffered from the constant fighting and economic failures brought about by their leaders &quot; policies , they have been left alone in their private lives . 
Hamas might go slower or faster with an &quot; Islamicizing &quot; program . 
Nevertheless , it is determined to transform the lives of those it rules . 
It will kill as it chooses , abolish women &apos;s rights , and indoctrinate schoolchildren with hatred and the ambition to be suicide bombers . 
Gaza has suffered from anarchy ; now it will be under the heel of a ruthless dictatorship . 
For example , when Hamas forces seized the Shati refugee camp , they deliberately executed three women - two teenagers and a 75-year-old - because they were relatives of Fatah officials . 
Those truly concerned with the Palestinians &quot; well-being should direct their criticism at that people &apos;s leaders and seek to protect their human rights in the Gaza Strip . 
Fatah &apos;s rule is still strong in the West Bank , but even the Gaza catastrophe is unlikely to lead it to change its ways . 
Israel &apos;s willingness to work with Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s Fatah regime and resumption of full-scale aid by the United States are intended to consolidate a relatively moderate Palestinian government on the West Bank . 
But , whereas Abbas appointed Salam Fayyad , a veteran economist who is respected in the West , as his new prime minister , he probably should have picked someone capable of being tough , organizing his forces , and fighting back . 
Logically , Fatah should now embrace moderation , crack down on cross-border terrorism , and seek some kind of peace with Israel . 
But Fatah has its own view of what is logical - one that might not coincide with such prescriptions . 
As wildly different as the two cases are , Fatah resembles the French monarchy before the revolution , incapable of learning from experience or taking the steps needed to avoid its own downfall . 
The world cannot save Fatah ; only Fatah can save itself . 
For Israel , of course , developments in Gaza pose a great challenge . 
Israel has long since decided that it has no interest in renewing its control over the Gaza Strip . 
In some ways , Hamas &apos;s coup makes things clearer . 
Gaza is ruled by a completely hostile regime . 
Israel will feel free to retaliate for cross-border attacks and continuing rocket fire at civilian targets within the country . 
At last , the world must recognize that the hopes stirred by the 1990 &quot; s peace process have been completely dashed . 
In effect , Hamas has returned the conflict to the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , when progress toward peace had to await the PLO &apos;s readiness to stop using terrorism and accept Israel &apos;s existence . 
Israel &apos;s survival and right to self-defense now has to be supported internationally , and the slander and demonization of recent years should come to an end . 
The strategic implications for the region are equally grim . 
Hamas &apos;s takeover of Gaza is a victory for the bloc comprising Iran , Syria , and Hezbollah , as well as the separate branches of the Muslim Brotherhood ( of which Hamas is one ) seeking to capture power in their own countries . 
These forces fully comprehend that the most important global contest today is between radical Islamism and the rest of the world . 
The question is when the rest of the world will figure that out .
