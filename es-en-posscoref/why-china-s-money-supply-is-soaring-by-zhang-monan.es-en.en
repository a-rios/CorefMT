Controlling China &apos;s Currency 
BEIJING - It is indisputable that China is over-issuing currency . 
But the reasons behind China &apos;s massive liquidity growth - and the most effective strategy for controlling it - are less obvious . 
The last decade has been a &quot; golden age &quot; of high growth and low inflation in China . 
From 2003 to 2012 , China &apos;s annual GDP growth averaged 10.5 % , while prices rose by only 3 % annually . 
But the unprecedented speed and scale of China &apos;s monetary expansion remain a concern , given that it could still trigger high inflation and lead to asset-price bubbles , debt growth , and capital outflows . 
Data from the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) show that , as of the end of last year , China &apos;s M2 ( broad money supply ) stood at ¥ 97.4 trillion ( $ 15.6 trillion ) , or 188 % of GDP . 
To compare , M2 in the United States amounts to only roughly 63 % of GDP . 
In fact , according to Standard Chartered Bank , China ranks first worldwide in terms of both overall M2 and newly issued currency . 
In 2011 , China accounted for an estimated 52 % of the world &apos;s added liquidity . 
But a horizontal comparison of absolute values is inadequate to assess the true scale of China &apos;s monetary emissions . 
Several other factors must be considered , including China &apos;s financial structure , financing model , savings rate , and stage of economic development , as well as the relationship between currency and finance in China . 
China &apos;s intensive economic monetization is a key factor driving its money-supply growth . 
But China &apos;s sharply rising monetization rate cannot be judged against the high , steady rates of developed countries without bearing in mind that China &apos;s monetization process began much later , and has distinct structural and institutional foundations . 
As China has opened up its economy , deepened reforms , and become increasingly market-oriented , the government has facilitated the continuous monetization of resources - including natural resources , labor , capital , and technology - by ensuring their constant delivery to the market . 
This has fueled rising demand for currency , leading to the expansion of the monetary base , with the money multiplier - that is , the effect on lending by commercial banks - boosting the money supply further . 
And , as GDP growth has become increasingly dependent on government-led investment , currency demand has continued to rise . 
Indeed , the rapid expansion of bank credit needed to finance skyrocketing government-led investment is increasing the amount of liquidity in China &apos;s financial system . 
As a result , in the last four years , China &apos;s M2 , spurred by a stimulus package totaling ¥ 4 trillion in 2008 and 2009 , has more than doubled . 
This trend is exacerbated by the declining efficiency of financial resources in the state sector , a product of the soft budget constraint implied by easily accessible , cheap capital . 
Consequently , maintaining high GDP growth rates requires an ever-increasing volume of credit and a continuously growing money supply . 
So China is stuck in a currency-creating cycle : GDP growth encourages investment , which boosts demand for capital . 
This generates liquidity , which then stimulates GDP growth . 
The key to controlling China &apos;s monetary expansion is to clarify the relationship between currency ( the central bank ) and finance ( the financial sector ) , thereby preventing the government from assuming the role of a second currency-creating body . 
According to Pan Gongsheng , a deputy governor of the PBOC , the relationship between the central bank and the financial sector entails both a division of labor and a system of checks and balances . 
In theory , the financial sector serves as a kind of accountant for the treasury and the government , while the PBOC acts as the government &apos;s cashier . 
In practice , however , the relationship between currency and finance is vague , with both assuming quasi-fiscal functions . 
China &apos;s low official government debt largely reflects the role of currency in assuming quasi-fiscal liabilities - not only the write-off costs incurred from reforming state-owned banks , but also the takeover of banks &quot; bad debts via note financing and the purchase of asset-management companies &quot; bonds . 
These activities both damage the PBOC &apos;s balance sheet and constrain monetary policy . 
At the same time , finance takes on quasi-fiscal functions by excluding government fiscal deposits - government deposits in the national treasury , commercial banks &quot; fiscal savings , and central treasury cash managed through commercial-bank deposits - from the money supply . 
Given the large volume of fiscal deposits - which totaled ¥ 2.4 trillion ( 3.3 % of M2 ) at the end of 2010 - their impact on the money supply cannot be ignored . 
Clarifying the relationship between currency and finance is essential to ensuring that all newly issued currency is backed by assets . 
Only by exerting a harder budget constraint on the state sector , limiting fiscal expansion , and reducing dependence on government-led investment can China &apos;s excessive currency issuance be addressed in the long term .
