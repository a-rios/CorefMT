The Stressful Life of Laboratory Animals 
Research on animals is performed to gain more knowledge about diseases and how to cure them , and to evaluate drugs for toxicity before testing them on humans . 
In fact , animal studies have played a vital role in almost every major medical advance . 
Although researchers are committed to finding new ways to reduce and replace animal testing , current technology cannot yet replace many types of animal research . 
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics estimates that between 50 and 100 million animals , from flies to monkeys , are euthanized for research each year worldwide , with roughly 90 % of the vertebrate animals used for research being rodents . 
Gaining useful knowledge from animal research requires robust experimental findings : different scientists should be able to reproduce them in different locations . 
This requires a thorough understanding of each animal species and its biology . 
Evidence is gradually accumulating that the majority of mammalian research animals , particularly rodents , are mentally stressed by their living conditions . 
Stress is generally defined as the state that results when the brain instructs the body to make changes in order to adapt to a new or excessive demand and the individual perceives that the demand will exceed the personal resources which he or she has available . 
The response is fuelled by stress hormones that flow through the body , altering every organ and biochemical function , with wide-ranging effects on metabolism , growth , and reproduction . 
Although the environments of laboratory animals are usually well controlled in terms of lighting , temperature , and humidity , there are many uncontrolled sources of noise in animal facilities , most of which derive from human activities . 
Rodents , in particular , are sensitive to these noises , and studies show that this sensitivity does not diminish with time , as is commonly assumed . 
These noises can alter rodents &quot; behavior and even adversely affect their health . 
Yet , surprisingly , many scientists are unaware that loud noises in their animal facilities can affect research outcomes and compromise their data . 
Apart from noise problems , research animals are often housed in small cages with no source of enrichment , such as wheels , shelves , or tubes . 
Such devices enable animals to exert some control over their environment , such as escaping an attack from a cage-mate by moving to another level in the cage or hiding . 
Often , researchers are unwilling to include such items in their animals &quot; cages because other researchers do not . 
However , rigorous standardization of the environment , particularly if it leads to barren surroundings , increases the risk of obtaining results that , being specific to a narrow set of conditions , cannot be compared with other researchers &quot; results . 
If animals are under stress , they can have permanently raised concentrations of stress hormones , reduced concentrations of sex hormones , and compromised immune systems . 
These uncontrolled variables make the animals unsuitable subjects for scientific studies . 
To ensure good science , research animals should be healthy and exhibit normal behavior , apart from the specific effects under investigation . 
Researchers often dismiss questions concerning environmental influences on their experimental data by claiming that such effects &quot; cancel out , &quot; because their control animals are housed under the same conditions . 
But the conclusions drawn from such experiments are specific to the stressed animals and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to healthy animals . 
The increasing use of genetically modified mice since their advent 20 years ago amplifies this problem . 
Genetically modified mice either lack a specific gene or gene-pair ( knock-out mice ) or carry a piece of foreign DNA integrated into their own chromosomes ( transgenic mice ) , and are used to deduce the functions of particular genes . Studies are beginning to show that an animal &apos;s environmental conditions can completely change the results of genetic studies . 
A more humane and effective way to ensure the validity and usefulness of animal experimentation would be to provide conditions that minimize stress-related activities such as excessive grooming and fighting . 
In addition , the environment should allow the animals to perform the behaviors normal for their species . 
Normal and aberrant behaviors for each species could be agreed upon institutionally and a list made available to all investigators . 
Designing an environment to suit animals &quot; psychological and physiological needs would be far preferable to the minimalism , otherwise known as &quot; standardization , &quot; that is currently employed . 
The exact conditions used to achieve these goals would probably vary between laboratories . 
Both the welfare of research animals and the quality of the science would be markedly improved , leading to data that could be meaningfully applied to our quest for medical knowledge .
