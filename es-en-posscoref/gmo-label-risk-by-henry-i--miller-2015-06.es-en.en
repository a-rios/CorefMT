The Risks of Mislabeled Risk 
STANFORD - Increasing numbers of supposedly health-conscious consumers are choosing products with &quot; free from &quot; labels , from &quot; BPA-free &quot; plastics to &quot; non-GMO &quot; foods . 
But such labels do not increase public safety . 
On the contrary , not only are many of the scary-sounding ingredients perfectly safe , but manufacturers , in their haste to meet consumer demand , sometimes substitute inferior - or even harmful - ingredients or processes . 
The blame for this situation lies mainly with activists and the news media for fanning unwarranted public fears . 
But a recent academic study demonstrates how manufacturers , by drawing attention to what they are omitting from a product , perpetuate spurious concerns that actually drive consumers to take greater health risks . 
The study explores , mainly through the lens of product labeling , how people evaluate the risks of Bisphenol A ( BPA ) - a chemical that is commonly used to harden plastics and prevent the growth of bacteria in food cans - compared to its alternatives . 
It found that &quot; people evaluate a situation in which scientific evidence is tempered by controversy similarly to a situation in which there is no scientific evidence at all . &quot; 
In other words , because there have been questions about the safety of BPA , people disregard the scientific evidence altogether . 
Concerns about BPA should have been put to rest long ago . 
Years of research and repeated assessments conducted by government regulators - including one earlier this year by the European Food Safety Authority - have concluded that BPA is safe in normal use . 
It is the removal of BPA from the cans &quot; lining , therefore , that may pose a threat to consumers &quot; health , by leading to an increase in foodborne illnesses from deadly bacteria like Clostridium botulinum ( which causes botulism ) . 
Most people found out that BPA existed only when they saw a BPA-free sticker on bottles at their local store . 
But that label has a profound impact : it sends the unmistakable message that BPA is a health hazard . 
After all , if it were not , why would manufacturers not only exclude it from their products , but also tout that they had done so ? 
&quot; What consumers do not know , &quot; the study &apos;s authors point out , &quot; is that BPA is often replaced with other , less-studied chemicals whose health implications are virtually unknown , &quot; and thus may prove to be worse than the original material . 
Yet people remain so focused on the BPA-free label that they accept these potentially &quot; regrettable substitutions , &quot; exposing themselves to chemicals that they might otherwise reject . 
GMOs ( genetically modified organisms ) face a similarly problematic stigma - one that compelled the American food-production behemoths General Mills and Post Foods to eliminate GMOs from their popular Cheerios and Grape Nuts cereals , respectively . 
In trying to meet a perceived consumer demand , the manufacturers have had to make regrettable substitutions - namely , marketing products that lack some added vitamins . 
It is ironic that , in order to please their customers , they have begun offering inferior products at higher prices . 
Of course , consumers are not the only ones whose inadequate consideration of the facts is resulting in regrettable substitutions . 
Governments , too , are making hasty , wrong-headed decisions that deny consumers a choice . 
Consider the European Union &apos;s politically motivated decision to ban , beginning in 2013 , the state-of-the-art pesticides called neonicotinoids . 
Forced to resort to older , more toxic , and less effective pesticides ( primarily pyrethroids , which had been largely phased out ) , Europe &apos;s farmers are seeing a resurgence of insect predation . 
The damage may cause a 15 % drop in this year &apos;s harvest of canola , the continent &apos;s primary source of vegetable oil used in food and biodiesel . 
There are important lessons to be learned from such outcomes . 
First , when manufacturers and retailers allow their decisions to be guided by pressure from activists , not scientific evidence , they risk eventual consumer dissatisfaction and potential product-liability lawsuits . 
Likewise , policymakers should emphasize science over politics . 
The public , too , has a vital role to play : maintaining a healthy skepticism regarding the claims of self-interested , self-styled &quot; consumer advocates . &quot; 
Putting science first now is the best way to ensure that we , as consumers , have no regrets later .
