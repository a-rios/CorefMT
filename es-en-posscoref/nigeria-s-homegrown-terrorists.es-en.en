Nigeria &apos;s Homegrown Terrorists 
LAGOS - Abuja , Nigeria &apos;s sparkling new capital , is a city under siege . 
In August , Boko Haram , a shadowy and violent Muslim sect operating in the northeastern part of the country , bombed a building housing staff of the United Nations in the central part of the city , killing 23 people and seriously injuring 86 . 
It was Nigeria &apos;s first suicide bombing , and the audacity and ferocity of the attack have thrown government officials and citizens alike into panic mode . 
Ever since its bloody repression of the Igbo secession bid in the late 1960 &quot; s , Nigeria &apos;s military has prided itself on its ability to &quot; neutralize &quot; ethno-religious insurgency and preserve the country &apos;s unity . 
Throughout the 1990 &quot; s and into the first years of the new millennium , it battled youth-led armed militias in the Niger Delta to assert the central government &apos;s control of the region &apos;s substantial oil receipts . 
The O &apos;odua People &apos;s Congress , an ethnic self-determination movement in the western part of the country , was also met with military force . 
But attempts to apply the same severe medicine to Boko Haram have backfired . 
A military contingent that the government dispatched in 2009 to Maiduguri , the northern city that has become the sect &apos;s bastion , killed its leader , Mohammed Yusuf , his father-in-law , and many of their followers . 
But the rump of Boko Haram then went underground , before re-emerging more ferocious and better organized . 
Yusuf has since become a martyr , and daily attacks on hotels , bars , churches , and schools are usually followed with admonitions to Nigerians to shun the Western way of life . 
( Boko Haram , loosely translated , means &quot; Western education is forbidden . &quot; ) 
Spokesmen for the sect , which began as a fringe Islamic revivalist movement in 2002 , say that their mission is to replace the secular state in northern Nigeria with a theocracy based on Sharia law . 
They also want the government to rebuild houses , mosques , and Islamic schools destroyed during the 2009 attack . 
The sect holds the northern political and religious elite in contempt , and does not recognize the authority of the Sultan of Sokoto , leader of Nigerian Muslims . 
Indeed , they blame northern political and religious leaders for the region &apos;s mounting economic and political problems , and have killed several in the past two years . 
But Boko Haram is only part of a profound crisis gripping Nigeria &apos;s vast northern region . 
Ordinary northerners still believe that President Goodluck Jonathan , who hails from the Niger Delta in the south , cheated their hero , Muhammadu Buhari , a retired general and former head of state , in last April &apos;s elections . 
More than 800 northerners died as enraged youths took to the streets in protest . 
Moreover , unemployment and poverty rates are higher in Nigeria &apos;s north than in other parts of the country . 
A powerful and wealthy feudal elite that has maintained power for two centuries through a mix of authoritarianism and religious sentiment now feels embattled following its loss of power in Abuja and , with it , the means to dispense patronage to formerly obsequious followers . 
Given all of this , it is perhaps not surprising that impoverished and restive northern youth are joining Boko Haram in droves . 
The increasing sophistication of the attacks on public buildings has led to speculation that the sect is linked to international terrorist networks , probably Al Qaeda in the Maghreb or Al Shabab in Somalia . 
To make Boko Haram appear more potent , its members play up this alleged affiliation , and even claim to have the support of &quot; important &quot; people in the northern part of the country . 
Following threats that university campuses in the south would be bombed , anxious parents recalled their children and now warn them to stay away from the north . 
Nigeria , a fragile coalition of ethnic groups , may not be sliding into a second civil war ( yet ) , but inter-ethnic relations could worsen if the Boko Haram menace is not quickly tackled . 
There is raging debate in the country over how best to do that . 
Two days after former President Olusegun Obasanjo traveled to Maiduguri and met with a relative of the sect &apos;s slain leader to initiate peace talks , a Boko Haram faction murdered the 49-year-old man . 
The military task force deployed to the area is still in place , and civil-society groups have accused soldiers of pillaging private property , raping women , and shooting innocent citizens . 
Since taking power last April , President Jonathan has pursued a purely military strategy towards the sect . 
With the tentative peace moves stifled , the position of the hawks in his government , particularly that of National Security Adviser Owoye Andrew Azazi , will likely be strengthened . 
The United States , Israel , and Britain have also expressed willingness to provide Nigeria with counter-terrorism support , but this &quot; help , &quot; if accepted , would only inflame passions in the country &apos;s Islamic belt . 
The fundamental problem in northern Nigeria , as in other parts of the country , is deepening poverty , mass unemployment , and the widespread belief that Nigeria &apos;s leaders are only looking after their own interests . 
After 100 days in office , Jonathan and his ruling People &apos;s Democratic Party appear indecisive about how to tackle these challenges . 
Most members of the president &apos;s large cabinet are seat warmers . 
After the sound and fury of its recent elections , Africa &apos;s most populous country appears set to face violence and chaos born of deprivation and neglect .
