Marxism , Back From the Grave in Uruguay 
MONTEVIDEO : Across Latin America , comrades and caudillos are supposedly consigned to the dustbin of history . 
Only Cuba holds out against the continent &apos;s push toward democracy and open economies . 
Marx , however , is far from dead ; not least in Uruguay , and perhaps not elsewhere . 
Jorge Batlle , taking office as President March 1 , must bear this in mind . 
In last year &apos;s presidential elections , Tabaré Vázquez , the Left &apos;s charismatic leader , easily won the first round , though not by enough votes to avoid a second round run off . 
Suspense gripped the country . 
Jorge Batlle , representing the long dominant Colorado party , needed solid support from the rival Blanco party to overcome Vázquez . 
After 150 years of feuding , that support seemed as likely as the Capulets rescuing the Montagues . 
Called &quot; red &quot; and &quot; white &quot; after the colored ribbons on their hats - worn since the 1830s to avoid being shot at by one &apos;s own side - the Colorados and Blancos are nowadays divided by little ideologically . 
But could ancestral wounds be forgotten ? 
No one knew . 
Pollsters predicted a technical draw . 
Fear of the Left overcame history &apos;s open wounds : Batlle won by 7 % , implying that almost all Blancos flocked to him . 
Uruguay &apos;s voters divided along lines of ideology , not old loyalties . 
That divide is likely to deepen , and be repeated at the next election . 
But - and here &apos;s the rub - next time there may be no second round . 
The Left &apos;s rank and file is faceless , with Communists , former guerrillas , and other radical fellow travelers marching side-by-side with a moderate majority of Social and Christian Democrats . 
Unlike in Chile , where modernized Socialists recently secured the presidency for the first time since the coup against Allende , even Uruguay &apos;s moderate Leftists cling to a passionate militancy , Cuba , and Che Guevara . 
Looking at the Left &apos;s leadership - dominated by Tabaré Vázquez and a few others - there is an undoubted and longstanding commitment to Marxism-Leninism . 
Those commitments , no matter how hidden , spell trouble in the future . 
What incited the Left &apos;s rise ? 
Not current economics . 
Uruguay suffered cruel stagnation from the middle 1950s to the 1970s , brought about by rampant protectionism , irresponsible public finance , and tight exchange controls . 
All this was long ago . 
Leftist support has surged at a time when growth averages something like 3 % per year in real terms , and is coupled with the most egalitarian income distribution in Latin America , as well as relatively high government spending for social purposes . 
Yet a pervasive malaise grips Uruguay , prompting people to seek systemic change . 
The irony of this yearning is that , instead of encouraging policies that would get the economy humming , discontent drives many voters back to the tried and failed policies of the past . 
Uruguay is often credited ( debited ? ) with establishing the first welfare state in Latin America . 
In 1915 it mandated the first 48-hour week seen anywhere in the world . 
Labor market regulation became an almost annual event , stifling innovation . 
State-owned commercial banks account for half the financial system ; all large companies are State monopolies , bureaucratically staffed and poorly managed . 
There is no room for an equities market . 
Ambitious young people seek their fortunes abroad . 
A paramount figure in shaping the country was José Batlle , the president elect &apos;s great-uncle . 
A populist , twice president , he frowned on foreign investment , favored small firms , wanted large ones nationalized , and disparaged entrepreneurship . 
Like Marx , he believed that profits resulted from labor &apos;s exploitation . 
Instead of revolution , he looked to social legislation to put things right . 
The elder Batlle was revered in his lifetime and beyond . 
Unwittingly , the Blancos borrowed his ideology . 
Paradoxically , today &apos;s Left benefits from a nostalgia for those Colorado times , when Uruguay &apos;s wealth made the elder Batlle &apos;s populism possible . 
Daunting challenges face Batlle &apos;s great-nephew . 
If he is merely competent , he will likely end up handing over power to the Left , and thus risks being remembered as Uruguay &apos;s Kerenski . 
To prevent that fate , he must battle the sprawling bureaucracy and the State &apos;s financial / industrial empire . 
Suffocating regulations must be lifted . 
The choice facing President Batlle is to be either a Kerenski or a Thatcher . 
Five earlier presidential bids by Jorge Batlle failed , many believe , because he promised daring , free-market ideas that frightened voters . 
During his victorious campaign his advisors kept his mouth shut on everything but trivialities . 
The few announced appointments have won lukewarm nods but no enthusiasm from those looking for bold leadership . 
Real modernization and real growth are the only things that will block Uruguay &apos;s unmodernized Left from power next time .
