In the Shadow of Miloševic 
Two years ago the world cheered as Slobodan Miloševic &apos;s opponents united to overthrow his dictatorship . 
Opposition to Milosevic , however , appears to have been the sole glue holding them together . 
Those protest leaders , now in power , have been at each other &apos;s throats ever since . 
Vojislav Koštunica , the current president of what remains of Yugoslavia and the &apos; mildish &apos; nationalist who out-polled Miloševic two years ago , holds a high-profile job with numerous ceremonial duties but little real power . 
So he decided to compete head-to-head in Serbia &apos;s presidential elections of September 29 with the reform candidate Miroljub Labus , a vice-premier in charge of finance . 
Because Koštunica did not win 50 % plus one of the votes of all registered voters in the first round , he faces a run-off with Labus on October 13th . 
Intelligent speeches , spirited debates and clever slogans were conspicuous by their absence in this election . 
Violence was also absent , but insults were not . 
For example , Zoran Djindjic , the hyper-pragmatic prime minister of Serbia who supports Labus , called Koštunica a lazy drone . 
Such language is lamentable , but it is still a big step forward from the Miloševic era , when both regime and opposition commonly dubbed their opponents as traitors , spies , or Western mercenaries . 
Look beyond the insults and you see that Koštunica and Labus have similar moderate programs . 
Labus favors faster economic reform and is readier to accept Western demands to cooperate with the Hague Tribunal . 
Koštunica is also for privatization and decreasing the role of the state , but he is more worried about corruption and favoritism during the sale of state firms . 
While he claims to be pro-Western , he prefers that extraditions of indicted Serb war criminals to the Hague conform to Serbian law . 
The biggest electoral surprise of the first round was the success of the blood-curdling nationalist Vojislav Sešelj , who received 24 % of the vote . 
For years he championed extreme Serbian nationalism and led paramilitary formations in the wars of Yugoslavia &apos;s disintegration . 
He also instigated many violent incidents in Serbian internal politics . 
Last but not least , Sešelj was in coalition with Miloševic when the Democratic Opposition of Serbia , a loose coalition of 18 opposition parties led by Koštunica but internally dominated by Djindjic , defeated Miloševic . 
Sešelj has worked hard to soften his image . 
He remains a nationalist , but the main theme of his electoral campaign was the struggle against organized crime and his promise to purge the police of dishonest high-ranking officers . 
Sešelj was much helped by Miloševic who , from his cell in the Hague , urged his Socialist Party to vote for Sešelj , not for one of its own two quarrelling candidates . 
Miloševic &apos;s shrewd , pugnacious cross-examination of witnesses in the Hague courtroom has somewhat restored his prestige among Serbs who perceive the Tribunal as anti-Serb . 
The good news is that Miloševic &apos;s support for Sešelj damaged the already weak Socialist Party , which is unlikely to recover soon . 
Sešelj was also the only major politician who spoke about the plight of the unemployed and the soon-to-be-unemployed , of the refugees and the homeless , and of the poor . 
He did this in a demagogical , nationalistic and populist way . 
But it is obvious that in the period of transition through which Serbia is going , there is a need for a strong , well-organized European-style social-democratic party to address these issues . 
Most of Sešelj &apos;s supporters will vote for Koštunica in the second round because they view Labus as a lackey of Americans and Germans , of the IMF and World Bank , and simply of Serbia &apos;s enemies the world over . 
Since most people who voted for the eight minor candidates in the first round will also cast ballots for Koštunica , he is all but certain to win . 
This certainty means that Koštunica need not actively court Sešelj supporters or other nationalists . 
Koštunica has made a career more by the absence of negative characteristics than by what he has achieved . 
He is neither corrupt nor a war criminal , neither aggressive in his utterance and behavior nor likely to bend the law for the sake of personal power . 
Many people voted by for him by default , both now and when he defeated Miloševic in 2000 . 
Though he does not sacrifice major moral principles for power , Koštunica is not the unassuming lawyer he once was . 
He crams his party with mediocrities , selects mostly bad advisers , and does not listen to the rare good ones . 
It is possible that his image as a right-of-center democrat conceals a reactionary who would like for Serbia to restore its pre-WWII monarchy and for the Orthodox Church to play a major role in political and social life . 
For there is a deep contradiction at the core of Koštunica , as there is at the core of Serbian society - an impossible dream of combining liberal European political institutions with authoritarian Serbian political traditions . 
It should not be forgotten that Koštunica supported the struggle of Serbs in Croatia , Bosnia and Kosovo and that he adheres to a rosy picture of Serb history . 
But Parliament is the seat of real political power here . 
After the parliamentary elections that will probably take place in the spring of 2003 , Koštunica &apos;s Democratic Party of Serbia ( DSS ) will be a formidable force in the Serbian assembly . 
But it will never come close to an absolute majority . 
Neither Serbs nor the West want a government in which Sešelj or someone like him plays a leading role . 
So Koštunica and Djindjic cannot seek allies in the nationalist camp . 
Both Djindjic and Koštunica must ultimately realize that they are stuck with each other and so begin to compromise and cooperate . 
If they do Serbia will sail on - slowly , without spectacular successes , in a disorderly way , but peacefully and in the right direction .
