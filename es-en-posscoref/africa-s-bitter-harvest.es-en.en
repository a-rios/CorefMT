Africa &apos;s Bitter Harvest 
Souley Madi is one of the most productive cotton growers in the Badjengo Cameroon , an area where the lush forests of central Africa give way to the semi-arid Sahel . 
Thanks to a combination of intense heat and periodic Sahelian rains , Madi consistently produces clean , high-quality cotton on the gently sloping hills that surround his walled compound . 
But , as the next growing season approaches , Madi , who is 40 , faces a difficult decision : how much cotton should he grow this year ? 
Prices for cotton were so low last year that Madi cut his acreage . 
He earned less from cotton last year than the year before , and much less than he earned five years ago . 
&quot; I &apos;m angry , but what can I do ? &quot; he asks . 
This year Madi may grow even less cotton , even though the crop is the main source of income for himself , his two wives and his five children . 
On some of his land , he now grows corn and peanuts instead of cotton . 
But cotton potentially offers the best payback , because it has cash value on the international market and can be stored for long periods of time . 
Like millions of other African cotton farmers , Madi has advantages over cotton farmers in other parts of the world . 
His land costs are low . 
Nor does he needs expensive machinery to plant his seeds ; his plow is drawn by cattle , and he pushes seeds into the ground with his bare hands . 
A state-owned cotton company collects his cotton relatively efficiently , gins it nearby to produce lint and then sells the lint on the international market , generally paying Madi promptly and fairly . 
Madi &apos;s earnings help him keep his children in school , even at the height of the cotton harvest . 
Having attended secondary school himself , he believes that his children will better their lives through education . 
He knows his children &apos;s future depends on better prices for cotton . 
But forces beyond Madi &apos;s control - even beyond his awareness - are restraining cotton prices , creating a global glut that is largely the result of policies followed by the world &apos;s richest governments . 
The United States government pays billions of dollars to cotton growers , mainly in California , Texas , and Mississippi . 
The European Union also contributes to low cotton prices , paying farmers in Greece about $ 1 billion a year to grow the crop at a loss . 
Such subsidies are a global scandal , yet large payments to largely wealthy American and Greek cotton growers seem likely to persist for many years . 
The best chance to end cotton subsidies soon was lost last December , when African countries , aided by India and Brazil , pressed hard for the elimination of cotton subsidies , at the World Trade Organization &apos;s meeting in Hong Kong . 
The US and Europe offered only a token reduction , scotching a deal . 
The only chance to end cotton subsidies is now somehow to convince US and EU leaders to assist African peasants by curtailing payments to their own cotton farmers . 
A revision to what Americans call &quot; the farm program &quot; is scheduled for next year . 
The powerful US cotton lobby wants no change in the level of payments , however . 
European farmers also want to maintain current subsidy levels , and EU members say that they are unlikely to make any reductions before the end of the decade . 
Take away subsidies and cotton prices will rise , perhaps as much as 15 % . 
&quot; There &apos;s real money here for the individual African , &quot; says Daniel Sumner , an economist and cotton expert at the University of California . 
Trade officials in both the US and Europe say that they will no longer encourage farmers to overproduce , and that they will end programs that specifically subsidize exports . 
For Africans , however , these changes are cosmetic , doing little or nothing to lift cotton prices . 
Africans are trying to make the best out of a bad situation . 
In some parts of Africa , cotton growers are expanding production , providing proof that if the US and Europe did somehow curtail their own cotton output , Africans could plug the gap . 
In Uganda , where civil wars in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s devastated farming , cotton growers are making a major comeback . 
In Zambia , cotton output is soaring . 
In both countries , foreign investors are opening gins and assisting growers . 
In Cameroon , where cotton is the main source of income for nearly five million people , record crops were posted last year and the year before . 
&quot; Our farmers are dedicated and disciplined , committed to quality , &quot; says Ali Batour , a manager with Cameroon &apos;s Sodecoton , the state-owned marketer . 
&quot; They deserve a fair price . &quot; 
But Souley Madi is resigned to receiving unfair cotton prices , perhaps for a long time . 
During the last harvest , when 100-degree heat forced him , his wives , and his mother to stop picking cotton after a few hours , he returned to his compound to tend to his ducks . 
He recently started raising a flock and last Christmas earned the equivalent of $ 70 on the sale of 18 birds . 
Tapping his forehead , Madi insists , &quot; We are waiting for the situation to change . &quot; 
For how long , he says , &quot; depends on God . &quot;
