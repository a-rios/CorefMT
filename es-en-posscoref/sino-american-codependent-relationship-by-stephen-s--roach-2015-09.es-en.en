The Sino-American Codependency Trap 
NEW HAVEN - Increasingly reliant on each other for sustainable economic growth , the United States and China have fallen into a classic codependency trap , bristling at changes in the rules of engagement . 
The symptoms of this insidious pathology were on clear display during Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s recent visit to America . 
Little was accomplished , and the path ahead remains treacherous . 
Codependency between America and China was born in the late 1970s , when the US was in the grips of wrenching stagflation , and the Chinese economy was in shambles following the Cultural Revolution . 
Both countries needed new recipes for revival and growth , and turned to each other in a marriage of convenience . 
China provided cheap goods that enabled income-constrained American consumers to make ends meet , and the US provided the external demand that underpinned Deng Xiaoping &apos;s export-led growth strategy . 
Over the years , this arrangement morphed into a deeper relationship . 
Lacking in saving and wanting to grow , the US relied increasingly on China &apos;s vast reservoir of surplus saving to make ends meet . 
Anchoring its currency to the dollar , the Chinese built up a huge stake in US Treasuries , which helped America fund record budget deficits . 
America provided China with both stability and growth anchors . 
China enabled the US to sidestep the mounting perils of subpar saving , reckless fiscal policy , and weak household income growth . 
But economic codependency is as unstable as human codependency . 
One partner eventually changes , while the other is left hanging , feeling scorned . 
China is now changing , and America doesn &apos;t like it . 
Not only is China rebalancing its economic model from exports to consumption ; it is also redefining its national character . 
It has adapted a more muscular foreign policy in the South China Sea , embraced the nationalistic longing of rejuvenation , framed by what Xi calls the &quot; China Dream . &quot; 
And it has started to reshape the international financial architecture with new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , the New Development Bank , and the Silk Road Fund . 
The US response has put China on edge , particularly America &apos;s so-called &quot; Asian pivot , &quot; or &quot; strategic rebalancing , &quot; with its subtext of containing China . 
The US recognizes the need to increase China &apos;s role in the existing Bretton Woods institutions ( the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ) ; but when it fails to deliver , it chafes at Chinese institution building . 
And while the US has long urged China to tilt its growth model toward private consumption , it is uncomfortable with many of the implications of this shift . 
In large part , America &apos;s unease reflects a failure to address its core economic problems - mainly a lack of domestic saving . 
The net national saving rate ( businesses , households , and the government combined ) stood at just 2.9 % of national income in mid-2015 , less than half the 6.3 % average over the final three decades of the twentieth century . 
As China shifts from surplus saving to saving absorption - using its surpluses to build a safety net for the Chinese people rather than subsidize the savings of Americans - a saving-short US will find it tough to fill the void . 
America &apos;s monetary policy reveals another layer of codependency . 
By citing international concerns - especially China &apos;s slowing growth - as a major reason for deferring its long-awaited interest-rate hike in September , the Federal Reserve has left little doubt concerning the key role that China plays in sustaining a still-fragile US recovery . 
And with good reason : US exports , which accounted for a record 13.7 % of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2013 , up from 10.6 % in the first quarter of 2009 , slipped back to 12.7 % of GDP in mid-2015 . 
With domestic demand still weak - real consumption has grown at an anemic 1.4 % pace over the past 7.5 years - the US needs export growth more than ever . 
So the outlook for China , America &apos;s third-largest and most rapidly growing major export market , is crucial for a Fed that has failed to gain much traction from its unconventional post-crisis monetary policies . 
This aspect of codependency is global in scope . 
Over the past decade , China has accounted for an average of 1.6 percentage points of world GDP growth per year - more than double the combined 0.7-percentage-point contribution of the so-called advanced economies . 
Even if its GDP growth slows to 6.8 % this year , China would account for slightly more growth than is likely from the advanced world . 
Little wonder that China &apos;s growth prospects are such a big deal for policymakers worldwide . 
Speaking in Seattle on September 22 , Xi stressed the need for both the US and China to deepen their &quot; mutual understanding of strategic intentions &quot; as a key objective for the bilateral relationship . 
And yet his deliberations with US President Barack Obama were lacking in precisely that respect . 
The agenda was shaped more by disconnected issues - cyber security , climate change , and market access - rather than by an appreciation of the strategic challenges that both countries face alone and together . 
Moreover , there was little sign of meaningful progress even on the issues that Xi and Obama discussed . 
Both sides hailed a newfound commitment to high-level exchanges on cyber crime ; but the US is about to impose sanctions on Chinese companies that have benefited from egregious hacking . 
Likewise , they stressed yet again the need for a &quot; high standard &quot; bilateral investment treaty ; but there was little indication of serious movement on the industries that would be shielded from such an agreement ( the &quot; negative list . &quot; ) . 
To its credit , China did announce an important shift in environmental policy - a nationwide cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions , to go into effect in 2017 . 
But , without similar actions by the US , China &apos;s move hardly tempers the perils of global climate change . 
Trapped in a web of codependency , the US-China relationship has become fraught with friction and finger pointing . 
In human behavior , the endgame of this pathology is usually a painful breakup . 
The just-concluded summit between Obama and Xi did little to dispel this possibility .
