The Peace-Prosperity Cycle 
NEW YORK - At the 68th session of the United Nations General Assembly , which began on September 17 , world leaders are laying the foundations of a development agenda to succeed the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , which expire in 2015 . 
The upcoming Sustainable Development Goals will be based on the understanding that economic development is key to improving human well-being and securing the most vulnerable people &apos;s rights . 
But , in order to make genuine progress , policymakers must address the factors that constrain development , particularly violence and conflict . 
According to the Global Peace Index , containing violence - including internal and external conflicts , as well as violent crimes and homicides - cost the world almost $ 9.5 trillion , or 11 % of global GDP , last year . 
That is 75 times the volume of official overseas development assistance in 2012 , which amounted to $ 125.6 billion , and nearly double the value of the world &apos;s annual agricultural production . 
( For further perspective , the post-2008 global financial crisis caused global GDP to fall by 0.6 % . ) 
This means that if the world were to reduce its violence-related expenditure by approximately 50 % , it could repay the debt of the developing world ( $ 4.1 trillion ) , provide enough money for the European Stability Mechanism ( $ 900 billion ) , and fund the additional amount required to achieve the MDGs ( $ 60 billion ) . 
Reducing violence-related expenditure by even 10 % would save $ 473 billion , while contributing to output growth worth an additional $ 473 billion - money that could be channeled toward infrastructure , health care , or educational services . 
And these are conservative estimates ; they do not reflect costs related to property crime , burglary , vehicle theft , domestic violence , surveillance equipment , lost wages , and lower productivity , because accurate data are not yet available . 
Just as long-term economic development requires political stability , peace can be achieved only in an environment of economic progress and prosperity . 
External shocks , such as sudden food-price fluctuations , may raise tension within communities - especially those that lack adequate social-safety nets - and even lead to conflict . 
This occurred in Colombia in the 1990 &quot; s , when an unexpected drop in coffee prices lowered wages and intensified conflict in coffee-dependent regions . 
Likewise , pervasive or rising unemployment undermines peace by encouraging the proliferation of criminal networks , gangs , and rebel groups . 
Indeed , in the World Bank &apos;s 2011 World Development Report , young people in conflict-affected countries cited unemployment and idleness as the most compelling reasons for joining such organizations . 
Given this , governments must intensify their efforts to foster job creation and improve employment opportunities -including finding ways to finance relevant policies and programs . 
They could begin by enhancing the efficiency of violence-related expenditure . 
In the United States , for example , researchers with the Institute for Economics and Peace found that more than one out of every seven dollars spent - a total of almost $ 2.2 trillion in 2010 and a staggering 37 % of that year &apos;s federal budget - is devoted to preventing and dealing with the consequences of violence . 
In other words , US violence-related expenditure is almost equal to the output of the entire British economy , approximately $ 2.4 trillion . 
Just as the ongoing health-care debate focuses on reducing costs while improving outcomes , a public debate centered on the costs and effectiveness of violence prevention and recovery programs should be launched . 
With thorough analysis , governments could identify surplus funds that might be redirected to development pursuits , thereby bolstering productivity , enhancing human well-being , and laying the foundations for a peaceful society . 
For example , a mere 5 % annual reduction in federal spending on violence containment in the US over the next three years could provide the capital to update the entire country &apos;s school infrastructure . 
The virtuous cycle by which prosperity engenders peace , which in turn fuels greater prosperity , is also apparent in education investment . 
Education enhances workers &quot; skills , knowledge , and behaviors , thereby boosting their productivity . 
This promotes stability and social cohesion , while making communities more resilient to economic , geopolitical , or natural disasters . 
Peaceful and prosperous Scandinavian countries , which boast high education levels , are a case in point . 
But the cycle runs in reverse , too . 
In Greece , for example , the recent economic downturn , exacerbated by strict austerity measures , has fueled violent demonstrations . 
And prolonged conflict has had a devastating impact on Iraq &apos;s economy . 
Three decades ago , after Iraq initiated hostilities with Iran , its per capita annual GDP plummeted , from $ 5,374 in 1980 to $ 1,253 in 1991 . 
It is easy to perpetuate the vicious cycle between economic hardship and conflict ; indeed , such an outcome requires only that policymakers do nothing . 
Reversing the cycle , however , is a difficult undertaking - one that requires carefully crafted policies , effective programs , and substantial investment . 
In formulating the post-2015 development agenda , world leaders must recognize the tremendous impetus that less violent , more harmonious societies would provide for economic development . 
By stimulating a virtuous cycle of peace and prosperity , policymakers can contribute to the well-being of people worldwide . 
Now that is a goal worth pursuing .
