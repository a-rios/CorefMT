Building on the Euro 
The euro is now six years old . 
It is past time to consider how it is performing , and whether it has lived up to the expectations that accompanied its birth . 
Those expectations were not modest . 
By reducing transaction costs and removing exchange-rate uncertainty , the single European currency was expected to lead to fully integrated product and financial markets . 
This , in turn , would bring greater gains from trade , stronger competition , larger cross-border capital flows , lower borrowing costs , and more opportunities for sharing risk , all of which were expected ultimately to boost investment and productivity . 
Reality has disappointed . 
Compared to the five years before the euro &apos;s launch in 1999 , productivity growth has since slowed in Italy , Germany , Spain , and the Netherlands , while over the same period it accelerated or remained constant in Denmark , Sweden , and the UK , the European Union members that remained out . 
Indeed , with the main exception of France , the euro does not seem to have been a blessing for the countries that adopted it . 
Why this disappointment ? 
Have the expected benefits of the new currency failed to materialize ? 
Several recent economic studies addressed this question , looking at a variety of indicators . 
Here is what emerges : 
· The single currency has boosted international trade within the euro area , by about 10 % . 
Although a larger effect was expected , it remains too early for a complete assessment . 
In any case , this is an important positive outcome , because international trade is generally regarded as a key determinant of faster growth and higher efficiency . 
· The euro was expected to increase price transparency , thereby strengthening competition in product markets . 
No evidence exists that this happened . 
Prices did converge during the implementation of the Single Market program , in the early 1990 &quot; s , but then price convergence stopped . 
· Cross-border investment towards the euro area has increased , although here it is more difficult to disentangle the effect of the single currency from other concomitant events ( such as privatizations or corporate mergers ) . 
· Money and bond markets are now fully integrated in the euro area , implying a reduction in the cost of capital for large corporate borrowers . 
Retail banking , however , remains segmented by national borders , so that households and smaller producers have not been much affected . 
· The euro was expected to acquire an international role , eventually improving Europe &apos;s resilience in the face of economic shocks . 
There has been a surge in euro-denominated international bonds , but the liquidity of foreign-exchange markets is no higher for the euro compared to the national currencies it replaced , and the euro remains a long way from challenging the supremacy of the dollar . 
Of course , the euro was never just an economic project . 
One of its backers &quot; main motives was to boost Europe &apos;s political integration . 
Indeed , the euro has quickly become a symbol of European unity . 
When asked , &quot; What does the EU mean to you personally , &quot; 50 % of citizens in the 15 countries that were EU members before enlargement in May 2004 say &quot; the euro &quot; - the second most common response ( just behind &quot; the ability to travel , study , and work anywhere in the EU &quot; ) . 
Yet , this symbol has not made the EU or the euro area any more popular . 
Support for EU membership within the pre-enlargement EU-15 remains where it was in the mid-1990 &quot; s ( and below the peak reached in 1990 ) , while support for the euro is no higher now than it was in 1997 . 
To be sure , the introduction of the euro was a true revolution , and we cannot yet see all its effects . 
But what is clear is that the revolution took place on shaky national economic foundations , transforming the upper floors of the European economy - financial markets and macroeconomic policy institutions - while leaving intact the ancien underpinnings of supply-side distortions induced by misguided national policies in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
These distortions , not any shortcomings of the single currency , account for the euro area &apos;s dismal economic performance . 
The countries that adopted the euro had poor labor-market institutions , bloated pension systems , high taxes on labor income , and inefficient service sectors in the late 1990 &quot; s , and they still do now . 
The more fundamental problem with the euro is that its adoption has not pushed countries to address these underlying deficiencies . 
It was expected that full integration of product and financial markets would expose inefficiencies , steering investment flows away from laggards towards the more efficient countries . 
Yet , while reform efforts intensified throughout Europe in the late 1990 &quot; s both inside and outside of the euro area , there is little evidence that &quot; ins &quot; enacted more far-reaching and significant supply-side reforms than the &quot; outs . &quot; 
Larry Summers , the former US Treasury Secretary and now president of Harvard University , once called the single European currency a &quot; distraction &quot; from the serious supply-side reforms Europe needed to confront . 
This judgment may be too harsh , because we do not know whether the EU and the single market would have survived without the single currency . 
But one thing is certain : Europe cannot afford other &quot; distractions . &quot; 
Overhauling Europe &apos;s shaky supply-side foundations is the key challenge facing the euro revolution , and it is a challenge that needs to be addressed at its national-level roots .
