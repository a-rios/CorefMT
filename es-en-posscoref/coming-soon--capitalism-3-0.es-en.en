Coming Soon : Capitalism 3.0 
CAMBRIDGE Â­ - Capitalism is in the throes of its most severe crisis in many decades . 
A combination of deep recession , global economic dislocations , and effective nationalization of large swathes of the financial sector in the world &apos;s advanced economies has deeply unsettled the balance between markets and states . 
Where the new balance will be struck is anybody &apos;s guess . 
Those who predict capitalism &apos;s demise have to contend with one important historical fact : capitalism has an almost unlimited capacity to reinvent itself . 
Indeed , its malleability is the reason it has overcome periodic crises over the centuries and outlived critics from Karl Marx on . 
The real question is not whether capitalism can survive - it can - but whether world leaders will demonstrate the leadership needed to take it to its next phase as we emerge from our current predicament . 
Capitalism has no equal when it comes to unleashing the collective economic energies of human societies . 
That is why all prosperous societies are capitalistic in the broad sense of the term : they are organized around private property and allow markets to play a large role in allocating resources and determining economic rewards . 
The catch is that neither property rights nor markets can function on their own . 
They require other social institutions to support them . 
So property rights rely on courts and legal enforcement , and markets depend on regulators to rein in abuse and fix market failures . 
At the political level , capitalism requires compensation and transfer mechanisms to render its outcomes acceptable . 
As the current crisis has demonstrated yet again , capitalism needs stabilizing arrangements such as a lender of last resort and counter-cyclical fiscal policy . 
In other words , capitalism is not self-creating , self-sustaining , self-regulating , or self-stabilizing . 
The history of capitalism has been a process of learning and re-learning these lessons . 
Adam Smith &apos;s idealized market society required little more than a &quot; night-watchman state . &quot; 
All that governments needed to do to ensure the division of labor was to enforce property rights , keep the peace , and collect a few taxes to pay for a limited range of public goods . 
Through the early part of the twentieth century , capitalism was governed by a narrow vision of the public institutions needed to uphold it . 
In practice , the state &apos;s reach often went beyond this conception ( as , say , in the case of Bismarck &apos;s introduction of old-age pensions in Germany in 1889 ) . 
But governments continued to see their economic roles in restricted terms . 
This began to change as societies became more democratic and labor unions and other groups mobilized against capitalism &apos;s perceived abuses . 
Anti-trust policies were spearheaded in the Unites States . 
The usefulness of activist monetary and fiscal policies became widely accepted in the aftermath of the Great Depression . 
The share of public spending in national income rose rapidly in today &apos;s industrialized countries , from below 10 % on average at the end of the nineteenth century to more than 20 % just before World War II . 
And , in the wake of WWII , most countries erected elaborate social-welfare states in which the public sector expanded to more than 40 % of national income on average . 
This &quot; mixed-economy &quot; model was the crowning achievement of the twentieth century . 
The new balance that it established between state and market set the stage for an unprecedented period of social cohesion , stability , and prosperity in the advanced economies that lasted until the mid-1970 &quot; s . 
This model became frayed from the 1980 &quot; s on , and now appears to have broken down . 
The reason can be expressed in one word : globalization . 
The postwar mixed economy was built for and operated at the level of nation-states , and required keeping the international economy at bay . 
The Bretton Woods-GATT regime entailed a &quot; shallow &quot; form of international economic integration that implied controls on international capital flows , which Keynes and his contemporaries had viewed as crucial for domestic economic management . 
Countries were required to undertake only limited trade liberalization , with plenty of exceptions for socially sensitive sectors ( agriculture , textiles , services ) . 
This left them free to build their own versions of national capitalism , as long as they obeyed a few simple international rules . 
The current crisis shows how far we have come from that model . 
Financial globalization , in particular , played havoc with the old rules . 
When Chinese-style capitalism met American-style capitalism , with few safety valves in place , it gave rise to an explosive mix . 
There were no protective mechanisms to prevent a global liquidity glut from developing , and then , in combination with US regulatory failings , from producing a spectacular housing boom and crash . 
Nor were there any international roadblocks to prevent the crisis from spreading from its epicenter . 
The lesson is not that capitalism is dead . 
It is that we need to reinvent it for a new century in which the forces of economic globalization are much more powerful than before . 
Just as Smith &apos;s minimal capitalism was transformed into Keynes &quot; mixed economy , we need to contemplate a transition from the national version of the mixed economy to its global counterpart . 
This means imagining a better balance between markets and their supporting institutions at the global level . 
Sometimes , this will require extending institutions outward from nation states and strengthening global governance . 
At other times , it will mean preventing markets from expanding beyond the reach of institutions that must remain national . 
The right approach will differ across country groupings and among issue areas . 
Designing the next capitalism will not be easy . 
But we do have history on our side : capitalism &apos;s saving grace is that it is almost infinitely malleable .
