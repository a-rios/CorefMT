Save the Emerging Markets 
CAMBRIDGE - If the world were fair , most emerging markets would be watching the financial crisis engulfing the world &apos;s advanced economies from the sidelines - if not entirely unaffected , not overly concerned either . 
For once , what has set financial markets ablaze are not their excesses , but those of Wall Street . 
Emerging markets &quot; external and fiscal positions have been stronger than ever , thanks to the hard lessons learned from their own crisis-prone history . 
We might even have allowed these countries a certain measure of schadenfreude in the troubles of the United States and other rich countries , just as we might expect kids to take perverse delight from their parents &quot; getting into the kinds of trouble they so adamantly warn their children against . 
Instead , emerging markets are suffering financial convulsions of possibly historic proportions . 
The fear is no longer that they will be unable to insulate themselves . 
Some of these countries should have known better and might have protected themselves sooner . 
There is little excuse for Iceland , which essentially turned itself into a highly leveraged hedge fund . 
Several other countries in Central and Eastern Europe , such as Hungary , Ukraine , and the Baltic states , were also living dangerously , with large current-account deficits and firms and households running up huge debts in foreign currency . 
Argentina , the international financial system &apos;s enfant terrible , could always be relied on to produce a gimmick to spook investors - in this case a nationalization of its private pension funds . 
But financial markets have made little distinction between these countries and others like Mexico , Brazil , South Korea , or Indonesia , which until just a few weeks ago appeared to be models of financial health . 
Consider what has happened to South Korea and Brazil . 
Both economies have experienced currency crises within recent memory - South Korea in 1997-1998 and Brazil in 1999 - and both subsequently took steps to increase their financial resilience . 
They reduced inflation , floated their currencies , ran external surpluses or small deficits , and , most importantly , accumulated mountains of foreign reserves ( which now comfortably exceed their short-term external debts ) . 
Brazil &apos;s financial good behavior was rewarded as recently as April of this year when Standard 
Poor &apos;s raised its credit rating to investment-grade . 
( South Korea has been investment-grade for years . ) 
But both are nonetheless getting hammered in financial markets . In the last two months , their currencies have lost around a quarter of their value against the US dollar . 
Their stock markets have declined by even more ( 40 % in Brazil and one-third in South Korea ) . 
None of this can be explained by economic fundamentals . 
Both countries have experienced strong growth recently . 
Brazil is a commodity exporter , while South Korea is not . 
South Korea is hugely dependent on exports to advanced countries , Brazil much less so . 
They and other emerging-market countries are victims of a rational flight to safety , exacerbated by an irrational panic . 
The public guarantees that rich countries &quot; governments have extended to their financial sectors have exposed more clearly the critical line of demarcation between &quot; safe &quot; and &quot; risky &quot; assets , with emerging markets clearly in the latter category . 
Economic fundamentals have fallen by the wayside . 
To make matters even worse , emerging markets are deprived of the one tool that the advanced countries have employed in order to stem their own financial panics : domestic fiscal resources or domestic liquidity . 
Emerging markets need foreign currency and , therefore , external support . 
What needs to be done is clear . 
The International Monetary Fund and the G7 countries &quot; central banks must act as global lenders of last resort and provide ample liquidity - quickly and with few strings attached - to support emerging markets &quot; currencies . 
The scale of the lending that is required will likely run into hundreds of billions of US dollars , and exceed anything that the IMF has done to date . 
If necessary , the IMF can issue special drawing rights ( SDRs ) to generate the global liquidity needed . 
Moreover , China , which holds nearly $ 2 trillion in foreign reserves , must be part of this rescue mission . 
The Chinese economy &apos;s dynamism is highly dependent on exports , which would suffer greatly from a collapse of emerging markets . 
In fact , China , with its need for high growth to pay for social peace , may be the country most at risk from a severe global downturn . 
Naked self-interest should persuade the advanced countries as well . 
Collapsing emerging-market currencies , and the resulting trade pressures , will make it all the more difficult for them to prevent their unemployment levels from rising significantly . 
In the absence of a backstop for emerging-country finances , the doomsday scenario of a protectionist vicious cycle reminiscent of the 1930 &quot; s could no longer be ruled out . 
The United States Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund have both taken some positive steps . The Fed has created a swap facility for four countries ( South Korea , Brazil , Mexico and Singapore ) of $ 30 billion each . The IMF has announced a new quick-dispersing short-term facility for a limited number of countries with good policies . The questions are whether these will be enough and what happens to those countries that will not be able to avail themselves of these programs . 
So when the G-20 countries meet in Washington on November 15 for their crisis summit , this is the agenda item that should dominate their discussion . 
There will be plenty of time to debate a new Bretton Woods and the construction of a global regulatory apparatus . 
The priority for now is to save the emerging markets from the consequences of Wall Street &apos;s financial follies .
