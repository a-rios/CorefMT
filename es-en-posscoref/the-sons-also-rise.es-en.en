The Sons Also Rise 
The looming succession of Ilam Aliyev to replace his dying father , Haider Aliyev , as Azerbaijan &apos;s ruler marks a triumph of nepotism on a scale other postcommunist leaders can only dream about . 
But Azerbaijan &apos;s dynastic politics are hardly exceptional . 
One Bush has practically succeeded another as America &apos;s president , and the son of Singapore &apos;s founder , Lee Kwan Hew , is to become the country &apos;s premier . 
Indeed , democratic leaders with dynastic dreams have bedeviled India , the Philippines , Indonesia , Sri Lanka , Haiti , and many other countries . 
Despite Communists &apos; self-proclaimed &quot; divine right &quot; to a monopoly on power , other systems have proven far more vulnerable to monarchist seizures . 
Until the Aliyev &apos;s came along , only North Korea &apos;s utterly loony Kim Il Sung managed to anoint his son atop a red throne . 
Otherwise , communist patriarchs - and their often scarcely more democratic postcommunist successors - have not seen fit to pitch their bloodlines against the sprawling institutional bureaucracy left behind by Leninism . 
Why ? 
By its nature communism - whose bureaucracy still exists in almost unadulterated form in the countries of the former Soviet Union - spawned lobbies and clans with a combined might that even the closest-knit family can scarcely expect to overcome . 
As a result , postcommunists prefer to place their offspring in lucrative commercial jobs where they can pile up foreign-currency fortunes . 
Kim Jong Il &apos;s father similarly ensured a smooth succession a decade ago by appointing family members to positions of power for 40 years , clearing the way by sending the incumbents to concentration camps . 
But another reason behind North Korea &apos;s dynastic succession was that Kim Il Sung created a national ideology , Juche , that mixed communism with a heavy dose of Confucian values . 
Confucianism exalts an idealized bond between father and son as the model for all human relations . 
As sons must revere fathers , so subjects must revere their rulers . 
Perhaps this &quot; Confucian factor &quot; is playing some part in Singapore &apos;s succession . 
In &quot; The Communist Manifesto , &quot; Marx and Engels dismissed the family as the product and protector of private gain . 
Such ideas were hardly new . 
In Plato &apos;s ideal republic , children would be separated from their parents at birth , so that &quot; no mother shall know her own child . &quot; 
In the brave new world of postrevolutionary Russia , Anatoli Lunacharski looked forward to freedom from the mutual relations of husbands , wives , fathers , children , so you could not tell who was related to whom and how closely . 
A glimpse of what it meant to be the child of a very top leader can be found in Svetlana Stalin &apos;s account of her brother , Vasily . &quot; He lived in a big government dacha with an enormous staff , a stable and kennels , all of course at government expense . . . 
They gave him medals , higher and higher ranks , horses , automobiles , privileges , everything . &quot; 
An alcoholic , Vasily was a lieutenant-general before 30 and air commander of the Moscow military district . 
For all the theorizing of Plato and Marx , the family seems to prevail unless other social institutions counteract or supersede it . 
Nepotism , patronage within the family circle , is thus a natural way for anybody in power , or aspiring to it , to strengthen his support in societies where other institutions are weak or non-existent , or where the destruction of existing institutions forms part of the power-grabber &apos;s intentions . 
Nepotism as a means of security is readily seen in the successful revolutionary &apos;s habit of appointing a brother or cousin to run the army : Fidel Castro did so in Cuba , Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua , Hafez Assad in Syria , and Saddam Hussein in Iraq . 
It is also a way of &quot; banking &quot; the spoils of power with a view to living off the interest later . 
Relatives can work at jobs which it would be improper or inconvenient for the family &apos;s head to be seen doing himself . 
For example , most modern societies , including postcommunist ones , favor a division between the makers of big money and the holders of high office because of the conflicts between public and private interest . 
If the jobs of ruling and moneymaking are shared across generations , or among brothers or cousins or in-laws , criticism is more easily deflected . 
Nepotism of this type is practically the organizing principle of big business in China , where most lucrative deals involve the &quot; princelings , &quot; the offspring of the communist leaders , who number perhaps 3,000-4,000 . 
If and when communism collapses in China , the piling-up of fortunes within leading families will probably have played a crucial role by persuading those leaders that life can offer pursuits even more rewarding than the struggle for socialism . 
All of this is fine for those who practice nepotism . 
The problem is that the public &apos;s loss is usually far greater than the family &apos;s gain . 
This is not necessarily because ruling families appropriate so much that they impoverish everybody else . 
Far more damaging is the simple fact that when a closed group monopolizes much of society &apos;s power and wealth , initiative and enterprise are stifled in the wider population . 
Queues of astrologers now reportedly camp outside the young Aliyev &apos;s home in Baku . 
However , the true danger to all would-be 21st Century dynasts lies not in their stars , but in themselves .
