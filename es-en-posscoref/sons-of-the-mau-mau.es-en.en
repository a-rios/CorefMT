Sons of the Mau Mau 
WASHINGTON - At the beginning of last year , Kenya seemed to be descending into madness . 
Those scenes return as if from a nightmare : children massacred inside burning churches , mobs using machetes at will in city slums , a country on the brink of breakdown . 
By the time the dust settled , more than 1,500 people had been killed and over 400,000 displaced , following an election that observers dismissed as rigged . 
Kenya was saved from the abyss by a shotgun marriage between the country &apos;s ethnic Kikuyu president , Mwai Kibaki , and his Luo challenger , Raila Odinga , who was given the post of prime minister . 
The power-sharing government , fostered by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Western powers , stabilized the country and gave Kenyans hope in a tough year that has seen food and fuel prices skyrocket and drought plague the north . 
But if the government is to succeed and prevent further violence , Kenya must tackle the roots of its election chaos . 
These include poverty , tribalism , and the failure of the country to live up to the vision of its first president , Jomo Kenyatta . 
Speaking in 1952 - prior to independence - Kenyatta said : &quot; It has never been known in history that a country prospers without equality . 
As long as people are held down , corruption is sure to rise , and the only answer to this is a policy of equality . 
If we work together as one , we must succeed . &quot; 
Today &apos;s Kenya bears little resemblance to this vision - 48 % of Kenyans live in poverty and 75 % of young people are unemployed . 
Urban slums like Nairobi &apos;s Kibera - home to over one million people - remain largely untouched by government services . 
Into this vacuum have stepped tribal gangs including the ethnic Kalenjin Sabaot Land Defence Force and the Luo Taliban , which was named , according to one member , in honor of its Afghan heroes &quot; &quot; defense of their people and way of life . &quot; 
These groups frequently challenge law and order through intimidation , extortion , and violence . 
But no group has provoked government ire like the Kikuyu Mungiki . 
The organization - which claims one million members - is guilty of horrific acts of violence that continue unabated , including the recent beheading of the son of one of Kibaki &apos;s key allies . 
Mungiki &apos;s origins can be traced in part to the sons and daughters of Mau Mau fighters , the dispossessed Kikuyu who fought the Kikuyu elite and British colonists in the 1950s . 
Today , they have vowed to fight government elites , Christianity , and foreign influences like the IMF and World Bank , which they accuse of re-colonizing Kenya . 
Western culture is shunned and traditional Kikuyu beliefs like female circumcision promoted . 
Kibaki has responded harshly to Mungiki , waging a &quot; war on terror &quot; -style campaign to defeat it , which has lead to thousands of deaths , according to Kenyan human rights groups . 
Kibaki was aided by the Bush administration , which was concerned that Kenyan instability would harm Western business interests and jeopardize American anti-terror operations in Somalia . 
Yet , at the same time Kenya &apos;s president was trying to suppress Mungiki , some of his Kikuyu allies in government allegedly activated Mungiki as attack dogs following attacks on the Kikuyu by the Luo and other tribes in the post-election chaos . 
Many Kenyans suspect that these politicians &quot; names are on a &quot; secret list &quot; of guilty officials from all sides contained in a recent report by Kenyan Justice Philip Waki . 
The discrepancy in Mungiki &apos;s treatment by the government is a good indication of what is going wrong in Kenya . 
The state fails to provide for its citizens ; poverty , political marginalization , and land disputes then fester , fueling ethnic militias that function as a kind of tribal shadow government , often providing social services . 
The state then brutally crushes the militias , making matters worse , and politicians manipulate the actors for their own purposes . 
To break this cycle , Kenya needs a new approach to government - a return to Kenyatta &apos;s original vision of justice and equality , and a way for the poor to benefit from economic growth and globalization . 
This does not mean using state power to crush groups that have arisen in part due to the state &apos;s own failures , but rather to uphold law and order by prosecuting only the guilty and understanding why such groups are gaining recruits in the first place . 
Odinga &apos;s pledge last year to begin a dialogue with Mungiki is a good step , but it must be followed with action . 
Kenyans should be proud of what they have accomplished in a year that has also seen the election of a man they claim as their own , Barack Obama , as America &apos;s president . 
But if the old pattern continues , and massive poverty-stricken populations are left out of the political process , the country could explode in another orgy of violence . 
For all the parties involved , including the coalition government and its Western allies , the stakes are much too high for a return to &quot; business as usual . &quot;
