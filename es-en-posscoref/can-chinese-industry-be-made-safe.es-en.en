Can Chinese Industry Be Made Safe ? 
After a massive gas well explosion killed 243 people in southwest China last December , China &apos;s State Council and National People &apos;s Congress have announced new rules for industrial safety . 
The authorities &apos; response follows a now-familiar pattern : high-profile pronouncements in the wake of workplace disaster give way to neglect of basic safety standards . 
But if Western experience is any guide , ad hoc responses to high rates of work accidents won &apos;t reduce the risks to Chinese workers . 
Only the development of basic legal institutions will help make Chinese workplaces safer . 
China and other developing Asian economies are experiencing an industrial accident crisis of world-historical proportions . 
Official sources report 14,675 industrial-accident deaths in China in 2003 , but statistics on workplace accidents are notoriously unreliable , and some observers suggest that the number may be closer to 120,000 . 
China &apos;s coalmines are among the most dangerous places to work in the world . 
Chinese garment factories have repeatedly experienced disasters on a par with the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist fire in New York City a century ago , which killed 146 workers , all young women . 
Conditions may well get worse before they get better . 
Even though China instituted new initiatives in industrial safety at the beginning of 2003 , official estimates indicate that industrial accident deaths increased by almost 10 % last year . 
Yet as the example of the Triangle fire suggests , the China &apos;s experience is not unprecedented . 
Until the recent Asian accident crisis , the poorest workplace safety record in world history belonged to the United States in the fifty years following the American Civil War . 
Coalmines in Pennsylvania in the 1860s - where 6 % of the workers were killed each year , 6 % crippled , and another 6 % temporarily disabled - looked very much like the mines now operating in China &apos;s Shaanxi Province . 
Industry-wide , one American worker in fifty at the turn of the last century was killed or seriously disabled each year in work-related accidents . 
Accidents were the leading cause of death among workers in dozens of hazardous industries . 
Of course , American industry is still plagued by serious safety problems . 
But seen from a historical perspective , there has been a striking decline in work-related injuries and deaths in the US . 
There were 30,000 annual work-related fatalities a century ago ; today , the annual average is around 5,000 , even as the population has tripled . 
What explains this huge improvement in occupational safety in the US ? 
Increased union membership in the mid-twentieth century clearly helped , as workers bargained and lobbied for improved working conditions . 
In recent decades , some of the most dangerous work has been shipped overseas ( ironically , much of it to China ) . 
But the deeper historical reasons for improved workplace safety lie in an array of legal institutions developed by workers , employers , lawyers , and lawmakers at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries . 
American workers &apos; organizations , for example , developed insurance benefits for their members and sought to exercise collective control to improve workplace safety . 
American lawyers developed modern accident law that created remedies against negligent employers . 
Most importantly , drawing on reforms first implemented in Germany , England , and France , workers &apos; compensation statutes provided compensation for injured workers and created powerful incentives for employers to reduce accident tolls . 
In the 1910 &apos;s , American workplace injuries began to fall in virtually every industry , except coal mining ( where injury rates remained high for several decades ) . 
Each of these innovations helped create an institutional infrastructure capable of dealing with the problem of work accidents - and , indeed , with the wider social problems of disability , sickness , old age , and unemployment . 
Why ? 
Because workplace safety and industrial accident compensation turned out to be critical early tests of western legal systems &apos; administrative capacity to deal with the systemic problems of industrial free-market societies . 
Of course , what worked for the US may not work for China . 
There are many different ways that legal systems can respond to occupational safety problems . 
The US , for example , never developed a powerful body of factory inspectors capable of providing effective enforcement of public safety standards . 
Other western states , such as Germany , have successfully relied on centralized regulation and social insurance systems ever since Bismarck reformed the German law of accidents in the 1880 &apos;s . 
Unfortunately , China is obstructing all available paths to improved workplace safety . 
National safety standards and inspection regimes reflect the underlying pathologies of the Chinese state , in which lower-ranking officials report only positive information up the bureaucratic food chain . 
At the same time , limits on workers &apos; ability to organize independent unions have inhibited grassroots forms of safety monitoring . 
Even Chinese media have come under fire from officials for uncovering the kinds of workplace hazards that muckraking journalists revealed a century ago in the US . 
Lawsuits are apparently increasingly common , but they are notoriously cumbersome , and judges are not independent from factory bosses . 
Compensation awards to injured workers and their families are pitifully low and fail to give employers incentives to make their workplaces safe . 
The lesson of the US and European experiences is that improving workplace safety depends on the development of basic rule-of-law standards in courts , workplaces , and administrative bureaucracies . 
Edicts and exhortations from the State Council are all well and good .
