Why Overseas Chinese Dominate China \ u0027s Exports 
Since the early 1990s , more foreign direct investment ( FDI ) has flowed into China than to any country except America . 
Of this vast capital inflow , overseas Chinese - from Hong Kong , Taiwan , Macao and Southeast Asia - delivered the lion &apos;s share . 
Investments from Hong Kong and Macao claimed 70 % of Chinese FDI in the early 90s ; since then their share has decreased , yet it still accounts for 50 % of China &apos;s total FDI . 
That China receives so much capital from expatriates is a global source of envy . 
Indian officials bemoan the fact that overseas Indians lack both the wealth and the propensity to invest back home . 
Economists and China-watchers celebrate this ready supply of capital , know-how , and marketing channels which enabled China to become - in a short period of time - Asia &apos;s manufacturing base and export power-house . 
Lavish praise for this stream of expatriate FDI , however , misses its deep flaws . 
Yes , expatriate-invested firms produce many Chinese exports , but they often do it by seizing control of export-oriented businesses from indigenous Chinese . 
Two ratios tell the story . 
One is the export / GDP ratio , which rose from 15 % in 1990 to 20 % in 1999 , an increase of 5 % . 
The other is the share of exports by foreign firms of total Chinese exports : this rose from 15 % to almost 40 % during the same period . 
So , foreign firms may create exports for China , but they also divert a big slice of the export pie away from indigenous Chinese entrepreneurs . 
Expatriate control of so much export-oriented businesses reflects a fundamental failing in China &apos;s financial system . 
China may have the second highest savings rate in the world , lagging behind only Singapore , but these funds are usually wasted on inefficient state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . 
These investments have failed to increase the competitiveness of Chinese SOEs , yet have starved efficient local entrepreneurs of the credits they need . 
As a result , expatriate Chinese investors buy up businesses controlled by indigenous entrepreneurs on the cheap because the money they bring is the only source of funds available for business expansion . 
China &apos;s ability to attract so much export-oriented FDI is thus a warning that there is something very wrong with the financial system . 
Discrimination against indigenous private entrepreneurs in China goes beyond finance . 
Until recently , private Chinese firms could not export directly to foreign buyers and could not retain foreign exchange earnings . 
But if you are in the export business , you need foreign exchange to import designs or intermediate inputs . 
The restriction of access to foreign exchange made it impossible for private entrepreneurs to run independent export businesses . 
Chinese law also discriminated against local export businesses . 
Foreign investors often complain that their property rights go unprotected . 
True , perhaps , but private Chinese entrepreneurs get a far worse deal . 
As early as 1982 , China &apos;s Constitution contained a clause to protect property rights of foreign investors ; domestic private entrepreneurs were not offered the same protection until 1999 ! 
Supposedly , the match between China &apos;s cheap labor costs and the entrepreneurship of expatriate Chinese investors is made in heaven . 
The problem with this view is that it implies that indigenous Chinese entrepreneurs are somehow incompetent . 
What matters about FDI is not only that foreign money comes into China , but also that it brings foreign control of business . 
And foreign control only makes sense if it brings in the management know-how that local entrepreneurs lack . 
Is this a plausible explanation as to why Chinese entrepreneurs cede control to expatriates ? 
A look at other countries may be instructive . 
Native Indian and Turkish entrepreneurs run successful export garment businesses in their countries and contract with foreign buyers to sell goods . 
The foreign buyers provide designs and even raw materials , while domestic entrepreneurs put them together according to required specifications . 
Unless Chinese entrepreneurs are more incompetent than their Indian and Turkish counterparts - and no one suggests that - there is no reason why expatriate Chinese cannot contract with indigenous entrepreneurs to produce goods for export . 
The difference is that FDI brings not only a business opportunity but also financing to liquidity-starved Chinese entrepreneurs , whereas a contract only brings forth a business opportunity . 
China &apos;s entrepreneurs lack money , not talent . 
In fact , in some areas , Chinese entrepreneurs should know more than expatriates . 
Take traditional handicrafts like jade and ivory carving . 
In 1995 , there were some 900 foreign-controlled firms producing traditional Chinese handicrafts ; the average foreign equity share was 88 % . 
Thus , in industries in which Chinese have excelled for thousands of years , foreign control is now almost absolute . 
Cheap labor is the least plausible argument why so much export-oriented FDI has gone to China . 
A Hong Kong firm can contract out its production in Guangdong province to reap the same labor-savings benefits it would gain from investing in China . 
Cheap labor explains why expatriate Chinese seek to produce in China ; it does not explain why their investments are so sought after by the Chinese . 
As China nears membership in the WTO , its political and administrative apparatus is mobilizing to improve the investment environment and property rights for foreign investors . 
But why not look after the interests of domestic entrepreneurs as well ? 
The most urgent task for China &apos;s government is not WTO membership , but improving the political , regulatory and financial treatment of Chinese entrepreneurs , who are as talented , innovative and hard working as their expatriate counterparts . 
There is no compelling reason why they should lose control of their businesses - often at fire-sale prices - to overseas cousins on so massive a scale .
