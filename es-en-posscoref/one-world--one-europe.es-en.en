One World , One Europe 
PARIS - G-8 , G-5 , G-20 , G-2 , G-3 , and now the G-14 ( the G-8 plus the G-5 plus Egypt ) : never have the &quot; mathematics &quot; of world order seemed more complex and confusing . 
Kofi Annan , on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the United Nations in 2005 , attempted to adjust the multilateral institutions of our world to fit its new realities . 
It was a brave effort that came too soon . 
The Northern industrial world was not yet ready to recognize the new weight of the emerging powers and the need to strike a new balance between North and South , East and West . 
Has the current financial and economic crisis , given its traumatic depth and the obvious responsibility of the United States as its source , created the necessary conditions and a more favourable climate for a major re-foundation of the multilateral institutions ? 
It is too early to be confident that true change will come . 
What is certain is that a rebalancing between North and South must start with an honest and hard-headed look at Europe &apos;s current status in our multilateral system . 
Nowadays , there is both too much and too little Europe , or , to put it differently , too many European countries are represented in the world &apos;s premier forums , with too many voices . 
But , in terms of weight and influence , there is not enough united Europe . 
In the early 1980 &quot; s , a former French foreign minister , Jean François-Poncet suggested that France and the United Kingdom give up their seats on the UN Security Council in favour of a single European Union seat . 
Germany would no longer seek a seat , Italy would not feel left out , and Europe &apos;s international identity would be strengthened in a spectacular way . 
Of course , this was not to be . 
France and the UK were not willing to give up the symbol of their nuclear and international status . 
They are probably are even less willing to do so today in the name of a Union that is less popular than ever , at least in the British Isles . 
But let &apos;s be reasonable : the absurdity of Italy &apos;s presence in the G-8 , together with the lack of official membership for countries such as China , India , and Brazil , is no longer acceptable or tenable . 
Yet , because of that anomaly , Europe suffers from a grave deficit of legitimacy and presence internationally . 
Of course , the US cannot be compared with a Union that is nowhere near becoming a United States of Europe . 
But if the contrast between the two sides of the Atlantic , between the continent of &quot; Yes , we can &quot; and the continent of &quot; Yes , we should , &quot; is so immense , it is for reasons that Europeans are refusing to face or even to discuss . 
The first one is the EU &apos;s lack of anything that incarnates it . 
It would be absurd to set US President Barack Obama and EU Commission President José Manuel Barroso against each other as equals . 
Whereas Obama owes his election in large part to his charisma , Barroso is likely to succeed himself precisely because of his lack of charisma , because he says very little in so many languages . 
But , for national leaders in the EU whose last ambition is to have to deal with a new Jacques Delors , i.e. , a man with ideas of his own , a cipher like Barroso is just the man for the job . 
On the other hand , the EU is paying a steep price for the bureaucratic anonymity of its leaders . 
A process of escalating alienation and indifference between the Union and its citizens is at work , illustrated by low turnout in the last European Parliament elections . 
As a result , there is less Union in Europe and less Europe in the world . 
A strong European voice , such as Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s during the French presidency of the EU , may make a difference , but only for six months , and at the cost of reinforcing other European countries &quot; nationalist feelings in reaction to the expression of &quot; Gallic pride . &quot; 
If Europeans want to regain self-confidence , pride and , collective hope , they must seize the opportunity that the necessary and inevitable adjustment of the multilateral system represents for them . 
They should make of necessity an opportunity . 
Of course , a single European voice in the major multilateral institutions appears more unrealistic than ever : who wants it , except maybe the EU &apos;s smaller members ? 
But Europe &apos;s last chance to be a credible actor in a multi-polar world rests precisely on its ability to present a single , united , responsible voice . 
Europe currently exists as an economic actor , not as an international political actor . 
If Europeans were to set for themselves the goal of speaking with one voice , of having one representative in the spectrum of multilateral institutions - starting with the UN Security Council - they would be taken more seriously . 
In this case , one can really say that &quot; less is more . &quot; 
Such a move would be deemed premature by numerous critics . 
Twenty years ago , right after the fall of the Berlin Wall , one could say &quot; I want Europe so much that I am willing to accept one Germany &quot; - a revolutionary move if one had in mind the French writer François Mauriac &apos;s famous joke , &quot; I like Germany so much , I want two of them . &quot; 
In today &apos;s global age , with the rise of emerging powers and the relative decline of the West , the only Europe that will be taken seriously is a Europe that can speak and be seen as one .
