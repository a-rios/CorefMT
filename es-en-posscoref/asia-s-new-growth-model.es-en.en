Asia &apos;s New Growth Model 
MILAN - Led by Asia , the share of the global economy held by emerging markets has risen steadily over recent decades . 
For the countries of Asia - especially its rising giants , China and India - sustainable growth is no longer part of a global challenge . 
Instead , it has become a national growth-strategy issue . 
This marks a sea change in the global structure of incentives with respect to achieving sustainability . 
Over the next few decades , almost all of the world &apos;s growth in energy consumption , urbanization , automobile usage , airline travel , and carbon emissions will come from emerging economies . 
By mid-century , the number of people living in what will be ( by then ) high-income economies will rise to 4.5 billion , from one billion today . 
Global GDP , which currently stands at about $ 60 trillion , will at least triple in the next 30 years . 
If emerging economies try to reach advanced-country income levels by following roughly the same pattern as their predecessors , the impact on natural resources and the environment would be enormous , risky , and probably disastrous . 
One or several tipping points would most likely bring the process to a screeching halt . 
Energy security and cost , water and air quality , climate , ecosystems on land and in the oceans , food security , and much more would be threatened . 
At present , almost any standard measure of the concentration of global economic power would show a declining trend . 
If that were to continue , the result would be a world in which each country &apos;s contribution to pressure on natural resources and the environment would make sustainability a major global challenge , as the free-rider problem in its most extreme form would prevail . 
To change course , global agreements that impinge on growth would be needed , along with systems that ensure compliance . 
But the trend in concentration will reverse about a decade from now , owing to the size and growth rates of India and China , which together account for almost 40 % of the world &apos;s population . 
Although their current combined GDP is still a relatively small fraction of global output ( about 15 % ) , that share is rising rapidly . 
By mid-century , India and China will account for 2.5 billion of the 3.5 billion additional people with advanced-country incomes . 
By themselves , they will cause global GDP to at least double in the next three decades , even in the absence of growth anywhere else . 
For India and China separately , and certainly together , sustainability is no longer mainly a global issue ; it is a domestic challenge to long-term growth . 
Their growth patterns and strategies , and the tradeoffs and choices they make with respect to lifestyle , urbanization , transportation , the environment , and energy efficiency , will largely determine whether their economies can complete the long transition to advanced-income levels . 
Moreover , both countries know it . 
There is a growing awareness among policymakers , businesses , and citizens in China and India ( and in Asia more broadly ) that the historical growth paths that all of their predecessors followed simply will not work , because they do not &quot; scale &quot; to a world economy that is triple its current size . 
As a result , these countries will have to invent new growth patterns to reach advanced-country levels of development . 
They are too big to be free riders , so the incentives relating to sustainability are becoming internalized as national priorities . 
Perceptions are rapidly coming into line with the reality that sustainability must become a critical ingredient of growth . 
The old model won &apos;t work . 
Of course , no one currently knows how to achieve sustainability at three ( or more ) times the size of the current global economy . 
That objective will be determined by a process of discovery , experimentation , innovation , and creativity , with tradeoffs along the way . 
But the incentive to ignore these issues is gone , independent of what other countries choose to do and whatever global agreements may be reached . 
The large , high-growth emerging economies have certain advantages . 
Integrating sustainability into growth strategies and policies is in their self-interest , and it is consistent with their long-term time horizons . 
The legacy assets that one finds in advanced countries - the way cities are configured , for example - don &apos;t have to be replaced to the same extent . 
China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan lowers the growth forecast ( to 7 % ) to create &quot; space &quot; to deal with issues like equity , sustainability , and the environment . 
The process of discovering a new growth path has started . 
The emergence of sustainability as a critical element in growth strategies in the worlds &quot; future largest economies is an extraordinarily positive development , because national needs , goals , and priorities remain much more powerful incentives than international agreements . 
This all may seem to be at variance with common wisdom . 
How could a tripling of global GDP and a fourfold expansion of the world &apos;s high-income population be good news , given all that goes with it ? 
Well , it depends on what one thinks the alternative is . 
Slow global growth would benefit natural resources and the environment . 
But that will not happen unless the world &apos;s resource supplies and environmental underpinnings collapse . 
So the baseline is high emerging-market growth , the key to which is innovation and adjustment of the growth path . 
As Asians drive growth toward more sustainable patterns , they will increase the incentives for others to do so by generating new technology , lowering the environmental cost of growth , and undercutting the argument that leadership incurs competitive and other economic costs , but few benefits . 
To say that free-rider problems are gone , or that multinational agreements are no longer desirable , would be incorrect . 
But real parallel progress , driven by necessity and self-interest , is becoming the most likely medium-term path .
