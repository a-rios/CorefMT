The Man Who Made Malaysia 
Once again , Malaysia &apos; s Mahathir Muhammed acerbic tongue has incited controversy . 
But his long rule in his country  -  which ends November 1  -  amounts to much more than intemperate remarks , as Wang Gungwu , one of Southeast Asia &apos;s leading strategic analysts , suggests . 
Dr. Mahathir Muhammed is stepping down after serving more than 22 years as the leader of Malaysia and its ruling United Malay National Organisation ( UMNO ) . 
Today &apos;s gleaming , modern Malaysia is unimaginable without Mahathir and UMNO , which also produced Tunku Abdul Rahman , the country &apos;s first prime minister . 
Like Mahathir , Malaysia &apos;s fourth prime minister , Tunku led the government and the party for more than twenty years . 
Generation-long reigns seem to have served Malaysia exceedingly well since independence . 
Indeed , the continuity delivered by these two men is the secret of Malaysia &apos;s success as a rapidly developing multi-cultural state . 
Both began their careers as Malay nationalists who sought to promote the rights of the Malay majority after the British left . 
But they also recognized that the country &apos;s sizable , and economically powerful , Chinese and Indian minorities , among other groups , were critical to the country &apos;s development and should be persuaded to accept the new Malay-led state as their own . 
Mahathir became prime minister in 1981 when the region was on the eve of historic change , following the end of the Vietnam War and Indonesia &apos;s stabilization following the bloody civil strife of the 1960 &apos;s . 
The global economic system was buoyant and East Asia , not least post-Maoist China , was more deeply committed than anyone expected to support that system . 
This encouraged Mahathir to make a clean break with the British colonial heritage . 
His call to &quot; look East &quot; marked the beginning of an ambitious industrialization policy that culminated , during his 10th year in power , with the Vision 2020 plan to catch up with Western levels of development . 
By 1997 , Mahathir was at the pinnacle of his power , inspiring the country to believe that it would not be long before all of the country &apos;s communities would see themselves as sharing a common Malay nationality . 
But the Asian financial crisis that struck later that year halted the region &apos;s trajectory of rapid growth . 
Against most international advice , Mahathir imposed capital controls and a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit to buy time for recovery . 
He also sought to shift the sense of crisis away from economics to politics ( where he retained an iron grip ) by removing his designated heir , Anwar Ibrahim , who was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance . 
Anwar &apos;s arrest and trial stunned the country , but Mahathir surprised few Malays - either allies or opponents - by restoring his authority so thoroughly following the crisis that he was able to handpick Abdullah Badawi as his successor . 
The launch of the war on terror provided Mahathir with another opportunity to recover politically . 
In the face of a world frightened by Islam , Mahathir was able to affirm a neglected facet of his leadership , repeatedly reminding the world that he presided over the one country in the world where a Muslim majority and large non-Muslim minorities live in peace . 
There are several reasons for this success , and Mahathir deserves much of the credit . 
Despite wearing his Malay nationalism on his sleeve , Mahathir ultimately persuaded most non-Malays that he was not simply a communal leader but someone who cared for all Malaysia &apos;s communities . 
In time , he made people forget that he had opposed Tunku Abdul Rahman for not being sufficiently &quot; Malay &quot; and for conceding too much to the Chinese and Indian coalition partners in Tunku &apos;s early post-independence governments . 
Mahathir , the first commoner to be Malaysian prime minister , became a leading Asian modernizer in another fundamental way , as well . 
He quickly took up a divisive constitutional battle against the hereditary Malay rulers , the nine sultans , and succeeded in curtailing their privileges and powers . 
Having overcome the inertia of communal suspicions and dynastic traditions , Mahathir was able to drive the country onto a course of rapid industrialization . 
Initially , his ambitious plans to make Malaysia an economic model for developing nations exposed him to both ridicule and admiration . 
Many thought that he was moving too far , too fast ; that he was expecting too much from Malays asked to make the cultural quantum leap from village to boardroom in a generation . 
But he was determined to break the traditional Malay mold and succeeded in building a new - albeit still small - urban middle class . 
Mahathir appears to have been spurred on by the successes of the neighboring island-state of Singapore , briefly a part of Malaysia , on its swift march to First World status . 
Having studied for his medical degree in Singapore , he appreciated the country &apos;s commitment to modernity . 
He will not want Malaysia to fall far behind . 
This competitive approach towards Singapore is in line with the concerns he expressed in his influential book , The Malay Dilemma . 
His thinking has become more adventurous and he has moved on to tackling the world of cyberspace and multimedia corridors . 
But the goal is still to build a Malaysia where Malays will always lead non-Malay minorities in shaping the country &apos;s future . 
That , perhaps , is the greatest continuity of all in Malaysia &apos;s legacy of generational rulers .
