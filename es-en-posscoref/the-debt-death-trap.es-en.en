The Debt Death Trap 
NEW YORK - The Greek financial saga is the tip of an iceberg of problems of public-debt sustainability for many advanced economies , and not only the so-called PIIGS ( Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Greece , and Spain ) . 
Indeed , the OECD now estimates that public debt-to-GDP ratios in advanced economies will rise to an average of around 100 % of GDP . 
The International Monetary Fund has recently put out similar estimates . 
Within the PIIGS , the problems are not just excessive public deficits and debt ratios ( in different degrees and measures in the five countries ) . 
These are economies that , even a decade ago , were losing market share to China and Asia , owing to their labor-intensive and low value-added exports . 
After a decade that saw wages grow faster than productivity , unit labor costs ( and the real exchange rate based on those costs ) appreciated sharply . 
The ensuing loss of competitiveness manifested itself in large and growing current-account deficits and slowing growth . 
The final nail in the coffin was the appreciation of the euro between 2002 and 2008 . 
So , even if Greece and other PIIGS had the political resolve to reduce massively their large fiscal deficits - and that is a big if , given the political resistance to spending cuts and tax increases - fiscal contraction may , at least in the short run , make the current recession worse as higher taxes and lower spending reduce aggregate demand . 
If GDP falls , achieving a certain deficit and debt target ( as a share of GDP ) becomes impossible . 
This , indeed , was the debt death trap that engulfed Argentina between 1998 and 2001 . 
Restoring sustained growth requires real currency depreciation . 
There are only three ways that this can occur . 
One is deflation that reduces prices and wages by 20-30 % . 
Default and an exit from the euro would occur well before that . 
The second path is to follow the German model of accelerating structural reforms and corporate restructuring to increase productivity growth while keeping wage growth moderate . 
But the main beneficiary would be Germany . 
Short of a miracle , Greece looks close to insolvency . 
At the onset of its crisis , Argentina &apos;s budget deficit , public debt , and current-account deficit ( as a share of GDP ) were about 3 % , 50 % and 2 % , respectively . 
Those ratios for Greece are far worse : 12.9 % , 120 % and 10 % . 
So it will take a Herculean effort , luck , and support from the European Union and the IMF to reduce the probability of an eventual default and exit from the eurozone . 
Greece is currently too interconnected to be allowed to collapse : since it has about $ 400 billion of public debt - three-quarters of which is held abroad , mostly by European financial institutions - a disorderly default would lead to massive losses and risk a systemic crisis . 
Moreover , the contagion to the sovereign spreads of the other PIIGS would be massive , tipping over several of these economies . 
So , despite revulsion on the part of Germany and the European Central Bank at the idea of a &quot; bailout , &quot; Greece needs large official financial support this year at rates that are not unsustainable to prevent its current illiquidity from devolving immediately into insolvency . 
The magic trifecta of sustainable debt and deficit ratios , a real depreciation , and restoration of growth looks unlikely to be achievable even with official financial support . 
All successful rescues of countries in financial distress - Mexico , Korea , Thailand , Brazil , Turkey - require two conditions : the country &apos;s credible willingness to impose the fiscal austerity and structural reforms needed to restore sustainability and growth ; and massive amounts of front-loaded official support to avoid a self-fulfilling rollover crisis of maturing public and / or private short-term debts . 
Reform without money on the table does not work , as nervous and trigger-happy investors would rather pull their money out if the country lacks the foreign-currency reserves needed to prevent the equivalent of a bank run on its short-term liabilities . 
So , after a totally flawed plan that would have given money to Greece too late - only when the country risked a refinancing crisis - and at market rates that would make its debt unsustainable , the EU regained its senses and designed a new scheme that is closer to typical IMF conditionality : tranched support with some early front-loaded support and a semi-concessional interest rate . 
Only time will tell if this plan will work : i.e. whether Greece will turn out to be illiquid but solvent , conditional on credible fiscal austerity and structural reforms and with the help of large amounts of financial support . 
For now , the official community has decided to stick with Plan A ; if that fails , Plan B is default to reduce unsustainable debts and a Greek exit from the eurozone to allow depreciation and restoration of competitiveness and growth .
