Putin &apos;s Brezhnev Syndrome 
PARIS - The winner of Sunday &apos;s legislative election in Russia was a foregone conclusion : United Russia , organized by Vladimir Putin . 
Likewise , there is no doubt that Putin himself will win the presidential election due in March 2012 . 
But the public enthusiasm that ratified Putin &apos;s rule for a decade has vanished , something demonstrated by the poor performance of his party , United Russia , in the just concluded elections to the Duma . 
Unlike Europe , beset by a sovereign-debt crisis , and the United States , whose leaders are wrangling over how to stem the deficit , Russia may look like an oasis of stability and continuity . 
But that continuity is more reminiscent of the zastoi , or stagnation , of the Brezhnev era . 
Eight years of 7 % average annual GDP growth during Putin &apos;s previous presidency ( 2000-2008 ) allowed Russia to repay its debts , accumulate almost $ 600 billion in foreign-currency reserves , and join the leading emerging economies . 
A decade after the 1998 crisis brought Russia to its knees , its leaders boasted that the country could weather the 2008 financial crisis . 
Given Russia &apos;s economic fundamentals , Putin &apos;s diminished popularity might appear surprising . 
The International Monetary Fund &apos;s forecast of 4 % growth in 2011 and subsequent years puts Russia well behind China and India , but far ahead of average growth rates in the rich G-7 countries . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s budget will be balanced as long as oil prices remain above $ 110 per barrel . 
Longer-term trends have also improved . 
Rapid demographic decline has been brought to a halt since the turn of the century ( a time when coffins outnumbered cribs by seven to four ) , as generous government subsidies for a third child have boosted the fertility rate from its 1999 low of 1.16 children per woman to 1.58 in 2010 . 
That is still far below the replacement rate of 2.1 , but higher fertility , together with successful measures to reduce male mortality , has slowed the pace of population shrinkage . 
But Russia remains essentially a &quot; rentier state &quot; - that is , a state whose primary source of revenue is rent - in this case , oil and gas - rather than taxation , which thus keeps demands for political representation at bay . 
Instead , the state is the target of political entrepreneurs who strive to capture it in order to capture the rents that it controls . 
Russia has most of the usual features of rentier states : autocracy , weak political and judicial institutions , arbitrary governance , lack of the rule of law , little transparency , restraints on freedom of expression , widespread corruption , cronyism , and nepotism . 
Also common to rentier states are short investment horizons , vulnerability to commodity-price volatility - euphoria when they surge , crisis when they collapse - and an underdeveloped and uncompetitive manufacturing sector . 
Today &apos;s Russia is a gigantic reservoir of raw materials , and its economy relies heavily on commodities - mining and drilling . 
Russia is the world &apos;s largest oil and gas exporter , sitting on more than 25 % of total proven gas reserves . 
Those commodities account for over two thirds of the country &apos;s export earnings , and are the primary source of state revenue . 
The impact on governance is all too predictable . 
In 2011 , Transparency International &apos;s &quot; corruption perception &quot; index ranked Russia 143rd out 182 countries , on a par with Nigeria , and 182nd out of 210 for &quot; control of corruption , &quot; one of the World Bank &apos;s worldwide governance indicators . Regarding the rule of law , there has been only minimal improvement , with Russia ranked 156th . 
In the meantime , infrastructure is crumbling even within the vital extractive industry , while manufacturing is internationally uncompetitive . 
The Russian armaments industry has lost its strong position with India and China , once its two main customers . 
Despite the hype about nanotechnology and a &quot; Russian Silicon Valley &quot; at Skolkovo , spending on Rampamp ; D is a mere one-fifteenth of the US level , and one-quarter of China &apos;s . 
As a proportion of GDP , it has been halved since the early 1990 &quot; s , and is now just 1 % of GDP . 
Scientists and researchers , once the pride of the Soviet Union , have vanished , often lured by more rewarding opportunities , at home or abroad . 
Indeed , Russian universities are almost absent from global rankings : only two appear in the Shanghai University Top-500 list and , at the very bottom , among the 400 rated by The Times Higher Education Supplement . 
Russia also fares poorly - 63rd - in the Global Competitiveness Index released by the World Economic Forum , well behind all developed countries and even many developing countries . 
The same holds for innovation capacity and technology . 
Yet there are hints of hope . 
Russia no longer lags behind the developed world in Internet use , which has provided space for unregulated speech , allowing users to circumvent the official - and overwhelmingly pro-Putin - news media . 
Moreover , after lengthy negotiations , Russia recently reached an agreement with the World Trade Organization to join , implying the need to comply with all relevant obligations regarding transparency and trading rules . 
But comprehensive transformation of Russia &apos;s economy remains doubtful . 
One of Russia &apos;s leading independent economists , Sergei Guriev , the rector of the New Economic School in Moscow , soberly noted in 2010 that 
&quot; meaningful reforms look highly unlikely - for the simple reason that they would harm the interests of Russia &apos;s ruling elites . 
In any resource-rich and undemocratic country , the political class and the business interests that surround it have little or no incentive to support stronger property rights , the rule of law , and competition . 
Indeed , such structural changes would weaken the elite &apos;s grip on political and economic power . 
The status quo - opaque rules , arbitrary decision-making , and lack of accountability - allows insiders to enrich themselves , especially by obtaining a share of commodity-export revenues . &quot; 
When Russia marks the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union this Christmas , it will have much to celebrate . 
Unfortunately , what hasn &apos;t changed will give it much to rue .
