Grumpy Old Men 
LONDON - Having reached pensionable age , I qualify to be a grumpy old man . 
I should be boring my children , and the students at Oxford University where I am Chancellor , with grumbles about how everything is going to the dogs . 
But that is not quite how I see things . 
I went to university myself in 1962 . 
My first term coincided with the Cuban missile crisis . 
The world seemed to be teetering on the brink of nuclear catastrophe . 
Those were the days when global peace was sustained by a concept known suitably enough by the acronym MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction . 
Was that world a worse and more dangerous one than today , where our main nuclear concerns are how to prevent proliferation and strengthen the treaty that has deterred it for the last generation ? 
At the end of my years at Oxford , I went as a student to the United States and visited Alabama . 
You may recall the story of Richard Nixon attending the independence celebrations in Ghana . 
At a gala reception , he went up to one guest , mistaking him for a local , and asked what it felt like to be able to vote and enjoy freedom under the rule of law . 
Within my adult lifetime , we have moved from the murder of civil-rights campaigners in the US to the election of a black president . 
Nothing to be grumpy about there . 
Elsewhere , some of our biggest problems have a sort of Hegelian quality . 
They are the result of solving past problems or of past success . 
Consider , for example , the biggest challenge facing us , which deserves to be called existential : global warming and climate change . 
In the last century , the world got richer ; its population quadrupled ; the number of people living in cities grew thirteen-fold ; and we consumed more of everything . 
Water consumption rose nine-fold and energy use thirteen-fold . 
Industrial output soared to 40 times its level at the beginning of the twentieth century . 
But - and here comes the real hit - carbon-dioxide emissions grew seventeen-fold . 
That is the biggest problem we face - the unforeseen result of increased economic activity and prosperity . 
Looking at preparations for the Copenhagen summit in December , when we will try to broker a new global agreement to combat climate change , does not make me grumpy . 
At last , the big players are taking the issues seriously . 
The US is no longer in denial on the question . 
President Barack Obama and his advisers do not deny the scientific evidence of what is happening to us all . 
In China , political leaders seem genuine in their commitment to reduce the carbon content of their runaway economy . 
The big problems , of course , are how we take account of past responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere , how we balance aggregate national emissions and per capita figures - China leads in the first category ; the US , Australia , and Canada are the biggest culprits in the second - and how we manage technology transfer from developed to emerging and poor economies . 
There will be plenty to moan about if we don &apos;t solve these problems sooner rather than later . 
This is where old men seem past their political expiration dates . 
Let me explain . 
For all of our lives , my generation has defined success in terms of rising GDP growth : more money in more pockets , more resources for public programs , and more jobs . 
None of these will necessarily be a measure of future success . 
We need to talk more about the quality of growth . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has raised this issue , and he is right to do so . 
I am not arguing that growth is bad . 
Try telling that to the poor . 
But what we should want to promote is the right sort of growth - growth that won &apos;t ravage our future prospects . 
We have to define the sustainability of growth in ways that create an attractive narrative for our citizens . 
At the moment , people applaud sustainable growth , but they don &apos;t vote for what it means in practice . 
German voters balk at any suggestion that we should limit the environmental damage caused by big and expensive cars . 
British voters line up behind the truck drivers when protests are launched against hikes in the price of petrol , not least through the introduction of higher energy taxes . 
Ideas for carbon taxes run into resistance everywhere . 
I have five grandchildren below the age of four . 
By the time they qualify for pensions and the license to grumble , the century will be into its seventh or eighth decade . 
We hope ! 
How much will they have to get angry about then because of the way that we are behaving today ?
