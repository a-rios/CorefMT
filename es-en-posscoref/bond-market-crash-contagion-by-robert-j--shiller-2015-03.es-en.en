How Scary Is the Bond Market ? 
NEW HAVEN - The prices of long-term government bonds have been running very high in recent years ( that is , their yields have been very low ) . 
In the United States , the 30-year Treasury bond yield reached a record low ( since the Federal Reserve series began in 1972 ) of 2.25 % on January 30 . 
The yield on the United Kingdom &apos;s 30-year government bond fell to 2.04 % on the same day . 
The Japanese 20-year government bond yielded just 0.87 % on January 20 . 
All of these yields have since moved slightly higher , but they remain exceptionally low . 
It seems puzzling - and unsustainable - that people would tie up their money for 20 or 30 years to earn little or nothing more than these central banks &apos; 2 % target rate for annual inflation . 
So , with the bond market appearing ripe for a dramatic correction , many are wondering whether a crash could drag down markets for other long-term assets , such as housing and equities . 
It is a question that I am repeatedly asked at seminars and conferences . 
After all , participants in the housing and equity markets set prices with a view to prices in the bond market , so contagion from one long-term market to another seems like a real possibility . 
I have been thinking about the bond market for a long time . 
In fact , the long-term bond market was the subject of my 1972 PhD dissertation and my first-ever academic publication the following year , co-authored with my academic adviser , Franco Modigliani . 
Our work with data for the years 1952-1971 showed that the long-term bond market back then was pretty easy to describe . 
Long-term interest rates on any given date could be explained quite well as a certain weighted average of the last 18 quarters of inflation and the last 18 quarters of short-term real interest rates . 
When either inflation or short-term real interest rates went up , long-term rates rose . 
When either fell , so did long-term rates . 
We now have more than 40 years of additional data , so I took a look to see if our theory still predicts well . 
It turns out that our estimates then , if applied to subsequent data , predicted long-term rates extremely well for the 20 years after we published ; but then , in the mid-1990s , our theory started to overpredict . 
According to our model , long-term rates in the US should be even lower than they are now , because both inflation and short-term real interest rates are practically zero or negative . 
Even taking into account the impact of quantitative easing since 2008 , long-term rates are higher than expected . 
But the explanation that we developed so long ago still fits well enough to encourage the belief that we will not see a crash in the bond market unless central banks tighten monetary policy very sharply ( by hiking short-term interest rates ) or there is a major spike in inflation . 
Bond-market crashes have actually been relatively rare and mild . 
In the US , the biggest one-year drop in the Global Financial Data extension of Moody &apos;s monthly total return index for 30-year corporate bonds ( going back to 1857 ) was 12.5 % in the 12 months ending in February 1980 . 
Compare that to the stock market : According to the GFD monthly S P 500 total return index , an annual loss of 67.8 % occurred in the year ending in May 1932 , during the Great Depression , and one-year losses have exceeded 12.5 % in 23 separate episodes since 1900 . 
It is also worth noting what kind of event is needed to produce a 12.5 % crash in the long-term bond market . 
The one-year drop in February 1980 came immediately after Paul Volcker took the helm of the Federal Reserve in 1979 . 
A 1979 Gallup Poll had shown that 62 % of Americans regarded inflation as the &quot; most important problem facing the nation . &quot; 
Volcker took radical steps to deal with it , hiking short-term interest rates so high that he created a major recession . 
He also created enemies ( and even faced death threats ) . 
People wondered whether he would get away with it politically , or be impeached . 
Regarding the stock market and the housing market , there may well be a major downward correction someday . 
That was the case with the biggest US stock-market corrections of the last century ( after 1907 , 1929 , 1973 , 2000 , and 2007 ) and the biggest US housing-market corrections of all time ( after 1979 , 1989 , and 2006 ) . 
It is true that extraordinarily low long-term bond yields put us outside the range of historical experience . 
When an event has never occurred , it cannot be predicted with any semblance of confidence .
