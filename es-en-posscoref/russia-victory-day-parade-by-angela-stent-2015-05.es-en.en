The Rain on Russia &apos;s Parade 
WASHINGTON , DC - When Russian President Vladimir Putin presides over the military parade commemorating Victory in Europe Day on May 9 , he will not attract the crowd he could have expected a couple of years ago . 
Neither US President Barack Obama nor any leader from the European Union will be present to watch as tanks roll and military bands march through Red Square . 
Aside from the president of Serbia , the only leaders expected to be in attendance are from countries , such as China and Vietnam , that were not part of the European theater in World War II . 
Following Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea , and given Putin &apos;s continued support for secessionists in eastern Ukraine , relations between Russia and the West are as bad as they have been since the Soviet Union disintegrated almost a quarter-century ago . 
Obama recently listed Russian aggression in Europe alongside Ebola and the Islamic State as one of the three main threats to US national security . 
The diplomatic tension is ironic , because the parade in Moscow is meant to commemorate a victory made possible seven decades ago by the alliance of the United States , Great Britain , and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany . 
Today , the former allies are unable to work together , even when facing a common enemy like the Islamic State . 
Previous commemorations - which were attended by US Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush - emphasized the common endeavor . 
This year , Russian media have ceaselessly downplayed American and British contributions to the defeat of the Axis powers . 
The Nazi-Soviet pact , which carved up Poland and Romania between the Soviet Union and Germany , has been swept under the rug . 
Obama &apos;s first term in office began with an attempt to &quot; reset &quot; relations with Russia . 
The surviving fruit of those efforts - the New Start arms-control treaty and cooperation on Iran and Afghanistan - are vestiges of the warmer ties that existed when Dimitri Medvedev was president of Russia . 
Bilateral relations began to deteriorate when Putin blamed the US - and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in particular - for supporting the thousands of Russians who protested his return to the presidency in December 2011 . 
The Obama administration made several unsuccessful attempts in 2012 and 2013 to restart a dialogue with the Kremlin , but changed course in the summer of 2013 , when Russia granted political asylum to former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden . 
The war in Ukraine then took relations to their current depths . 
One year after the &quot; little green men &quot; - Russian soldiers without military insignias - began to appear , first in Crimea and then in the Donbas region , the situation in eastern Ukraine remains both stalemated and volatile . 
A fragile ceasefire remains in place in most parts of the contested region , but fighting continues to break out in some areas , and many worry that a new Russian-backed offensive could soon be launched around the strategic port of Mariupol . 
Worse , the war in Ukraine appears to be on its way to becoming a &quot; frozen conflict , &quot; with the Donbas maintained as a pseudo-state run by Russian-backed insurgents and mafias . 
Ukraine has lost control over both the region and its border with Russia , and it faces the constant possibility that the conflict could heat up once again , as Georgia &apos;s did in 2008 , when Russia sent in troops to support the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . 
Meanwhile , Ukraine &apos;s neighbors are left feeling vulnerable , worried that Russia &apos;s efforts to destabilize the region may cross yet another border . 
The Kremlin shows no signs that it is interested in a solution to the crisis that would enable the government in Kyiv to regain full sovereignty over its territory . 
Even if the fighting does not spread , the US and its allies must re-evaluate their relations with Russia . 
The turning point was the annexation of Crimea , which effectively ended US and European hopes for integrating a modern post-Soviet Russia into the West . 
Putin has explicitly rejected a global order that he believes was imposed by the US in the 1990s , when Russia was weak - an order that , in his view , has run roughshod over his country &apos;s interests . 
The ability of the next US president to work with Russia on issues of global order and Euro-Atlantic security will depend largely on the choices that Putin makes in Ukraine and elsewhere . 
His Victory Day celebration - with its display of advanced weaponry , underpinned by increased military spending - will serve as a demonstration of Russian nationalism and intransigence . 
As long as the US and Russia view each other as antagonists , creating a viable working relationship , let alone an alliance , will be impossible . 
Their inability to unite even in celebrating their shared triumph in World War II is a clear sign of the geopolitical challenges that lie ahead .
