Down and Out in the United States ? 
For most of the past decade the world has been lectured to by Americans who proclaimed the perfection of the US economy : its focus on competition , loose labor regulation , and a modest social safety net , all of which supposedly delivered dynamism and high growth rates . 
Continental Europeans were told to follow the US model and liberalize their labor markets , so that businesses that want to hire can do so without losing money and so that unemployed workers who find new jobs won &apos;t see their wages offset by cuts in welfare-state benefits . 
Japanese were told to socialize the losses their banking system incurred when Japan &apos;s bubble burst , then re-privatize those parts of it that could still succeed as going concerns and liquidate the rest . 
East Asia &apos;s Tigers were told to abandon the German-Japanese financial system based on universal banking and adopt the Anglo-American model based on liquid financial markets . 
They were also admonished to do a better job at regulating their financial system . 
Other developing countries were told that their trade barriers , their love of inflationary finance , their failure to curb tax evasion , and their lack of governments strong enough to enforce property and contract rights against local notables , organized bandits , and - most important - their own functionaries were keeping them from participating in the new globalized economic cornucopia . 
Now it &apos;s &quot; pay back &quot; time , when the world lectures America about how to fix its no-longer-perfect economy . 
But can this criticism be constructive , not a bout ( pleasurable , of course ) of Schadenfreude ? 
The most obvious piece of advice is that America &apos;s financial system should follow more faithfully the advice its advocates dispensed to others . 
In some countries , corporate managers are disciplined by the representatives of large universal banks who sit on corporate boards and vote large blocks of shares . 
In many countries , managers &apos; leashes are also held by families of plutocrats who exercise control through pyramids of companies and special classes of stock . 
America &apos;s model of corporate governance was supposed to rely on the following set of factors : 
· managerial failures were supposed to trigger hostile takeovers ; 
· even before a takeover occurs , managers were supposed to be disciplined by fears of a revolt by their boards of directors , especially when the directors think that the company might be become a target of a hostile takeover ; 
· managers were to pursue good performance at all costs , because their stock options and other performance-related compensation made their own fortunes tied to that of shareholders and the corporation . 
Within those constraints , American managers were supposed to exercise considerably more discretion than their foreign counterparts , so that they could use their business judgment without being shackled and second-guessed . 
Combined , all of this was supposed to deliver dynamism . 
But for this system to work solid information about under-performing companies must be available to investors and the link between the pay of top managers and company performance must be real . 
Instead , what evolved was a lax accounting system and a &quot; heads you win , tails your options will be re-priced and you still win &quot; method of managerial compensation . 
No surprise , then , that bosses who couldn &apos;t legitimately show the market strong profits cooked the books , often with the help of their supposedly independent accountants . 
As things stand , it is in no one &apos;s short-term interest , certainly not in the short-run interest of accounting firms that make more money from consulting contracts than from doing a company &apos;s books , to allow accurate information - if it is bad - to leak into the market . 
Other countries must then tell America that the state can &apos;t stand back and let the market do this job : accurate business information is a governmental responsibility . 
Moreover , the greed of bosses cannot be the sole determinant of managerial remuneration . 
Unfortunately , America now has an administration keen to downplay the importance of timely reporting of insider stock sales ( the President himself failed to do that when he was in business ) , the timely reporting of changes in the accounting treatment of a company &apos;s unrealized revenues ( something that did happen at Halliburton when it was run by Vice President Cheney ) , and of executives &apos; duty to know about the fraud committed by their subordinates ( unlike what happened when current Army Secretary White was running Enron &apos;s energy trading operations ) . 
Outsiders should also remind America that its population is aging and that big savings will be needed to pay for the looming retirement of the baby boomers . 
Two years ago &quot; Save Social Security &quot; ( America &apos;s state pension system ) was a political mantra . 
The huge federal budget surplus was supposed to provide the means to do that . 
President Bush &apos;s tax cut , however , squandered the surplus . 
Huge deficits reappeared . 
Outsiders must remind America that its pension system is a ticking time bomb that must be defused . 
Third and last , the past two decades saw America change from a largely middle-class society of the same genus as Europe &apos;s social democracies into a creature with extremes of wealth unseen since before World War I. One driving force behind this is America &apos;s retreat from its unique emphasis on education . 
Declining public school quality , downward pressure on funding for public higher education , and a failure of political will to make higher education affordable for everyone has produced a growing education gap among those who can and cannot afford quality education . 
So while the economic case for greater private and public investment in education is stronger than ever , most individuals can &apos;t save enough to pay for it , and education - despite all the talk of politicians - is not the federal priority it should be . 
After lording it over the world for so long , Americans should accept today &apos;s rebukes with grace . 
But if the rest of the world really wants to help , it should lecture America along the lines I suggest . 
Some of us might listen .
