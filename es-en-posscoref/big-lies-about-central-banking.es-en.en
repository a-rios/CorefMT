Big Lies about Central Banking 
An independent central bank focused exclusively on price stability has become a central part of the mantra of &quot; economic reform . &quot; 
Like so many other policy maxims , it has been repeated often enough that it has come to be believed . 
But bold assertions , even from central bankers , are no substitute for research and analysis . 
Research suggests that if central banks focus on inflation , they do a better job at controlling inflation . 
But controlling inflation is not an end in itself : it is merely a means of achieving faster , more stable growth , with lower unemployment . 
These are the real variables that matter , and there is little evidence that independent central banks focusing exclusively on price stability do better in these crucial respects . 
George Akerlof , who shared the Nobel Prize with me in 2001 , and his colleagues have argued forcefully that there is an optimal rate of inflation , greater than zero . 
So ruthless pursuit of price stability actually harms economic growth and well being . 
Recent research even questions whether targeting price stability reduces the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment . 
A focus on inflation may make sense for countries with long histories of inflation , but not for others , like Japan . 
America &apos;s central bank , the Federal Reserve , is mandated not only to ensure price stability , but also to promote growth and full employment . 
There is broad consensus in the US against a narrow mandate , such as that of the European Central Bank . 
Today , Europe &apos;s growth languishes , because the ECB is constrained by its single-minded focus on inflation from promoting economic recovery . 
Technocrats and financial market players who benefit from this institutional arrangement have done an impressive job of convincing many countries of its virtues , and of the need to treat monetary policy as a technical matter that should be put above politics . 
That might be the case if all that central bankers did was , say , choose computer software for clearing payments . 
But central banks make decisions that affect every aspect of society , including rates of economic growth and unemployment . 
Because there are tradeoffs , these decisions can only be made as part of a political process . 
Some argue that in the long run there are no tradeoffs . 
But , as Keynes said , in the long run , we are all dead . 
Even if it were impossible to lower unemployment below some critical level without fuelling inflation , there is uncertainty about what that critical level is . 
Accordingly , risk is unavoidable : monetary policy that is too loose risks inflation ; if it is too tight , it can cause unnecessary unemployment , with all the suffering that follows . 
During America &apos;s growth boom in the 1990s , the Clinton Administration believed that it was worth risking pushing the unemployment rate lower , especially when the social gains - declining welfare roles , reduced violence - were added to the direct economic benefits . 
By contrast , the IMF urged tighter monetary policy , because it put far less weight on the cost of unemployment , seemingly no weight on the ancillary social benefits of reducing it , and much greater weight on the costs of potential inflation . 
The economic analysis of Clinton &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers turned out to be right ; the models of the IMF ( and the Fed ) were wrong . 
America secured a much lower rate of unemployment without inflation - eventually unemployment fell to below 4 % . 
But that is not the point : the point is that no one could be sure . 
A calculated risk is always unavoidable . 
Who bears it varies with different policies , and that is a decision that cannot - or at least should not - be left to central bank technocrats . 
While there is a legitimate debate about the degree of independence accorded to central banks and other decision-making bodies , within a democracy , the perspectives of those whose well-being is affected by the decisions taken should be represented in the process . 
Workers , for instance , who have much to lose if the central bank pursues an excessively tight policy , do not have a seat at the table . 
But financial markets - which do not have much to lose from unemployment , but are affected by inflation - are typically well represented . 
And yet financial markets hardly have a monopoly on technical competency . 
Indeed , many in the financial community have little understanding of the intricate workings of the macroeconomic system - as evidenced by their frequent mistakes in managing it . 
For example , most US recessions since 1945 were caused by the Fed stepping on the brakes too hard . 
Similarly , central banks adopted monetarism with a fervor in the late 1970 &apos;s and early 1980 &apos;s , just as empirical evidence discrediting the underlying theories was mounting . 
Whatever the merits of a common currency , those in Europe deliberating about adopting the Euro should consider whether to tie their fortunes to an institutional arrangement whose flaws are increasingly apparent . 
Likewise , developing countries need to consider not only the central bank &apos;s independence , but also its mandate and representativeness . 
They need to balance concerns about economic efficiency with those of democratic accountability . 
In many new democracies , citizens are bewildered . 
The virtues of the new regime are first praised , but then they are told that the macroeconomic policy decisions about which they care most are too important to be left to democratic processes . 
Citizens are warned against the risks of populism ( meaning the will of the people ? ) . 
There are no easy answers . 
But in too many countries , nor is there democratic debate about the alternatives .
