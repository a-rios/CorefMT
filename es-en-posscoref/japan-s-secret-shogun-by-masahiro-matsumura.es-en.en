Japan &apos;s Secret Shogun 
OSAKA - With the post-general election honeymoon over , the Japanese public has become increasingly aware that Ichiro Ozawa , Secretary-General of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , is the puppet-master behind Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama &apos;s cabinet . 
Although he distances himself from formal policy-making within the executive branch , Ozawa in fact masterminds the entire legislative process , including the budget and appropriations . 
He has centralized the DPJ &apos;s contacts with lobbyists at his office in the Diet ( Parliament ) . 
Alas , Hatoyama controls only the narrow field of policy . 
Together with other factions , Tanaka commanded a majority within the LDP and remained the party &apos;s kingmaker and string-puller in successive LDP governments , perfecting the LDP &apos;s quasi-social-democratic combination of export-led growth and pork-barrel wealth redistribution . 
Recently , Ozawa had a visit that he made to Tanaka &apos;s tombstone televised , thereby holding himself up to the public as Tanaka &apos;s heir . 
With the LDP suffering from organizational sclerosis , Ozawa and some four dozen fellow legislators of the Tanaka faction broke away from the LDP in 1993 in a bid to build a two-party system . 
Since then , and until the DPJ &apos;s victory in the 2008 upper-house election , Ozawa was almost always at the center of political battles against the LDP , building an effective political machine by making the most use of the art of patronage . 
In fact , Ozawa has established one of the largest financial war chests of any political party , using tactics reminiscent of Tanaka : three of Ozawa &apos;s current and former political aides were recently arrested on charges of channeling kickbacks from civil engineering and construction firms into Ozawa &apos;s fund-raising operation . 
Ironically , Ozawa &apos;s power results from the rise and fall of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the LDP . 
Having pledged to destroy the &quot; old LDP , &quot; Koizumi implemented exemplary reforms that took the spoils away from special-interest groups , which merely accelerated the LDP &apos;s enfeeblement . 
Behind Koizumi &apos;s pro-reform slogans was an intra-party factional struggle with the dominant Tanaka faction , whose seemingly invincible political machine and electoral constituencies were anchored to public works involving special-interest groups , particularly civil engineering and construction firms . 
Koizumi slashed a large portion of the budgets for public works and abandoned the rural population , which depended on a variety of redistributive schemes . 
Instead , Koizumi appealed to an electoral majority comprising urban and suburban swing voters . 
But , while Koizumi successfully knocked out the Tanaka faction within the LDP , many of Tanaka &apos;s adherents , led by Ozawa , had re-established themselves by colonizing and taking over the DPJ . 
Unsurprisingly , as Koizumi &apos;s reforms stalled , and as LDP governments under Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe , Yasuo Fukuda , and Taro Aso ran adrift , Ozawa-proposed wealth redistribution captured the hearts and minds not only of rural voters , but also of city dwellers displeased at the fraying social-safety net . 
Now that the DPJ has won the most recent upper- and lower-house elections , Ozawa &apos;s faction has become the largest by far within the party . 
Moreover , there are several veterans of the old Tanaka faction in the Cabinet , including Hatoyama himself and Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada . 
Now the public is increasingly disenchanted with the DPJ , which it expected to jump-start Japanese politics . 
But instead of that happening , the country faces the grotesque revival of a domestic variant of the Cold War structure . 
Formerly , the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party ( JSP ) disguised their ideological confrontation , at least publicly , while making deals under the table after behind-the-scenes negotiations . 
This was a key to the one-party dominant system in which the LDP maintained a majority in the Diet while the JSP laid low as the largest opposition party . 
Today , Ozawa and the DPJ &apos;s Tanaka veterans , who lead a party overwhelmingly composed of newly elected , amateurish lawmakers , deal directly with former socialists and other populist spin-offs from the LDP , in both the Cabinet and the Diet . 
It is no wonder that the two regimes have many domestic and foreign / security policies in common . 
Prosecutors have so far taken an aggressive approach to the cases involving Ozawa &apos;s aides , just as they once did with Tanaka . 
But Ozawa remains combative , hinting that the two sides are engaged in a grudge match - and knowing that his faction can intervene through the ruling DPJ to shake up the personnel , budget , and operations of the prosecutor &apos;s office . 
In Japan &apos;s season of political discontent , it seems that there is nothing new under the sun .
