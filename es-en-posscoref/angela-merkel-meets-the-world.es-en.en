Angela Merkel Meets the World 
At long last , Angela Merkel is Germany &apos;s new - and first woman - Chancellor . 
Although continuity will remain the hallmark of foreign policy , Germany &apos;s international engagement under Merkel will sound and feel different from that under Gerhard Schroeder &apos;s leadership . 
Schroeder came to power seven years ago representing a new generation whose formative experience was not the Cold War , European integration , and transatlantic friendship , but German unification and the restoration of national sovereignty . 
For him and the team that took over after Helmut Kohl &apos;s 16-year reign , Germany had become a normal country , no different from other European heavyweights like France or Britain . 
Indeed , one of Schroeder &apos;s first major foreign-policy experiences was the EU summit of 1999 , where the leaders of France and Britain played rough with the newcomer from Berlin . 
The lesson that Schroeder drew was to insist that Germany could no longer be taken for granted and would demand a role commensurate to its size and weight . 
Self-assertion became the watchword of German foreign policy . 
Thus , when Schroeder claimed special circumstances for Germany &apos;s failure to meet the budgetary ceilings of the European Union &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact , he seemed to be arguing that the restrictions should apply only to smaller countries , not to the big players . 
When he rightly opposed America &apos;s war against Iraq , the pride of standing up to the world &apos;s only superpower was palpable . 
When he established a close personal and political relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin , he signaled to the world - and to the EU &apos;s sensitive new Eastern European members - that Germany &apos;s foreign policy would no longer be constrained by the past . 
In fairness , it should be acknowledged that it was under Schroeder that Germany shed hesitations to deploy soldiers abroad . 
His support for international crisis missions in Kosovo , Bosnia , or Afghanistan required considerable political courage and made Germany one of the major contributors to international stability efforts . 
To have removed the issue from domestic ideological controversy ranks as a major achievement of Schroeder &apos;s tenure . 
But it was also meant to convey that Germany had grown up into a proper international power . 
With Merkel , the substance of Germany &apos;s foreign policy will change little , but the assertive style will be muted . 
American leaders will welcome her election as proof that the estrangement in bilateral relations is over . 
But that alienation already largely ended earlier this year , when the Bush administration realized that allies are good to have and that Germany is an important one . 
Merkel will reintroduce the warmth that has been missing under Schroeder , but she will not become America &apos;s yes-woman . 
Nor will she abandon special relations with Russia , to which every German chancellor since Adenauer has attached major importance . 
But she has already made clear that Germany &apos;s neighbors to the East will have no reason not feel bypassed . 
She may even want to confirm that message by making her first official trip abroad not to Paris but to Warsaw or Vilnius . 
On the European project , she is as committed to integration as her predecessors have been . 
She will continue to emphasize close relations with France because there is no alternative ; 
Britain , absent from the euro zone and the Schengen border regime , remains the odd man-in of the EU . 
But there will be no new initiatives on integration until leaders in the countries that rejected the Constitutional Treaty are ready for a new try . 
Then Merkel will be in a key position to add weight to a new effort for moving the EU forward . 
She will continue to favor the eventual admission of the Balkan states , but she has left no doubt of her opposition to full membership for Turkey , which is the major substantive change from the Schroeder era ( although her government will not block the start of negotiations in early October ) . 
In fact , there is very little Merkel has to do after her election to make her mark on foreign policy ; the visible change of style will suffice , at least at first . 
In any case , she will have her hands full pushing through the economic reforms for which she will be elected and which are her top priority . 
There are indications that Germany is finally emerging from years of economic stagnation , not least thanks to the reforms started under Schroeder . 
At home , Merkel can hope to reap the rewards . 
Abroad , Merkel has no need to demonstrate that Germany is a big country in Europe ; her partners are fully aware of this . 
But it is also more than just a normal country : Germany remains central to holding together the two international institutions that will continue to assure its well-being , the European Union and the Atlantic alliance . 
There are some indications that Merkel is more aware of this then Schroeder was . 
One can only hope that this recognition will serve as her guidepost when tough decisions must be made and changes in style alone will not be enough .
