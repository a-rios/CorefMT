Obama Meets the World 
CAMBRIDGE - Many people will try to set President Barack Obama &apos;s priorities , but one person is sure to have a major effect . 
George W. Bush has bequeathed an unenviable legacy : an economic crisis , two wars , a struggle against terrorism , and problems across the Middle East and elsewhere . 
If Obama fails to fight these fires successfully , they will consume his political capital , but if all he does is fight them , he will inherit Bush &apos;s priorities . 
The new president must deal with the past and chart a new future at the same time . 
Foremost on Obama &apos;s agenda will be the economic crisis , where his domestic and international priorities intersect . 
He will need to stimulate the economy and avoid protectionist pressures at home , while also taking the lead in restructuring the global financial system . 
Cooperation with others will be essential . 
That Bush convened a G-20 meeting in November sets a useful precedent of going beyond the G-7 to include emerging economies such as China , India , and Brazil . 
In second place must be America &apos;s two current wars . 
Obama campaigned on a promise to withdraw American combat brigades ( but not troops engaged in training and counterterrorism ) from Iraq by mid-2010 . 
Now the Bush administration and the Iraq government have signed an agreement for troop withdrawal by late 2011 . 
These timetables &quot; effectiveness will depend on events on the ground , including political compromises inside Iraq and dialogue with Iraq &apos;s neighbors , but a clear sense of direction has been established . 
Afghanistan looks more difficult , given the Taliban &apos;s reinvigoration with help from groups in Pakistan . 
Obama has called for additional United States and NATO troops to stabilize the situation , but too many foreign troops will only increase Afghan nationalist reactions . 
We cannot simply shoot our way out of the problem . 
Increased training of the Afghan army and police , and a political dialogue inside the country and with neighbors will be important components of any solution . 
The third priority will be what Bush misleadingly called a &quot; global war on terrorism . &quot; 
The Obama administration will have to pursue the struggle against Al Qaeda , but should drop the war rhetoric . 
It makes little sense to declare war on a tactic , and experience has proven that the terminology merely reinforces the narrative that bin Laden seeks to promote , which is why Britain now avoids the phrase . 
A successful strategy against Al Qaeda will require close intelligence cooperation with other countries and policies that attract the support of mainstream Muslim opinion . 
The Middle East represents a fourth set of urgent priorities . 
Iran has now enriched enough uranium to produce ( in principle ) one nuclear bomb . 
Nonetheless , there remains time for a diplomatic initiative that includes Europe , Russia , and China . 
Given the unattractiveness of choosing between a pre-emptive attack on Iran or allowing Iranian nuclear weapons to destabilize the Gulf region , Obama has pledged to conduct a broad diplomatic dialogue with Iran without the preconditions that hampered Bush . 
But successful diplomacy will require repairing relations with Russia . 
Also high on the priority list in the Middle East will be to sustain and enhance Bush &apos;s efforts to bring about a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine , and to encourage the incipient dialogue between Israel and Syria . 
Major issues will also arise in Africa , Latin America , and Asia , and relations with these areas will grow in importance . 
Fortunately , none of them became political footballs in the recent election campaign . 
In Asian policy , with the exception of North Korea , the Bush legacy is better , bequeathing good relations with the key states of Japan , China , and India . 
The &quot; Bush Doctrine &quot; of preemptive war and coercive democratization , coupled with a unilateralist style , was based on a flawed analysis of power in today &apos;s world . 
The paradox of American power is that the strongest country since the days of Rome cannot achieve its objectives acting alone . 
Obama &apos;s election has done much to restore American &quot; soft &quot; power , but he will need to follow up with policies that combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy of the sort that won the Cold War . 
Democracy promotion is better accomplished by soft attraction than hard coercion , and it takes time and patience . 
Here Obama should lead by example and remember the historical wisdom of being Reagan &apos;s &quot; shining city on a hill . &quot; 
Closing the prison camp at Guant√°namo Bay , Cuba , would send such a signal . 
Right now , Bush &apos;s calls for democracy are heard as an imperial imposition of American institutions . 
We need less Wilsonian rhetoric about making the world safe for democracy , unless combined with John F. Kennedy &apos;s calls to &quot; make the world safe for diversity . &quot; ampnbsp ; 
A &quot; liberal realist &quot; policy should look to the long-term evolution of world order and realize the responsibility of the international system &apos;s strongest country to produce global public goods - things people and governments around the world want but cannot otherwise attain - as Britain did in the nineteenth century . 
America should similarly promote an open international economy and commons ( seas , space , Internet ) , mediate international disputes before they escalate , and develop international rules and institutions . 
Early signals that the US will take the lead in dealing with global climate change will be an important start . 
The US can become a smart power by once again investing in global public goods . 
That means support for international institutions , aligning America with the cause of international development , promoting public health , increasing cultural exchanges , maintaining an open economy , and dealing seriously with climate change . 
Indeed , Obama &apos;s most important priority must be to show that America is back in the business of exporting hope rather than fear .
