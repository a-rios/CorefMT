Europe &apos;s Troublesome Neighbors 
PARIS - Geography has dealt Europe a mixed hand . 
Europeans can congratulate themselves on being a relatively safe distance away from whatever tensions may accompany the rise of powers like India , Brazil , and , especially , China . 
But Europe is bordered to its south and east by two great regions that give cause for significant concern . 
Neither Russia nor the Islamic world is , thus far , adapting well to globalization . 
The economies of both remain over-dependent on oil and gas exports . 
In the Middle East , this exacerbates the problem of creating jobs for ballooning populations of young adults . 
Russia , too , faces real demographic difficulties , though in the other direction as Russia &apos;s population is projected to shrink by as much as 10 % over the next 15 or 20 years . 
Despite the understandable concerns of Finns , Poles , and others in Central and Eastern Europe , the relationship with Russia should be the easier of the two to manage . 
The West &apos;s relations with Russia since the end of the Cold War have resembled the meeting of two tectonic plates , with one progressively forced beneath the other . 
The Georgia conflict of 2008 was the tremor that signaled substantial resistance to the western plate &apos;s eastward movement . 
But the shifts that have taken place left Russia much diminished in terms of its sphere of influence and military might . To be sure , Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia is nationalistic , awkward , and disposed to dangerous trouble-making . 
But it also faces acute social and public-health problems and has 1.3 billion Chinese on its eastern border , and it has important common interests with Europe , including trade in gas and oil and a shared preoccupation with Islamic extremism . 
Handled with forbearance and firmness , relations with Russia should remain difficult but manageable . 
With NATO backing off , the European Union stepping in with its Eastern Partnership initiative to shift continuing competition in the post-Soviet space onto a less antagonistic footing , and President Barack Obama demonstrating his willingness to assuage Russia &apos;s damaged pride , major confrontation should be avoidable . 
Europe &quot; s relations with the Islamic world are a lot trickier . 
First , although Russia &apos;s resentments may be fresher , those of the Muslim world run deeper , and are born of more profound interactions , past and present . 
Second , whether one thinks of Al Qaeda &apos;s terrorism or the presence of Western armies in Iraq and Afghanistan , Europe and the Islamic world have demonstrated a continuing willingness to deal violently with each other . 
Third , even if Europeans are a disparate group , the Islamic world is infinitely more so . 
Islam is its identifying glue - but how much else do Indonesia and Yemen , for example , have in common ? 
The Islamic world is riven by disputes between Arab and non-Arab , Sunni and Shia , and Salafi extremists and theological moderates . 
Al Qaeda &apos;s agenda is as much about the creation of a new Islamic caliphate as it is about waging jihad against the West . 
Fourth , Europeans find it hard to stomach traditional Islamic attitudes towards , say , women or homosexuals . 
Muslims find it hard to understand how we can believe our society is civilized when pornography and drunkenness are openly displayed . 
To the extent that Europeans are Christian at all , we see religion as a matter of an individual &apos;s relationship with his or her God ; 
Muslims see it as an organizing social principle . 
Israel is , of course , the single issue on which the Islamic sense of resentment focuses . 
It exemplifies Western hypocrisy - whether over nuclear non-proliferation , the refusal to deal with the elected Hamas , or readiness to criticize Russia for &quot; disproportionate &quot; use of force in Georgia while remaining quiet over 1,300 deaths in Gaza . 
Unlike his two predecessors , Obama has had the courage to target the Israel-Palestine problem , the intractable seat of the infection , from the beginning of his presidency . 
And he went to Cairo to address the Arab world with humility and respect , without shirking issues of human rights and individual freedom . 
The risk in this American activism is that it will provide the excuse for Europeans to sit back and cheer while someone else does the heavy lifting . 
But passivity would be a historic mistake . 
America &apos;s Middle East interests are not identical with those of Europe . 
Protected behind its oceans , and applying its vast technological capacity to the goal of energy self-sufficiency , the United States is ultimately able to distance itself from the travails of the Middle East . 
Once out of Iraq and Afghanistan , the US may find itself increasingly tempted to do just that . 
For Europe , such distancing is impossible . 
European security is inextricably bound up with the need to find and maintain a modus vivendi with the Muslim world . 
Europe is not without leverage . 
It has currently put on hold a deepened economic relationship with Israel : if Israel &apos;s government continues to refuse to stop its colonization of the West Bank , Europeans should make clear that , as Israel &apos;s most important export market , they have tougher options at hand . 
And , given the determination of both the Israeli and Iranian governments to use each other &apos;s intransigence as an excuse for their own , Europe must also be prepared to use its economic muscle on Iran if and when the mullahs reject Obama &apos;s extended hand . 
European military forces will also be required to play a crucial role in policing and guaranteeing a two-state settlement . 
This makes it all the more important for Europe to wake up to where its real security interests lie , and to take responsibility for asserting them .
