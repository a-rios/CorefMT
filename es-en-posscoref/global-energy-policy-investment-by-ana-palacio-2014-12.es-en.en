Global Energy Realism 
MADRID - Energy has become a focal point of global policymaking . 
As falling oil prices grab headlines worldwide , US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping have signed a major climate-change deal , and October &apos;s European Council decisions could signal real progress toward a serious European Union energy policy . 
This momentum should be maintained in the coming year , culminating in December &apos;s United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris . 
But , in order to establish a global energy system that meets growing demand within the constraints of carbon neutrality , we must avoid the pitfalls that have plagued past responses . 
In particular , we must strike the proper balance between ideology and realism , the public and private sectors , and long- and short-term considerations . 
And , critically , we must follow through on our commitments . 
When it comes to ideology and realism , the European Union is perhaps the best example of an imbalanced approach , as Europeans &quot; tendency to lead with their hearts , rather than their heads , has undermined effective action . 
The knee-jerk rejection of nuclear power by some EU member countries has led to sharp increases in coal usage . 
Renewables have been pursued with a sort of missionary zeal , regardless of their effectiveness or feasibility . 
And the EU &apos;s &quot; 20 / 20 / 20 targets &quot; - a 20 % reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions , a 20 % share for renewables , and a 20 % increase in energy efficiency , all by 2020 - was more of a mantra than a policy . 
Bridging the gap between the public and private sectors is vital to finance the construction of an efficient global energy system . 
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040 , the annual investment required in energy-supply infrastructure alone will total $ 2 trillion , up 20 % from current levels . 
Over the next 26 years , some $ 51 trillion will be needed . 
This is just part of the overall infrastructure investment shortfall , which stands at $ 1 trillion annually - far more than what governments can afford . 
That is why governments must build innovative partnerships with private-sector actors , while recognizing that energy , as a public good , must be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight . 
There have been some notable moves in this direction , though it remains to be seen whether they will translate into real action . 
China has spearheaded the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . 
More important , the World Bank , the G-20 , and the EU recently launched initiatives aimed at directing the financing power of business toward infrastructure development . 
The World Bank &apos;s Global Infrastructure Facility is an open platform that brings together multilateral development banks , national governments , and private finance to shepherd infrastructure projects to completion and to fill in gaps that have hampered investment . 
Pivotal to sparking this investment is the mitigation of associated political risks , especially through an enhanced role for the Bank &apos;s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency . 
Similarly , at last month &apos;s summit in Brisbane , the G-20 created a new Global Infrastructure Hub to facilitate information-sharing , thereby streamlining infrastructure projects . 
And , the EU &apos;s Connecting Europe Facility has allocated € 5.85 billion ( $ 7.2 billion ) from now until 2020 to help kick-start private investment in infrastructure projects linking member countries &quot; energy systems . 
Of course , the need for private-sector involvement extends beyond investment . 
The private sector is also better situated to research and develop new production methods that limit demand for fossil fuels . 
To spur such action , the public sector should offer funds or guarantees , which , though risky , could offer huge benefits . 
US government funding of research into hydraulic fracturing - the technology now driving the surge in America &apos;s oil and gas production - dates back to the 1970s . 
This brings us to the need to balance short-term imperatives with long-term vision . 
Energy projects and policies today must account for the projected increase in emerging-market demand , while ensuring sufficient investment in future generating capacity . 
For example , over the next 25 years , 60 % of the EU &apos;s generating capacity is due to retire - contributing to demand for $ 2.2 trillion of energy investment . 
Furthermore , with US tight-oil production expected to peak in the early 2020s , new sources must be developed , such as in Iraq . 
Given the long lead time for bringing new projects onstream , efforts to address the coming shortfall must begin today . 
In all of these efforts , there is one common imperative : matching words with deeds . 
The world does not need more commitments and pledges ; it needs action . 
Yet many countries continue to issue weak declarations that fail to produce genuine progress . 
Once again , this problem is particularly pervasive in Europe . 
The maxims of today - the need for diverse suppliers , enhanced interconnection , greater efficiency , and a sensible energy mix - have been discussed for at least a decade . 
In fact , despite the seemingly unending stream of new energy initiatives and projects , Europe has made little progress ; its energy situation may even be worse . 
Repackaging the same old strategies - here one need look no further than European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker &apos;s much-hyped € 300 billion investment package - simply will not work . 
With attention focused on COP21 next December , the coming year will be an exceptional opportunity to build a sound global energy system . 
Europe , which has prided itself on its energy leadership , should set an example by developing - and then implementing - a realistic long-term strategy that involves the private sector .
