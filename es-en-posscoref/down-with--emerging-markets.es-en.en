Down with &quot; Emerging Markets &quot; 
LONDON - It has been nine years since I coined the acronym &quot; BRIC , &quot; which has become synonymous with the rise of Brazil , Russia , India , and China . 
It has been more than seven years since my colleagues at Goldman Sachs and I first published an outlook to 2050 in which we suggested that the four BRIC economies could emerge bigger than the G-7 economies , and , together with the United States , would constitute the world &apos;s five largest . 
It also has been more than five years since the expression &quot; Next Eleven , &quot; or &quot; N-11 , &quot; first appeared . 
That term bracketed the next eleven largest countries by population , and sought to determine their BRIC-like potential . 
These 15 countries drive most of the positive momentum behind the world economy nowadays . 
China has overtaken Japan as the world &apos;s second largest economy , with output roughly equal to that of the other three BRIC countries combined . 
Their aggregate GDP stands at around $ 11 trillion , or about 80 % of the US level . 
Domestic demand in the BRIC countries is even more impressive . 
The collective dollar value of BRIC consumers is estimated conservatively at just over $ 4 trillion , possibly $ 4.5 trillion . 
The US consumer market is worth more than double that - around $ 10.5 trillion - but BRIC consumer power is currently growing at an annual rate in dollar terms of around 15 % , which means an annual rate of roughly $ 600 billion . 
If this pace is maintained , BRIC consumers will be adding another $ 1 trillion to the global economy by the middle of this decade . 
By the end of the decade , they will be worth more than US consumers . 
Indeed , at some point during this decade , the BRIC economies combined will become as big as the US economy , with China &apos;s GDP alone reaching about two-thirds that of the US . 
The four countries will be responsible for at least one-half of real GDP growth in the world , and possibly as much as 70 % . 
Beyond the BRICs , among the likely top ten contributors to global GDP growth this decade are South Korea , Mexico , and Turkey . 
From the so-called developed world , only the US is guaranteed a place on this list - and the top 20 could include Iran , Nigeria , the Philippines , and Vietnam . 
So how should we now think about the term &quot; emerging markets &quot; ? 
A few weeks ago , I decided with my colleagues to pursue the term &quot; growth economies , &quot; which Goldman Sachs adopted in 2010 to describe how we treat many of the world &apos;s most dynamic markets . 
At its simplest , a growth economy should be regarded as one that is likely to experience rising productivity , which , together with favorable demographics , points to economic growth that outpaces the global average . 
But an economy also needs sufficient size and depth in order to allow investors not only to invest , but also to exit when appropriate . 
So we opted for the following : any economy outside the so-called developed world that accounts for at least 1 % of current global GDP should be defined as a growth economy . 
At this size , currently around $ 600 billion , an economy should be large enough to allow investors and businesses to operate as they do in advanced countries , yet also be likely to grow faster . 
All other economies should continue to be defined as emerging markets . 
According to this definition , eight countries currently qualify : the BRIC countries , along with South Korea , Indonesia , Mexico , and Turkey , while others - including Saudi Arabia , Iran , Nigeria , and the Philippines - could join the list in the next 20 years . 
It is also time that investors started to benchmark their portfolios more appropriately . 
In the past few decades , it has become conventional for equity investors to base their decisions on neutral benchmarks determined by the market capitalization of companies and indices . 
But this gives much more weight to the US economy and its companies relative to so-called emerging markets . 
An alternative approach is to use a GDP-weighted benchmark . 
For bold and aggressive investors , a benchmark that incorporates future predicted GDP gives a lot more weight to emerging markets , especially to the growth economies . 
The index that Goldman Sachs calculates every year for around 180 countries , called a Growth Environment Score ( GES ) , is used to monitor productivity and the likelihood of sustainable growth . 
The index goes from 0 to 10 , with 13 sub-indices for overall growth and productivity . 
Currently , for example , Korea &apos;s GES is 7.5 , compared to 6.9 for the US . 
Economies that remain small and have low GES scores are appropriately treated as emerging markets with lots of risk . 
While they may grow significantly and escape from their current situation , they are vulnerable to adverse developments in core developed countries - especially the US - and in these countries &quot; financial markets . 
Countries with low GES scores need to undertake policies that allow them to rise . 
For example , we forecast that within the next 20 years Nigeria , home to around 20 % of Africa &apos;s population , could account for 1 % of global GDP . 
But its current GES score of 3.9 is significantly below the BRIC and N-11 average . 
On the other hand , Nigeria &apos;s economy has almost doubled in size over the last 13 years . 
If it maintains this progress , before 2030 it will no longer be an &quot; emerging economy . &quot; 
That would be an exciting development for Nigeria - and for Africa . 
Even more exciting is the likelihood that Nigeria will not be alone at its graduation into a growth economy .
