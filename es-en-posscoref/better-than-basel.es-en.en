Better than Basel 
ROME - The Basel Accords - meant to protect depositors and the public in general from bad banking practices - exacerbated the downward economic spiral triggered by the financial crisis of 2008 . 
Throughout the crisis , as business confidence evaporated , banks were forced to sell assets and cut lending in order to maintain capital requirements stipulated by the Accords . 
This lending squeeze resulted in a sharp drop in GDP and employment , while the sharp sell-off in assets ensured further declines . 
My recent study with Jacopo Carmassi , Time to Set Banking Regulation Right , shows that by permitting excessive leverage and risk-taking by large international banks - in some cases allowing banks to accumulate total liabilities up to 40 , or even 50 , times their equity capital - the Basel banking rules not only enabled , but , ironically , intensified the crisis . 
After the crisis , world leaders and central bankers overhauled banking regulations , first and foremost by rectifying the Basel prudential rules . 
Unfortunately , the new Basel III Accord and the ensuing EU Capital Requirements Directive have failed to correct the two main shortcomings of international prudential rules - namely , their reliance on banks &quot; risk-management models for the calculation of capital requirements , and the lack of supervisory accountability . 
The latest example highlighting this flaw is Dexia , the Belgian-French banking group that failed in 2011 - just after passing the European Banking Authority &apos;s stress test with flying colors . 
The stunning opacity of solvency ratios encouraged regulators to turn a blind eye to banks &quot; excessive risk-taking . 
The problem is that the Basel capital rules - whether Basel I , II , or III - are of no help in separating the weak banks from the sound ones . 
Indeed , more often than not , the banks that failed or had to be rescued in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis had solvency ratios higher than those of banks that remained standing without assistance . 
Compounding the problem , the diversity in banks &quot; capital ratios also indicates a dramatic distortion of the international playing field , as increasingly competitive conditions in financial markets have led to national discretion in applying the rules . 
Meanwhile , the opacity of capital indicators has made market discipline impossible to impose . 
Thus , large banks are likely to continue to hold too little capital and to take excessive risks , raising the prospect of renewed bouts of financial instability . 
In order to overcome these shortcomings in international banking regulations , three remedies are needed . 
First , capital requirements should be set as a straightforward ratio of common equity to total assets , thereby abandoning all reference to banks &quot; own risk-management models . 
The new capital ratio should be raised to 7-10 % of total assets in order to dampen risk-taking by bankers and minimize the real economic impact of large-scale deleveraging following a loss of confidence in the banking system . 
Second , new capital ratios with multiple and decreasing capital thresholds , which trigger increasingly intrusive corrective action , should serve as the basis for a new system of mandated supervisory action . 
Supervisors should be bound by a presumption that they will act . 
They could argue that action is not necessary in a specific case , but they would have to do so publicly , thus becoming accountable for their inaction . 
In order to eradicate moral hazard , the system must have a resolution procedure to close banks when their capital falls below a minimum threshold . 
Finally , solvency rules should be complemented by an obligation that banks issue a substantial amount of non-collateralized debt - on the order of 100 % of their capital - that is convertible into equity . 
These debentures should be designed to create a strong incentive for bank managers and shareholders to issue equity rather than suffer conversion . 
These three measures , if applied to all banks , would eliminate the need for special rules governing liquidity or funding ( which would remain open to supervisory review , but not to binding constraints ) . 
There would also be no need for special restrictions on banking activities and operations . 
The most remarkable feature of the policy deliberations on prudential banking rules so far has been their delegation to the Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors and the banks themselves , both of which have a vested interest in preserving the existing system . 
Governments and parliaments have an obligation to launch a thorough review of the Basel rules , and to demand revisions that align them with the public interest .
