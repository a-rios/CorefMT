Has Economic Power Replaced Military Might ? 
CAMBRIDGE - At the Cold War &apos;s end , some pundits proclaimed that &quot; geo-economics &quot; had replaced geopolitics . 
Economic power would become the key to success in world politics , a change that many people thought would usher in a world dominated by Japan and Germany . 
Today , some interpret the rise in China &apos;s share of world output as signifying a fundamental shift in the balance of global power , but without considering military power . 
They argue that a dominant economic power soon becomes a dominant military power , forgetting that the United States was the world &apos;s largest economy for 70 years before it became a military superpower . 
Political observers have long debated whether economic or military power is more fundamental . 
The Marxist tradition casts economics as the underlying structure of power , and political institutions as a mere superstructure , an assumption shared by nineteenth-century liberals who believed that growing interdependence in trade and finance would make war obsolete . 
But , while Britain and Germany were each other &apos;s most significant trading partners in 1914 , that did not prevent a conflagration that set back global economic integration for a half-century . 
Military power , which some call the ultimate form of power in world politics , requires a thriving economy . 
But whether economic or military resources produce more power in today &apos;s world depends on the context . 
A carrot is more effective than a stick if you wish to lead a mule to water , but a gun may be more useful if your aim is to deprive an opponent of his mule . 
Many crucial issues , such as financial stability or climate change , simply are not amenable to military force . 
Today , China and the US are highly interdependent economically , but many analysts misunderstand the implications of this for power politics . 
True , China could bring the US to its knees by threatening to sell its dollar holdings . 
But doing so would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the dollar weakened ; it would also jeopardize US demand for Chinese imports , leading to job losses and instability in China . 
In other words , bringing the US to it knees might well mean that China would bring itself to its ankles . 
Judging whether economic interdependence produces power requires looking at the balance of asymmetries . 
In this case , it resembles a &quot; balance of financial terror , &quot; analogous to the Cold War military interdependence in which the US and the Soviet Union each had the potential to destroy the other in a nuclear exchange . 
In February 2010 , a group of senior Chinese military officers , angered over US arms sales to Taiwan , called for China &apos;s government to sell off US government bonds in retaliation . 
Their suggestion was not heeded . 
Economic resources can produce soft-power behavior as well as hard military power . 
A successful economic model not only finances the military resources needed for the exercise of hard power , but it can also attract others to emulate its example . 
The European Union &apos;s soft power at the end of the Cold War , and that of China today , owes much to the success of the EU and Chinese economic models . 
Economic resources are increasingly important in this century , but it would be a mistake to write off the role of military power . 
As US President Barack Obama said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 , &quot; We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth that we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes . 
There will be times when nations - acting individually or in concert - will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified . &quot; 
Even if the probability of the use of force among states , or of threats of its use , is lower now than in earlier eras , the high impact of war leads rational actors to purchase expensive military insurance . 
If China &apos;s hard power frightens its neighbors , they are likely to seek such insurance policies , and the US is likely to be the major provider . 
This leads to a larger point about the role of military force . 
Some analysts argue that military power is of such restricted utility that it is no longer the ultimate measuring rod . 
But the fact that military power is not always sufficient to decide particular situations does not mean that it has lost all utility . 
While there are more situations and contexts in which military force is difficult to use , it remains a vital source of power . 
Markets and economic power rest upon political frameworks , which in turn depend not only upon norms , institutions , and relationships , but also upon the management of coercive power . 
A well-ordered modern state is one that holds a monopoly on the legitimate use of force , and that allows domestic markets to operate . 
Internationally , where order is more tenuous , residual concerns about the coercive use of force , even if a low probability , can have important effects - including a stabilizing effect . 
Indeed , metaphorically , military power provides a degree of security that is to order as oxygen is to breathing : little noticed until it becomes scarce , at which point its absence dominates all else . 
In the twenty-first century , military power will not have the same utility for states that it had in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , but it will remain a crucial component of power in world politics .
