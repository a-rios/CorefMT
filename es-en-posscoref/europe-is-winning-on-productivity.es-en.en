Europe is Winning on Productivity 
Revision is in the air about America &apos;s economic miracle . 
Not only did America &apos;s bubble crash , but also it now appears that much of the US economic miracle of the 1990s never happened . 
When it comes to performance , Europe is king , not the US . 
A study of the sources of economic growth by the OECD has brought together a formidable set of data and with it new views about who is doing well and who poorly . 
One new conclusion is that America &apos;s economic performance is not as glittering as previously thought . 
The accompanying table captures the central fact : true , the US had high growth in the 1990s , more than Europe &apos;s largest economies by a long shot . 
But the productivity part - the US as a productivity miracle - is wrong . 
This is apparent at the conventional level of output per person employed . 
But it gets even worse when we recognize that in Europe many fewer hours are worked per person than in America . 
By the time we look at output per hour worked , Europe shows a full reversal . 
Suddenly a place thought dull if not worse - Germany - is the big winner . 
Germans don &apos;t work much , but when they do , it is with unmatched productivity , and the story gets better over time . 
It might seem from these numbers that Europe has figured out a neat trick : work little , work well . 
In fact , not only was productivity growth better in Europe , but so also were productivity levels . 
West Germany or France produced absolutely more dollars worth of output per hour worked than the US . 
So , too , did Italy . 
By contrast , Japan , with its inefficient service sector , was way below the US or Europe , as was the UK . 
How should we interpret these facts ? 
One possibility is this : Europe &apos;s labor market is a great problem . 
It is over-regulated and inflexible and , on top of these twin evils , is expensive even at the current low level of the Euro . 
Why be surprised , then , that European firms shy away from labor and operate in a capital-intensive fashion . 
With high concentrations of capital per worker , other things being equal , labor is highly productive - that is the European model . 
Moreover , labor-intensive ( i.e. low productivity ) companies more readily outsource some tasks or go offshore altogether . 
This is partially because restructuring in Europe is hard , which can result in a whole business leaving Europe altogether . 
Consequently , by a process of elimination , what firms remain are the ones showing gains in productivity . 
That is a smart model , but is there a downside ? 
The downside is this : Europe has high unemployment because firms shy away from hiring new workers . 
In the US by contrast , growth normally involves relatively less capital accumulation per worker and a small productivity gain per worker or per hour , but in exchange significantly more employment creation . 
In fact , much of America &apos;s growth in the 1990s involved absorption of the unemployed and of welfare recipients into jobs . 
US growth thus involves lots of job creation ; 
Two different models , each with a downside . 
It would obviously be attractive for Europe to get the extra benefit of massive job creation and for the US to enjoy stronger productivity in addition to its mammoth jobs machine . 
Is there a chance of either happening ? 
Europe does not stand much of a chance to emerge from its unemployment trap either in the coming year of recession or any time soon . 
To change things , Europe would need to stoke up the economy with a lot of investment , cheap money , tax cuts for everyone , and perhaps public works spending , too . 
No prospect of that in these days of strict accounting . 
The story will remain one of good productivity - surprisingly good considering that Europe was not thought to be part of the &quot; new economy &quot; area . 
In the US there is recession and hence rising unemployment . 
The likely modest recovery will not be strong enough to outpace productivity . 
Next year , accordingly , Europe and the US will look alike . 
On the productivity side , the news may become somewhat better . 
This is the first time the US shows productivity growth in a recession ( during which productivity normally turns negative ) . 
If this holds up and strengthens with recovery , as Chairman Greenspan seems to think it will , the US may soon face the European dilemma . 
It will be doing well on productivity , possibly better than Europe , but will not be able to get the unemployment rate down . 
Sadly , it is not at all clear which state of things is better .
