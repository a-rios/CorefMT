Iran v. Britain : Who Blinked ? 
While commentators have charged that Britain capitulated to Iran and handed them a humiliating victory in obtaining the release of the 15 British Marines last week , it would appear that something more like the opposite is actually the case . 
But to understand why this is so , we have to look at the larger picture of internal Iranian politics against which the crisis played out . 
Our Iranian problem is actually a problem with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC , or in Persian Pasdaran ) and allied institutions like the Basij militia . 
These are the &quot; power &quot; agencies that serve as the political base for the conservatives inside Iran . 
In return for its support , political leaders like ex-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have allowed the IRGC to grow into a semi-autonomous state-within-a-state . 
Today it is a large and sprawling enterprise , that controls its own intelligence agency , manufacturing base , and import-export companies , much like the Russian FSB or the Chinese military . 
Since coming to power , the current Ahmedinejad regime has awarded IRGC-affiliated companies billions in no-bid contracts , increasing the already great perception among the Iranian public of its corruption . 
It is widely believed that Supreme Leader Khamenei put the current nutcase president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad into office as a means of counterbalancing former president Rafsanjani , and has been regretting this decision ever since as Ahmedinejad spouted off about the Holocaust and pushed Iran deeper and deeper into isolation . 
The current president comes out of the IRGC ( specifically , the Ramazan Unit of the Quds Force ) , and has used that organization and the Basij to help consolidate his power by moving against more liberal political opponents . 
No one knows exactly why the naval wing of the IRGC took the 15 British Marines captive at the end of March . 
Some have speculated that it was a matter of freelancing by the IRGC &apos;s command , or the navy , reacting to a local target of opportunity . 
The IRGC may have wanted some bargaining chips to help spring of its members captured in Iraq . 
It does not seem to be an accident , though , that the capture came quickly after the Security Council passed a very specific set of sanctions against Iran that targeted not just IRGC-affiliated companies and financial institutions like the Ammunition and Metallurgy Industries Group and the Bank Sepah , organizations dealing with nuclear or ballistic missile activities , but also a series of senior IRGC commanders , including Morteza Rezaei , the Guards &quot; deputy commander , Vice Admiral Ali Ahmadian , chief of the Joint Staff , and Brigadier General Mohammad Hejazi , commander of the Basij . 
By freezing Iranian assets outside of Iran , the UN was hitting the IRGC where it hurt , in its pocketbook . 
Clearly , whoever was responsible for the decision to take the British Marines prisoner was hoping to rekindle some of the fervor of the 1979 revolution , and use that to force the rest of the leadership into a confrontation with Britain and America . 
Hence the televised &quot; confessions &quot; that hearkened back to the taking of hostages in the American Embassy ( the &quot; nest of spies &quot; ) , and the rallies against foreign embassies . 
But the gambit didn &apos;t work , and there was clearly a behind-the-scenes power struggle between different parts of the regime . 
Ahmedinejad was supposed to give a major speech to a huge rally in Teheran , which he cancelled at the last moment , and when he did speak , it was to announce that the captives would soon be released . 
The IRGC prisoners in Iraq were released , but Britain did not apologize or admit wrong-doing in return . 
So it would appear that it was the Iranians who blinked first , before the incident could spiral into a genuine 1979-style hostage crisis . 
All of this does not mean that there are necessarily &quot; radicals &quot; and &quot; moderates &quot; within the clerical regime in Teheran . 
Those pulling the IRGC &apos;s chain are themselves committed to a revolutionary agenda , and doubtless want a nuclear weapon as badly as the Pasdaran commanders . 
One of the alleged reasons Khamenei didn &apos;t want Rafsanjani as president was because he was not keen enough on the nuclear program . 
The Iranian regime is not , however , a totalitarian juggernaut ; there are important splits within the leadership and there is an important faction that does not want Iran to be isolated . 
The IRGC has evolved into something like a mafia organization , with extensive economic interests that lead both to corruption and potential vulnerability to sanctions imposed by the international community . 
It is important to remember : those who were responsible for taking the British Marines captive wanted an escalation of the confrontation , both to improve their domestic standing , and to punch back for sanctions that were beginning to bite . 
This suggests that what the Bush administration has been doing - slowly ratcheting up the pressure through the use of diplomacy to create an international coalition that now includes the Russians - is the proper course to be on .
