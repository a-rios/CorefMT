Nigeria \ u0027s Battle of the Generals 
Nigeria has never held successful civilian-run elections . 
The last one , which returned President Shehu Shagari and his National Party of Nigeria to power in 1983 , was marked by widespread violence and vote-rigging . 
Three months later , the Army staged a coup - Nigeria &apos;s fifth since independence in 1960 . 
Governance has never been easy in Nigeria , a conglomerate of over 150 million people and some 250 ethnic or language groups . 
Not all share the same vision of Nigeria &apos;s future , and they are exceptionally vigorous in disputing what it should be . 
Civic virtue is rare . 
No leader can be expected to run this giant of Africa as if it were Singapore . 
Nigerians once again fear that chaos will accompany the second elections since the Army returned power to civilians in May 1999 . 
Legislative elections will be held on April 12 th , followed by the presidential election a week later . 
Opposing President Olusegun Obasanjo , a retired general seeking a second term on the platform of the People &apos;s Democratic Party ( PDP ) , is Muhammadu Buhari , another retired general , from the All Nigeria People &apos;s Party ( ANPP ) . 
General Buhari led the coup against Shagari in 1983 . 
Two other candidates stand out . 
Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu is an Oxford-trained historian and retired army officer who led the Biafran secessionist attempt in 1967 , which plunged the country into civil war . 
Gani Fawehinmi , a fiery lawyer who made his name as a human rights campaigner under military rule , is the candidate of the National Conscience Party ( NCP ) . 
The PDP and ANPP are broadly center-right parties , while the NCP styles itself as the &quot; party of the poor &quot; and espouses social democratic policies . 
In reality , however , the election is a straightforward fight between Obasanjo , a born-again Christian from the Yoruba southwest , and Buhari , an ascetic Muslim from the Hausa-Fulani-dominated north . 
So far , bleak predictions that the campaign would split Nigerians along Islamic / Christian lines , triggering sectarian violence before the voting , have not come to pass . 
Buhari , whose running mate is a Christian , has toned down his support for Shari &apos;ah , the strict Islamic legal system adopted by 12 northern states over the past three years . 
While taking care not to anger northern voters by openly distancing himself from Shari &apos;ah , Buhari pledges to uphold the nation &apos;s secular constitution . 
The power behind Obasanjo is his Vice President , Abubakar Atiku , a northern Muslim . 
Atiku , a formidable political operator , is positioning himself for his own presidential bid in 2007 . 
Atiku &apos;s huge influence balances the perceived Christian-millenarian strain of Obasanjo &apos;s presidency . 
Faced with meeting the constitutional requirement of getting votes from each state in the Federation , the candidates and their handlers have gone out of their way to avoid taking positions that ruffle feathers . 
This is not to say that parochial sentiments are unimportant . 
The Alliance for Democracy , the dominant Yoruba party , is not fielding a candidate because it does not want to divide the Yoruba vote and deny victory to Obasanjo , their kinsman . 
Nevertheless , Nigerians have seen little of the crude &quot; vote for my tribe &quot; politicking that doomed previous attempts at democratic rule . 
Still , political violence has increased as the campaign enters its final stage . 
Marshall Harry , an ANPP chieftain and General Buhari &apos;s point man in the volatile Niger delta region , was murdered on March 5 
Moreover , communal violence has combined with deep-seated local resentment against western oil companies to render the oil-rich delta a battlefront . 
Youth of the Ijo tribe demand that the government redraw local government boundaries , which they claim favor the Itsekiri , a rival group , before the elections . 
Violent clashes between the two groups have left hundreds dead and wounded . 
The presence of federal troops did not stop the warring factions from disrupting oil production , forcing Chevron / Texaco and Shell - which account for more than half of Nigeria &apos;s daily oil production - to suspend operations . 
Some calm has returned , and oil production is resuming . 
But the lethal mix of poverty , youth unemployment , and the mesmerizing spectacle of millions of petrodollars flowing out of the delta and into the pockets of the powerful , casts a long shadow . 
Ethnic militias are also making a show of strength elsewhere in the south , mainly among the Igbo and the Yoruba , whose political elites call for greater political and fiscal autonomy . 
Federal authorities have curbed their excesses so far , but in the heady , chaotic atmosphere surrounding the elections , uncertainty prevails . 
Rattled , leading politicians from all the parties met in Abuja , the capital , and promised to eschew violence and intimidation during the elections - an encouraging sign that the political class is keen not to repeat the coup-inciting mistakes of the past . 
Of course , the army is in no hurry to seize power . 
Revulsion for military rule runs deep . 
Ordinary Nigerians hold the &quot; Khaki Boys , &quot; as army officers are derisively called , responsible for today &apos;s wrecked economy and social malaise . 
But four years of democratic rule have not brought Nigerians much relief , with the majority still living below the poverty line . 
Obasanjo &apos;s government has no clear idea about how to address the nation &apos;s key problems - an ailing , oil-dependent economy hobbled by $ 30 billion in external debt , a deeply flawed unitary constitution forced on a socially-diverse people by the military in 1999 , and an exploding youth population . 
If Buhari beats Obasanjo , he is unlikely to do better . 
Ordinary Nigerians , brutalized by a dizzying succession of corrupt and inept military juntas , have , like a drowning man , clutched at &quot; democracy &quot; as their lifeline . 
This hope alone keeps the country from disintegrating into a thousand warring parts .
