China without North Korea 
NOTTINGHAM - North Korea &apos;s third nuclear test is a game changer not only for the United States and Japan , but also for the regime &apos;s last ally , China . 
The official Chinese reaction to North Korea &apos;s latest provocation was stern : China is &quot; strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed &quot; to the test , and it is calling for the resumption of international talks . 
But China &apos;s stance lacks meaningful bite , because its leaders fail to recognize that they no longer need to succumb to their unruly neighbor &apos;s blackmail . 
In carrying out the test , the North Koreans have once again compromised China &apos;s national interests . 
The international community is again firmly focused on China &apos;s relationship with its rogue ally , and expects that , as an emerging superpower seeking to reassure the world of its peaceful rise , China will play a constructive role . 
However limited China &apos;s influence may be , the North Korean regime can sustain itself only with Chinese backing . 
With North Korea &apos;s latest nuclear test coming so quickly after its rocket launch in December , the United Nations has good reason to ask China , a permanent Security Council member , to take the diplomatic lead . 
It is simply not enough for China to call , as its official statement does , for the resumption of the Six-Party Talks with South Korea , China , the US , Japan , and Russia . 
That framework has been thoroughly discredited by North Korea &apos;s repeated violation of past agreements . 
China must warn North Korea that it will not be pressured into providing support even when Chinese national interests have been undermined . 
Indeed , China should make clear that , much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper , it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode . 
Simply put , the conventional wisdom that North Korea &apos;s collapse would be disastrous for China is misconceived . Any crisis sparked by North Korean refugees fleeing across the Chinese border would be short-lived , and international assistance would be readily available . 
Likewise , China need not fear a South Korea-led unification of the peninsula . 
China already enjoys a smoother relationship with the South than it does with the North . 
Unification would occupy the Korean people for the next two decades , with Japan and the US compelled to inject a huge amount of aid to rebuild and reintegrate the North . 
This hardly runs counter to China &apos;s interests as it continues its own advance toward becoming the world &apos;s largest economy . 
Indeed , if this process were to unfold , the US rationale for keeping its own military forces in South Korea would disappear . 
A phased reduction of the American presence would follow . If the US wished to maintain bases in Korea in the longer term , it would have to secure permission from a proud and newly united Korean nation - hardly a forgone conclusion . 
Moreover , a united Korea will have inherited the North &apos;s nuclear weapons . 
This will pose challenges to US-Korea relations , which should work to China &apos;s advantage . 
The US will remain committed to de-nuclearizing the peninsula , while the Korean government will be tempted to retain the North &apos;s nuclear capabilities . 
This strain further reduces the risk of having US troops stationed on the Korean side of China &apos;s border . 
China must also consider the implications of North Korea &apos;s actions on its own fractious relations with Japan . 
Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s top foreign-policy priority is to force the Japanese government to acknowledge , if not accept , China &apos;s territorial claims in the two countries &quot; dispute over the Diaoyu / Senkaku islands in the East China Sea . 
Chinese naval ships have already trained their weapons on a Japanese destroyer and a Japanese naval helicopter . 
In these incidents , the single most important reason for Japanese restraint has been its military &apos;s own rules of engagement . 
Under current law , Japanese security forces are forbidden from firing their weapons unless clearly fired upon , which means that the country &apos;s Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels can do little when targeted by Chinese naval radar . 
And revising the rules to allow Japan &apos;s military to , say , destroy a North Korean missile before it reaches Japanese air space would increase the risk of conflict between Chinese and Japanese naval and air forces . 
If the Chinese leadership can think beyond its usual default response to North Korean misbehavior - abstract condemnation followed by a call for dialogue - it can apply real pressure on the North Korean regime in full view of the international community . 
North Korea &apos;s last ally should give it one last chance . 
And then it should be prepared to pull the plug .
