America &apos;s Partisan Peril 
NEWPORT BEACH - The United States &quot; reputation for sound economic policymaking took a beating in 2013 . 
And now a related distorted narrative - one that in 2014 could needlessly undermine policies that are key to improving America &apos;s economic recovery - is gaining traction . 
The 2008 global financial crisis left the US economy mired in a low-level equilibrium , characterized by sluggish job creation , persistently high long-term and youth unemployment , and growing inequalities of income , wealth , and opportunity . 
Many Americans started 2013 with high hopes that congressional leaders would overcome , even if only partly , the polarization and political dysfunction that had slowed recovery . 
Expectations of less political turbulence were enhanced at the start of 2013 by a bipartisan agreement that avoided the so-called fiscal cliff ( though at the last minute and with much rancor ) and a deal reached later in January to raise the debt ceiling ( albeit temporarily ) . 
With expectations of less political brinkmanship and lower policy uncertainty ahead , consensus projections foresaw faster , more inclusive economic growth . 
In turn , faster growth was expected to revitalize the labor market , counteract worsening income inequality , mollify concerns about debt and deficit levels , and enable the Federal Reserve to start normalizing monetary policy in an orderly fashion . 
It would also facilitate a return by Congress to more normal economic governance - whether passing an annual budget , something not accomplished in four years , or finally taking steps to enhance rather than impede growth and job creation . 
But optimism foundered over the course of 2013 , and frustration soared . 
Growth has again fallen short of expectations . 
With another year of uneven job creation , the problems associated with long-term and youth unemployment have become more deeply embedded in the economy &apos;s structure . 
Inequalities remain too high , and continue to grow . 
Congressional paralysis has reached levels unparalleled in recent history . 
And , again , lawmakers have not enacted an annual budget . 
This is not to say that there has been no economic or financial progress in 2013 . 
After all , economic growth , while unnecessarily held below potential by Congress ( and vulnerable to decline if Congress is not careful ) , has again outpaced that of Europe . 
The budget deficit has fallen markedly , while companies and households , too , have continued to strengthen their balance sheets . 
Many segments of the equities market have bounced back strongly , with price indexes hitting record highs . 
And Americans are on the verge of obtaining much better access to health care . 
What is frustrating is that the country could have - and should have - done a lot better . 
Recognizing this , Americans are not hesitant to blame a Congress that seems more eager to manufacture problems than to enable the economy to reach its considerable potential . 
Rather than building on some of the fledgling bipartisanship from earlier in the year , Congress decided to produce a mid-year government-financing drama . 
Even immigration reform - a bipartisan pro-growth issue with considerable support from much of American society - has languished unnecessarily . 
More broadly , Congress took no significant action to avoid headwinds that impose a drag on growth and discourage companies and individuals from investing in their future . 
According to a survey based on data from the Office of the Clerk of the US House of Representatives , the current 113th Congress has delivered the lowest legislative activity &quot; since at least 1947 , when the data collection began . &quot; 
And Americans know it . 
According to Gallup , the 9 % approval rating for Congress is the lowest level in the survey &apos;s 39-year history . 
Partisan polarization in Congress has also undermined the executive branch , unduly blocking government appointments - including routine and essentially uncontroversial ones - and placing unwarranted obstacles in the way of implementing even the most sensible and seemingly bipartisan legislative proposals . 
The resulting sense of political drift and dysfunction has been exacerbated by the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) - a massive , avoidable distraction that has been allowed to cast doubt on this landmark initiative . 
Yes , 2013 was not a good year for public-sector decision-making , especially given that most of the slippages were &quot; own goals . &quot; 
In the process , the US damaged the reputation for effective economic management that it had earned during the global financial crisis , when bold and timely measures prevented a period of reckless private risk-taking and financial leverage from ending in Great Depression II . 
The Congress-imposed government shutdown and near-default in October were particularly harmful to the country &apos;s global standing . 
As a result , the popular narrative is shifting to the danger of &quot; government failure . &quot; 
More and more Americans are being led to forget how , just a few years ago , a united US government reacted decisively to &quot; market failures &quot; and thus helped to avoid a global economic meltdown that would have devastated millions of lives and undermined future generations &quot; prospects . 
Now , as the pendulum swings back , it risks overshooting the optimal combination of private and public activity and ending up at a simplistic view of government as the problem and the private sector as the solution . 
If this occurs , the outlook for faster , more inclusive growth would be weakened further . 
Government has a long pro-growth to-do list heading into 2014 . 
The top priorities include modernizing the country &apos;s transport and energy infrastructure , reforming an underperforming education system , improving the labor market , bringing order to an overly-fragmented fiscal structure , enhancing the provision of public goods , and safeguarding America &apos;s interests abroad . 
It is tempting for politicians and analysts to overplay simple narratives that place the blame entirely on one side or the other . 
The truth is more nuanced and complex . 
America is in desperate need of a Congress that encourages , rather than impedes , better partnerships between the public and private sectors . 
Constantly pitting one side against the other may make for entertaining roundtables on cable television and energizing political rallies .
