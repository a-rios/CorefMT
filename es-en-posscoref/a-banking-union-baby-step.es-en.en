A Banking Union Baby Step 
BRUSSELS - At the beginning of the financial crisis , it was said that banks were , in Charles Goodhart &apos;s crisp phrase , &quot; international in life , but national in death . &quot; 
At the time ( 2008-2009 ) , large international banks had to be rescued by their home countries &quot; governments when they ran into trouble . 
But the problem now in Europe is the opposite : banks are &quot; national in life , but European in death . &quot; 
In Spain , for example , local savings banks ( cajas ) financed an outsize real-estate boom . 
The Spanish case is symptomatic of a larger problem . 
National supervisors always tend to minimize problems at home . 
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper . 
Until recently , the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country &apos;s real-estate sector were temporary . 
To acknowledge the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the build-up of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country . 
In the case of Ireland , the situation was initially not much different . 
When problems started to surface , the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out &quot; the cheapest bank rescue ever . &quot; 
Given national supervisors &quot; predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home , it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up insolvent banks should also be borne at the national level . 
It thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone , banking supervision remained largely national . 
The recently created European Banking Authority has only limited powers over national supervisors , whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations . 
But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable . 
Problems might originate at the national level , but , owing to monetary union , they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system . 
At their June summit , Europe &apos;s leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation , transferring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank . 
Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union , putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice . 
Moreover , the ECB already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone &apos;s banking system . 
Putting the ECB in charge should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process , which is not publicly visible , but is very real nonetheless . 
Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy , but with an important subsidiary in Germany . 
The German operations naturally generate a surplus of funds ( given that savings in Germany far exceed investment on average ) . 
The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group &apos;s liquidity . 
The supervisor of the home country ( Italy ) has the opposite interest . 
Here , too , it makes sense to have the ECB in charge as a neutral arbiter with respect to these opposing interests . 
But , while putting the ECB in charge of banking supervision solves one problem , it creates another : can national authorities still be held responsible for saving banks that they no longer supervise ? 
Economic ( and political ) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund . 
Officially , this has not yet been acknowledged . 
This incremental approach has worked well in the past ; indeed , today &apos;s European Union resulted from it . 
But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another . 
They will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro .
