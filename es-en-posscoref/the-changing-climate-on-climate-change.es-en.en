The Changing Climate On Climate Change 
The message , it seems , has finally gotten through : global warming represents a serious threat to our planet . 
At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos , world leaders saw climate change , for the first time , topping the list of global concerns . 
Europe and Japan have shown their commitment to reduce global warming by imposing costs on themselves and their producers , even if it places them at a competitive disadvantage . 
The biggest obstacle until now has been the United States . 
The Clinton administration had called for bold action as far back as 1993 , proposing what was in effect a tax on carbon emissions ; but an alliance of polluters , led by the coal , oil , and auto industries beat back this initiative . 
To the scientific community , the evidence on climate change has , of course , been overwhelming for more than a decade and a half . 
I participated in the second assessment of the scientific evidence conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which perhaps made one critical mistake : it underestimated the pace at which global warming was occurring . 
The Fourth Assessment , which was just issued , confirms the mounting evidence and the increasing conviction that global warming is the result of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . 
The increased pace of warming reflects the impact of complex non-linear factors and a variety of &quot; tipping points &quot; that can result in acceleration of the process . 
For instance , as the Arctic ice cap melts , less sunlight is reflected . 
Seemingly dramatic changes in weather patterns - including the melting of glaciers in Greenland and the thawing of the Siberian permafrost - have at last convinced most business leaders that the time for action is now . 
Recently , even President Bush seems to have woken up . 
But a closer look at what he is doing , and not doing , shows clearly that he has mostly heard the call of his campaign contributors from the oil and coal industries , and that he has once again put their interests over the global interest in reducing emissions . 
If he were truly concerned about global warming , how could he have endorsed the construction of coal-fired electricity plants , even if those plants use more efficient technologies than have been employed in the past ? 
What is required , first and foremost , are market-based incentives to induce Americans to use less energy and to produce more energy in ways that emit less carbon . 
But Bush has neither eliminated massive subsidies to the oil industry ( though , fortunately , the Democratic Congress may take action ) nor provided adequate incentives for conservation . 
Even his call for energy independence should be seen for what it is - a new rationale for old corporate subsidies . 
A policy that entails draining America &apos;s limited oil supplies - I call it &quot; drain America first &quot; - will leave the US even more dependent on foreign oil . 
The US imposes a tariff of more than 50 cents per gallon on sugar-based ethanol from Brazil , but subsidizes inefficient corn-based American ethanol heavily - indeed , it requires more than a gallon of gasoline to fertilize , harvest , transport , process , and distill corn to yield one gallon of ethanol . 
As the world &apos;s largest polluter , accounting for roughly a quarter of global carbon emissions , America &apos;s reluctance to do more is perhaps understandable , if not forgivable . 
But claims by Bush that America cannot afford to do anything about global warming ring hollow : other advanced industrial countries with comparable standards of living emit only a fraction of what the US emits per dollar of GDP . 
As a result , American firms with access to cheap energy are given a big competitive advantage over firms in Europe and elsewhere . 
Some in Europe worry that stringent action on global warming may be counterproductive : energy-intensive industries may simply move to the US or other countries that pay little attention to emissions . 
And there is more than a grain of truth to these concerns . 
A striking fact about climate change is that there is little overlap between the countries that are most vulnerable to its effects - mainly poor countries in the South that can ill afford to deal with the consequences - and the countries , like the US , that are the largest polluters . 
What is at stake is in part a moral issue , a matter of global social justice . 
The Kyoto Protocol represented the international community &apos;s attempt to begin to deal with global warming in a fair and efficient way . 
But it left out a majority of the sources of emissions , and unless something is done to include the US and the developing countries in a meaningful way , it will be little more than a symbolic gesture . 
There needs to be a new &quot; coalition of the willing , &quot; this time perhaps led by Europe - and this time directed at a real danger . 
This &quot; coalition of the willing &quot; could agree to certain basic standards : to forego building coal-fired plants , increase automobiles &quot; fuel efficiency , and provide targeted assistance to developing countries to enhance their energy efficiency and reduce emissions . 
Coalition members could also agree to provide stronger incentives to their own producers , through either more stringent caps on emissions or higher taxes on pollution . 
They could then agree to impose taxes on products from other countries - including the US - that are produced in ways that unnecessarily add substantially to global warming . 
What is at stake is not protecting domestic producers , but protecting our planet . 
The changing climate on climate change provides political leaders in Europe and other potential members of this &quot; coalition of the willing &quot; an unprecedented opportunity to move beyond mere rhetoric . 
The time to act is now .
