Sustaining the Unsustainable Eurozone 
ATHENS - When the eurozone was established , its creators envisioned gradual progress toward an &quot; optimal currency area , &quot; characterized by fiscal integration , the free movement of labor , and political union . 
But this process has not occurred , and , as the interminable Greek crisis has shown , the eurozone remains rife with structural weaknesses and extremely vulnerable to internal shocks . 
This is clearly not sustainable . 
Despite efforts to promote fiscal-policy coordination , eurozone members &quot; budgets still fall under the purview of separate national authorities , and northern Europeans continue to oppose transfers from more to less prosperous countries beyond the very limited allowance of the European Union &apos;s regional funds . 
Moreover , labor mobility is severely constrained by linguistic and cultural barriers , as well as administrative bottlenecks . 
And &quot; ever-closer &quot; political union has ceased to attract public support - if it ever did - and is thus not feasible today . 
A growing number of commentators - and no longer only in the Anglo-Saxon world - question the monetary union &apos;s viability . 
Some encourage Greece to exit the eurozone , believing that a more restricted and homogeneous currency union would be stronger and easier to unite . 
Others consider a Greek exit to be just the start of the inevitable unraveling of a scheme that does not serve the purpose for which it was created . 
The eurozone has so far managed to prove the doomsayers wrong . 
By sheer force of political will , compromise after compromise has been reached , thereby sustaining a historic project that is not , in its current state , sustainable . 
The need to maintain this commitment to European unity , and overcome the economic difficulties that arise , is reinforced by new geopolitical challenges . 
Most notably , Russia &apos;s perceived ambition of recapturing its Soviet-era influence is challenging the rules-based order that was established after World War II , and a surge in religious and political extremism is threatening democratic and liberal values . 
But the economic difficulties are bound to continue , fostering doubts about the currency union &apos;s future - doubts that could become self-fulfilling by undermining the euro &apos;s ability to function properly . 
Already , economic pressures have fueled anti-European sentiment in Spain , Italy , and even France ; if allowed to continue , such sentiment could culminate in secession , with devastating consequences for the eurozone and Europe as a whole . 
The first step in such a process would probably be the eurozone &apos;s division into sub-areas , comprising countries of relatively equal resilience . 
As it becomes increasingly difficult to pursue coherent fiscal and monetary policies , the risk of the eurozone &apos;s complete dissolution would grow . 
Greece &apos;s exit could shorten this timeline considerably . 
Though such a scenario was inconceivable five years ago , when the Greek crisis first erupted , the term &quot; Grexit &quot; entered the European lexicon soon after , when the crisis reached a new peak . 
But European leaders seemed to recognize the implications of allowing a country - even small , crisis-stricken Greece - to exit the eurozone . 
That is why , this year , a series of Eurogroup meetings were held with the avowed purpose of averting such an outcome . 
The problem is that Europeans have become so accustomed to muddling through that long-term solutions seem all but impossible . 
Indeed , in recent years , eurozone authorities have introduced several policies for fighting financial crises - including government-backed rescue funds , a partial banking union , tougher fiscal controls , and a role for the European Central Bank as lender of last resort . 
But most of these policies - with the possible exception of the banking union - are aimed at managing default risk , not eliminating this risk &apos;s root causes . 
It is time to recover the capacity , displayed by the EU &apos;s founders , to look ahead and pursue a dream of a better future . 
Specifically , eurozone leaders must introduce a mechanism for fiscal transfers from stronger to weaker economies . 
In a currency union , individual economies cannot alter their exchange rates to account for changes in relative competitiveness . 
The resulting price stickiness tends to delay macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment , leading to rising debt and unemployment in weaker economies . 
Without free labor mobility , fiscal transfers are the eurozone &apos;s only option to ease debt repayment and , by stimulating economic activity , boost employment . 
Establishing such a mechanism will not be easy , as it requires a resource that is in short supply in Europe today : trust . 
Indeed , the north and south have struggled to overcome cultural differences and unequal economic conditions , preventing them from viewing the situation from each other &apos;s perspective . 
Binding the union closer together could prove critical to building such trust . 
One strategy that combines rationality with the gradualism needed to overcome political resistance would be to increase the EU budget steadily , so that it can ultimately play a macroeconomic role , promoting stability and reinforcing cohesion within the eurozone . 
It is a tough sell , but also a vital one .
