Escaping the Oil Curse 
CAMBRIDGE - Libyans have a new lease on life , a feeling that , at long last , they are the masters of their own fate . 
Perhaps Iraqis , after a decade of warfare , feel the same way . 
Both countries are oil producers , and there is widespread expectation among their citizens that that wealth will be a big advantage in rebuilding their societies . 
Meanwhile , in Africa , Ghana has begun pumping oil for the first time , and Uganda is about to do so as well . 
Indeed , from West Africa to Mongolia , countries are experiencing windfalls from new discoveries of oil and mineral wealth . 
Heightening the euphoria are the historic levels that oil and mineral prices have reached on world markets over the last four years . 
Many countries have been in this position before , exhilarated by natural-resource bonanzas , only to see the boom end in disappointment and the opportunity squandered , with little payoff in terms of a better quality of life for their people . 
To prescribe a cure , one must first diagnose the illness . 
Why do oil riches turn out to be a curse as often as they are a blessing ? 
Economists have identified six pitfalls that can afflict natural-resource exporters : commodity-price volatility , crowding out of manufacturing , &quot; Dutch disease &quot; ( a booming export industry causes rapid currency appreciation , which undermines other exporters &quot; competitiveness ) , inhibited institutional development , civil war , and excessively rapid resource depletion ( with insufficient saving ) . 
Oil prices are especially volatile , as the large swings over the last five years remind us . 
The recent oil boom could easily turn to bust , especially if global economic activity slows . 
Volatility itself is costly , leaving economies unable to respond effectively to price signals . 
Temporary commodity booms typically pull workers , capital , and land away from fledgling manufacturing sectors and production of other internationally traded goods . 
This reallocation can damage long-term economic development if those sectors nurture learning by doing and fuel broader productivity gains . 
The problem is not just that workers , capital , and land are sucked into the booming commodity sector . 
They also are frequently lured away from manufacturing by booms in construction and other non-tradable goods and services . 
The pattern also includes an exuberant expansion of government spending , which can result in bloated public payrolls and large infrastructure projects , both of which are found to be unsustainable when oil prices fall . 
If the manufacturing sector has been &quot; hollowed out &quot; in the meantime , so much the worse . 
Even if an increase in oil prices turns out to be permanent , pitfalls abound . 
Governments that can finance themselves simply by retaining physical control over oil or mineral deposits often fail in the long run to develop institutions that are conducive to economic development . 
Such countries evolve a hierarchical authoritarian society in which the only incentive is to compete for privileged access to commodity rents . 
In the extreme case , this competition can take the form of civil war . 
In a country without resource wealth , by contrast , elites have little alternative but to nurture a decentralized economy in which individuals have incentives to work and save . 
These are the economies that industrialize . 
The final pitfall is excessively rapid depletion of oil or mineral deposits , in violation of optimal rates of saving , let alone environmental preservation . 
What can countries do to ensure that natural resources are a blessing rather than a curse ? 
Some policies and institutions have been tried and failed . 
But some countries have succeeded , and their strategies could be useful models for Libya , Iraq , Ghana , Mongolia , and others to emulate . 
These include : hedging export earnings - for example , via the oil options market , as Mexico does ; ensuring counter-cyclical fiscal policy - for example , via a variant of Chile &apos;s structural budget rule ; and delegating sovereign wealth funds to professional managers , as Botswana &apos;s Pula Fund does . 
Finally , some promising ideas have virtually never been tried at all : denominating bonds in oil prices instead of dollars , to protect against the risk of a price decline ; choosing commodity-price targeting as an alternative to inflation targeting or exchange-rate targeting for anchoring monetary policy ; and distributing oil revenues on a nationwide per capita basis , to ensure that they do not wind up in elites &quot; Swiss bank accounts . 
Leaders have free will . 
Oil exporters need not be prisoners of a curse that has befallen others . 
Countries can choose to use their resource bonanzas for the long-term economic advancement of their people , not just that of their leaders .
