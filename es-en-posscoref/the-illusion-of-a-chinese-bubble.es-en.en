The Illusion of a Chinese Bubble 
BEIJING - On the eve of Chinese New Year , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBC ) surprised the market by announcing - for the second consecutive time in a month - an increase in banks &quot; mandatory-reserve ratio by 50 basis points , bringing it to 16.5 % . 
Shortly before that , China &apos;s government acted to stop over-borrowing by local governments ( through local state investment corporations ) , and to cool feverish regional housing markets by raising the down-payment ratio for second house buyers and the capital-adequacy ratio for developers . 
This latest round of monetary tightening in China reflects the authorities &quot; growing concern over liquidity . 
In 2009 , M2 money supply ( a key indicator used to forecast inflation ) increased by 27 % year on year , and credit expanded by 34 % . 
In January 2010 , despite strict &quot; administrative control &quot; of financial credit lines ( the PBC actually imposed credit ceilings on commercial banks ) , bank lending grew at an annual rate of 29 % , on top of already strong expansion in the same period a year earlier . 
While inflation remains low , at 1.5 % , it has been rising in recent months . 
Housing prices have also soared in most major cities . 
These factors have inspired some China watchers to regard the country &apos;s economy as a bubble , if not to predict a hard landing in 2010 . 
But that judgment seems premature , at best . 
To be sure , China may have a strong tendency to create bubbles , partly because people in a fast-growing economy become less risk-averse . 
Thirty years of stable growth without serious crises have made people less aware of the negative consequences of overheating and bubbles . 
Instead , they are so confident that they often blame the government for not allowing the economy to grow even faster . 
There are also several special factors that may make China vulnerable to bubbles . 
China &apos;s large state sector ( which accounts for more than 30 % of GDP ) is usually careless about losses , owing to the soft budget constraints under which they operate . 
Local governments are equally careless , often failing to service their debts . 
In addition , various structural problems - including large and growing income disparities - are causing serious disequilibrium in the economy . 
But a tendency toward a bubble need not become a reality . 
The good news is that Chinese policymakers are vigilant and prepared to bear down on incipient bubbles - sometimes with unpopular interventions such as the recent monetary moves . 
Whatever one thinks of those measures , taking counter-cyclical policy action is almost always better than doing nothing when an economy is overheating . 
Whereas some policies may be criticized for being too &quot; administrative &quot; and failing to allow market forces to play a sufficient role , they may be the only effective way to deal with China &apos;s &quot; administrative entities . &quot; 
In any case , the new policies should reassure those who feared that China &apos;s central government either would simply watch the bubble inflate or that it lacked a sufficiently independent macroeconomic policy to intervene . 
The consequences of burst bubbles in Japan in the 1980 &quot; s and in the United States last year are powerful reasons why China &apos;s government has acted with such determination , while the legacy of a functioning centralized system may explain why it has proven capable of doing so decisively . 
After all , although modern market economics provides a sound framework for policymaking - as Chinese bureaucrats are eagerly learning - the idea of a planned economy emerged in the nineteenth century as a counter-orthodoxy to address market failures . 
Some people would prefer China to move to a totally free market without regulation and management , but the recent crises have reminded everyone that free-market fundamentalism has its drawbacks , too . 
No one has proven able to eliminate bubbles in economies where markets are allowed to function . 
But if the fluctuations can be &quot; ironed out , &quot; as John Maynard Keynes put it , total economic efficiency can be improved . 
Government investment , which represents the major part of China &apos;s anti-crisis stimulus package , should help in this regard . 
Roughly 80 % of the total is going to public infrastructure such as subways , railways , and urban projects , which to a great extent should be counted as long-term public goods . 
As such , they will not fuel a bubble by leading to immediate over-capacity in industry . 
Moreover , roughly 40 % of the increase in bank credit in 2009 accommodated the fiscal expansion , as projects were started prior to the budget allocations needed to finance them . 
Over-borrowing by local government did pose risks to the banking system and the economy as a whole , but , given China &apos;s currently low public-debt / GDP ratio ( just 24 % even after the anti-crisis stimulus ) , non-performing loans are not a dangerous problem . 
Indeed , they may be easily absorbed as long as annual GDP growth remains at 8-9 % and , most importantly , as long as local government borrowings are now contained . 
Finally , the leverage of financial investments remains very low compared to other countries . 
Using bank credits to speculate in equity and housing markets is still mostly forbidden . 
There may be leaks and loopholes in these rules , but firewalls are in place - and are more stringently guarded than ever before . 
So is a Chinese bubble still possible ? 
Perhaps . 
But it has not appeared yet , and it may be adequately contained if it does .
