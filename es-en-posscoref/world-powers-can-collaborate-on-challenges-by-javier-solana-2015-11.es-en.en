Managing a World of Great Powers 
MADRID - Today , great-power competition is a fact : The United States now competes with an increasingly active Russia and a rising China . 
The Middle East , the South China Sea , and Ukraine are just three theaters where this new reality is playing out . 
Upon rereading former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott &apos;s book The Great Experiment , I was left with the impression that the seeds of some of the dynamics at play today were sown some time ago . 
The book describes a conversation that took place in December 2000 between President Bill Clinton and President-elect George W. Bush . 
Clinton says that , judging by Bush &apos;s electoral campaign , the security issues that seemed to concern him most were Saddam Hussein and the construction of a large-scale antimissile defense system . 
&quot; That &apos;s absolutely right , &quot; Bush responds . 
These issues were put on hold when tragedy unexpectedly struck , in the form of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the US , which brought a period of international cooperation during which solidarity against terrorism reigned . 
It was a time when we were all Americans , and when Bush described Putin as &quot; very straightforward and trustworthy . &quot; 
The winds began to change that December , when the US announced that it was withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty , in order to build an antimissile defense system to protect itself from a potentially nuclearized Iran . 
This did not go unnoticed in Russia . 
The US at the time did not seem to understand that a multipolar world order was emerging - one that would make it very difficult to pursue , without serious consequences , the policies that Bush and Clinton had discussed in 2000 . 
In a 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference , Russian President Vladimir Putin made this plain , vehemently rejecting the intervention in Iraq and especially US plans to expand antimissile defense systems to Europe , calling this an act of aggression toward Russia and a breach of common European security . 
In the summer of 2008 , three events placed the new multipolar order in stark relief . 
China dazzled the world as host of the Olympic Games , reinforcing its status as a significant international player . 
Russia &apos;s military actions in Georgia - in the midst of the Games - showed the world that the concept of spheres of influence was still alive and well in the Kremlin . 
And the collapse the following month of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers , which unleashed a global financial crisis from which the world economy has yet to recover fully , underscored the advanced economies &quot; vulnerabilities , while largely sparing China . 
With a new sense of confidence in its great-power status , China seemed to qualify the concept of a &quot; peaceful rise &quot; that its leaders have invoked since the era of Deng Xiaoping , adopting a more muscular foreign-policy approach within its neighborhood . 
Drawing on alleged historical rights , China began to expand its territorial claims , along with its military presence , in the South and East China Seas . 
In 2013 , tensions peaked when China unilaterally declared an Air Defense Identification Zone ( ADIZ ) covering territories in the East China Sea that it claims , but Japan controls . 
Many of the countries affected by China &apos;s actions in the South and East China Seas have security treaties with the US , which has been the major maritime power in the Pacific region since World War II . 
China &apos;s ADIZ declaration was therefore viewed by the US as a provocation . 
By expanding its sovereignty claims , China was actually expanding its claims to influence . 
It has taken the international institutions some time to catch up to the changing world order . 
The 2010 G-20 summit in Seoul produced an agreement to increase the emerging countries &quot; quotas in the International Monetary Fund by 2014 . 
But the US Congress refused to ratify the changes , so nothing came of the agreement . 
China then took matters into its own hands , spearheading the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . 
Fragmentation of the international institutions seemed imminent - that is , until European countries decided to join the AIIB . 
Though the US resisted at first , and has still refused to join , that decision was lent some nuance in a later conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama . 
Meanwhile , Russia was exposing its own renewed foreign-policy ambitions in Ukraine . 
By violating the Helsinki Final Act in the spring of 2014 , Putin placed Russian foreign policy in direct opposition to that of the US and Europe . 
This position was reaffirmed in September , when Putin decided to intervene in the Syrian conflict , securing for Russia a role in any attempt to bring peace to the country . 
Today , the world is very different from what some might have imagined at the end of the last century , a decade after the Berlin Wall came down . 
Historically speaking , 15 years can seem long or short , depending on the intensity of change . 
During the last 15 years of mounting great-power competition and renewed instability in the Middle East - including the Arab Spring , the rise of the brutal Islamic State , Sunni-Shia proxy wars , and unspeakable human suffering - change has been very intense , to say the least . 
But confrontation is not the whole story . 
Promising steps have been made in two critical areas : nuclear non-proliferation , especially through the nuclear deal with Iran , and the fight against climate change , exemplified in the encouraging preparations for the current climate summit in Paris . 
If there is one lesson to be learned from all of this , it is that well-executed , tenacious diplomacy still holds extraordinary power to resolve conflicts . 
It remains the best instrument to produce those cooperative outcomes that confrontation effectively impedes .
