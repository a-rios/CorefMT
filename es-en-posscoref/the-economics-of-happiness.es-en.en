The Economics of Happiness 
NEW YORK - We live in a time of high anxiety . 
Despite the world &apos;s unprecedented total wealth , there is vast insecurity , unrest , and dissatisfaction . 
In the United States , a large majority of Americans believe that the country is &quot; on the wrong track . &quot; 
Pessimism has soared . 
The same is true in many other places . 
Against this backdrop , the time has come to reconsider the basic sources of happiness in our economic life . 
The relentless pursuit of higher income is leading to unprecedented inequality and anxiety , rather than to greater happiness and life satisfaction . 
Economic progress is important and can greatly improve the quality of life , but only if it is pursued in line with other goals . 
In this respect , the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan has been leading the way . 
Forty years ago , Bhutan &apos;s fourth king , young and newly installed , made a remarkable choice : Bhutan should pursue &quot; gross national happiness &quot; rather than gross national product . 
Since then , the country has been experimenting with an alternative , holistic approach to development that emphasizes not only economic growth , but also culture , mental health , compassion , and community . 
Dozens of experts recently gathered in Bhutan &apos;s capital , Thimphu , to take stock of the country &apos;s record . 
I was co-host with Bhutan &apos;s prime minister , Jigme Thinley , a leader in sustainable development and a great champion of the concept of &quot; GNH . &quot; 
We assembled in the wake of a declaration in July by the United Nations General Assembly calling on countries to examine how national policies can promote happiness in their societies . 
All who gathered in Thimphu agreed on the importance of pursuing happiness rather than pursuing national income . 
The question we examined is how to achieve happiness in a world that is characterized by rapid urbanization , mass media , global capitalism , and environmental degradation . 
How can our economic life be re-ordered to recreate a sense of community , trust , and environmental sustainability ? 
Here are some of the initial conclusions . 
First , we should not denigrate the value of economic progress . 
When people are hungry , deprived of basic needs such as clean water , health care , and education , and without meaningful employment , they suffer . 
Economic development that alleviates poverty is a vital step in boosting happiness . 
Second , relentless pursuit of GNP to the exclusion of other goals is also no path to happiness . 
In the US , GNP has risen sharply in the past 40 years , but happiness has not . 
Instead , single-minded pursuit of GNP has led to great inequalities of wealth and power , fueled the growth of a vast underclass , trapped millions of children in poverty , and caused serious environmental degradation . 
Third , happiness is achieved through a balanced approach to life by both individuals and societies . 
As individuals , we are unhappy if we are denied our basic material needs , but we are also unhappy if the pursuit of higher incomes replaces our focus on family , friends , community , compassion , and maintaining internal balance . 
As a society , it is one thing to organize economic policies to keep living standards on the rise , but quite another to subordinate all of society &apos;s values to the pursuit of profit . 
Yet politics in the US has increasingly allowed corporate profits to dominate all other aspirations : fairness , justice , trust , physical and mental health , and environmental sustainability . 
Corporate campaign contributions increasingly undermine the democratic process , with the blessing of the US Supreme Court . 
Fourth , global capitalism presents many direct threats to happiness . 
It is destroying the natural environment through climate change and other kinds of pollution , while a relentless stream of oil-industry propaganda keeps many people ignorant of this . 
It is weakening social trust and mental stability , with the prevalence of clinical depression apparently on the rise . 
The mass media have become outlets for corporate &quot; messaging , &quot; much of it overtly anti-scientific , and Americans suffer from an increasing range of consumer addictions . 
Consider how the fast-food industry uses oils , fats , sugar , and other addictive ingredients to create unhealthy dependency on foods that contribute to obesity . 
One-third of all Americans are now obese . 
The rest of the world will eventually follow unless countries restrict dangerous corporate practices , including advertising unhealthy and addictive foods to young children . 
The problem is not just foods . 
Mass advertising is contributing to many other consumer addictions that imply large public-health costs , including excessive TV watching , gambling , drug use , cigarette smoking , and alcoholism . 
Fifth , to promote happiness , we must identify the many factors other than GNP that can raise or lower society &apos;s well-being . 
Most countries invest to measure GNP , but spend little to identify the sources of poor health ( like fast foods and excessive TV watching ) , declining social trust , and environmental degradation . 
Once we understand these factors , we can act . 
The mad pursuit of corporate profits is threatening us all . 
To be sure , we should support economic growth and development , but only in a broader context : one that promotes environmental sustainability and the values of compassion and honesty that are required for social trust . 
The search for happiness should not be confined to the beautiful mountain kingdom of Bhutan .
