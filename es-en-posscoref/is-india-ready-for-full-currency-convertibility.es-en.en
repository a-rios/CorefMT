Is India Ready for Full Currency Convertibility ? 
India &apos;s political boldness in seeking peace with Pakistan in their half-century twilight struggle for Kashmir may soon be matched by economic moves equally as daring . 
Indeed , India is edging toward a truly bold reform : full international convertibility of the rupee . 
How it goes about this will not only effect India &apos;s economic development , but provide object lessons for China as it ponders convertibility in the years ahead . 
Since 1991 India has been travelling on a path from rupee devaluation to full convertibility , with the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) relaxing a range of foreign-exchange controls . 
Resident Indians can now maintain a foreign-currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies , while non-resident Indians can repatriate legacy / inheritance assets . 
Indian companies listed abroad can buy property in foreign countries , and resident firms will be allowed to pre-pay external commercial debt up to US $ 100 million . 
Limits on exporters &apos; foreign-currency accounts will be removed , and banks may invest in overseas money and debt markets . 
Is India ready for full convertibility ? 
The government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms . 
Structural reform and privatization have slowed , eroding investors &apos; confidence . 
But failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term . 
Hence it would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately . 
Exchange rate stability is the key anchor when a country &apos;s reform process is underway . 
There is , however , little evidence that capital account convertibility has a meaningful impact on a country &apos;s growth rate . 
With capital-account convertibility , the rupee &apos;s exchange rate will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials , as India &apos;s inflation rate remains broadly in line with the OECD average of around 3 % . 
Because India is still running a trade deficit , there could be some pressure on the rupee following any negative shock . 
Although monetary growth is more than twice the rate of real GDP growth , the inflationary risk is probably low because substantial excess capacity exists . 
Indeed , throughout the 1990s , despite rising output , deflation occurred , which means that India &apos;s potential output is expanding . 
The moves towards full capital-account convertibility have proceeded in step with impressive growth in India &apos;s foreign-currency reserves . 
Indeed , India &apos;s external liquidity position has strengthened dramatically in the past decade . 
As a result of a current-account surplus and an interest-rate differential of 3-4 % , foreign reserves reached $ 70.3 billion by the end of 2002 - enough to cover almost 15 months of imports - up from only US $ 4 billion in 1990 . 
Following the 1991 balance of payments crisis , the rupee &apos;s exchange rate was devalued around 20 % . 
Exporters could exchange 30 % of their earnings at the market rate . 
This was subsequently replaced with a two-tier exchange-rate system making the rupee partially convertible - 60 % of export earnings could be converted at the market exchange rate , and the rest at the RBI &apos;s fixed rate ( used by the government to finance essential imports like petroleum , cooking oil , fertilizers , and life-saving drugs ) . 
The two-tier exchange-rate system acted as an export tax , but it did not survive for long , giving way to a unified exchange rate on the trade account . 
Full convertibility on the current account followed in August 1994 . 
The policy debate then turned to capital-account convertibility , with the IMF and the World Bank strongly in favor . 
In May 1997 , the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility charted a three-stage liberalization process to be completed by 1999-2000 , with an accompanying emphasis on fiscal consolidation , a mandated inflation target , and a strong financial system . 
Then the East Asian currency crisis put further action on hold and raised serious questions about when - and whether - to proceed . 
The sudden meltdown of apparently healthy economies served as a stark reminder that strong external liquidity should not be the driving force towards full convertibility . 
The downside risk of capital-account liberalization , after all , is higher exchange-rate volatility , and even countries with sound liquidity positions could not prevent a run on their reserves . 
The lesson for India is that , in the event of a domestic or external shock , full convertibility could prove to be a costly , short-lived experiment . 
The fundamental question is whether full convertibility will encourage higher net inflows or outflows of capital . 
The downside risk of higher volatility for the rupee is aggravated by some serious problems , including a deficit running at 6 % of GDP and the strategic stand-off with Pakistan . 
Short-term capital outflows - which might occur should either risk worsen - could create greater output volatility . 
So it is vital for India to increase the inward flow of long-term capital , regardless of whether the capital account is closed or open . 
In this context , it is noteworthy that China , with a closed capital account , has foreign-exchange reserves of US $ 286 billion , four times the size of India &apos;s , though China &apos;s economy is only double India &apos;s size . 
Nor is full convertibility the key to attracting higher inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . 
China attracted FDI inflows of US $ 52.7 billion in 2002 - the largest in the world . 
India needs to attract higher FDI inflows to help soak up the economy &apos;s excess capacity . 
This underscores the importance for India &apos;s financial stability of successful management of the capital account ( monitoring inflows and outflows ) following any move toward full convertibility . 
But , in the near term , full capital account convertibility is not in India &apos;s interest .
