The Wars of the Chinese Succession 
What political reforms will Hu Jintao make in China ? 
That is the question to ask the 59-year old engineer who will take over as head of the world &apos;s biggest and longest-ruling communist party next month . 
While talk about the horse-trading surrounding Hu &apos;s accession to power - and President Jiang Zemin &apos;s seeming desire not to leave the stage - has dominated Chinese affairs since summer , more important to China &apos;s future is an appreciation of Mr. Hu &apos;s inheritance and what he will do with it . 
Hu Jintao &apos;s career does not inspire optimism . 
A 1998 Xinhua report quoted him as saying that &quot; A good leader should carry forward democracy . &quot; 
But Hu &apos;s idea of democracy doesn &apos;t appear to contain ideas about the direct election of top leaders or of guaranteed individual freedoms . 
According to Wu Jiaxiang , a former staffer on the Communist Central Committee secretariat who worked on political reforms before being jailed for three years after the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre , Hu believes in rule by elites chosen through a rigorous examination and approval process . 
In internal speeches , Hu identified the grooming of cadres and improved party operations as the keys to political reform . 
Those ideals were reflected in a new law governing cadres passed in July 2002 that Hu personally announced . 
This elitist model appeals to Chinese intellectuals who desire refined rulers . 
Hu wants nothing to do with increasing political participation or outside checks on communist party power . 
In various speeches , he warned against fiddling with the party &apos;s Leninist foundation . 
He advocates greater internal party democracy but rejects system-wide democracy . 
His top three aides in the Central Committee - Ling Jihua , Zheng Xinli , and He Yiting - are big advocates of &quot; cadre hearing &quot; reforms in which internal peer-review is used to evaluate government leaders . 
Hu &apos;s behavior confirms his conservatism . 
Hu sanctioned a military crackdown in Tibet in March 1989 , reversing a liberalizing policy introduced by former party General Secretary Hu Yaobang , and he was among the first provincial leaders to support the Tiananmen crackdown . 
Hu also holds strong anti-American views , even though his daughter is believed to carry a US passport . 
While the Central Party School that Hu has headed since 1993 is now more liberal and daring , Hu had little to do with that change , which was instigated by others and approved by Hu after seeking the advice of Jiang . 
The issue of meaningful reform is almost certain to surface early on Hu &apos;s watch . 
Forces are building inside the party , as evidenced by a stream of surveys , journal articles , and academic debates , that may lead to a split on the issue of reform in Hu &apos;s first term . 
Such a split happened in the 1986-89 period , contributing to party &apos;s initially confused reactions to the Tiananmen protests . 
Failure to move on the issue in his first five years may cause Hu to be supplanted , informally if not formally , by others willing to embrace change . 
So , how will Hu respond ? 
Will he , like Gorbachev , see the writing on the wall and lead the charge ? 
Or will he be pushed aside by others willing to modernize China &apos;s political system more aggressively ? 
Hu &apos;s key rivals are Li Ruihuan , the liberal former mayor of Tianjin who will take over China &apos;s parliament next March , and Zeng Qinghong , Jiang &apos;s closest aid who now heads the party &apos;s Organization Department . 
Li has called for an expansion of competitive direct elections up to the provincial level as well as for new press freedoms . 
Zeng sees movement towards a more pluralistic political system as critical so that the party can continue ruling as a grand coalition of the country &apos;s main groups . 
In internal speeches , Zeng has said that China could consider holding nationwide elections as long as they do not threaten national unity , ethnic cohesion , or social stability . 
Both Li and Zeng urge cadres to learn from America &apos;s democratic system . 
Zeng even maintains secretive but close ties to overseas pro-democracy groups and , some analysts believe , would reverse the official verdict on the 1989 Tiananmen protests and lift the ban on opposition parties and a free press if the opportunity were to arise . 
So the key question for political reform concerns which man gains the upper hand . 
Zeng is a master manipulator who , given the chance , would run circles around the cautious Hu . 
In alliance with Li , they would form a formidable force , one likely to enjoy high-level support from senior party elders like Wan Li , Qiao Shi , and Tian Jiyun . 
They would also likely enjoy the backing of the as yet unspecified leader of the &quot; fifth generation &quot; due to replace Hu in 2012 , someone likely to be a provincial-level leader with strong reform credentials . 
Within the wider party , a powerful constituency is growing that would support Li and Zeng if they seized the banner of reform while Hu dithered . 
Almost unnoticed by the outside world , the last four years in China have seen a remarkable outpouring of writings on political reform from across the political spectrum . 
Ideas vary , but in general there is agreement on faster political liberalization and more civic freedoms . 
Hu , then , may become a mere footnote in history , a bridge between the corrupt and divided state of Jiang Zemin and the democratizing leadership of Zeng Qinghong or some other reformer . 
Like Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko , who ruled the USSR between 1982 to 1985 , Hu may slip dimly into memory because he was unwilling to confront political reform head-on .
