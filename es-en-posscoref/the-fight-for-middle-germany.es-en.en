The Fight for Middle Germany 
BERLIN - Germany has made its choice . 
It voted the grand coalition out of office with a bang , consigning the Social Democrats to the political abyss . Only ruins remain of the once-proud Gerhard Schröder &apos;s SPD . 
Despite a clear win for the center-right , the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) did not escape unscathed . 
But while their losses were moderate , CDU &apos;s Bavarian sister-party , the CSU , experienced a debacle second only to the Social Democrats . 
So it looks like SPD hit rock bottom , CSU is in freefall , and CDU the worse for wear . 
The clear winners are Guido Westerwelle and his Liberal party , followed by the Left , and the Greens - all three of which got their highest vote count ever . 
But the reality is a bit more complicated . 
The clearest winner is Angela Merkel . 
The chancellor played for high stakes , seemingly against the odds , and hit the jackpot . 
Unlike her party , she is now stronger than ever . 
So will we see a new Merkel , a chancellor who , freed from the restraints of SPD in the governing coalition , will be more decisive , reformist , and willing to take political risks ? 
Don &apos;t bet on it . 
Merkel barely avoided political oblivion in the last general election , after the CDU had embraced market radicalism and then campaigned on it in 2005 . 
Her savior came in the unlikely form of the then Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , whose wild performance on election night handed her the chancellorship . 
To be sure , fortune and success are inseparable in politics . 
But Merkel hasn &apos;t tried to press her luck since then . 
On the contrary , she has unflinchingly steered the CDU towards the left , because she learned three things from the CDU &apos;s election defeat in 2002 and its narrow victory in 2005 : Germans don &apos;t want to go to war , don &apos;t think much of economic reform , and are mostly to the left of the CDU / CSU . 
Merkel could attempt this strategy because she knew that her right flank was covered by the FDP , which would attract voters dissatisfied with the CDU &apos;s leftward turn , but then join in a CDU-led coalition . 
At the same time , by moving to the left , Merkel ousted the SPD from the political center - where elections are won and lost in Germany - while still being able to form a workable majority in the new five-party system without risking new coalition constellations and fierce internal conflict . 
In other words , the secret of Merkel &apos;s election victory was to secure a majority for the center-right in order to pursue , more or less , a center-left policy agenda . 
A change of tack by Merkel now would merely reinvigorate the devastated SPD . 
To be sure , the &quot; black and yellow &quot; CDU-FDP coalition will make some policy corrections - slowing the nuclear phase-out , cosmetic changes to the tax system , etc . - in order not to disappoint parts of their constituency and economic supporters . 
But there will be no clear-cut change in policy direction . 
That said , governing will hardly be a cinch for Merkel . 
In the coming years , she will face the economic crisis , increasing unemployment , mounting public debt , and demographic challenges at home , as well as tough foreign-policy choices in Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan and the Middle East . 
Moreover , with the grand coalition gone , she will no longer be able to blame SDP &apos;s obstructionism for her inaction . 
Indeed , Merkel &apos;s room for maneuver will be reduced . 
Until now , Merkel had to deal with a weak or non-existent opposition . 
This will change very quickly , particularly given the possibility of NATO troop increases in Afghanistan . 
From now on , she will require a trait that she has lacked so far : leadership and decision-making skills . 
The victory of black and yellow has , moreover , defined the alternative : red , dark red , and green . 
The political camps of old - left and right - are back for the time being . 
If this situation prevails beyond 2013 , the SPD will face an unenviable challenge . 
It will have to manage a realignment that includes a possible coalition with the Left at the federal level , but without moving too far to the left in policy terms . 
The SPD , together with the Greens , will have to take the fight to the political center , which precludes competing with the Left for fringe voters . 
Moreover , the Left - a party that is descended from the former East Germany &apos;s ruling Communists and Social Democratic dissenters - will have to play ball by embracing political realism . 
The best way to achieve this is through the Left &apos;s participation in regional ( länder ) governments . 
But it is difficult to predict whether such a division of labor with the disenchanted former Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine will be possible . 
And the Greens ? 
Their part in such a constellation will be to represent middle-class and ecologically oriented voters . 
If , however , a scramble towards the left occurs within the left camp , the Greens would stand to lose , as would their most likely coalition partners .
