Governing a World Out of Order 
WASHINGTON , DC - Can we develop an international order that will keep the peace and allow countries to play by agreed rules ? 
That is the question that Henry Kissinger poses in his new book World Order . 
Unfortunately , it is the wrong question . 
Kissinger defines &quot; world order &quot; as a concept of just international arrangements that is &quot; thought to be applicable to the entire world . &quot; 
Before the advent of the European Union , for example , Europe conceived of world order as a balance of great powers , in which multiple religions and forms of government could coexist . 
As a civilization and a religion , Islam envisions the optimal world order very differently - as a caliphate , in which faith and government are united and peace prevails throughout the Dar al-Islam , or house of Islam . 
That is certainly not the belief of all Muslims or of the governments of Muslim-majority states , but the radicalism espoused by groups like the Islamic State seeks to spread not just codes of conduct but an entire worldview . 
In Kissinger &apos;s view , contending conceptions of world order are emerging not only in the Middle East , but also in Asia . 
China is currently playing by the international rules but is increasingly signaling that it expects to be treated as first among equals in the region ( as the US has long insisted with respect to its position in the Americas ) . 
But , as China grows stronger and reclaims what it believes to be its historic position in Asia and the world , how long will it wait to insist on reshaping the international rules ? 
Russia is openly breaking those rules and no longer bothering to justify itself under international law . 
Instead , it boasts of reclaiming territories once ruled by the Kremlin and threatens to use force to &quot; protect &quot; ethnic Russians from purported threats . 
When Russia annexed Crimea last March , Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations pointed out the marked difference in the way it handled its invasion of Georgia in 2008 . 
The Russian government essentially provoked Georgia into attacking first and then crafted an elaborate justification aimed at rendering its actions compatible with international law . 
But this time , Kadri wrote , &quot; Moscow has challenged the whole post-Cold War European order , together with its system of rules . &quot; 
Kissinger &apos;s hope is that these countries and rising powers like India and presumably Brazil ( he leaves Latin America out of his account of world orders ) will be able to forge agreement on a set of rules that all will regard as legitimate , thereby maintaining a stable global balance of power . 
The Westphalian principle of multiplicity will be critical , he believes , as it will be necessary to allow different countries and civilizations to operate on very different domestic principles . 
An effective world order for the twenty-first century , however , must do much more than keep the peace . 
Kissinger focuses on inter-state relations - on how , from one country &apos;s perspective , to avoid war with other countries while deterring them from aggression or other actions likely to upset a regional or global balance of power . 
Yet a glance at today &apos;s headlines suggests that what is most likely to kill and displace millions , if not hundreds of millions , of people in the coming decades are global threats such as pandemics , climate change , and terrorist and criminal networks - not inter-state war . 
Yes , Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine has led to more than 3,000 deaths . 
But current projections of the spread of the Ebola virus predict a million cases by January . 
According to the World Health Organization , the HIV / AIDS epidemic has killed 36 million people , roughly ten million higher than the estimated number of military deaths in World War II , with an additional 35 million people infected . 
Many of these global threats are closely intertwined with war , but war that is far more likely to be fought within borders than across them . 
Consider that roughly two-thirds of Syria &apos;s population has been displaced by the country &apos;s civil war , with millions living miserably in refugee camps . 
The disastrous state of health care in Liberia and Sierra Leone , where Ebola is raging , reflects decades of horrific civil war in both countries . 
The ongoing violence in Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region , which has claimed millions of civilian lives , is rooted in the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the resulting flood of Hutu refugees into neighboring states . 
The droughts and floods caused by climate change will put millions of people on the move , first into crowded and combustible cities , and then across borders . 
Russia and Canada may be happy to receive them as vast new tracts of land open up , but many other parts of the world are already crowded , which spells conflict . 
Maintaining peace is mostly a matter of restraint or constraint . 
Effective global cooperation requires much more . 
Governments must be able to come together , alongside vital actors from both business and civil society , to adopt comprehensive plans of action . 
Those plans , in turn , require funding , manpower , collective will , and enforcement capability . 
Yet today , faced with a virus that kills half of those it infects and the prospect that it could decimate an entire region of Africa , disrupt air travel , and put people around the world in quarantine , the world has delivered only a fraction of the needed financial and material assistance . 
We live in a world of global problems and largely national solutions . 
The need for institutions that can respond swiftly and effectively , as domestic government does in well-governed states , is greater than ever . 
The post-WWII institutions have become insufficient . 
It is time to reform them - and to devise new structures and tools designed to address global problems .
