Germany &apos;s Four Neins 
BERLIN - Germany &apos;s stance toward Europe has become one of rejection and disengagement . 
Its policymakers deny the eurozone &apos;s crisis-ridden countries a more active fiscal policy ; refuse to support a European investment agenda to generate demand and growth ; have declared a fiscal surplus , rather than faster potential growth , as their primary domestic goal ; and have begun turning against the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in the struggle against deflation and a credit crunch . 
On all four counts , Germany is wrong . 
To be sure , Germany is justified in rejecting narrow-minded calls by France and Italy for unconditional fiscal expansion . 
After all , fiscal stimulus can work only if it supports private investment and is accompanied by much more ambitious structural reforms - the kind of reforms that France and Italy are currently resisting . 
But Germany has all of the leverage it needs to implement the stability-oriented reforms that it wants for Europe . 
For starters , Germany , together with the European Commission , can compel France to pursue deeper reforms in exchange for more time to consolidate its deficit . 
Germany cannot , however , indulge its obsession with supply-side reforms without also pursuing growth-enhancing policies . 
As Germany knows from its own experience in the early 2000s , the benefits of supply-side reforms - namely , improved competitiveness and higher long-term growth rates - take a long time to emerge . 
Time is a luxury that Europe does not have . 
With every month that the economy loses productive capacity , the likelihood of stagnation and deflation rises . 
The key to ending the European crisis is a stimulus plan that addresses deficiencies on both the supply and demand sides . 
That is why Germany &apos;s refusal to help find a way to finance the proposed European investment agenda - which , for a limited time , would fund productive private investment - is a mistake . 
Equally problematic is Germany &apos;s focus on maintaining a fiscal surplus . 
With projections for German GDP growth this year and next revised downward by more than 0.6 percentage points in the last few months , the government could be forced to initiate a pro-cyclical fiscal policy to achieve its goal , inducing even lower growth at home and throughout the eurozone . 
Given that the German economy &apos;s output gap remains negative , the government should be implementing expansionary fiscal policy that targets the country &apos;s infrastructure weaknesses . 
In this sense , Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble &apos;s plan to spend an additional € 10 billion ( $ 12.5 billion ) on public investment in 2016-2018 is a step in the right direction . 
But , at just 0.1 % of Germany &apos;s annual GDP , Schäuble &apos;s scheme looks more like an attempt to quiet criticism from the rest of Europe than a genuine policy shift . 
Germany &apos;s fourth policy mistake is its apparent withdrawal of support for the ECB . 
Over the last seven years , the ECB &apos;s actions have helped Germany &apos;s economy and taxpayers as much as those of its neighbors . 
Moreover , the claim that the ECB &apos;s purchases of asset-backed securities amount to &quot; toxic loans &quot; that transfer risk to German taxpayers is unfounded ; after all , there have been almost no defaults since 2008 . 
Germany &apos;s leaders need to recognize this - and to defend the ECB publicly from baseless fear mongering . 
Failure to do so may reflect an effort to forestall the rise of the far-right anti-European political forces , particularly the Alternative for Germany . 
But this strategy merely plays into the party &apos;s hands . 
If Germany refuses to take a more reasoned approach , it risks undermining the ECB &apos;s credibility , thereby reducing the effectiveness of its measures . 
If that happens , the ECB may well be compelled to initiate large-scale purchases of eurozone government bonds through its so-called &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; scheme - a plan that many German policymakers and economists staunchly oppose . 
The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need , while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone . 
And it has the authority to bolster the ECB &apos;s credibility and thus its efforts to ensure future price stability and prevent financial contagion . 
Europe needs a grand bargain , involving close coordination on structural reforms and fiscal and monetary policy . 
Germany &apos;s relative economic and political stability , far from enabling it to disengage from such efforts , makes it among the most important protagonists in their development and implementation . 
The question is whether Germany &apos;s leaders will recognize this before Europe &apos;s economy falls into an even deeper slump .
