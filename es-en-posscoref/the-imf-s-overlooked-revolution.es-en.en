The IMF &apos;s Overlooked Revolution 
Mexico City - As the turmoil swirling through global financial markets continues , there is a growing realization that global economic problems require global solutions and improved global governance . 
This March , amid the latest financial twists and turns , a significant achievement in this regard went largely unnoticed : an agreement by the executive board of the International Monetary Fund on a new quota formula and increases in quotas for under-represented members , particularly emerging-market and developing countries . 
With that move , the IMF gave these countries a stronger voice in the main international organization charged with ensuring financial stability - and thus in the global economy itself . 
The decision , taken after nearly two years of highly technical and sometimes arcane negotiations , involved a set of measures that change the way quotas ( which determine voting power in the IMF ) are distributed . 
Of course , at the end of the day , the total shift in voting power from developed to developing countries was only about 2.7 % . 
So why is it important ? 
Speaking as someone who has witnessed this process as an insider ( as a former member of the IMF &apos;s executive board ) and an outsider ( in my current capacity as Mexico &apos;s finance minister ) , I see three main points that merit attention . 
First , a large number of countries - 54 , to be exact - will see their representation in the IMF increase . 
Korea &apos;s quota share , for example , will increase by 106 % , and that of China and Turkey will double . 
Brazil , India , and Mexico will gain a 40 % increase . 
This is an important signal that the enhanced role of dynamic emerging countries in the global economy has at long last begun to be recognized . 
At the same time , the participation of small countries , many of them poorer nations , is not being overlooked : the IMF agreement calls for a tripling of so-called &quot; basic votes , &quot; which ensures that these countries &quot; voices will be better heard . 
Second , the quota deal is just the beginning , for it recognizes that countries &quot; representation will need to adjust to changes in the global economy further down the road . 
The agreement provides that realignments of quotas and voting shares will take place every five years , which will result in a further increase in the share of under-represented countries . 
So , unlike many past international agreements , this one is dynamic , not static . 
Finally this agreement is notable for the spirit of compromise by which it was reached . 
Several developed countries , including Germany , Ireland , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , and the United States agreed to forego part of the quota increase for which they were eligible . 
At the same time , a longstanding wish of developing countries - to use purchasing power parity exchange rates as a criterion for calculating quotas - was met . 
To be sure , no country got everything it wanted ; but every country got a stronger , more globally representative institution . 
Critics have argued that the agreement does not go far enough in terms of reflecting the new realities of the global economy . 
The new head of the IMF , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , has acknowledged this , describing the agreement as a &quot; major step &quot; but also a &quot; first step . &quot; 
He is right : it is both . 
Of course , it is easy to imagine a quota reform that would lead to more ambitious results , but it would be difficult to have it approved . 
I know from my time at the IMF , as well as from many years working in international circles , how difficult it is to achieve any kind of change in our multilateral institutions - especially , as is true of some elements of this agreement , the first such change in 63 years . 
The most difficult thing is to start . 
In fact , I believe that this agreement provides an appropriate example for other multilateral institutions , such as the World Bank , that need to begin their own process of reform aimed at giving emerging and developing countries greater voice and representation . 
For that reason , above all , the IMF &apos;s new agreement should be given its due .
