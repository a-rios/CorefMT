Grandmasters and Global Growth 
CAMBRIDGE - As the global economy limps out of the last decade and enters a new one in 2010 , what will be the next big driver of global growth ? 
Here &apos;s betting that the &quot; teens &quot; is a decade in which artificial intelligence hits escape velocity , and starts to have an economic impact on par with the emergence of India and China . 
Admittedly , my perspective is heavily colored by events in the world of chess , a game I once played at a professional level and still follow from a distance . 
Though special , computer chess nevertheless offers both a window into silicon evolution and a barometer of how people might adapt to it . 
A little bit of history might help . 
In 1996 and 1997 , World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov played a pair of matches against an IBM computer named &quot; Deep Blue . &quot; 
At the time , Kasparov dominated world chess , in the same way that Tiger Woods - at least until recently - has dominated golf . 
In the 1996 match , Deep Blue stunned the champion by beating him in the first game . 
But Kasparov quickly adjusted to exploit the computer &apos;s weakness in long-term strategic planning , where his judgment and intuition seemed to trump the computer &apos;s mechanical counting . 
Unfortunately , the supremely confident Kasparov did not take Deep Blue seriously enough in the 1997 rematch . 
Deep Blue shocked the champion , winning the match 3.5 to 2.5 . 
Many commentators have labeled Deep Blue &apos;s triumph one of the most important events of the twentieth century . 
Perhaps Kasparov would have won the rematch had it continued to a full 24 games ( then the standard length of world championship matches ) . 
But , over the next few years , even as humans learned from computers , computers improved at a far faster pace . 
With ever more powerful processors , silicon chess players developed the ability to calculate so far ahead that the distinction between short-term tactical calculations and long-term strategic planning became blurred . 
At the same time , computer programs began to exploit huge databases of games between grandmaster ( the highest title in chess ) , using results from the human games to extrapolate what moves have the highest chances of success . 
Soon , it became clear that even the best human chess players would have little chance to do better than an occasional draw . 
Today , chess programs have become so good that even grandmasters sometimes struggle to understand the logic behind some of their moves . 
In chess magazines , one often sees comments from top players such as &quot; My silicon friend says I should have moved my King instead of my Queen , but I still think I played the best &quot; human &quot; move . &quot; 
It gets worse . 
Many commercially available computer programs can be set to mimic the styles of top grandmasters to an extent that is almost uncanny . 
Indeed , chess programs now come very close to passing the late British mathematician Alan Turing &apos;s ultimate test of artificial intelligence : can a human conversing with the machine tell it is not human ? 
I sure can &apos;t . 
Ironically , as computer-aided cheating increasingly pervades chess tournaments ( with accusations reaching the highest levels ) , the main detection device requires using another computer . 
Only a machine can consistently tell what another computer would do in a given position . 
Perhaps if Turing were alive today , he would define artificial intelligence as the inability of a computer to tell whether another machine is human ! 
So has all this put chess players out of work ? 
Encouragingly , the answer is &quot; not yet . &quot; 
In fact , in some ways , chess is as popular and successful today as at any point in the last few decades . Chess lends itself very well to Internet play , and fans can follow top-level tournaments in real time , often with commentary . 
Technology has helped thoroughly globalize chess , with the Indian Vishy Anand now the first Asian world champion , and the handsome young Norwegian Magnus Carlsen having reached rock-star status . 
Man and machine have learned to co-exist , for now . 
Of course , this is a microcosm of the larger changes that we can expect . 
The horrible computerized telephone-answering systems that we all now suffer with might actually improve . 
Imagine , someday you might actually prefer digital to human operators . 
In 50 years , computers might be doing everything from driving taxis to performing routine surgery . 
Sooner than that , artificial intelligence will transform higher learning , potentially making a world-class university education broadly affordable even in poor developing countries . 
And , of course , there are more mundane but crucial uses of artificial intelligence everywhere , from managing the electronics and lighting in our homes to populating &quot; smart grids &quot; for water and electricity , helping monitor these and other systems to reduce waste . 
In short , I do not share the view of many that , after the Internet and the personal computer , it will be a long wait until the next paradigm-shifting innovation . 
Artificial intelligence will provide the boost that keeps the teens rolling . 
So , despite a rough start from the financial crisis ( which will still slow global growth this year and next ) , there is no reason why the new decade has to be an economic flop . 
Barring another round of deep financial crises , it won &apos;t be - as long as politicians do not stand in the way of the new paradigm of trade , technology , and artificial intelligence .
