The Democratic Merits of Selective Schools 
SANTIAGO - Where do Latin American elites come from ? 
If the magical realist fiction once so popular in the United States and Europe is any guide , they belong to one of the 14 families ( yes , that is always the number ) that since colonial times have owned all arable land - along with everything else . 
But reality is more complicated than fiction . 
In most Latin American countries , the traditional ruling families learned long ago to share their place at the table with a different kind of elite : the urban , professional , and educated graduates of the region &apos;s top public schools and universities . 
In Chile , however , that may be about to change . 
Chile &apos;s Instituto Nacional , a fiercely competitive secondary school for boys , is as old as the Republic itself . 
With no fees and an entrance system based entirely on merit , students from middle- and working-class families comprise the vast majority of the student body . 
In last year &apos;s college entrance examinations , 22 Institute students were nationally ranked - far more than the nine who studied at the second most successful institution , an expensive private Catholic school run by the Church &apos;s conservative Opus Dei organization . 
The Instituto and its counterpart for young women , Liceo 1 , have educated 18 Chilean Presidents and four of the last seven , including the incumbent , Michelle Bachelet . 
Chile is far from unique in this respect . 
From Colegio Nacional in Buenos Aires to Stuyvesant High School in New York City , institutions that are public , meritocratic , and free have long and distinguished records of achievement across the Americas . 
One might expect that such schools would make a progressive leader like Bachelet proud - not least because she herself attended one . 
Yet she has proposed a plan , recently approved by the Chilean Congress , that will upend the system , allowing the Instituto Nacional and two dozen other highly competitive public schools across Chile to select only 30 % of their students through entrance exams , with the rest chosen by lottery . 
The affected schools &quot; students , teachers , and alumni are predictably upset . 
Why would anyone wish to weaken public schools in the name of equality ? 
Backers of the reform make two arguments - neither of which is convincing . 
The first argument is that these schools &quot; achievements seem greater than they are . 
By selecting only the strongest students , critics claim , they ensure strong results , without having to add a lot of value . 
This is a textbook &quot; endogeneity &quot; problem : Do the students excel because of the quality of the school , or does the school gain strong results because of the quality of the students ? 
To answer this question , a recent paper compared standardized-test performance by students who barely missed gaining admission to the Instituto to that of enrolled Instituto students . 
It turned out that the performance gap between the two groups grew , and the difference was statistically significant . 
In short , there is reason to believe that elite public schools like Instituto Nacional do make a difference for their students . 
In fact , the critics who helped to craft the reform recognize this . 
They argue that the performance advantage is precisely why the doors of such schools should be open to all , without entrance exams . 
The proposal has a nice egalitarian ring to it ; but it is far from clear that these schools and their teachers , however skillful , can have such a significant impact on a randomly selected group of students . 
The challenge is particularly great for schools with a special focus , such as sports , music , science , or the visual arts . 
After all , not just any pair of legs will allow you to play soccer like Lionel Messi , and not just any set of vocal cords will allow you to sing like Maria Callas . 
The Bronx High School of Science in New York City takes children of immigrants and molds them into some of the world &apos;s leading scientists . 
Not even the school &apos;s most enthusiastic boosters - of which there are many - could argue with any certainty that it could produce such impressive results if it could not select its own students . 
Latin America tried this experiment once already , with many public colleges attempting to deflect accusations of elitism by eliminating entrance examinations and tuition fees in the 1960s . 
In a region where a university degree had , until then , represented a ticket to the good life , enrollment predictably swelled . 
But , in many places , the experiment was short-lived . 
Institutions like the University of Chile and Brazil &apos;s University of SÃ£o Paulo resumed their highly competitive admissions processes . 
Those that did not , such as the University of Buenos Aires , saw their role in shaping their countries &quot; academic , business , and political elites diminish . 
In that last sentence , underline the word &quot; political . &quot; 
Indeed , the strongest argument for maintaining elite public schools , with their merit-based admissions policies , is political . 
In countries where traditional wealthy elites have long wielded power , an alternative elite drawn from the middle classes and educated under republican values is politically invaluable . 
It is no coincidence that many of Chile &apos;s democratic reformers of the last two centuries were once students at the Instituto Nacional . 
In last year &apos;s Chilean college entrance exam , the second-place school was not the only expensive Catholic institution with a largely upper-class student body to perform well ; the rest of the top-ten schools also fit this description . 
Opus Dei runs most - though not all - of them . 
The dominance of such conservative , elitist institutions is why schools like the Instituto Nacional are so important . 
Yet once the effects of Bachelet &apos;s recent reform kick in , their graduates may no longer be at the top of the ranks . 
As the elite public schools suffer , so will Chilean democracy .
