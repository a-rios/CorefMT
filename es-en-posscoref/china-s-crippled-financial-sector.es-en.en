China &apos;s Crippled Financial Sector 
BEIJING - Even in the best of times , it is difficult for China &apos;s small and medium-size enterprises to get bank loans . 
But with the current regimen of credit austerity , imposed to contain economic overheating and inflationary pressure , making conditions for SMEs worse , the financial sector - the least reformed sector in China - now is suffocating the beating heart of the country &apos;s economic dynamism . 
In normal times , the informal financial market helps SMEs to get by ; but the recent woes of Wenzhou , a city in southern Zhejiang province renowned for its freewheeling private economy , have shown that the informal financial market can be very volatile and undependable . 
Several major lenders absconded with large amounts of deposits , and defaults by ordinary companies have become a serious concern . 
Things have gotten so bad as to warrant a visit by Premier Wen Jiabao . 
China &apos;s official foreign reserves are increasing at a rate of about $ 1 billion per business day , almost all of which is used to buy US Treasury bonds and other international assets that carry a minimal rate of return . 
At the same time , about 40 % of China &apos;s bank savings are not lent out . 
One might thus think that returns to capital are low in China . 
Why then , can &apos;t China &apos;s SMEs rely on the formal financial sector to finance their daily operations ? 
To be sure , it is not easy for SMEs in other countries to get formal financing . 
But not many countries are experiencing the same level of difficulties ; surveys consistently show that only about 10 % of Chinese SMEs &quot; finance comes from banks , while the global average doubles . 
Moreover , none of these countries has a capital surplus of China &apos;s magnitude . 
The main impediment in China is local governments , which compete with SMEs for bank loans and inevitably crowd them out from the formal banking sector . 
Local governments rely on bank credit to invest in infrastructure and real-estate development . 
A report released early this year by the People &apos;s Bank of China showed that close to one-third of the country &apos;s total outstanding loans , or 14 trillion renminbi ( $ 2.2 trillion ) , were owed by local governments . 
In the last few years , 30-40 % of bank credits went to government infrastructure projects . 
Another impediment is the dominance of large banks . 
The four largest banks in China account for 60 % of the country &apos;s total bank lending . 
While the US banking sector is similarly concentrated , it has far more financial institutions - roughly 18,000 commercial banks , savings and locals associations , mutual savings banks , and credit unions , compared to only around 400 commercial banks and 3,000 rural credit unions and township banks in China . 
This means that banks in China on average are larger than in the US , especially in view of the difference in the size of the two countries &quot; GDP . 
Large banks tend to lend to large companies in order to save costs . 
This bias is mitigated in advanced economies by various flexible financing tools offered by large banks . 
For example , a small business with a decent credit history can borrow large amounts with a major credit card . 
In the end , it is the crippled financial system that is driving the wedge between China &apos;s large surplus of capital and formal financing for the country &apos;s SMEs . 
Indeed , in some parts of southern China , the informal financial sector is growing to match the size of the formal financial sector . 
From depositors &quot; point of view , participating in the informal sector is a rational choice . 
Bank interest rates on savings are lower than the inflation rate - and many multiples lower than the rates promised by the informal sector . 
Default rates in the informal sector are high , and lenders may disappear with depositors &quot; money , as happened in Wenzhou . 
But , despite these risks , investing in the informal market can still be a better choice than keeping one &apos;s money in the bank . 
The record of the last 20 years shows that the Chinese monetary and banking authorities have a habit of taking an ostrich approach to the informal financial sector , pretending that they are regulating the sector until serious problems emerge . 
This approach cannot last forever , and changing it means acknowledging the backwardness of the formal financial sector and taking remedial action . 
An immediate step that the authorities should take , as many economists have argued for years , is to allow the saving rate to reflect the cost of investment . 
That way , ordinary depositors would put their savings back into banks , because the formal financial sector would offer them a way to tap into the benefits offered by China &apos;s phenomenal growth . 
With more deposits at their disposure and a more flexible interest rate policy , banks would be able to price risks more easily and thus lend more to SMEs .
