Sarkozy &apos;s Moment 
LONDON - A little more than three years ago , just as the financial crisis was getting into full swing , I published a guide to the international system of financial regulation , Global Financial Regulation : The Essential Guide . 
After all that has happened in the intervening years to demonstrate the dangers inherent in these flaws , and a plethora of summits and conferences , a 2008 guide to financial regulation ought now to be hopelessly out of date . 
Unfortunately , it is not . 
True , some things have changed for the better . 
At the apex of the pyramid , the G-7 was obliged to give way to the broader G-20 , bringing countries like China and India into the decision-making nexus as full partners . 
G-20 summits are more cumbersome as a result , but that simply reflects the reality of the ongoing shift in economic power from West to East . 
There is no point in pretending that this shift is not happening , or that standards set in New York and London will be slavishly followed in Mumbai and Beijing if China and India are not involved in the process . 
So the increased importance of the G-20 should be welcomed . 
There has been one other important change , too . 
The Financial Stability Forum , created after the Asian financial crisis as an informal coordinating body - the United States resisted anything stronger - was renamed the Financial Stability Board . 
A &quot; board &quot; sounds more impressive , authoritative , and permanent than a mere &quot; forum . &quot; 
In the arcane world of international financial diplomacy , these subtle shifts in terminology matter . 
But the change in name should not blind us to the fact that the FSB has no more power than the FSF had . 
Successive G-20 summits have asked its chairman , Mario Draghi ( now a favorite to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank ) , for updates on progress in reforming regulation , but the FSB has no authority over the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , or any of the other standard setters . 
It cannot instruct them to change their rules . 
Nor can it achieve consistency between different standard setters &quot; approaches , or , indeed , consistency of implementation by different national regulators . 
Yet consistent implementation is crucial to avoiding another regulatory &quot; race to the bottom . &quot; 
There are already dangerous signs that global firms are moving activities into more congenial jurisdictions in order to avoid tighter regulation in the major financial centers . 
The G-20 should fill that gap urgently . 
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , which chairs the G-20 this year , has asked for a review of the governance of the financial system . 
In response , the existing bodies are vigorously defending their autonomy , resisting any attempts to impose on them a modicum of coordination and discipline . 
The International Monetary Fund , for example , has always resented the FSB , arguing that the Fund itself should be the monitor of systemic risk - and thus serve as the de facto global financial regulator . 
The IMF is too political a body to act as the systemic-risk watchdog . 
The next G-20 summit should implement a fundamental reform of the FSB . 
It should give the FSB a legal personality , enshrined in an international treaty . 
Currently , the Board has no formal status and only a small , though high-quality , permanent staff , hosted by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel . 
Draghi &apos;s successor as chairman should be a full-time appointee , and the FSB should be given powers to direct the other standard setters , review the implementation of standards by individual countries , and publish the results . 
It would be unrealistic to think that the FSB could direct countries to strengthen their regulation , but it should have some form of arbitration power analogous to that held by the World Trade Organization . 
So , if a country is thought to be operating a lax regime to attract mobile international business , the FSB could expose that behavior and publish its conclusions . 
The anomaly that countries have decided to endow an international body with powers to regulate disputes in trading goods , but not in financial transactions , should be corrected . 
There is a strong argument for going further , and subsuming the standard setters - the Basel Committee , the International Organization of Securities Commissions , the International Association of Insurance Supervisors , etc . - in a single body . 
They could be co-located in a regulatory Tower of Babel in Basel . 
That might happen one day , as the borderlines between different sub-sectors of the financial system become more blurred . 
Even so , as the saying goes , it is important not to waste a good crisis . 
Sarkozy has a golden opportunity to put his mark on the global financial system . 
Surely a French president , eager for global success with a domestic election looming , will not pass up his chance ? 
Indeed , Sarkozy has an additional incentive , given that he would be scoring a point against the IMF , led by Dominique Strauss-Kahn , his likely Socialist opponent in the next presidential election . 
So , for once , logic and personal political motivation are pushing in the same direction . 
That ought to be a winning combination .
