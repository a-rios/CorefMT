The Next Chinese Economy 
BEIJING - After more than 30 years of extraordinary growth , the Chinese economy is shifting onto a more conventional development path - and a difficult rebalancing is underway , affecting nearly every aspect of the economy . 
For starters , China &apos;s current-account surplus has shrunk from its 2007 peak of 10 % of GDP to just over 2 % last year - its lowest level in nine years . 
In the third quarter of 2014 , China &apos;s external surplus stood at $ 81.5 billion and its capital and financial account deficits amounted to $ 81.6 billion , reflecting a more stable balance of payments . 
This shift can partly be explained by the fact that , over the last two years , developed countries have been pursuing re-industrialization to boost their trade competitiveness . 
In the United States , for example , manufacturing grew at an annual rate of 4.3 % , on average , in 2011-2012 , and growth in durable-goods manufacturing reached 8 % - having risen from 4.1 % and 5.7 % , respectively , in 2002 and 2007 . 
Indeed , America &apos;s manufacturing industry has helped to drive its macroeconomic recovery . 
Meanwhile , as China &apos;s wage costs rise , its labor-intensive manufacturing industries are facing increasingly intense competition , with the likes of India , Mexico , Vietnam , and some Eastern European economies acting as new , more cost-effective bases for industrial transfer from developed countries . 
As a result , the recovery in the advanced economies is not returning Chinese export demand to pre-crisis levels . 
These trends - together with the continued appreciation of the renminbi - have contributed to the decline of Chinese goods &quot; market share in developed countries . 
Indeed , Chinese exports have lost some 2.3 % of market share in the developed world since 2013 , and about 2 % in the US since 2011 . 
Incipient trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership , the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , and the Plurilateral Services Agreement will accelerate this process further , as they eliminate tariffs among certain countries and implement labor and environmental criteria . 
Add to that furtive protectionism , in the form of state assistance and government procurement , and Chinese exports are facing serious challenges . 
China is also undergoing an internal rebalancing of investment and consumption . 
As it stands , declining growth in fixed-asset investment - from 33 % in 2009 to 16 % this year - is placing significant downward pressure on output growth . 
Investment &apos;s contribution to GDP growth fell from 8.1 percentage points in 2009 to 4.2 last year . 
One reason for the decline is that China has yet to absorb the production capacity created by large-scale investment in 2010-2011 . 
Aside from traditional industries like steel , non-ferrous metals , construction materials , chemical engineering , and shipbuilding , excess capacity is now affecting emerging industries like wind power , photovoltaics , and carbon fiber , with many using less than 75 % of their production capacity . 
But the decline in investment is also directly correlated with that of capital formation . 
In 1996-2012 , China &apos;s average incremental capital-output ratio - the marginal capital investment needed to increase overall output by one unit - was a relatively high 3.9 , meaning that capital investment in China was less efficient than in developing countries experiencing similar levels of growth . 
Moreover , the cyclical increase in financing rates and factor costs has brought a gradual restoration of the price scissors of industrial and agricultural goods . 
As a result , industrial firms &quot; profits are likely to continue to fall , making it difficult to sustain high investment . 
Meanwhile , the expansion of China &apos;s middle class is having a major impact on consumption . 
Last year , China surpassed Japan to become the second-largest consumer market in the world , after the US . 
To be sure , Chinese imports remain focused on intermediate goods , with imports of raw materials like iron ore having surged over the last decade . 
But , in the last few years , the share of imported consumption goods and mixed-use ( consumption and investment ) finished products , such as automobiles and computers , has increased considerably . 
The final piece of China &apos;s rebalancing puzzle is technology . 
As it stands , a lag in technological adoption and innovation is contributing to the growing divide between China and the Western developed countries , stifling economic transformation and upgrading , and hampering China &apos;s ability to move up global value chains . 
But , as China &apos;s per capita income increases , its consumer market matures , and its industrial structure is transformed , demand for capital equipment and commercial services will increase considerably . 
Indeed , over the next decade , China &apos;s high-tech market is expected to reach annual growth rates of 20-40 % . 
If the US loosens restrictions on exports to China and maintains its 18.3 % share of China &apos;s total imports , American exports of high-tech products to China stand to reach more than $ 60 billion over this period . 
This would accelerate industrial upgrading and innovation in China , while improving global technological transmission and expanding related investment in developed countries . 
China &apos;s economy may be decelerating , but its prospects remain strong . 
Its GDP may have reached $ 10 trillion in 2014 . 
Once it weathers the current rebalancing , it could well be stronger than ever .
