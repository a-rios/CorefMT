Small Economies , Big Problems , and Global Interdependence 
WASHINGTON , DC - Greece &apos;s GDP , at about $ 300 billion , represents approximately 0.5 % of world output . 
Its $ 470 billion public debt is very large relative to the Greek economy &apos;s size , but less than 1 % of global debt - and less than half is held by private banks ( mainly Greek ) . 
Barclays Capital estimates that only a few globally significant foreign banks hold close to 10 % of their Tier 1 capital in Greek government bonds , with the majority holding much less . 
So , at least on paper , Greece should not be a systemically important economy . 
Yet there are several reasons why the Greek crisis is having substantial spillover effects . 
Moreover , Greece is not alone in this respect . 
First , in the Greek case , there is the fear of contagion to other distressed European economies , such as Portugal and Ireland , or even Spain and Italy . 
There are also substantial investments by American money-market funds in instruments issued by some of the exposed banks . 
Then there are various derivatives , such as credit-default swaps , through which banks holding Greek debt have insured themselves against non-payment . 
If CDSs are concentrated in particular financial institutions , these institutions could be at risk - more so than the primary purchasers of Greek debt themselves . 
But no one knows who is holding how much of these derivatives , or whether they reduce or magnify the risk , because CDSs are not transparently traded on open exchanges . 
Finally , Greece &apos;s difficulties imply problems for managing the euro , as well as possible disorderly behavior in foreign-exchange markets , which threaten to augment uncertainty and negatively influence the already-weakening global recovery . 
Clearly , the world economy has a large stake in Greece &apos;s recovery . 
In the same vein , consider a completely different case , that of Yemen . 
Greece and Yemen have no relevant similarities , except the contrast between their size and possible spillover effects . 
Yemen &apos;s GDP is only 10 % the size of Greece &apos;s , representing 0.05 % of global output , and its economy is not significantly linked to the international financial system . 
But Yemen &apos;s population is close to that of Saudi Arabia , and its border is very hard to control . 
Chaos in Yemen , coupled with the growing strength of extremists , could seriously destabilize Saudi Arabia and threaten oil production . 
In that case , the price of oil could shoot up to $ 150 a barrel or more , dealing a heavy blow to the global economy . 
One can find other examples of this kind . 
Recall that the 1997 Asian crisis started in Thailand - again , not a large economy . 
The strong trade , financial , and natural-resource-related interconnections that have developed in the world economy turn many otherwise small countries , or problems , into global systemic risks . 
The implications for global economic governance need to be understood and addressed . 
At the Seoul G-20 summit in November 2010 , the assembled leaders encouraged the International Monetary Fund to work with the Financial Stability Forum to develop an early-warning system for global financial risks , and to analyze spillover effects on &quot; large economies &quot; ( China , the United States , the United Kingdom , Japan , and the eurozone ) . 
The spillover reports are currently being discussed by the IMF &apos;s board . 
A synthetic report by the Fund &apos;s Managing Director is to be presented to the International Monetary and Financial Committee when officials from the IMF &apos;s member states meet in September . 
This step , if pursued seriously , would enable a deeper analysis of interdependence in the world economy . 
It could also increase the IMF &apos;s legitimacy as an institution that is global not only in its membership , but also in its treatment of different types of members . 
So long as the IMF &apos;s macroeconomic surveillance was in fact applied only to developing countries , with the G-7 and other rich countries evading a serious monitoring process , the Fund could not be perceived as fair and impartial . 
As these examples indicate , however , systemic importance is not just a question of size . 
What matters is the interconnections that link a particular country , institution , or group of institutions ( for example , Lehman Brothers and AIG ) to the wider world economy . 
Surveillance of systemic risk must proactively test and analyze these interconnections , and try to imagine the &quot; hard to imagine . &quot; 
After all , as we now know only too well , systemic risk can emerge in unexpected places . 
Interdependence has become much more complex than it was even a decade ago . 
The IMF needs to be empowered to analyze the macroeconomic and macro-financial risks that have emerged , establish an early-warning system , and propose possible preemptive policy measures . 
The Fund &apos;s almost universal membership and its staff &apos;s technical expertise should enable it to carry out effective multilateral surveillance , provided that it accelerates its own governance reforms , so that surveillance is perceived as being in everyone &apos;s interest .
