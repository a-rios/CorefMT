Development &apos;s Digital Divide 
STOCKHOLM - On September 25 , world leaders will gather in New York to adopt the new Sustainable Development Goals . 
The SDGs , comprising 17 goals and 169 related targets , are the result of extensive political negotiations , and will set the benchmarks over the next 15 years for achieving the international community &apos;s overarching objective : to &quot; end poverty in all its forms everywhere . &quot; 
The SDGs are noble and certainly ambitious . 
And yet , in a time of profound scientific and technological change , they remain remarkably conventional . 
Information technology - this century &apos;s defining social and economic development - receives only a brief mention ( in one of the sub-targets ) . 
Nowhere in the document is there even a hint of the revolutionary role that the nascent explosion in connectivity , information , and data could play in ending poverty . 
There can be no doubting the impact that information technology will have on economic growth . 
Governments , politicians , and international organizations must harness the potential of the Internet to serve global development and individual empowerment . 
Issues concerning security and governance have dominated discussions of cyber policy over the past few years . 
But it is also clear that the countries that will gain the most from the ongoing information revolution are those that manage to keep their eyes on the real prize : using this explosion in technology to strengthen their economies and improve the lives of their citizens . 
A 2009 study by the World Bank found that a 10 % increase in fixed broadband penetration boosts a developing economy &apos;s GDP by about 1.4 % . 
These findings likely vastly understate the impact of the technology ; after all , much of the developing world is seeing a rapid rollout of mobile broadband , with much higher capacity than what was available at the time of the study . 
The phenomenon is most evident in Asia and Africa - which together account for three-quarters of the global growth in smartphone use this year . 
As smartphone subscriptions increase from 2.9 billion to 7.7 billion worldwide in the next five years , 80 % of the new accounts are expected to be opened by users on these two continents . 
The widespread adoption of information technology in the developing world opens up myriad possibilities ; we are only at the beginning . 
Data analysis has been used to fight Ebola in West Africa , and mobile phone networks have been used to bring modern banking to unserved populations throughout the developing world . 
These new technologies empower people - most notably the rapidly growing youth population - and create new avenues for economic and social development . 
Indeed , mobile connectivity may turn out to be the most important development tool ever for the billions of people in emerging Africa and Asia . 
Of course , there will still be a digital divide . 
But , increasingly , it will be generational rather than geographical . 
Within a decade , the majority of young people in Africa will likely be as well connected as those in Europe or North America . 
This will change the world profoundly . 
The big question is whether governments are aware of the potential power of this development . 
If the SDGs are any indication , it is likely that they are not . 
The goals and targets that the world is about to embrace do not adequately reflect the significance of this epochal change . 
The absence of awareness is also reflected in the preparations for a high-level UN meeting on international policy concerning the Internet and development that will take place in December . 
The event , a review of the progress made since the 2005 World Summit on the Information Society , is the culmination of a three-year negotiation process . 
Unfortunately , political wrangling over issues of Internet governance and cybersecurity have dominated the preparations for the meeting , and there has been little discussion of the revolutionary possibilities that an open , dynamic , and free Internet can provide . 
Governments are being left behind as entrepreneurs and innovators race ahead . 
But maximizing the potential of the new technology requires the stable and predictable operating environment , as well as the support for basic research , that only governments can provide . 
It is time for world leaders to put the potential of the Internet at the top of the development agenda .
