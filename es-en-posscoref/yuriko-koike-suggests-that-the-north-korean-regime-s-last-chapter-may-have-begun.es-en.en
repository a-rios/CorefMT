The Pyongyang Purge 
TOKYO - During the Cold War , the term &quot; Kremlinology &quot; referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the Soviet Union - indeed , behind the entire Iron Curtain . 
Kremlinologists monitored ( in whatever way possible ) who was up and who was down among the core Soviet leadership . 
Great significance was read into who signed an official document , or who stood where atop Lenin &apos;s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades . 
All of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in North Korea , where the truth is far more opaque . 
Consider what happened on December 17 . 
Choe Ryong-hae , Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Korean Workers &quot; Party , was conspicuously present on stage at the commemoration of the second anniversary of &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il &apos;s death - the first major ceremony following the purge and execution of Jang Song-thaek , the former vice chairman of the National Defense Commission . 
Choe &apos;s speech , with its threats against the United States and South Korea , seemed to set the stage for his political elevation . 
Jang Song-thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to Kim Jong-un , the young successor to the Kim family dynasty , and was thought to be number two in the regime . 
But he owed his position to his wife , Kim Kyong-hui , the only sister of Kim Jong-il , Kim Jong-un &apos;s deceased father . 
Jang &apos;s tact , as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with China , enabled him to keep his position , despite his long-term separation from his wife . 
But in North Korea , blood is paramount : everything , including ideology and the national interest , is subservient to the maintenance of the Kim dynasty . 
The &quot; legacy &quot; of the &quot; Great Leader &quot; Kim Il-sung and his son , &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong-il , determines all major decisions . 
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il &apos;s death has been his sister , Kim Kyong-hui , and no one else . 
North Korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership , but it appears that she was the only family member whom Kim Jong-il could trust . 
When he was incapacitated by illness , it was she who called the shots . 
Her blood tie to the Kim dynasty is the reason why , even after her husband was purged and executed ( and the rest of his family rounded up ) , she maintained her political position . 
It has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband . 
Though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him , it is not surprising that she believed that , with her own health failing , she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband &apos;s care . 
Perhaps the most chilling aspect of Jang &apos;s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding frenzy that has claimed the lives of a number of senior officials and generals . 
And the bloodletting has been extremely personal : In August , Kim Jong-un reportedly ordered the execution by firing squad of an ex-girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble ; the killings are said to have been carried out in front of their families . 
Elsewhere in the communist world , such murderous purges were renounced long ago , first in the Soviet Union by Khrushchev , following his denunciation of Stalin , and then in China by Deng Xiaoping , following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970 &quot; s . 
This &quot; reform &quot; did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient , but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior . 
North Korea , always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states , remains in a twilight world . 
More disturbing is the question of whether China is going down a parallel path under President Xi Jinping . 
Ever since Deng &apos;s rule , there has been an understanding that members of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s Politburo are not to be touched , even in retirement . 
But Xi , under the pretext of his anti-corruption battle , has targeted retired Politburo member Zhou Yongkang , who is now reportedly under house arrest , facing graft charges - and lurid allegations not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to assassinate Xi . 
China &apos;s emphasis since Deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic , but it at least prevented the re-emergence of a new cult of personality Ã  la Mao Zedong . 
The question today is whether Xi &apos;s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re-creating one-man - and thus completely arbitrary - rule in China . 
In North Korea , of course , arbitrary rule - no matter how bizarre and inept - is always the norm . 
And now , with Jang purged , responsibility for economic failure in North Korea has been shifted to Choe . 
All officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner , for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems . 
And Jang &apos;s purge may make those problems worse . 
While China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime , North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself . 
The economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained , and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship . 
China , which has been the Kim dynasty &apos;s lifeline , no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check . 
So the day is fast approaching when Kim Jong-un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country &apos;s dire condition , and it may come soon after Kim Kyong-hui dies . 
If so , the Kim dynasty &apos;s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions , though the ending - for the Korean Peninsula and East Asia alike - remains very much in doubt .
