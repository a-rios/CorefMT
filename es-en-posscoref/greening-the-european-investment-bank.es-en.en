Greening the European Investment Bank 
BRUSSELS - Over the past four years , the European Investment Bank - the European Union &apos;s house bank - has loaned € 48 billion ( $ 62 billion ) to energy projects around the world . 
Indeed , the EIB lends more to the energy sector than to any other , except transport ( and its € 72 billion total loan portfolio in 2010 made it a bigger lender than the World Bank ) . 
Investment on this scale can help countries worldwide to make vital progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions at a time when political solutions based on international agreement remain elusive . 
Unfortunately , the EIB &apos;s lending priorities and energy-investment portfolio are making the problem worse . 
In 2007 , the EIB adopted its first energy policy - &quot; Clean Energy for Europe : A Reinforced EIB Contribution . &quot; 
Since then , the Bank has significantly increased its lending for renewable energy , which totaled € 13 billion in 2007-2010 . 
Yet , over the same period , the bank compromised this performance by lending € 16 billion ( $ 21 billion ) for fossil-fuels projects , one-third of the institution &apos;s total energy lending . 
Indeed , the EIB &apos;s fossil-fuel lending grew from € 2.8 billion in 2007 to € 5 billion in 2010 , including new coal units in Germany and Slovenia . 
In new EU member states , the EIB has supported mostly high-carbon energy , which traps these countries in unsustainable energy systems . 
The EIB also loaned North Africa and Syria € 1.6 billion for fossil fuels between 2007 and 2010 , which constituted 30 % of total lending to the region . 
Make no mistake : these are long-term investments . 
The energy infrastructure constructed today will be used for at least another 40 years , thereby tying countries to carbon-dependent paths . 
In Slovenia , for example , if the government implements EU-wide climate targets , the new EIB-financed Sostanj lignite unit will consume most of that country &apos;s CO2 emissions quota by 2050 . 
Meanwhile , the EIB invests only 5 % of its energy portfolio in energy-efficiency programs . 
The EIB argues that fossil-fuel lending supports strategic projects that safeguard European energy security . 
That is partly true : EU members &quot; political interests do drive some of this lending , particularly investments in oil and gas import infrastructure . 
The EU &apos;s goals therefore embody an inherent contradiction - energy security versus climate-change prevention - which makes it difficult for the EIB to clean up its energy portfolio . 
Yet a closer look shows that € 6.7 billion of the € 16 billion that the EIB loaned for fossil fuels went to coal , gas , and oil-fired plants , both inside and outside the EU - not to EU energy-security projects . 
These figures suggest that the EIB may simply find dirty energy projects more familiar , easier to access , and more profitable . 
But the EIB , which is both an investment bank and the EU &apos;s public bank , is uniquely placed to lead markets , and should not merely be following them . 
As a public bank , its financial operations are guaranteed by European taxpayers &quot; money , and its capital is immense . 
Moreover , it benefits from the information and know-how of EU institutions . 
If the EIB were to put its clout behind renewable energy and energy efficiency , it could help to reconcile energy security and the fight against climate change . 
And Europe could lead that fight if it fully exploited its renewable and energy-efficiency potential . 
The EIB must act more courageously to clean up its energy-lending portfolio . 
Coal investments must be stopped immediately , and a plan to phase out all fossil-fuel lending should be prepared and implemented as soon as possible . 
The capital from fossil-fuel investments could be redirected towards green projects instead . 
For regions such as Central and Eastern Europe , where the EIB argues that it is more difficult to find investment opportunities , the bank must develop targeted instruments and technical assistance that supports small-scale renewable-energy projects . 
It must also encourage governments to build flexible power grids . 
Weaning Europe from its addiction to fossil fuels will not be easy .
