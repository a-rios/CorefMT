Why Pay More ? 
PRINCETON - When Rados≈Çaw Sikorski , Poland &apos;s foreign minister , went to Ukraine for talks last month , his Ukrainian counterparts reportedly laughed at him because he was wearing a Japanese quartz watch that cost only $ 165 . 
A Ukrainian newspaper reported on the preferences of Ukrainian ministers , several of whom have watches that cost more than $ 30,000 . 
Even a Communist member of Ukraine &apos;s parliament , the Rada , was shown wearing a watch that retails for more than $ 6,000 . 
The laughter should have gone in the opposite direction . 
Wouldn &apos;t you laugh ( maybe in private , to avoid being impolite ) at someone who pays more than 200 times as much as you do , and ends up with an inferior product ? 
That is what the Ukrainians have done . 
They could have bought an accurate , lightweight , maintenance-free quartz watch that can run for five years , keeping virtually perfect time , without ever being moved or wound . 
Instead , they paid far more for clunkier watches that can lose minutes every month , and that will stop if you forget to wind them for a day or two ( if they have an automatic mechanism , they will stop if you don &apos;t move them ) . 
In addition , the quartz watches also have integrated alarm , stopwatch , and timer functions that the other watches either lack , or that serve only as a design-spoiling , hard-to-read effort to keep up with the competition . 
Why would any wise shopper accept such a bad bargain ? 
Out of nostalgia , perhaps ? 
A full-page ad for Patek Philippe has Thierry Stern , the president of the company , saying that he listens to the chime of every watch with a minute repeater that his company makes , as his father and grandfather did before him . 
That &apos;s all very nice , but since the days of Stern &apos;s grandfather , we have made progress in time-keeping . 
Why reject the improvements that human ingenuity has provided to us ? 
I have an old fountain pen that belonged to my grandmother ; it &apos;s a nice memento of her , but I wouldn &apos;t dream of using it to write this column . 
Thorstein Veblen knew the answer . 
In his classic The Theory of the Leisure Class , published in 1899 , he argued that once the basis of social status became wealth itself - rather than , say , wisdom , knowledge , moral integrity , or skill in battle - the rich needed to find ways of spending money that had no other objective than the display of wealth itself . 
He termed this &quot; conspicuous consumption . &quot; 
Veblen wrote as a social scientist , refraining from rendering moral judgments , though he left readers in little doubt about his attitude toward such expenditure in a time when many lived in poverty . 
Wearing a ridiculously expensive watch to proclaim that one has achieved an elevated social standing seems especially immoral for a public official in a country where a significant portion of the population still lives in real poverty . 
These officials are wearing on their wrists the equivalent of four or five years of an average Ukrainian &apos;s salary . 
That tells Ukrainian taxpayers either that they are paying their public servants too much , or that their public servants have other ways of getting money to buy watches that they would not be able to afford otherwise . 
The Chinese government knows what those &quot; other ways &quot; might be . 
As the International Herald Tribune reports , one aspect of the Chinese government &apos;s campaign against corruption is a clampdown on expensive gifts . 
As a result , according to Jon Cox , an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets , &quot; it &apos;s no longer acceptable to have a big chunky watch on your wrist . &quot; 
The Chinese market for expensive watches is in steep decline . 
Ukrainians , take note . 
Wearing a watch that costs 200 times more than one that does a better job of keeping time says something else , even when it is worn by people who are not governing a relatively poor country . 
Andrew Carnegie , the richest man of Veblen &apos;s era , was blunt in his moral judgments . 
&quot; The man who dies rich , &quot; he is often quoted as saying , &quot; dies disgraced . &quot; 
We can adapt that judgment to the man or woman who wears a $ 30,000 watch or buys similar luxury goods , like a $ 12,000 handbag . 
&quot; I am either extraordinarily ignorant , or just plain selfish . 
If I were not ignorant , I would know that children are dying from diarrhea or malaria , because they lack safe drinking water , or mosquito nets , and obviously what I have spent on this watch or handbag would have been enough to help several of them survive ; but I care so little about them that I would rather spend my money on something that I wear for ostentation alone . &quot; 
Of course , we all have our little indulgences . 
I am not arguing that every luxury is wrong . 
But to mock someone for having a sensible watch at a modest price puts pressure on others to join the quest for ever-greater extravagance . 
That pressure should be turned in the opposite direction , and we should celebrate those , like Sikorski , with modest tastes and higher priorities than conspicuous consumption .
