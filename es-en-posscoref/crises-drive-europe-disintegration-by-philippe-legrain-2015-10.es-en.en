The Disintegration of Europe 
LONDON - If a clear signal was needed that the European Union is falling apart at an alarming rate , Hungary &apos;s construction of razor-wire fences along the border with its fellow EU member Croatia is it . 
The crisis in the eurozone has , of course , fragmented financial flows , caused economies to diverge , eroded political support for EU institutions , and set Europeans against one another . 
Now , as governments erect barriers and reinstate border controls , the refugee crisis is disrupting flows of people and gumming up trade . 
And , as the EU unravels , the risk of Britain voting to leave is rising . 
It is often argued that the EU progresses through crises , because they focus minds on the overwhelming need for further integration . 
But such breakthroughs require at least four ingredients : a correct shared understanding of the problem , agreement on an effective way forward , willingness to pool more sovereignty , and political leaders able to drive change forward . 
All four are now lacking . 
EU leaders are weak , divided , and seemingly incapable of setting out a credible vision of the future benefits that European integration could provide , without which they cannot rally popular support and convince recalcitrant governments to bear their fair share of current costs . 
In the absence of an effective , common response , Europe &apos;s crises fester , feed on each other , and foment unilateralism . 
The eurozone and refugee crises have common features that make them tricky to resolve . 
Both involve disputes about sharing costs , complicated by a clash of values , at the center of which lies a newly dominant Germany . 
The EU is hopeless at burden sharing . 
Rather than agree on a fair division of costs , whether of the financial crisis or of welcoming refugees , governments try to minimize their obligations and shift them onto others - thereby increasing the collective costs . 
A banking crisis that could have been resolved through a fair and decisive restructuring of unsustainable debts has ballooned into a much greater economic and political crisis that pits creditors against debtors , both within and among countries . 
Likewise , EU rules stipulating that refugees should be granted asylum in the first member country they reach have proved both unworkable and unfair ; because asylum-seekers mostly arrive in southern Europe and want to head north , Greece and Italy ignore the rules and facilitate their passage . 
Transit countries such as Hungary try to divert refugees elsewhere . 
Resettling the almost 750,000 people who have sought asylum in the EU this year - still only 0.14 % of the EU population - has thus become an existential crisis . 
Part of the problem is blinkered decision-making . 
EU leaders focus narrowly on limiting short-term financial and political costs , rather than thinking strategically about broader longer-term consequences . 
Restructuring Greek debt in 2010 would have implied a financial hit for French and German banks ( and the governments that stood behind them ) , but a much smaller loss than that implied by the mushrooming costs of an enduring crisis . 
Likewise , whereas welcoming refugees requires an initial investment of public funds , it can pay dividends as soon as the newcomers start working . 
A graying continent needs dynamic young workers to do jobs that locals spurn ( or for which they lack the skills ) , pay for and care for the old , start businesses , and pursue spark new ideas that boost economic growth . 
The clash of values also impedes compromise . 
Germans insist that debtors have a moral obligation to pay what they owe and atone for their sinful profligacy . 
A Slovak prime minister who rejects refugees on the grounds that &quot; Slovakia is built for Slovaks , not for minorities &quot; is hard to buy off . 
Even though the EU &apos;s plan to resettle refugees would remove unwanted newcomers from Hungary , Viktor Orb√°n , the country &apos;s authoritarian and nationalist leader , objects to it in principle , accusing Germany of &quot; moral imperialism &quot; in trying to foist its generous attitude toward refugees on its neighbors . 
Until recently , German policymakers sought to atone for the country &apos;s Nazi past by seeking a more European Germany and bankrolling the EU , thus helping to smooth over many disputes . 
But , with Germany &apos;s position as creditor-in-chief having thrust it into the driver &apos;s seat , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s administration now seeks to create a more Germanic Europe . 
Germany refuses to accept that its beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies - reflected in its massive current-account surpluses - are both a cause of the eurozone crisis and a major impediment to resolving it . 
Instead , it bullies others to get its way , wrongly identifying its narrow interests as a creditor with those of the system as a whole . 
Merkel has played a much more positive role in the refugee crisis . 
Germany unilaterally suspended application of the EU &apos;s asylum rules and pledged to accept all arriving Syrian refugees . 
But Merkel &apos;s failure to offer those refugees safe passage has exacerbated the chaos . 
Subsequently reimposing border controls within the supposedly border-free Schengen Area set a terrible precedent , prompting Germany &apos;s neighbors to do likewise . 
Meanwhile , with the EU increasingly viewed as a source of economic crisis , political turmoil , and unwanted migrants , the risk that Britons will vote to leave in a referendum due before the end of 2017 is rising . 
Britain is already semi-detached - outside of Schengen and with opt-outs from the euro and many home-affairs matters ( including asylum policy ) . 
With the government now seeking to negotiate even looser membership terms , Britain will end up more estranged from the EU even if it remains a member . 
Polls are finely balanced and referendums unpredictable . 
At a time of anti-establishment rage and political upheaval , anti-EU campaigners can peddle three fantasies of a post-EU future : a free-market , foreigner-free , or socialist Utopia . 
The pro-EU camp , by contrast , has to sell the reality of the EU as it is , warts and all . 
Until recently , EU integration seemed inevitable . 
It might stall , but it would never go into reverse . 
Countries joined ; none left . 
But with the EU already crumbling , Brexit could turn that dynamic on its head . 
That is all the more reason to fix the EU before it is too late .
