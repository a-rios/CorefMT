Ransoming Israel &apos;s Chance for Peace 
MADRID - The exchange of prisoners between enemies is often a prelude to political reconciliation . 
Unfortunately , the recent exchange between Israel and Hamas , in which the Islamist organization gained the lion &apos;s share of more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , does not augur well for the chances of an Israeli-Palestinian peace . 
Contrary to appearances , the deal is not a reflection of both sides &quot; interest in beginning a political rapprochement that might lead to the end of the Gaza siege and other confidence-building measures . 
This exchange reveals quite the opposite - that both parties are committed to their core values of resistance and confrontation . 
For Israel , recovering Shalit was its way to uphold an ethos of unity in times of war , and to fulfill the army &apos;s promise to its conscripts ( and their families ) that no soldier , dead or alive , would ever be left behind . 
The message was that Israel must remain mobilized and alert in a hostile environment , and that its survival depends on the cohesion of its citizens &quot; army , as well as on solidarity with those sent into battle . 
Controversial and divisive , the Shalit deal triggered a profoundly moral debate in one of the world &apos;s most vibrant civil societies . 
The deal is also , in the eyes of Israelis , a badge of honor for their res publica - their Periclean democracy &apos;s claim to the moral high ground in an autocratic neighborhood . 
For Hamas , on the other hand , the prisoner exchange embodied the core value of steadfastness . 
It was about standing up to the Zionist enemy , the high-tech crusader whose military superiority can be defeated only by stubborn resistance . 
Hamas believes that the deal vindicated the teachings of Hezbollah &apos;s leader , Hassan Nassrallah , who has defined Israel as nothing but a &quot; spider &apos;s web &quot; that can be destroyed with the whisper of a sword . 
Both Hamas and Hezbollah are bound to conclude from Israel &apos;s emotional collapse at the fate of one young soldier that its helplessness in dealing with psychological and sentimental dilemmas opens the way to its eventual strategic defeat . 
Meanwhile , the deal severely compromised the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas , the president of the Palestinian Authority , who has been clamoring for years for the release of prisoners in order to boost his popular standing and enhance his position as Israel &apos;s interlocutor for peace . 
Hamas &quot; resounding success in bringing home the heroes of the Palestinian cause was a major defeat for Abbas - and a significant blow to the peace process . 
The Shalit deal clearly gave a boost to the war camp in Palestine and weakened its champions of peace . 
The sad irony is that Abbas is still cooperating with Israel in curtailing Hamas in the West Bank , and is still detaining hundreds of Hamas militants , among them some who were arrested for planning abductions of Israeli soldiers and civilians . 
The Arab Spring has pushed Israel into a strategic trap from which it can extricate itself only through accommodation with the Palestinians . 
In the current political climate , Arab leaders , whether conservative or revolutionary , can no longer afford to be seen as complicit with Israel and the United States in the region . 
The Palestinian cause will now resonate louder than ever in the central squares of Cairo , Amman , and Ankara . 
By freeing Gilad Shalit , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have finally become a leader who can take difficult decisions . 
He will need this quality to make bold moves on the peace process as well . 
Admittedly , Hamas is no easy enemy , but neither is it immune to rational political calculations.True , its leader , Khaled Mashaal only recently declared in Tehran that &quot; our aim is liberating all of Palestine from the River to the Sea . &quot; More than once , however , he has also made conciliatory declarations . 
But Israel is not required to sign a peace deal with the erratic Mashaal . 
Its task is to boost Abbas , instead of weakening him , as it did in the Shalit deal . 
It is in Israel &apos;s best interest to reach a settlement with the man who has constantly repudiated his predecessors &quot; tactics of armed conflict .
