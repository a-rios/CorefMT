Big Money Merges with Big Brother 
PARIS - All over the world , Internet users entertain romantic delusions about cyberspace . 
To most of us Web surfers , the Internet provides a false sense of complete freedom , power , and anonymity . 
Every once in a while , of course , unsolicited messages and ads that happen to be mysteriously related to our most intimate habits intrude . 
They remind us that we Internet users are , indeed , under constant virtual surveillance . 
When the watchers have only commercial motives , such &quot; spam &quot; feels like a minor violation . 
But in China or Russia , the Internet is patrolled not by unsolicited peddlers , but by the police . 
So Russian human-rights activists and the environmental organization Baikal Environmental Wave should not have been surprised when , earlier this month , flesh and blood policemen - not Internet bots - confiscated their computers and the files stored within them . 
In the time of the Soviet Union , the KGB would have indicted these anti-Putin dissidents for mental disorders . 
This supposedly being a &quot; new Russia , &quot; cyber-dissidents are accused of violating intellectual property rights . 
You see , they were using Microsoft-equipped computers and could not prove that the software had not been pirated . 
By confiscating the computers , the Russian police could supposedly verify whether or not the Microsoft software that the activists were using had been installed legally . 
On the surface , Microsoft and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s police look like strange bedfellows . 
But are they ? 
Microsoft &apos;s authorized representatives declared that they could not oppose the Russian police actions , because the Seattle-based company had to abide by Russian law . 
Such an ambiguous declaration can be interpreted either as active support for the Russian police or as passive collaboration . 
Moreover , in previous cases , Microsoft assisted the Russian police in their investigations of non-governmental organizations . 
Clearly , human-right activists in Russia cannot and should not count on Microsoft as an ally in their efforts to build a more open society . 
But Microsoft &apos;s ambiguous - at best - behavior is part of a pattern . 
Indeed , the record of Internet companies in authoritarian countries is both consistent and grim . 
Yahoo set the pace in pioneering the active collaboration of Internet and high-tech firms with political repression . 
In 2005 , Yahoo gave the Chinese police the computer identification code for a dissident journalist , Shi Tao . 
Following Yahoo &apos;s lead , the police arrested him . 
Shi remains in jail to this day . 
At that time , Yahoo &apos;s managers in the United States , like Microsoft in Russia , declared that they had to follow Chinese law . 
Shi Tao , in his jail cell , was undoubtedly pleased to learn that China is ruled by law , not by the Communist Party . 
After all , the rule of law is what Shi Tao is fighting for . 
Google , at least for a short while , seemed to follow different guidelines in its Chinese business , appearing to adhere to its widely proclaimed ethical principle , &quot; Don &apos;t be evil . &quot; 
To protest against censorship , the Silicon Valley-based company relocated from mainland China in 2009 to the still relatively free Hong Kong . 
On the Hong Kong-based search engine , Chinese internauts could read about Taiwan , the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 , or the Dalai Lama . 
On Google.cn , these sources , along with the results of searches using many other forbidden terms , simply did not appear . 
Google &apos;s move seemed to reconcile its proclaimed libertarian philosophy with its business ethics . 
But that reconciliation did not last long : Google , after all , had accepted censorship from the beginning of its efforts in China , in 2006 , in order to gain entry into the Chinese market . 
After six months of life in Hong Kong , money talked : Google reinstated its mainland China service , and with the same level of censorship as before . 
In the end , Google , not the Chinese Communist Party , lost face . 
Yahoo , Google , and Microsoft have thus followed a strikingly similar road : access to lucrative markets trumped ethical anxiety . 
The tools that they provide are politically neutral . 
Dissidents try to use them to pursue a democratic agenda . 
Police use them to detect and repress dissidents . 
Either way , Microsoft , Yahoo , and Google make money - just like , say , IBM , which in the 1930 &quot; s sold its computing machines to the Nazi regime : the Nazis used these machines to make the destruction of their victims routine and bureaucratic . 
Should we be shocked that Internet companies put profits ahead of morals ? 
After all , they are ordinary , profit-seeking corporations , just like the IBM of Hitler &apos;s era . 
Internet companies may , more than most , hide their true motives behind ersatz , democratic-sounding slogans , but in the end they are advertising products like any other . 
In advertising or self-promotion , the choice of words is determined by customer expectations , not by managers &quot; philosophy , as they mostly have none . 
Capitalism is always a trade-off : we must live with unethical behavior by money-making corporations that provide us with useful new tools . 
These tools can be used by Iranians fighting dictatorship , or by Tibetan dissidents trying to save their culture . 
They also can be used to compute the number of exterminated Jews , to arrest a Chinese dissident , or to break a human-rights group in Russia . 
Microsoft in Russia or Google in China teach us that capitalism is not ethical : it is only efficient . 
Entrepreneurs are greedy by definition : if they were not , they would go bankrupt . 
An open society will never be created or sustained by righteous entrepreneurs or be the mere byproduct of political engineering . 
Liberty , as always , remains the endeavor of vigilant , free men and women .
