A New Deal for Poor Farmers 
NEW YORK - Many poor , food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months , as global prices of rice , wheat , and maize have doubled . 
Hundreds of millions of poor people , who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food , are being pushed to the edge . 
But many poor countries can grow more food themselves , because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible . 
In some cases , with appropriate government action , they could double or even triple food production in just a few years . 
The idea is basic and well known . 
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields . 
Poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season , lack fertilizer , depend on rain rather than irrigation , and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe . 
Their farms are small , perhaps one hectare ( 2.5 acres ) or less . 
Under traditional agricultural conditions , the yields of grain - rice , wheat , maize , sorghum , or millet - are usually around one ton per hectare , for one planting season per year . 
For a farm family of five or six living on one hectare , this means extreme poverty , and for their country , it means reliance on expensive food imports , including food aid . 
The solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons - and in some places to three or more tons - per hectare . 
If water can be managed through irrigation , this could be combined with multi-cropping ( multiple harvests per year ) to produce a crop during the dry season . 
Higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families , and lower food prices for cities . 
The key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties ( usually &quot; hybrid &quot; seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties ) , chemical fertilizers , organic matter to replenish soil nutrients , and , where possible , small-scale irrigation methods , such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well . 
There is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds , fertilizer , and small-scale irrigation . 
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960 &quot; s . 
The problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries . 
When peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral , they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds , fertilizer , and irrigation . 
As a result , they grow food the traditional way , often earning little or nothing from their harvest , because it &apos;s not even enough to keep their families alive . 
History has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap . 
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies , income can rise , and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral . 
With a bit of temporary help , perhaps lasting around five years , farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis , either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans . 
Around the world , government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs , but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies . 
Of course , there were abuses , such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones , or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy . 
And in many cases , government agricultural banks went bankrupt . 
Still , the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid . 
During the debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems . 
Poor farmers were told to fend for themselves , to let &quot; market forces &quot; provide for inputs . 
This was a profound mistake : there were no such market forces . 
Poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties . 
They could not obtain bank financing . 
The time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries , notably those farming on two hectares or less , to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds , fertilizer , and small-scale irrigation . 
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons , and has doubled its food production as a result . 
Other low-income countries should follow suit . 
Importantly , the World Bank , under its new president , Robert Zoellick , has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach . 
If the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs , then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time . 
Donor governments , including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East , should help finance the World Bank &apos;s new efforts . 
The world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions ( such as Haiti ) during the next five years .
