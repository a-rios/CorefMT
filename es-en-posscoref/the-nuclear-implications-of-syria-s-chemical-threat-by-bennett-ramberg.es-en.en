Syria &apos;s Chemical Genie 
LOS ANGELES - Since Syria &apos;s civil war erupted , its large chemical-weapons arsenal has haunted the conflict zone and beyond . 
Now Israel says that chemical weapons have been used by the Syrian regime . 
Escalating fears have driven US President Barack Obama to declare repeatedly that any Syrian use or transfer of chemical weapons would cross a &quot; red line , &quot; for which President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime would be &quot; held accountable . &quot; 
But the practical implications of this warning remain vague . 
As dangerous as Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpile is , it pales in comparison with another risk that became evident in late February , when Syrian rebels overran a Scud-missile base in Al-Kibar , in the country &apos;s remote northeastern desert . 
Beneath the installation lay the buried remnants of the North Korean-engineered nuclear reactor that Israel &apos;s air force had destroyed on September 6 , 2007 . 
Had Israel not learned of the secret plant , which was on the verge of launching operations to produce material for an atomic arsenal , the rebels effectively would have been in possession of a radiological weapon . 
The mere threat could have held the Syrian government hostage . 
Far more worrying , had Syrian engineers built a lab at the site , or in other rebel-held territory , to extract plutonium from the reactor &apos;s spent fuel , the insurgents might even have found themselves with the ingredients of an atomic bomb . 
Fortunately , Syria does not face these threats today . 
But Pakistan , North Korea , and Iran - all potentially unstable countries with growing nuclear enterprises - may in the future . 
How concerned should the world be ? 
History provides grounds for optimism . 
After all , host countries have been able to contain nuclear risks in the most challenging circumstances . 
During Yugoslavia &apos;s violent collapse , adversaries never struck or invaded Serbia &apos;s research reactor , powered by weaponizable enriched uranium . 
When Serbian fighter jets flew threateningly low over Slovenia &apos;s nuclear power plant , they spared the reactor . 
Likewise , during China &apos;s Cultural Revolution , the imposition of martial law prevented attempts by rival factions to seize nuclear facilities in Xinjiang and Qinghai . 
In 1961 , as a group of former French generals revolted in French Algeria , an atomic-bomb test in the Sahara went off without a hitch . 
And , most significant , during the collapse of the Soviet Union , the vast nuclear arsenal remained intact . 
However , concern that the Syrian government could intensify its use of chemical weapons against rebel-held areas , or that rebels could initiate attacks or respond with captured chemical weapons , raises questions about the pattern &apos;s durability and the international community &apos;s reaction . 
The United States , which has become the world &apos;s leader in containing the chemical-weapons risk , seems befuddled . 
Early last year , the US Department of Defense let it be known that 75,000 troops would be needed to secure Syria &apos;s chemical facilities . 
After the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , it is not surprising that this estimate did not exactly generate a groundswell of public support for military intervention in Syria . 
Recent statements from US officials have not been reassuring . 
In January , then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the US was not pursuing options that involve &quot; boots on the ground &quot; to secure Assad &apos;s arsenal during the conflict . 
At the same news conference , Martin E. Dempsey , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , conceded that preventing the Syrian government &apos;s use of chemical weapons would require such clear , comprehensive intelligence that obtaining it is &quot; almost unachievable . &quot; 
Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 17 , Dempsey added that he had no confidence that US forces could secure the arsenal given the number of sites . 
Such remarks from senior military authorities suggest that Obama &apos;s warnings may be hollow . 
Worse , they inspire little confidence that the US can deal with future cases in which countries with nuclear assets find themselves in revolt , civil war , or political collapse - and with compromised domestic atomic safeguards risking the spread of nuclear havoc to other regions . 
Such risks demand examination and planning . 
But , to rely on the US government alone to plot the most effective strategy in the shadow of possible internal group-think is asking too much . 
Outside vetting - including published reviews by congressional investigative bodies , think tanks , and scholars - could add important insights . 
In the aftermath of America &apos;s poorly executed recent wars and confounded planning with respect to Syria &apos;s chemical weapons , such vetting is the least that Americans and their allies should expect in order to prevent the realization of the sum of all our fears : the first nuclear attack or intentional major radiological event of the twenty-first century .
