American Foreign Policy After the Mid-Term Elections 
NEW YORK - Few Americans cast their ballot in the recent mid-term elections on the basis of foreign policy . 
While it may be difficult for people around the world to comprehend this , given the global reach of the United States , it is an undeniable fact . 
Most Americans are , after all , preoccupied with the US economy &apos;s sluggish growth and persistent high unemployment . 
The world &apos;s challenges seem far removed from their day-to-day lives . 
The Cold War ended a generation ago ; the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , are nearly a decade in the past . 
Most Americans do not feel the sacrifices associated with the large troop presence and ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
But the fact that foreign policy did not materially affect the November elections does not mean that the results will not affect US foreign policy . 
They will , but in ways that are inconsistent and even surprising . 
One relationship sure to be influenced by Republican gains will be that between the US and Russia . 
Quick or easy Senate approval of the New START arms-control treaty is highly unlikely , given stated concerns about verification and the protection of US missile-defense programs ; instead , we can expect delays and , possibly , attempts to amend what the two governments already agreed upon . 
Congress may also prove less willing to remove hurdles to Russia &apos;s admission to the World Trade Organization , given what is widely judged to be its leaders &quot; anti-democratic behavior . 
China , too , will feel the results of the new balance in Congress . 
Pressure was already growing to introduce trade sanctions in response to China &apos;s refusal to allow its currency to rise to a natural level against the dollar . 
Such pressure will likely grow , given concerns over Chinese behavior both at home and abroad . 
Moreover , Congress will resist rolling back any of the long-standing economic sanctions against Cuba . 
President Barack Obama has the authority to take some small steps on his own to normalize ties , but substantial change to US policy requires Congress to act - and Congress wants to see fundamental change in Cuba before it does so . 
There will be other consequences stemming from the election . 
What little chance there was of the US backing any global plan to limit or tax carbon emissions has disappeared . 
Improvement in US performance on climate change will have to come from innovation and increased energy efficiency . 
One can anticipate the Republicans , now in control of the House of Representatives , exploiting their ability to convene hearings to question and review foreign policy . 
Depending on how this power is used ( or abused ) , it can be beneficial ( exercising needed oversight and increasing the transparency of policy and policy-making ) or destructive ( if , for example , hearings degenerate into politically motivated attacks on administration officials and policies ) . 
In many other areas , continuity can be expected to trump change . 
This comes as little surprise , as America &apos;s Constitution and political system delegate most of the initiative on foreign policy and defense to the president . 
Yes , Congress must declare war , approve spending , agree to most senior appointments , and ( in the case of the Senate ) ratify treaties , but the president has enormous latitude when it comes to carrying out diplomacy and using military force in situations other than war , which tend to be most situations . 
One area of probable continuity is the Middle East , where Obama will continue to try to broker a deal between Israelis and Palestinians and press Iran not to develop nuclear weapons . 
( Republicans , however will argue for putting less pressure on Israel to compromise and more pressure on Iran . ) But he can expect considerable backing from Republicans if he wants to maintain a sizeable US military presence in Afghanistan beyond this July , or a modest military presence in Iraq beyond the end of 2011 . 
Questions abound when it comes to foreign economic policy , however . 
Three completed trade agreements ( with South Korea , Panama , and Colombia ) have been languishing for years , mostly because of deep opposition to free trade from labor unions and the Democratic Party . 
Republicans have historically been more supportive of such bilateral free-trade agreements . 
But will the new generation of Republicans continue this tradition ? 
There is a fair chance that one or more of these bilateral accords will be approved ( in part because the Obama administration seems finally to have recognized that trade can generate good jobs ) , but it is far less certain that the president will gain the authority needed to negotiate a new global trade deal . 
An even bigger question mark hovers over what might be the greatest national security concern of all : the federal budget deficit . 
Failure to address the deficit ( and the mounting debt ) will create pressures to reduce what the US spends on foreign aid , intelligence , and defense - although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to protect such spending ( except for foreign aid ) . 
Mounting debt also leaves the US vulnerable to the decisions of those who lend it money - or to the vagaries of the market . 
A dollar crisis could weaken the foundations of American power . 
But averting such a crisis requires that the White House and Congress , Democrats and Republicans , agree on a plan for moving the US budget toward balance . 
Alas , the election makes such agreement more distant than ever .
