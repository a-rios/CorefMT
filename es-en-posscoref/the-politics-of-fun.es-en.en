The Politics of Fun 
WARSAW : We in Poland have had a hectic political year . 
Last autumn we had presidential elections ; this autumn we will have parliamentary elections . 
In both , the outcome was obvious before the campaigning started . 
Indeed , the postcommunists now hold such an enormous advantage over all their competitors that a vote scarcely seems necessary . 
But today &apos;s political parties and politicians are so well known that Polish politics is boring us to sleep . 
The ruling right-leaning coalition ( with &quot; Solidarity &quot; roots ) is such a failure and the centrist Union of Freedom is so well known and ineffective , that people support the postcommunists simply because they have been in opposition for four years and might ( just might ) behave differently . 
Suddenly , however , something is changing and for totally unexpected reasons . 
During the presidential elections Mr. Andrzej Olechowski ran as an independent candidate . 
He had no party support , no big money , but he somehow managed to place second with 17 % of the votes , more than what the governing party achieved . 
Mr. Olechowski is well known in Polish politics , for he was once a minister of finance and later a minister of foreign affairs . 
He is tall , handsome , and smart . 
A disc jockey in his youth , he later worked in some international financial institutions , where he spied for the communists , something he openly admits . 
Now he appears as a gentleman of independent means and views . 
Both of my children and a majority of Polish students voted for him mainly because he seems fun . 
He has no specific program or strong ideas , but he speaks in a clear and reasonable way ( he calls himself liberal-conservative ) that is very different from the mechanical party language of the postcommunists and rightists . 
But in looking for fun in politics , we Poles have to remember that democracy , at its root , is meant to be boring , and for a good reason . 
Safety is democracy &apos;s primary purpose : the safety of each citizen to lead their lives in ways they choose . 
Indeed , one explanation I have often heard for the political turmoil in France in May 1968 is that the French people were bored with the successes of General de Gaulle &apos;s presidency and so took to the streets around the Sorbonne for fun . 
So , it seems that democracy should not only provide personal satisfaction for politicians but for the people , too . 
Therefore it cannot be dull for long periods because people will then begin to doubt democracy itself . 
Mr. Olechowski , despite his success was , after the elections , totally neglected by the Union of Freedom ( with which he was supposed to be very close ) and by the Solidarity right . 
He was not a member of the political class , so nobody thought about how to gain advantage by his success . 
So he decided , in tandem with some major political figures both from Solidarity and from the Union of Freedom , to create a movement called &quot; Citizen &apos;s Platform . &quot; 
All three of the leaders of Citizen &apos;s Platform are handsome and bright , intelligent and funny . They now have close to 20 % of voter support as the postcommunists slowly lose their huge advantage . 
( For the first time in two years , indeed , they now hold less that 40 % in opinion polls . ) 
Former political friends of the leaders of Citizen &apos;s Platform try to conceal their envy , but without much success . 
Things can &apos;t be the same any more . 
The new movement espouses the same program as Mr. Olechowski . 
It is simple , clear and thus attractive , although they do try to avoid populist temptations . 
Even for cynical people - like this writer - who thought that nothing was interesting in Polish politics , Citizen &apos;s Platform is fun . 
In the wake of recent elections in the US and Europe it seems clear that the &quot; fun factor &quot; is becoming important everywhere . 
It is said that the best way to seduce a woman is to make her laugh . 
Perhaps the same is true with societies . 
To be funny in politics and to preserve democracy is no easy task . 
To be funny in politics really means the ability to deliver feelings of satisfaction to the citizenry for their participation in the public realm . 
But do politicians really want people to participate ? 
I doubt it . 
People who participate tend to have their own opinions , which makes the task of ruling harder . 
But if there is no pleasure in democratic politics we will abandon it to specialists . 
Pleasure is here understood as John Stuart Mill understood it . 
Mill thought that there is a big minority of people who tend to seek higher pleasures and that to be active in democratic politics is one of such pleasure . 
The future of democracy may , thus , depend on the ideas and the people who might bring us some higher pleasure and so provide us satisfaction in our citizenship . 
Whether or not these new people will turn out to be good people is unclear , but it is becoming obvious that the sorts of people who are arriving in leadership positions are very different types of people from those that we have known - not only in Poland but all over the democratic world .
