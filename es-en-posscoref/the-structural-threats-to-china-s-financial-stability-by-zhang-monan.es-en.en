China &apos;s Hidden Debt Risk 
BEIJING - In the last 200 years , there have been more than 250 cases of sovereign-debt default , and 68 cases of domestic-debt default . 
None of these was an isolated incident . 
Indeed , such defaults - combined with factors like large current-account or fiscal deficits , overvalued currencies , high public-sector debt , and insufficient foreign-exchange reserves - have always triggered financial crises , from the Mexican peso crisis in 1994 to the Russian ruble crisis in 1998 to the American subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 . 
Since China &apos;s era of reform and opening up began , the country has experienced three instances of large-scale public-finance problems . 
In the late 1970 &quot; s , the country faced a debilitating fiscal deficit . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , its corporate sector was plagued by &quot; triangular debts &quot; ( when a manufacturer that has not been paid for its product is unable to pay its suppliers , which in turn struggle to pay their suppliers ) . 
Later that decade , financial institutions were burdened by bad debts generated by state-owned enterprises . 
Now China is experiencing a fourth instance of elevated debt risk , this time characterized by high levels of accumulated local-government and corporate debt . 
To be sure , China &apos;s national balance sheet , which boasts positive net assets , has garnered significant attention in recent years . 
But , in order to assess China &apos;s financial risk accurately , policymakers and economists must consider the risks that lie in the country &apos;s asset structure - and the liabilities that are not included on its balance sheet . 
The current problems are rooted in the government &apos;s response to the 2008 global financial crisis . 
The first round of fiscal stimulus , supported by credit easing , led local governments and the financial sector to increase their leverage ratios . 
As a result , by 2010 , China &apos;s overall leverage ratio had risen by 30 % . 
In 2011 , local-government debt totaled ¥ 10.7 trillion ( $ 1.7 trillion ) , with only 54 of more than 2,500 county governments debt-free . 
Debts incurred by local government investment vehicles ( LGIVs ) totaled almost ¥ 5 trillion - 46.4 % of overall debt . 
At the end of 2011 , China &apos;s Treasury-bond debt stood at ¥ 7.2 trillion , and its ratio of foreign debt to foreign-exchange reserves reached 21.8 % , having grown by 27 % since 2010 . 
But , while this represents an increase for China , it remains well below the widely recognized danger threshold of 100 % . 
Likewise , China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio is rising , though it remains within the &quot; safe &quot; boundary of 60 % - and is considerably lower than the ratio in most developed economies . 
At the end of 2011 , China &apos;s central-government debt amounted to 16.5 % of GDP , and overall government debt totaled ¥ 18 trillion , or 38 % of GDP . 
Judging from its balance sheet , then , the Chinese government has a relatively large stock of net assets and a low debt ratio , and thus seems to be in a solid position to manage its liabilities . 
Indeed , according to China &apos;s Academy of Social Sciences , China &apos;s sovereign net assets increased every year from 2000 to 2010 , reaching ¥ 69.6 trillion - enough to cover the government &apos;s obligations . 
But positive net assets are not sufficient to eliminate financial risk , which also depends on asset structure ( the liquidity of assets and the alignment of maturities of assets and liabilities ) . 
If a large proportion of a country &apos;s assets cannot be liquidated easily , or would be greatly depreciated by a large-scale sell-off , the fact that assets exceed liabilities would not rule out the possibility of debt default . 
In China , this proportion of fixed , illiquid assets exceeds 90 % . 
Resource assets account for roughly 50 % of total government assets , with operating assets amounting to 39 % and administrative ( or non-operating ) assets comprising another 6 % . 
The latter two are difficult to liquidate . 
And , given that resource assets are scarce and non-renewable , the traditional practice of auctioning and leasing land to keep the fiscal deficit under control is unsustainable - especially at a time when external shocks or a domestic economic downturn could easily trigger a short-term solvency crisis or debt default . 
While fiscal revenues are on the rise , they account for only about 6 % of China &apos;s total assets - and their growth rate is slowing . 
China faces additional debt risks from contingent liabilities and inter-departmental risk conversion , especially in the form of implicit guarantees on debts incurred by local governments and state-owned enterprises . 
In recent months , there has been a surge in LGIV bond issuance , aimed at supporting local governments &quot; efforts to stabilize economic growth through stimulus-style investment projects . 
But the implicit guarantees on these bonds - as well as on existing bank loans - amount to hidden extra-budgetary liabilities for the central government . 
Local governments have also accumulated massive amounts of non-explicit debt through arrears , credits , and guarantees . 
Once this debt &apos;s cumulative risk exceeds a local government &apos;s financial capacity , the central government is forced to assume responsibility for servicing it , directly endangering its own financial capacity . 
At the same time , China &apos;s corporate sector relies excessively on debt financing , rather than equity . 
China &apos;s non-financial corporate debt accounts for roughly 62 % of total debt - 30-40 % higher than in other countries . 
According to GK Dragonomics , China &apos;s total corporate debt amounted to 108 % of GDP in 2011 , and reached a 15-year high of 122 % of GDP in 2012 . 
Many of these heavily indebted enterprises are state-owned , and have borrowed from state-controlled banks . 
The implicit guarantees on this debt , too , suggest that the government &apos;s liabilities are much higher than its balance sheet indicates . 
China is not too big to fail . 
In a fragile economic environment , policymakers cannot afford to allow the size of China &apos;s balance sheet to distract them from the underlying structural risks and contingent liabilities that threaten its financial stability .
