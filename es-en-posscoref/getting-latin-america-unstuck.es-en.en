Getting Latin America Unstuck 
One of the world economy &apos;s biggest puzzles is Latin America &apos;s poor performance . 
Since the early 1980 &apos;s , Latin America has been stuck , with per capita incomes growing slowly ( if at all ) in most of the region , and with one big crisis following another . 
Many policies have been tried , especially trade liberalization , privatization of inefficient state enterprises , and budgetary reforms . 
Yet something is holding Latin America back . 
The lack of vigorous growth is all the more bewildering in view of Latin America &apos;s many advantages and social successes . 
Natural resources are plentiful , with vast amounts of fertile land . 
Health conditions are reasonably good , and all Latin American countries have made headway against illiteracy , with most reaching 90 % adult literacy or higher . 
Moreover , fertility rates have fallen sharply , to a point where populations in many countries will probably level off in coming decades . 
Women &apos;s status has improved , and girls enjoy equal access to education , with even higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries . 
Latin America may be known for its &quot; macho &quot; culture , but women increasingly participate in the labor force and attain prominent political and social positions . 
Latin America boasts still other long-term advantages . 
Most people live near the coasts , with good access to international trade , and most live in cities - another advantage for growth . 
Indeed , the region is not poor by international standards , but rather stuck in the middle-income range between the world &apos;s poorest places and the high-income countries of North America , Europe , and East Asia . 
What , then , accounts for the puzzling lack of real growth over the past 25 years ? 
I blame two unsolved , but solvable , problems . 
The first has been around for centuries : the social divisions that trace their origins back to the European conquest over Native Americans in the sixteenth century . 
More than most places , Latin America was born in violent conquest . 
Europeans subdued Amerindian populations and also brought in massive numbers of slaves from Africa , especially to the Caribbean basin and Brazil . 
Societies became racially and ethnically complex , as the European , Amerindian , and African populations intermarried , but the long-term trend of European dominance , indigenous and Afro-American subservience , and entrenched poverty became a scar on Latin American societies . 
Even today , income inequality in Latin America is among the highest in the world , reflecting the old patterns of ethnic and racial division . 
Income inequality casts a long shadow . 
The rich have long fought against taxation needed to increase investment in the education and health of the poor , perpetuating deep social divisions and leaving many people without the health and skills that global competitiveness requires . 
The situation today is improving in some places - such as Brazil - which augurs well for the future . 
In other places - for example , Guatemala and parts of the Andean region - social divisions remain fraught with violence and distrust . 
Beyond this , a basic failure of economic strategy has been largely overlooked , one that is reflected in a major difference between public policy discussions in Latin America and Asia . 
In Asia , public debate is about technology : how can Asia catch up ? 
Asian governments relentlessly act to raise the scientific and technological capacities of their economies . 
In Latin America , the global technological revolution is much less discussed , and national policies to promote science and technology are rarely given prominence . 
The result is that Latin America has failed to benefit adequately from the global technological revolutions . 
Asian developing countries are now producers of computers , semiconductors , pharmaceuticals , and software . 
By contrast , even Latin America &apos;s star performer , Chile , remains largely a resource-based export economy , with a heavy concentration in copper and agricultural exports . 
These sectors are technologically sophisticated , but form a narrow base for long-term development . 
The situation is far from hopeless . 
Brazil has demonstrated the ability to be a technological export power . 
It has succeeded , notably , in exporting airplanes and many consumer durable goods . 
Mexico , too , has begun to mobilize significant technological prowess . 
Argentina , Chile , and other countries could become high-tech agricultural producers , in the forefront of agro-biotechnology for example , if they put their minds to it . 
Still , Latin American countries have not yet tried to foster a technological revolution , certainly not with the focus , skill , commitment , and financing that Asian countries have shown . 
Such a push could play a major role in jump-starting economic growth . 
Such a policy would entail committing to a major increase in spending on research and development , as Asian developing countries have done . 
Latin American countries should aim to increase spending to around 2 % of GNP ( from 0.5 % currently ) , partly through public support for laboratories and universities and partly through incentives for private-sector R &amp; D. They should roll out the red carpet for high-tech multinational firms , just as Asia has done . 
They should also increase their focus on scientific and technological training and encourage a higher proportion of students to go on to university education . 
Government stipends for tuition and for new and enlarged universities can play a big role , as can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities . 
The social agenda and the technology agenda are not independent of each other . 
Both call upon Latin American societies to invest more in their people , so that Latin Americans can join the cutting edge of global productivity . 
If these investments reach all parts of Latin America , rich and poor , the region &apos;s prospects will brighten enormously .
