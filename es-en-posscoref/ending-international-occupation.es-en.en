Ending International Occupation 
To state the obvious , military / political occupations and international oversight of a country are never welcome to the people who are being occupied and / or overseen . 
For a while , they grin and bear it , sometimes recognizing the necessity of the loss of sovereignty that they are enduring . 
But their tolerance inevitably fades - and fast . 
In Bucharest recently , I was discussing the oversight role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) in my country , Albania , with an expert from that body . 
He was surprised to learn that the number of OSCE employees in Albania is equal to that of the entire staff of the OSCE &apos;s Vienna headquarters . 
The sheer scale of the OSCE &apos;s operations in Albania is not what troubles me . 
What is troubling is the seeming permanence of its mission . 
Indeed , who is to decide when the OSCE &apos;s mission in Albania is over ? 
The question is , of course , broader than that of the OSCE in Albania . 
With UN administrators still holding sway in Kosovo and Bosnia years after their savage wars ended , and with talk of a UN mission to replace the US occupation administration in Iraq , when should an international administration be terminated and oversight of a country returned to its citizens ? 
Let there be no mistake : the OSCE played a positive role in stabilizing Albania . 
Its presence throughout the country in 1997 helped keep Albania united at a time of near civil war . 
But 1997 is a long time ago , and Albania has changed dramatically . 
Its democracy is secure ; its economy improving . 
Yet , despite these far-reaching changes , the dynamics of the OSCE &apos;s presence have scarcely budged . 
Indeed , the OSCE still sticks its nose and fingers into pretty much every aspect of Albanian political life . 
The problem with such intrusive oversight is that political issues that incite the strongest passions  -  such as determining electoral lists  -  are suppressed when an international body offers and imposes its own solutions . 
But suppression won &apos;t make these issues go away ; it only lets them fester . 
Albanian problems now demand homemade Albanian compromises . 
For most issues , I suspect that Kosovo and Bosnia are experiencing similar side effects due to their occupations . 
A stultifying form of international oversight that offers only fiat or imposed conciliation paralyzes their domestic political development . 
Even more than in Albania , opportunities to develop the habits of compromise that make democratic politics workable are denied to the people . 
In Albania , instead of developing and strengthening our infant democratic institutions , the OSCE , in its desire to see its policies implemented , often seeks to bypass or override them . 
This retards the country &apos;s political stabilization and democratic consolidation . 
Indeed , on some issues , shades of the old imperial strategy of &quot; divide and rule &quot; can be seen , with the OSCE pitting one Albanian institution or political party against another . 
Of course , the OSCE &apos;s presence in Albania does have political backing from large portions of the country &apos;s electorate . 
Until 2000 , the government tended more to rely on the advice of the OSCE , but even since 2001 , it has tried to buttress its position by claiming that it gets along better than ever with the OSCE and its mission . 
When an Albanian minister tried last year to raise the question of the duration of the OSCE &apos;s mission , the opposition leapt to the OSCE &apos;s defense . 
Nonetheless , there is a creeping perception that the OSCE is becoming too deeply engaged in picking winners and losers in Albanian politics - a perception underpinned by wider questions of sovereignty . 
Is the OSCE &apos;s presence retarding the country &apos;s independence and economic vitality by creating an image of a protectorate , a country unable to forge international agreements or join powerful international bodies on its own volition ? 
Is it the OSCE &apos;s presence , and not Albania &apos;s government , that is now keeping the country what it has long been , a hermit kingdom ? 
I do not attribute any malign or sinister purposes to the OSCE presence in Albania , unless one considers inertia malign . 
But saying that a body means well and saying that it is actually doing any good are two different things . 
Worst of all , the OSCE &apos;s bureaucratic nature means that it will never have an incentive to leave because the first duty of a bureaucracy is to perpetuate itself . 
Of course , an effective OSCE mission , confined to Tirana and comprised of experts that the country still needs , would be useful . 
But Albania no longer needs the OSCE &apos;s staff to be scattered throughout the country to monitor every aspect of its political life . 
The reality is that the OSCE has achieved its goals . 
It is time for it to take a bow and go home to Vienna . 
That &apos;s a lesson other occupying international agencies should keep in mind .
