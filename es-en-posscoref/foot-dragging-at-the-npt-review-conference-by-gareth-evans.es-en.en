The Nuclear Illusion 
GENEVA - As delegates from 189 countries gather to prepare for the next Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference , due in 2015 , I am reminded of my first official briefing , as a young Australian minister back in the early 1980 &quot; s , on United States nuclear strategy . 
It was given to me , in the bowels of the Pentagon , by a man with a white dust jacket and a pointer who looked uncannily like Woody Allen . 
He did not have much to say about the countless real human beings who would be vaporized , crushed , baked , boiled , or irradiated to death if a nuclear war ever erupted . 
The language was disengaged and technical - all about throw-weights , survivability , counterforce , and countervalue targets . 
But it was a dazzling account of the logic of nuclear deterrence and the mechanics of mutually assured destruction , which both the US and Soviet Union applied throughout the Cold War . 
Thirty years later , our world is not one in which the governments in Moscow or Washington are likely to hurl swarms of nuclear missiles at each other ( if it ever was ) . 
Nor is it a world in which China or the US would conceivably ever intentionally start a nuclear war against the other . 
Even for India and Pakistan , the risk of misjudgment or miscalculation is much greater than that of deliberate nuclear warmongering . 
And , for North Korea - or Iran , should it ever build nuclear weapons - the risk of the regime initiating a nuclear attack is negligible , given that doing so would result in its certain ( non-nuclear ) incineration . 
Not many delegates here in Geneva , even from the nuclear-armed states , would disagree with any of these assessments . 
But it is extraordinary how much of the disembodied calculus of my Woody Allen-lookalike still prevails in today &apos;s nuclear policymaking . 
Russia worries that its nuclear-tipped missiles , based largely in static locations , might be destroyed on the ground by a preemptive strike by long-range US missiles , and its retaliatory punch weakened by US ballistic missile defense . 
Though it can paint no scenario in which this would ever occur , it not only drags its heels on further arms-reduction talks , but insists on keeping a thousand or so of its strategic nuclear weapons on launch-within-minutes alert status . 
Not surprisingly , the US refuses to de-alert its own nuclear missiles if Russia will not . 
So nearly 2,000 weapons of mass destruction still face each other on high alert , maximizing the prospect of a catastrophe through human or system error or cyber sabotage . 
This deterrence logic produces a snowball effect . 
With Russia and the US holding 18,000 of the world &apos;s current stockpile of 19,000 nuclear weapons , it is proving impossible to persuade any of the other nuclear-armed states to reduce their own ( much smaller ) arsenals until the Big Two make further drastic cuts to theirs . 
China shares Russia &apos;s concerns about US conventional and missile-defense superiority , and is increasing and modernizing its estimated 240-weapon stockpile . 
With China taking that course , India - outside the NPT but with 100 weapons of its own - feels the need to add to its own arsenal . 
And Pakistan then becomes even more determined to try to keep ahead of India . 
The truth is that none of the nuclear-armed states , inside or outside the NPT , pays anything more than lip service to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons . 
The continued seductive power of the Cold War logic and language of nuclear deterrence is the primary reason , though for some states it is clear that the testosterone factor - perceived status and prestige - also plays a role . 
The uplifting pro-disarmament rhetoric of US President Barack Obama remains just that . 
No nuclear-armed state will set a timetable for a major reduction in the number of nuclear weapons , let alone their abolition . 
The size of their arsenals , their fissile material stocks , their force-modernization plans , their stated doctrine , and their known deployment practices all point in the same direction . 
All foresee indefinite retention of their nuclear weapons , and a continuing role for them in their security policies . 
The implications of this stance are profoundly troubling . 
Concern about states in the Middle East and Northeast Asia joining the nuclear club is as high as it has ever been . 
But the foot-dragging by the nuclear states on disarmament is making it increasingly difficult to add necessary new muscle to the global non-proliferation regime . 
This was obvious at the last NPT Review Conference in 2010 , when efforts to mandate stronger safeguards , strengthen compliance and enforcement mechanisms , and inject new life into the control of fissile-material production all went nowhere . 
And that sentiment is alive and well in Geneva this week . 
Of course , it is irrational for those whose ultimate objective is a nuclear-weapons-free world to support anything but the strongest non-proliferation measures . 
But bloody-mindedness is a natural and inevitable reaction when leaders see double standards - &quot; my security concerns justify nuclear weapons , but yours do not &quot; - at work on this scale . 
Progress toward achieving a safer and saner world requires all of the nuclear-armed states to break out of their Cold War mindset , rethink the strategic utility of nuclear deterrence in current conditions , and recalibrate the huge risks implied by retaining their arsenals . 
It is time for them to recognize that in today &apos;s world , nuclear weapons are the problem , not the solution .
