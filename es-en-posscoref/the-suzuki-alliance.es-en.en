The Suzuki Alliance 
TOKYO - The name &quot; Suzuki &quot; is the most popular surname in Japan and the brand name of the most popular car in India . 
Suzuki has a market share of 55.6 % in the compact and mid-size car market in India , whose middle class , car purchasing public , accounts for 200-300 million of the country &apos;s 1.15 billion people . 
For a long time , Indians have used bicycle rickshaws or auto rickshaws for daily transportation . 
The word &quot; rickshaw &quot; originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha , which literally means &quot; human-powered vehicle . &quot; 
The fact that Suzuki is now practically synonymous with automobile in India suggests how close the relationship between the two countries can be . 
Indeed , India and Japan are natural allies . 
Their strategic interests are almost perfectly aligned , and each shares a desire to stabilize and preserve Asia &apos;s balance of power . 
So it is no surprise that Japan is pushing to develop closer economic and strategic ties with India . 
Suzuki Motor Corporation first entered the Indian market in 1982 , when it started a joint venture with Maruti Udyog , an Indian state-owned firm . 
Despite many ups and downs - and fierce competition from other major automobile manufacturers , including the Indian giant Tata Motors - Suzuki succeeded in establishing its brand as India &apos;s &quot; people &apos;s car . &quot; 
Currently , Maruti Suzuki India Limited has more than 4,000 employees and a nationwide sales network of 337 dealers with 8,600 salespersons . 
The company is planning to build a new factory in 2011 , with production capacity of 300,000 cars per year for a market expected to reach two million in sales this year . 
The reason why Suzuki entered the Indian market is clear . 
Suzuki chose an untapped market while Japan &apos;s bigger automakers - Toyota , Nissan , and Honda - engaged in fierce competition within Japan . 
Osamu Suzuki , CEO and COO of the company ( and a grandson-in-law of its founder ) , is a creative decision maker , a maverick who considers himself an &quot; old man in a mom-and-pop company &quot; that concentrated most of its resources on producing motorcycles and light motor vehicles . 
Yet when he decided to diversify and focus on India , many criticized him as being reckless , because India was so unfamiliar to Japanese companies . 
Indeed , while there are currently more than 19,000 Japanese companies in the Chinese market , there are only about 260 in India . 
Suzuki &apos;s decision to enter the Indian market turned out to be a resoundingly wise choice . 
Japan &apos;s population peaked in 2004 and is now falling , while its younger generations show diminishing interests in automobiles . 
In the past , young Japanese were proud of their knowledge about cars , and every teenage boy knew which model would attract the most girls . 
Today , however , Japanese driving schools suffer from a fall-off in students , which cannot be explained solely by declining population . 
India &quot; s population , on the other hand , is increasing dramatically in the absence of a one-child policy , such as exists in China . 
It makes sense , then , that Japanese companies should head to the expanding Indian market . 
Doing so , moreover , makes geo-strategic sense as well , with successive Japanese governments increasingly regarding India as a vital diplomatic and political partner . 
For example , in August 2007 , then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed a big delegation to India , followed by an official visit in December 2009 by current Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama . 
The &quot; Strategic and Global Partnership between Japan and India , &quot; established in 2006 , rests on the recognition that Japan and India share common values and interests , as they are the two major entrenched democratic countries in Asia . 
These shared values distinguish the Japan-India relationship from Japan &apos;s relationship with China . 
The growing congruence of strategic interests led to the 2008 Japan-India security agreement , a significant milestone in building a stable geo-political order in Asia . 
A constellation of Asian democracies linked by strategic cooperation and common interests is becoming critical to ensuring equilibrium at a time when Asia &apos;s security challenges are mounting due to the shift in global economic and political power from west to east . 
The emerging Japan / India partnership looks like a necessary foundation for pan-Asian security in the 21st century . 
The key point today is that the governments in both India and Japan are keen on developing their strategic consensus about Asia &apos;s future , a fact underscored by the many bilateral discussions between defense and military officials of both countries that are taking place . 
These discussions include joint initiatives on maritime security , counterterrorism , weapons proliferation , disaster prevention and management , and energy security . 
More is needed . 
India and Japan should , for example , jointly develop new defense capacities . 
Today , India and Japan cooperate on missile defense in partnership with Israel and the US . 
Bilateral efforts should also be launched to develop other defense technologies . 
Suzuki &apos;s joint venture in India suggests that cooperation in high-tech manufacturing is eminently possible . 
Suzuki &apos;s success is a powerful precedent not only for other Japanese companies that are looking at the Indian market , but also for further deepening cooperation between the two countries . 
Osamu Suzuki may not be willing to share all of the secrets of his success with his competitors , but they and Japanese diplomats should be studying the Suzuki method . 
Japan &apos;s economy and Asian security depend on its replication .
