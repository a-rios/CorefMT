Japan As Number Three 
TOKYO - China has now officially supplanted Japan as the world &apos;s second largest economy . 
The question for Japan is whether or not the country will continue to tumble down the list of the world &apos;s great economies , or whether its politicians will return to a path of reform that can revive growth . 
That the ruling Democratic Party of Japan now seems trapped in a power struggle between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and party power broker Ichiro Ozawa suggests that serious economic reform is not at the top of the DPJ agenda . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , Japan &apos;s annual GDP growth averaged 4.5 ％ ; since the early 1990 &quot; s , the economy has been virtually stagnant , averaging barely 1 % annual growth . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , Japan &apos;s government , grossly misjudging the sources of the economy &apos;s difficulties , vastly increased government expenditures on public works , but ignored supply-side adjustments . 
This policy created new vested interests , and thus a new political environment , as construction companies and other beneficiaries of government contracts began donating heavily to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party . 
It was in these circumstances that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi took office in April 2001 . 
Under Koizumi &apos;s leadership , insolvent banks were made whole again . 
At the start of Koizumi &apos;s government , 8.4 % of bank loans in Japan were non-performing . 
By the end of his tenure , the rate was down to 1.5 % , restoring the country &apos;s potential for growth . 
Indeed , this was one reason why Japan was so little affected by the &quot; Lehman Shock &quot; that incited the global financial crisis . 
But macroeconomic reform came to a screeching halt after Koizumi stepped down in 2006 . 
A series of short-term prime ministers began a pattern of huge government outlays . 
Not surprisingly , the economy deteriorated . 
Frustrated by the long-ruling LDP &apos;s poor political and economic management , voters opted last year for change at the top . 
Huge spending increases were directed at farmers and households . 
As a result , the share of tax revenue to total spending this fiscal year slipped below 50 % , something unseen in Japan &apos;s entire post-war history . 
Despite the parlous fiscal position , for now the market for Japanese government bonds ( JGBs ) remains stable . 
In another words , the government &apos;s negative saving is financed by the private sector &apos;s positive savings . 
But that private-sector safety net of savings is fraying . 
Japanese households hold savings of about ¥ 1.1 trillion in net monetary assets . 
In about three years , however , the amount of JGBs will exceed the total assets of Japanese households . 
Government debt will no longer be backed up by taxpayers &quot; assets . 
Confidence in the JGB market will likely decline . 
Moreover , as Japan &apos;s society ages , the household savings rate will decrease dramatically . 
And new demands for fiscal expenditures are expected to grow as the country ages . 
In about five years , all baby boomers will be over 65 , but pressure on government expenditures for pensions and health care is expected to start sooner , around 2013 . 
Japan &apos;s new government , led by Prime Minister Naoto Kan , started discussing a consumption-tax hike to offset the growth in spending . 
Although a tax increase will undoubtedly be needed , it is the wrong priority at the moment - and could prove counter-productive if it causes the economy to decline dramatically . 
Indeed , Koizumi &apos;s government demonstrated the best way to tackle fiscal consolidation . 
Koizumi decided that a primary budget balance should be restored in 10 years . 
Had this effort been continued for two more years , a primary surplus could have been realized . 
Without a strategy for growth , which includes efforts to reduce government expenditures and a policy to stop deflation , Japan &apos;s economy will remain in the doldrums . 
But , as history has shown , no third way exists . 
Kan continues to believe that a large government , with growing social-welfare expenditures , is the way to get the economy moving . 
This should not be surprising . 
He used to be involved in civic movements and groups - like environmental organizations - that take little heed of the need for economic growth . 
Increasing the tax burden seems almost a natural part of such a mindset , as does ignorance of the need for increased economic competition . 
Without that , and a renewed focus on growth , Japan will continue to climb down the global ladder of success . 
Indeed , any Japanese who thinks that complacency is an option should look to Argentina . 
A hundred years ago , Argentina was arguably the world &apos;s second wealthiest economy . 
Now , thanks to bad policies , and even worse politicians , it ranks among the world &apos;s also-rans .
