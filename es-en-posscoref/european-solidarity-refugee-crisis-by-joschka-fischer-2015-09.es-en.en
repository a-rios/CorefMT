Europe &apos;s Reality Check 
BERLIN - Until a few weeks ago , Europeans believed they lived in a kind of sanctuary , insulated from the world &apos;s current conflicts . 
Certainly , the news and images of drowned migrants were dreadful ; but the tragedy occurring south of Italy , Greece , and Malta , seemed a long way off . 
Syria &apos;s brutal civil war , which has been raging for years , seemed even farther away . 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad deployed poison gas and later barrel bombs filled with nails and metal fragments against his rebellious population . 
And those who escaped Assad &apos;s henchmen found themselves confronted by the terror of the Islamic State . 
Hundreds of thousands were killed , and millions of Syrians have fled , with most living in camps in Jordan , Lebanon , or Turkey for years , in appalling conditions and with no hope of improvement . 
So , sometime this summer , when the last glimmer of hope of a return to Syria disappeared and an alternative to Assad and the Islamic State no longer seemed realistic , these people started heading toward Europe , which seemed to promise a future of peace , freedom , and security . 
The refugees came via Turkey , Greece , and the Balkan states , or across the Mediterranean to escape similar chaos in Eritrea , Libya , Somalia , and Sudan . 
In August , thousands of refugees became stranded at Budapest &apos;s Keleti train station for days on end when Hungary &apos;s vexed and incompetent government deliberately allowed the situation to escalate . 
Eventually , thousands of men , women , and children - and even old and disabled people - started to make their way on foot toward the Austrian border . 
At this point Europe , witnessing an exodus of biblical proportions , could no longer ignore the challenge and the consequences of the crises in its neighboring region . 
Europe was now directly confronted with the harsh realities from which it had appeared to be a sanctuary . 
Europe was , no surprise , unprepared . 
The European Union lacked the civilian , diplomatic , and military tools needed to contain , let alone resolve , the crises and conflicts in its neighborhood . 
And , once the migrants headed for Europe , the EU &apos;s common asylum policy failed , because the so-called Dublin III agreement provided no effective mechanism to distribute asylum-seekers among all members states after their initial registration in EU border states ( in particular Greece and Italy ) . 
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi &apos;s call for European solidarity went unheeded . 
When thousands of refugees arrived in Budapest on their way to Germany and Scandinavia , a humanitarian disaster loomed , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had to choose : either take in the refugees or risk further escalation of the crisis in Budapest . 
Germany probably could not have stood idly by even for another two days . 
Merkel took the brave and correct decision to let the refugees enter Germany . 
For this , she deserves wholehearted respect and full support , all the more so in view of the icy response of many within her own party . 
But Merkel was not alone in embodying humane values at this decisive moment . 
Civil-society groups in Germany , Austria , and elsewhere mobilized to a hitherto unseen extent to meet - together with the public authorities - the enormous challenge posed by the influx . 
Without the public &apos;s active empathy , the authorities would never have managed . 
With the support of such ad hoc coalitions , Europe should do whatever it takes to ensure the refugees &quot; successful integration . 
The influx launched during the &quot; refugee summer &quot; will change Germany and Europe . 
The EU will be able to address the challenge - and seize the opportunity - of integrating the newcomers only together and in the spirit of European solidarity . 
Should unity crumble in this crisis , the consequences for all parties involved - especially the refugees - will be grave . 
First and foremost , a new , effective system for securing Europe &apos;s external borders must be established as quickly as possible . 
This includes a joint procedure for judging asylum claims and a mechanism to distribute the refugees among EU countries fairly . 
Moreover , if the EU wants to maintain its core values , including the abolition of internal borders , it will need to focus on stabilizing its Middle Eastern , North African , and Eastern European neighbors with money , commitment , and all its hard and soft power . 
A united approach will be crucial . 
But Europe should avoid the kind of dismal realpolitik that would betray its core values elsewhere . 
It would be a grave mistake , for example , to sell out Ukraine &apos;s interests and lift the sanctions imposed on Russia out of the mistaken belief that the Kremlin &apos;s assistance is needed in Syria . 
Cooperation with Russia , however useful and advisable , must not come at the expense of third parties and Western interests and unity . 
Attempting to redeem past mistakes is not advisable when it means making even bigger ones . 
To be sure , there is a risk that the refugee crisis will strengthen nationalist and populist parties in EU member states . 
But the renationalization of politics within the EU gained traction long before the summer of 2015 , and it is not a result of the refugee crisis . 
At its heart lies a fundamental conflict over Europe &apos;s future : back to a continent of nation-states , or forward to a community of shared values ? 
Convinced Europeans will need to marshal all their strength - and muster all their nerve - in the times ahead .
