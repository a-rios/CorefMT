European Exceptionalism 
PARIS - The creation of Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union is unique in the history of sovereign states . 
The eurozone constitutes a &quot; society of states &quot; of a completely new type , one that transcends the traditional Westphalian concept of sovereignty . 
Like individuals in a society , eurozone countries are both independent and interdependent . 
They can affect each other both positively and negatively . 
Good governance requires that individual member states and the European Union &apos;s institutions fulfill their responsibilities . 
Above all , economic and monetary union means just that : two unions , monetary and economic . 
Europe &apos;s monetary union has worked remarkably well . 
Since the euro &apos;s launch in 1999 , price stability has been maintained for 17 countries and 332 million people , with average yearly inflation of just 2.03 % - better than Germany &apos;s record from 1955 to 1999 . 
Moreover , the eurozone has created 14.5 million new jobs since 1999 , compared to 8.5-9 million in the United States . 
This is not to say that Europe does not have a serious unemployment problem ; but there is no obvious inferiority in Europe : all advanced economies must boost job creation . 
Likewise , on a consolidated basis , the eurozone &apos;s current account is balanced , its debt / GDP ratio is well below that of Japan , and its annual public-finance deficit is well below that of the US , Japan , and the United Kingdom . 
The euro per se thus does not explain why the eurozone has become the sick man of the global economy . 
To understand that , one has to consider the weakness of Europe &apos;s economic union . 
For starters , the Stability and Growth Pact , intended to ensure sound fiscal policies in the eurozone , was never correctly implemented . 
On the contrary , in 2003 and 2004 , France , Italy , and Germany , sought to weaken it . 
The European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the small and medium-sized eurozone countries prevented the SGP from being dismantled , but its spirit was gravely compromised . 
Moreover , eurozone governance did not include monitoring and surveillance of competitiveness indicators - trends in nominal prices and costs in member states , and countries &quot; external imbalances within the eurozone . 
( In 2005 , long before the crisis , I called , on behalf of the ECB &apos;s governing council , for appropriate surveillance of a number of national indicators , including unit labor costs . ) 
A third source of weakness is that no crisis-management tools were envisaged at the euro &apos;s launch . 
For much of the world at the time , &quot; benign neglect &quot; was the order of the day , particularly in the advanced economies . 
Finally , the high correlation between the creditworthiness of a particular country &apos;s commercial banks and that of its government creates an additional source of vulnerability , which is particularly damaging in the eurozone . 
Fortunately , much progress has been made , including significant improvements to the SGP and the introduction of surveillance of competitiveness indicators and national imbalances . 
New crisis-management tools have been put in place . 
And there is a consensus that the EU &apos;s stability and prosperity requires completion of the single market and obligatory structural reforms for all 27 members . 
A proposed banking union would help to separate the commercial banks &quot; creditworthiness from that of their government . 
But none of this is enough . 
Instead of imposing fines on countries that transgress rules and ignore recommendations , as the SGP was supposed to do , the European Commission , the European Council , and - this is essential - the European Parliament should decide directly on measures to be immediately implemented in the country concerned . 
Fiscal and certain other economic policies should be subject to activation of a eurozone &quot; federation by exception . &quot; 
The idea that sharing a single currency also means accepting limitations on fiscal sovereignty is not new . 
A &quot; federation by exception &quot; merely draws the logical consequences from the ineffectiveness of the fines envisaged by the SGP , and is fully consistent with the concept of subsidiarity that has been applied since the SGP &apos;s introduction : as long as national economic policy complies with the framework , there are no sanctions . 
Perhaps the most important element of the &quot; federation by exception &quot; would be its strong democratic anchor . 
Its activation would be subject to a fully democratic decision-making process , with clear political accountability . 
More precisely , decisions to implement measures proposed by the Commission and already approved by the Council would require a majority vote by the European Parliament - that is , those representatives elected from the EU &apos;s eurozone members . 
In such exceptional circumstances , the parliament of the country concerned should have the opportunity to explain to the European Parliament why it could not implement the recommendations proposed , while the European Parliament could explain why the eurozone &apos;s stability and prosperity are at stake . 
But the final word would belong to the European Parliament . 
In the past , I have suggested establishing a eurozone finance ministry , which would be responsible for activating economic and fiscal federation when and where necessary , and for managing new crisis-management tools like the European Stability Mechanism . 
It would also be responsible for overseeing the banking union , and it would represent the eurozone in all international financial institutions and informal groupings . 
But , most important , &quot; federation by exception &quot; would ultimately cease to be an exception . 
The finance minister would be a member of the EU &apos;s future executive branch , together with the other ministers responsible for other federal departments . 
From this perspective , the Commission presages a future European democratic government , as German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble , who has proposed instituting an elected president , has suggested . 
The Council , meanwhile , appears to anticipate the European Parliament &apos;s future upper house , with the lower house already elected by all EU citizens . 
I am fully aware of the boldness of what I propose . 
But Europeans must learn the lessons of the recent past . 
We must clarify the nature of what must be done to secure governance that is both democratic and as effective as circumstances require .
