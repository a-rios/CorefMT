Waiting for Obama 
This is the season for Asian gatherings . 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) summit in Thailand in late October brought all the key players of Asia together . 
Come mid-November , almost all of them will meet again in Singapore at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit , which will include other Pacific leaders , plus US President Barack Obama . 
Summits are a circus with many rings and acronyms . 
At the ASEAN summit , the 10 Southeast Asian leaders met counterparts from China , Japan , and South Korea . These 13 countries then met again with India , Australia , and New Zealand . 
Some 42 agreements were reportedly penned at the meeting , on issues ranging from outstanding trade and economic matters to the launch of a human rights commission . 
Not bad for a summit that some feared would not happen at all : an earlier meeting planned for April in Bangkok had been disrupted by protesters - &quot; red shirts &quot; who support ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra . 
As for Obama , he will first visit Japan , and , while at APEC , will also attend the first US-ASEAN Summit . 
Afterwards , he will go to China and South Korea . 
What additional dimension might America &apos;s president bring on his first visit to the region ? 
Obama is still fighting back home for his healthcare initiative , and is hamstrung from acting on climate change in time for the Copenhagen summit , which is to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol . 
So there is a risk that he will come to Asia for just a star turn and photo opportunities while reserving his strength for other battles . 
Starting with Japan , Obama needs to ensure a good working relationship with Yukio Hatoyama , the new premier . 
Japan has voiced support for an East Asian community that includes India , Australia , and New Zealand , while the Chinese and others question widening the circle . 
The US should welcome the Japanese initiative and engage with Asia as a whole . 
Keeping Japan close is a starting point . 
Moving onto ASEAN , much attention will be on how Obama interacts with Myanmar &apos;s leader , who will also be present . 
Obama should stand for democracy and help push for a clean vote in the elections that the junta has promised for 2010 . 
But there are other , broader opportunities . 
ASEAN has been the hub for Asian regionalism , but some in Australia have proposed focusing only on the larger countries . 
Southeast Asians have a renewed openness towards American leadership , and meaningful initiatives can be started that would resonate with regional aspirations . 
One such initiative is for freer trade . 
While the US has stood on the sidelines , intra-Asian agreements have run ahead . 
US Senator Richard Lugar has floated the idea of a free-trade agreement between the US and ASEAN . 
But , with Myanmar included , this may be too difficult politically , and an ASEAN sub-grouping may be more realistic . 
Another option is for the US to press for a Trans-Pacific Partnership . 
This was proposed late in the Bush administration in order to forge links with some ASEAN members - Singapore , Vietnam , and Brunei - as well as others across the Pacific . 
This could be built up to include other open Southeast Asian economies - Malaysia and Thailand - with the eventual aim being an APEC-wide agreement , which would be an impressive achievement if realized by the end of 2011 , when it will be Obama &apos;s turn to play host to all the leaders . 
In this time of crisis and unemployment , the American public may question freer trade . 
But more and more American businesses realize that still-growing Asian markets are vital for their future profits and overall economic recovery . 
Most economic frameworks are among Asians only , but an American initiative could trump them and ensure that the region remains open and engaged with the US . 
It could also help lessen the tendency of some governments to gravitate ever closer towards the booming Chinese economy . 
Of course , when Obama arrives in Beijing , he must continue to strengthen cooperation with China . 
On the economic crisis , climate change , and many other global issues , China and the US are potentially the decisive actors . 
But the US must also engage in a more multilateral way to include Southeast Asia &apos;s smaller countries . 
China has been charming them over the past decade , and the US must offer an attractive alternative . 
To cynics , APEC is a talking shop , while ASEAN is an arena for an ongoing contest between China and Japan , with India on the side . 
But , despite the rivalries and all the chatter , it is clear that Asians are coming closer together . 
And , while Asian regionalism is messy and rife with tensions and flash points , the US has been the stabilizing power in the region . 
Obama has the opportunity to ensure that the region continues to see the US as the essential actor - now more open and helpful than before . 
If he achieves this , Obama &apos;s long trip will be valuable for Americans , and Asians will realize that it was worth waiting for him .
