China Confronts the Global Meltdown 
BEIJING - For three decades , China has been growing at an average annual rate of 9.8 % . 
For most of this time , world markets were favorable , with no major global economic or financial crisis or slowdown . 
Yes , there were regional crises such as Southeast Asia &apos;s financial turmoil of 1997-1998 or the collapse of Japan &apos;s housing bubble in 1990 and America &apos;s high-tech bubble in 2000 . 
The past three months , however , have seen a significant slowdown in China &apos;s exports , domestic investment , industrial output , and tax revenues . 
A major slowdown seems to be looming . 
Will China &apos;s rapid growth persist ? 
I believe it will . 
Within China , the current slowdown is mostly homemade . 
Since 2004 , China &apos;s government has sought to cool an overheating economy by bringing the growth rate down from 12 % to a more sustainable 8-9 % . 
It even began to tax exports in order to reduce the trade surplus . 
Of course , if Chinese policymakers could have predicted what has now happened in the world economy , they might have been less stringent in trying to rein in growth . 
China &apos;s government never believed that it should leave what happens in the economy solely to the market . 
When there is no big bubble , there is no need to worry about a big crisis . 
Another reason that China &apos;s strong growth is likely to continue is that its economic fundamentals are sound . 
All the factors that encourage high growth remain in place : low labor costs , education , high savings , improving infrastructure , and rapid urbanization . 
Moreover , China &apos;s fiscal position is one of the best in the world . 
Government deficits rarely exceeded 3 % of GDP in past decades , and there were surpluses in recent years . 
Indeed , the government debt-to-GDP ratio is about 20 % , compared with more than 80 % in the United States , 160 % in Japan , and 60-90 % in Europe . 
Monetary policy has been prudent , and the threat of inflation has now been lessened by the decline in commodity and oil prices . 
The international balance of payments remains in surplus , and there is still a net capital inflow despite the global credit crunch . 
Official foreign exchange reserves will soon reach US $ 2 trillion . 
The recent $ 568 billion fiscal stimulus package , which will be spent on railway expansion , subway construction , low-budget housing programs for the poor , irrigation systems , rural social security , and health care , will add a few percentage points to growth over the next couple years . 
With monetary policy and some of the administrative controls on investment and local spending being relaxed , the slowdown should be brief . 
But it is not all good news in China &apos;s economy , because low consumption remains a big weakness . 
Household consumption only accounted for 34 % of GDP and total consumption is less than 50 % of GDP in 2007 . That weakness , however , is institutional and cannot be easily corrected in the short run . 
So , with its domestic economy basically secure , is there anything China can do to help the world economy ? 
If China can manage to maintain real growth at 8 % per annum over the next two years , emerging markets may be able to grow at 4 % . 
That may prevent the world economy from falling into recession . 
Indeed , China now looks like it can play the role of &quot; growth anchor . &quot; 
But China should not be expected to do too much more . 
World financial stabilization , for example , is not something China can do much to help directly . 
China played little part in the global derivatives markets , and does not have much toxic securities to clean up or banks to save in order to unfreeze credit flows . 
Perhaps China should use its $ 1.9 trillion official reserves to buy more foreign debt , but this huge asset pool is already heavily loaded with foreign sovereign bonds , so any increase can only be incremental . 
China is also probably unsuited at the moment to play a central role in reforming the global financial and monetary system in 2009 because it has not yet fully liberalized its capital accounts and financial system . 
So Chinese negotiators would rather play a supporting role and let others , both developed and developing countries , take the lead in most issues concerning risk control and regulations . 
But China is likely to increase its voice on one issue - the US dollar &apos;s status as global reserve currency . 
In China &apos;s view , it is not enough merely to require others to accommodate themselves to dollar devaluation . 
As a developing country with US $ 2,500 per capita income and 35 % of its labor force still in agriculture , where workers earn only about $ 600 per year , China &apos;s domestic problems remain enormous . 
Thus , development will continue to be the top priority , including the development of China &apos;s own financial market . 
The good news is that China recognizes how much it has benefited from the marketization and openness of the past 30 years . 
There is no turning back on its path toward full involvement in the global market , despite the current crisis . 
Indeed , the real challenge for China in the year ahead will be to find ways to deal with growing global protectionism as the financial crisis and economic recession bite ever deeper in its main foreign markets .
