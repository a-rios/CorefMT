Two Funerals and Our Freedom 
MOSCOW - My great-grandfather , Nikita Khrushchev , has been on my mind recently . 
I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called &quot; kitchen debate &quot; which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories . 
But the funeral last week in Budapest of General Béla Király , who commanded the Hungarian Revolution &apos;s freedom fighters in 1956 , and this week &apos;s funeral in Warsaw of the philosopher Leszek Kolakowski , whose break with Stalinism that year inspired many intellectuals ( in Poland and elsewhere ) to abandon communism , made me reconsider my grandfather &apos;s legacy . 
The year 1956 was the best of times and the worst of times for Khrushchev . 
His &quot; secret speech &quot; that year laid bare the monumentality of Stalin &apos;s crimes . 
Soon , the gulag was virtually emptied ; a political thaw began , spurring whispers of freedom that could not be contained . 
In Poland and Hungary , in particular , an underground tide burst forth demanding change . 
Hungary , of course , had its short and glorious revolution . 
That first war among socialist states shattered the myth of inviolable &quot; fraternal &quot; bonds between the Soviet Union and the captive nations of Eastern Europe . 
But Khrushchev never envisioned the breakup of the Soviet empire as part of his thaw . 
So the Red Army invaded Hungary - on a scale larger than the Allies &quot; D-Day invasion of Europe in 1944 . 
Béla Király , released from a sentence of life in prison ( one of the four death sentences he received from the communists having been commuted ) was offered the job of commander of the Hungarian National Guard and the defense of Budapest . 
His task was to knock the rag-tag freedom fighters into an army , but there wasn &apos;t time to stop the Soviet advance . 
So , after a week of heroism he and a few thousand of his men crossed the border into Austria and exile . 
Over the years , a mutual friend often tried to introduce me to General Király , but , to my regret , that meeting never happened . 
Any man who would frame the four death sentences he had received ( one signed by Khrushchev , another by Yuri Andropov , the Soviet ambassador in Budapest in 1956 ) and hang them in his drawing room has the sort of quirky humor I relish . 
And from what I know of the man and his history , particularly his work in Hungary after 1989 , I can only wish that my great-grandfather could have met him . 
Certainly , Király would not have hesitated to meet the man who ordered the invasion . 
After all , when he learned that one of the Russian generals who had led the invasion was still alive in 2006 , Király invited him to Budapest to join the 50th anniversary celebrations . 
When General Yevgeni Malashenko declined in fear that he might be arrested , the 94-year-old Király flew to Moscow , where he spent a long weekend reminiscing and going to a banya for retired Red Army generals . 
Kolakowski , on the other hand , was someone I knew . 
We frequently met at conferences , where it was always a delight to hear him speak Russian - a Russian that had the accent and elegance of Tolstoi and Pushkin , not the degraded Russian bark of Vladimir Putin . 
Like Király , in 1956 , Kolakowski turned against the Communist party he had once joined in the hope , formed in the charnel house that the Nazis had wrought in Poland , that it would build a better world . 
Kolakowski , modern Poland &apos;s most acclaimed philosopher , quickly learned that mendacity was the true building block of Communism , and he withdrew from it in horror . 
By 1968 , the Polish regime could no longer tolerate his presence . 
He was expelled from his post at Warsaw University and , when he went to teach abroad , the government forced him into exile by never allowing him to return . 
The question for me is how these three men with such different backgrounds and trajectories - Khrushchev , a Russian peasant turned proletarian who became General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party ; 
Király , a Magyar soldier of old world Europe , steeped in aristocratic traditions ; and Kolakowski , a gentleman scholar from Warsaw more attuned to Jansenist heresies than the perverse logic of Leninist dialectics - could ultimately contribute to the same goal : the resurrection of liberty in Europe . 
Khrushchev did not really know anything other than Communism . 
He tried to humanize it and undo the cruelty of Stalinist orthodoxy , but never doubted that the Leninist system was the way of the future . 
Király , who subscribed to the old codes of military honor ( he would be named a Righteous Gentile at Yad Vashem , Israel &apos;s Holocaust memorial , for the hundreds of Jews he saved by keeping them with his army during WWII ) , saw that very system as the enemy of his country and its liberty . 
But today , Khrushchev is remembered mostly for his contribution to the demise of Stalinism - and , via Mikhail Gorbachev , whose hero he was , ultimately for helping to bring about communism &apos;s demise . 
Király and Kolakowski became voices of moderation and reconciliation in the Hungary and Poland that emerged out of communism &apos;s darkness at noon . 
Király will be remembered not merely as a warrior , but as a humanist , the conciliator who called for no reprisals after 1989 , and a liberal model for many Hungarians . 
Kolakowski , in upholding the sanctity of truth in the empire of the lie , connected the new democratic Poland to the old Poland of intellect and culture . 
Király , Kolakowski , and Khrushchev : each in his own way is a symbol of today &apos;s new and uniting Europe , a Europe of rapprochement and forgiveness among erstwhile opponents .
