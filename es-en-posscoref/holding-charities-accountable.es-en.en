Holding Charities Accountable 
Suppose you are concerned about children in Africa dying from preventable diseases . 
You want to donate money to a charity that is working to reduce the toll . 
How do you choose ? 
The first thing that many people ask about charities is , &quot; How much of my donation is spent on administration ? &quot; 
In the United States , that figure is readily available from Charity Navigator , a Web site that has five million users . 
But the information is taken from forms that the charities themselves complete and send to the tax authorities . 
No one checks the forms , and the proportions allocated to administration and program expenses are easily massaged with a little creative accounting . 
Worse still , that figure , even if accurate , tells you nothing about the charity &apos;s impact . 
The pressure to keep administrative expenses low can make an organization less effective . 
If , for example , an agency working to reduce poverty in Africa cuts staff with expert knowledge , it is more likely to end up funding projects that fail . 
It may not even know which of its projects fail , because evaluating them , and learning from mistakes , requires staff - and that adds to administrative costs . 
In 2006 , Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld faced the question of which charity would make the best use of their money . 
They were in their mid-twenties , earning six-figure incomes at an investment company - more than they needed - and were thinking about donating money to help make the world a better place . 
As investment advisers , they would never recommend investing in a company without detailed information about how well it was achieving its goals . 
They wanted to make similarly well-informed choices about the charities to which they contributed . 
So Karnofsky and Hassenfeld got together with six friends who also worked in finance and divided up the field to find out which charities could be shown to be effective . 
They contacted organizations and received lots of attractive marketing material , but nothing that answered basic questions : what do the charities do with their money , and what evidence do they have that their activities help ? 
They called many charities , but eventually realized something that seemed extraordinary : the information was just not there . 
Some foundations said that information on their work &apos;s effectiveness was confidential . 
This , Karnofsky and Hassenfeld thought , is not a good way to go about charitable work . 
Why should information about how to help people be secret ? 
The fact that charities were unprepared for such questions indicated to Karnofsky and Hassenfeld that other donors and foundations give more or less blindly , without the information needed to make sound decisions about whom to support . 
Karnofsky and Hassenfeld now had a new goal : to obtain and publicize the information . 
To that end , they founded an organization called GiveWell so that other donors would not have as hard a time extracting it as they had had . 
However , it soon became apparent that the task required more than part-time attention , and the following year , after raising $ 300,000 from their colleagues , Karnofsky and Hassenfeld left their jobs and began working full-time for GiveWell and its associated grant-making body , The Clear Fund . 
They invited charities to apply for grants of $ 25,000 in five broad humanitarian categories , with the application process demanding the kind of information that they had been seeking . 
In this way , a substantial part of the money they had raised would go to the most effective charity in each category , while simultaneously encouraging transparency and rigorous evaluation . 
The first report on which organizations are most effective at saving or transforming lives in Africa is now available on GiveWell &apos;s Web site , www.givewell.net . 
Population Services International , which promotes and sells items like condoms , to prevent HIV infection , and bed nets , to prevent malaria , came out on top , followed by Partners in Health , an organization that provides health care to poor rural populations . 
The third-ranked organization was Interplast , which is more narrowly focused on correcting deformities like cleft palate . 
Evaluating charities can be more difficult than making investment decisions . 
Investors are interested in financial returns , so there is no problem about measuring distinct values - in the end it all comes down to money . 
It is more difficult to compare the reduction of suffering brought about by correcting a facial deformity with saving a life . 
There is no single unit of value . 
In other ways , too , evaluating charities takes time , and can be expensive . 
Perhaps for this reason , many organizations , including some of the best-known anti-poverty organizations working in Africa , did not respond to GiveWell &apos;s request for information . 
No doubt they calculated that a chance to get a $ 25,000 grant wasn &apos;t worth it . 
But if donors start to follow GiveWell &apos;s recommendations , then a high ranking from GiveWell could be worth far more than the value of the grant . 
This is why the potential of GiveWell is revolutionary . 
In the US , individual donors give about $ 200 billion to charities each year . 
No one knows how effective that vast sum is in achieving the goals that donors intend to support . 
By giving charities an incentive to become more transparent and more focused on being demonstrably effective , GiveWell could make our charitable donations do much more good than ever before .
