The Media Versus the Mentally Ill 
MELBOURNE - James Holmes , accused of opening fire in a crowded movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , last summer , had no criminal history , but was seeing a psychiatrist prior to the incident . 
Adam Lanza , suspected of murdering his mother and gunning down 20 children and six adult staff members at a Connecticut elementary school before taking his own life , had never been in legal trouble , but had been diagnosed with a &quot; personality disorder , &quot; as well as the developmental disorder Asperger syndrome . 
Anders Behring Breivik in Norway , Jared Lee Loughner in Arizona , Seung-Hui Cho in Virginia - the list of mass murderers defined according to their mental illnesses goes on . 
The fact is that deciding to murder , at random , a large number of innocent people reflects deeply disturbed thinking , which might reflect a mental illness . 
But , contrary to popular belief , this does not mean that people with mental illnesses are likely to be dangerous or violent . 
The belief that they are - and the reporting that feeds it - is reinforcing widespread stigmatization of those with mental illness , increasing their suffering and preventing them from participating fully in society . 
Public perceptions of the risk of violence associated with mental illness are at odds with the facts . 
In the United States , for example , roughly 42 % of adults believe that a depressed child is likely to be dangerous . And 70 % of Americans believe that patients hospitalized for a mental illness may be dangerous . 
But , according to the American Psychiatric Association , people with mental disorders , who account for roughly one-quarter of the population in a given year , commit only 4-5 % of violent crimes . 
Indeed , while mentally ill people may be more likely to commit violent acts if they are not treated , or are misusing alcohol or drugs , the risk is small . 
Personal experience usually refutes the link between mental illness and violence . 
A survey of the American public found that , while 68 % of adults knew at least one person who had been hospitalized with a mental illness and 10 % knew five or more people , only 9 % had ever been threatened or physically harmed by such a person . 
People in close contact with the mentally ill , such as mental-health professionals and family members of people affected , are the least likely to believe that they are dangerous . 
The discrepancy between experience and perception is largely caused by the media , which frequently link mental illness with acts of violence . 
One study of American newspaper reports found that 39 % of reports concerning mental illness were focused on violence or danger . 
In Germany , extensive reports on violent attacks against prominent politicians by two people suffering from schizophrenia in 1990 bolstered the German public &apos;s belief that mentally ill people are dangerous . 
Coverage of violent acts that result in multiple deaths is particularly extensive . 
The public inevitably seeks some explanation , and the media will explore any potential link to mental illness to provide one - for example , acquaintances &quot; reports of &quot; odd &quot; behavior and social withdrawal or accounts of previous interactions with mental-health professionals . 
Meanwhile , defense attorneys may try to lessen their client &apos;s culpability by claiming insanity , as Breivik &apos;s lawyers attempted to do after he killed 77 people to protest the multiculturalism that he claims threatens Norway . 
Although this approach is rarely successful - Breivik received a 21-year sentence - it is widely reported , linking crime to mental illness in the minds of the public . 
The perception that mentally ill people are dangerous is global . 
The major exception is the US , where the ready availability of firearms contributes to one of the highest homicide rates - and the highest gun homicide rate - among developed countries . 
Given that multiple homicides in the US draw international interest , media reports highlighting a perpetrator &apos;s mental illness or describing insanity pleas inform perceptions of mental illness worldwide . 
Loughner &apos;s shooting of 19 people in 2011 , including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords , attracted global attention , as did the court-ordered evaluation of his mental competency . 
Indeed , on the other side of the world , the newspaper The Australian mentioned Giffords 160 times in the six months following the shooting , compared to just one mention in the previous 12 months . 
Though mass shootings are extremely rare even in the US , the media &apos;s coverage continually reinforces negative perceptions at home and abroad . 
In this manner , the US may well be exporting the mental-illness stigma to the rest of the world . 
Similarly , Cho &apos;s history of mental illness was widely discussed . 
Moreover , his mental-health records were released to the public two years later , reviving the link between his crime - killing 32 people and wounding 17 others before committing suicide - and his mental illness . 
In this context , US President Barack Obama &apos;s gun-control efforts - which include intensifying background-check requirements and increasing financing for mental-health programs for young people - hold global significance . 
While expanding the scope of mental-health services is a positive step , with the potential to contribute to the physical safety of US citizens , it is crucial that this link not be allowed to feed the perception that people with mental illnesses are dangerous . 
Rather , American legislators and media outlets must use their international influence to reduce the stigma experienced by people suffering from mental illnesses worldwide .
