Tiananmen Square Revisited 
NEW YORK - The publication of secret , audio-taped memoirs by fallen Communist Party reformer Zhao Ziyang , who sought to &quot; eradicate the malady of China &apos;s economic system at its roots &quot; and died under house arrest for his efforts , is reigniting debate over the complex legacy of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . 
Indeed , as China looms ever larger in the world economy , it is worth remembering that 20 years ago this June , the People &apos;s Republic of China almost fell apart . 
The protest movement that gathered in Tiananmen that year posed an existential threat to the Communist Party state , proclaimed in that very spot 40 years earlier by Mao Zedong . 
The threat came from two directions - from within the highest echelons of the Party leadership , where ideological differences over reform split the ruling Politburo , and from the urban masses , who , with Beijing &apos;s university students at the vanguard , stood in open , peaceful revolt against state authority . 
Amazingly , the Party emerged from the crisis unified around Deng Xiaoping &apos;s vision of a &quot; socialist market economy , &quot; and regained legitimacy with the urban population through implementing that vision . 
The Party restored unity on the platform of globally integrated , market-driven growth , to be achieved without the intercession of the students &quot; &quot; Goddess of Democracy , &quot; but bringing tangible material benefit to city residents . 
Sure enough , urban development , investment , and GDP growth accelerated throughout the 1990 &quot; s , but so did the gap between urban winners and rural losers . 
The protest energy that briefly electrified Tiananmen Square dissipated out of the cities and spread across the countryside . 
At the euphoric outset of the 1989 demonstrations , more than 80,000 students marched through the streets of Beijing demanding a more responsive government . 
By 2005 , there were more than 80,000 mass disturbances reported across the country - but mostly not in the booming coastal cities , and certainly not at the elite national universities . 
Over the past 20 years , laid-off workers , dispossessed farmers , Falun Gong practitioners , and angry Tibetans have organized protests . 
No student-led , urban protests like those of Tiananmen Square of 1989 , however , have occurred . 
The economic boom under President Jiang Zemin and his successor , Hu Jintao , which channeled youthful revolt into entrepreneurship and professional success , was possible only because Deng prevented the Party leadership from fracturing during the student protests of the late 1980 &quot; s and the conservative backlash of the early 1990 &quot; s . 
As the protests began , Deng &apos;s chosen successor , Premier Zhao Ziyang , was tempted to use the mass movement as a lever to push harder for market reform , and possibly political reform . 
If China was going to have its own Mikhail Gorbachev , it would have been Zhao . 
Deng supported Zhao &apos;s drive to liberalize the economy , even though it was creating mixed results in 1988 and 1989 , with inflation spiking and economic anxiety pervasive . 
And Zhao &apos;s toleration of the demonstrators was dividing the Politburo into factions . 
So Deng fed Zhao to the Party &apos;s more conservative lions . Hardliners emerged triumphant in the wake of the crackdown . In their eyes , the tumult of 1989 proved that &quot; reform and opening &quot; were leading to chaos and collapse . 
Deng temporarily withdrew , letting the central planners around Party elder Chen Yun slow down marketization and weather the PRC &apos;s international isolation in Tiananmen &apos;s wake . 
But then , with his famous &quot; southern tour &quot; in early 1992 , Deng orchestrated the eclipse of the anti-market , conservative faction . 
In the boomtown of Shenzhen , with television cameras rolling , Deng jabbed his finger in the air , admonishing his Party : &quot; If China does not practice socialism , does not carry on with &quot; reform and opening &quot; and economic development , does not improve people &apos;s standards of living , then no matter what direction we go , it will be a dead end . &quot; 
Having begrudgingly purged the reformers in 1989 , Deng in 1992 seized the opportunity to sideline the central planners , bringing in China &apos;s neo-liberal hero , Zhu Rongji , to re-fire the engines of the economy . 
The new Party leadership of the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 &quot; s did not waver from Deng &apos;s line : steady expansion of market reforms , active involvement in international commerce , massive urbanization and urban development , and total dedication to Party unity . 
June 4 , the day Peoples &quot; Liberation Army troops drove the students and their supporters from Tiananmen Square , is remembered in the West as a tragic example of state violence against unarmed citizens , and a memorial to the suppressed yearnings of the Chinese people for freedom and democracy . 
By reunifying the Party leadership and re-establishing solidarity between the Party and the urban population , the crisis consolidated CCP rule , and accelerated China &apos;s momentum down its current path of rapid economic growth . 
In her classic study On Revolution , Hannah Arendt observed darkly that &quot; whatever brotherhood human beings may be capable of has grown out of fratricide , whatever political organization men may have achieved has its origin in crime . &quot; 
The bloodstained Square on the morning of June 4 was in this sense perhaps the birthplace of post-revolutionary China .
