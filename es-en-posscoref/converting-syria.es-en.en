Converting Syria 
An Arab-Israeli peace requires a comprehensive approach , because the problems at stake are intertwined . 
Not only are key issues such as Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees insoluble without an all-Arab consensus , but any country that is left out of the peace process is bound to persist in its role as a revolutionary power bent on regional destabilization . 
Admittedly , Israeli governments have never liked the idea of negotiating peace with all enemies simultaneously , if only because the political costs of the required concessions would be unbearable . 
The Israeli strategy of peacemaking therefore oscillates between two visions : while the Israeli left gives priority to the Palestinian problem , the Israeli right prefers pursuing a settlement with the big Arab powers . 
The current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the American veto on negotiations with Syria indicate that we have returned to the &quot; Palestine first &quot; concept . 
With the Americans still refraining from engaging in a Clinton-like level of committed mediation , the parties look to be incapable of meeting each other &apos;s minimal requirements for a settlement . 
Their failure would have dire consequences for the entire region . 
The Syria-Iran-Hamas-Hezbollah axis would be emboldened in its challenge to American leadership in the region , and , with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas humbled and defeated , a third Intifada would be a likely scenario . 
It is therefore vitally important to take Syria , an ally of Iran and the patron of spoilers such as Hamas and Hezbollah , out of the war equation . 
The muted response of the Arab states to Israel &apos;s recent mysterious air raid on its territory reflects its isolation within the Arab world - an isolation with which the Syrians are extremely uncomfortable . 
The Ba &apos;athist regime in Damascus is marked by two major formative experiences : Hafez al-Assad &apos;s loss of the Golan Heights to Israel , and his son Bashar &apos;s loss of Lebanon . 
Recovering the Golan , gaining recognition of Syria &apos;s special interests in Lebanon , and reconciling with America are thus vital objectives for the regime and the best way that Bashar al-Assad can boost his legitimacy at home . 
Syria &apos;s readmission into the Arab consensus and financial support from the Gulf monarchies for abandoning the Shi &apos;a alliance with Iran and Hezbollah would also be significant gains . 
Bashar may lack his father &apos;s acumen , but he , too , knows a simple truth : peace with Israel is the price to pay . 
The question remains whether Bashar understands that peace is not only about regaining the Golan , but also about normalization of relations with Israel , which his father was reluctant to allow . 
The old Assad feared that open borders and the end of the politics of conflict might erode his one-party system . 
Peace thus requires a degree of political and socioeconomic change to diminish the appetite for military adventurism . 
A Damascene conversion is not only possible , but is also vital for regional peace . 
The most realistic scenario is now a three-front war pitting Israel against Syria , Hamas , and Hezbollah . 
The only way to extricate Syria from the fatal Iranian embrace is to draw it into a regional scheme for peace . 
Alas , precisely because of their isolation and the Ba &apos;athist regime &apos;s paranoiac nature , the Syrians are unlikely to meet the US condition for peace talks : abandoning their current rogue alliances and their marriage with terror . 
The idea that the Arab-Israeli peace process requires choosing between a Syrian or a Palestinian track has proved to be a dangerous fallacy . 
Neither the Palestinians nor the Syrians will acquiesce to their exclusion . 
A revolutionary force in international relations is one whose level of dissatisfaction with the status quo is such that it works to undermine it at any price . 
In addition to reviewing the state of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations , the November Middle East conference that President George W. Bush has called should begin to build a platform for an Israeli-Syrian negotiating track and a region-wide forum where clear rules of conduct and engagement are agreed by all . 
Of course , this conference will not bring an end to the Damascus-Tehran axis .
