Twenty-Five Years of HIV / AIDS 
It is now a quarter-century since the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) was recognized . 
The knowledge that has been gained since then has been breathtaking , and the pace at which basic research has been translated into lifesaving treatments is unprecedented . 
The discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) as the cause of AIDS was followed by elucidation of its pathogenesis , natural history , and epidemiology , the creation of a diagnostic blood test , and the development of antiretroviral drugs . 
In 1996 , the approval of the first drug of a class called protease inhibitors led to the adoption of a multi-drug , anti-HIV regimen known as highly active antiretroviral therapy , or HAART . 
This advance dramatically transformed the quality of life and extended the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals . 
Moreover , antiretroviral drugs given to pregnant HIV-infected women and newborns have proven enormously successful in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV . 
As a result , since these combinations of drugs were introduced , at least three million years of life have been saved in the United States alone . 
We now have more than two dozen approved anti-HIV drugs and drug combinations , and a robust pipeline of next-generation drugs in various stages of development and clinical testing . 
But nowadays our task is to apply these scientific and technological advances to delivering treatment and prevention strategies to people throughout the world , particularly those in resource-poor nations . 
Despite the successes in treating HIV / AIDS in the United States and other developed countries , it is clear that efforts to combat the pandemic must be scaled up in Africa , Asia , and other parts of the world where HIV / AIDS exacts its greatest toll . 
Indeed , an estimated 40 million people throughout the world are infected with HIV ; nearly three million died of AIDS in 2006 alone . 
Programs such as the President &apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , and philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation have helped make drugs available to treat 2 million people infected with HIV in lower- and middle-income countries . 
But fewer than 25 % of the people in these countries who need antiretroviral drugs are receiving them . 
With 4.3 million new HIV infections each year throughout the world , we face an untenable situation , as new HIV infections far outstrip our ability to treat all those infected . 
So improvements in our ability to prevent HIV infections from occurring are desperately needed . 
A wide array of prevention strategies , including behavioral modification , distribution of condoms , and the provision of clean needles and syringes to intravenous drug users , has emerged . 
Recent studies suggest that adult male circumcision can be a promising prevention strategy , if properly and hygienically performed and accompanied by appropriate counseling and post-surgical care . 
Likewise , the ongoing development of topical microbicides offers the hope of empowering women to protect themselves from HIV infection when using condoms or refusing sexual intercourse is not feasible . 
But the greatest scientific and public health goal in HIV / AIDS research still eludes us : the development of an effective HIV vaccine . 
This challenge has been particularly difficult because of the nature of the virus , particularly its ability to integrate itself into the genome of host cells , to readily mutate , and to conceal that part of its outer coat that would induce protective antibodies . 
We also know that the body &apos;s natural immune response against HIV is inadequate in containing or controlling the virus . 
Indeed , since the discovery of HIV , there has never been a documented case in which an individual &apos;s immune system has ever completely eradicated the virus following established infection . 
Many current studies focus on developing vaccines that might not completely prevent HIV infection , but that still could slow the progression of HIV or make a person less likely to pass the virus on to others . 
But our ultimate goal is to develop a vaccine that can prevent HIV infection . 
To succeed , we must solve the mystery of how to induce the human body to produce a protective immune response . 
Despite the extraordinary scientific and medical accomplishments in the battle against HIV / AIDS so far , history will judge us by what we accomplish in the next quarter-century , and how we respond to the challenge of delivering the fruits of our research efforts to those who need them most .
