The Re-Education of Hong Kong 
HONG KONG - After less than 100 days in office , C.Y. Leung , Hong Kong &apos;s new Chief Executive , is already in political intensive care . 
In record time , he has managed to lose his veneer of competence , credibility , and steely leadership . 
One of his cabinet appointees was arrested for corruption within two weeks of Leung &apos;s assumption of his official duties . 
Another was found to have been a slumlord who owned illegal cage-like flats that he blamed entirely on his wife , denying any involvement whatsoever . 
Leung himself was caught with several illegal structures in his house , a violation that he exploited successfully against his rival , Henry Tang , in the election campaign . 
Leung has also distinguished himself by inciting a large swathe of school teachers and students to stage massive street protests against his hasty effort to insert a &quot; national education &quot; program into the school curriculum in order to &quot; reconnect &quot; Hong Kong &apos;s young people with the motherland . 
For tens of thousands of student protesters , many with their parents in tow , the potential death of an honest education was too much to bear . 
The goal of the program , inherited from the previous administration , is a good one : expand knowledge among the young about modern China . 
But , as Tang correctly pointed out in response to a question about the protests , the &quot; devil is in the details . &quot; 
What triggered the uproar was the appearance of a &quot; model &quot; textbook , financed by the government and published by a pro-China think tank . 
The textbook contains mostly propaganda , including assertions that China &apos;s one-party system is wonderful , whereas multiparty democracy as practiced in the United States has created harmful social turbulence . 
It offers no discussion of the lethal policies since 1949 that led to the persecution and starvation of tens of millions of Chinese . 
Nor does it mention the fratricidal political movements from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution . 
The program was clearly meant to indoctrinate , not educate . 
Massive protests forced Leung to withdraw a deadline to implement the new curriculum . 
He has also given the schools flexibility concerning when and perhaps how to introduce it . 
Since nearly all schools are dependent on government subsidies , the grant of flexibility is widely perceived to be a tactical delay . 
With the job security of schoolmasters at risk , most are sure to implement the program . 
The protesters , led by a 15-year-old student , now a folk hero , have retreated , but that , too , is a tactical decision . 
The students have promised to continue to fight the program until it is scrapped . 
But why does China &apos;s government seek to impose the curriculum in the first place ? 
After all , Hong Kong has one of the world &apos;s most educated populations : the city has , in per capita terms , perhaps more graduates of the world &apos;s top 20 universities than anywhere outside of Manhattan . 
Nevertheless , after more than 60 years in power , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) continues to retain a deep sense of insecurity . 
The Internet may be ubiquitous in modern China , but YouTube and Facebook , so accepted as a part of normal life around the world , are still banned , and the Public Security Bureau has built a vast Internet monitoring system to filter and censor whatever China &apos;s leaders believe they must fear . 
While dissent is the lifeblood of any open society , for China it is a dangerous poison . 
Moreover , China fears that Hong Kong , with a population of less than eight million , might present a systemic problem as an alternative form of government , even though many Communists and their allies hold key positions in Hong Kong &apos;s private and public sectors . 
Instead of accepting that &quot; love &quot; cannot be enforced and must be won , Hong Kong &apos;s over-zealous &quot; patriots &quot; cannot wait to show their loyalty by trying to mandate primitive propaganda . 
Few in Hong Kong are buying the political elite &apos;s mantra that the national education program is the &quot; right &quot; thing to do . 
They know that practically all of the ruling elite &apos;s children attend expensive schools in the United States and the United Kingdom , where they would be shielded from the mindless drivel at home . 
Leung &apos;s son , for example , is reportedly a student at Winchester College , one of the UK &apos;s most exclusive boarding schools . 
And most , if not all , of the children of the ruling elite in Beijing are in a similar position . 
The daughter of Xi Jinping , the presumptive future leader who has now reemerged from an unexplained absence , is attending Harvard under an assumed name . 
Disgraced ex-Politburo member Bo Xilai &apos;s hard-partying son , Bo Guagua , attended Harrow , Winston Churchill &apos;s alma mater , then Oxford and Harvard . 
Their parents clearly know that &quot; national education &quot; is not needed for a good education . 
Unfortunately , Hong Kong &apos;s younger generation is losing confidence in democracy . 
Popular elections do not translate into representation in a system designed by China to ensure that its allies win a majority every time . 
As a result , more and more young people are turning to street demonstrations to make their voices heard . 
And , while no one in Hong Kong wants independence from China , continued strong-arm tactics to force Hong Kong to &quot; love &quot; China could begin to inspire such sentiments . 
Leung &apos;s tone-deafness to popular feeling revives one of the main issues that he managed to dodge during the election campaign . 
At the time , he denied vehemently that he was a member of the CCP . 
He claimed that he had only Hong Kong &apos;s interest in mind within the limits of China &apos;s &quot; one country , two systems &quot; formula . 
So far , however , he seems inclined to make one of those systems resemble the other . 
But China &apos;s national interest is to ensure that Hong Kong remains a first-rate city , modern and open . 
Pulling Hong Kong down , in the name of patriotism , can only impede the advance to modernity that all of China needs to become truly great .
