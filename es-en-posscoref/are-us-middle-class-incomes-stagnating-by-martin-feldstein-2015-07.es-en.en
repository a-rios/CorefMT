Are US Middle-Class Incomes Really Stagnating ? 
CAMBRIDGE - The challenge of raising the incomes of middle-class families has emerged as an important focus of the presidential election campaign in the United States . 
Everyone agrees that incomes at the top have surged ahead in recent decades , helped by soaring rewards for those with a high-tech education and rising share prices . 
And there is general support for improving programs - such as food stamps and means-tested retiree benefits - that help those who would otherwise be poor . 
Here , much can be done by improving existing government programs : expanding market-relevant training , increasing opportunities for married women to join or rejoin the labor force , reducing the penalties in Social Security rules for continued employment by older workers , and changing tax rules in ways that will increase productivity and wages . 
But , while strengthening such programs should be a high priority , we should not lose sight of how well middle-income families have actually done over the past few decades . 
Unfortunately , the political debate is distorted by misleading statistics that grossly understate these gains . 
For example , it is frequently said that the average household income has risen only slightly , or not at all , for the past few decades . 
Some US Census figures seem to support that conclusion . 
The US Census Bureau estimates the money income that households receive from all sources and identifies the income level that divides the top and bottom halves of the distribution . 
This is the median household income . 
To compare median household incomes over time , the authorities divide these annual dollar values by the consumer price index to create annual real median household incomes . 
The resulting numbers imply that the cumulative increase from 1984 through 2013 was less than 10 % , equivalent to less than 0.3 % per year . 
Any adult who was alive in the US during these three decades realizes that this number grossly understates the gains of the typical household . 
One indication that something is wrong with this figure is that the government also estimates that real hourly compensation of employees in the non-farm business sector rose 39 % from 1985 to 2015 . 
The official Census estimate suffers from three important problems . 
For starters , it fails to recognize the changing composition of the population ; the household of today is quite different from the household of 30 years ago . 
Moreover , the Census Bureau &apos;s estimate of income is too narrow , given that middle-income families have received increasing government transfers while benefiting from lower income-tax rates . 
Finally , the price index used by the Census Bureau fails to capture the important contributions of new products and product improvements to Americans &quot; standard of living . 
Consider first the changing nature of households . 
From 1980 to 2010 , the share of &quot; households &quot; that consisted of just a single man or woman rose from 26 % to 33 % , while the share that contained married couples declined from 60 % to 50 % . 
When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) conducted a detailed study of changes in household incomes from 1979 to 2011 , it expanded the definition of income to include near-cash benefits like food stamps and in-kind benefits like health care . 
It also subtracted federal taxes , which fell from 19 % of pretax income for middle-income households in 1980 to just 11.5 % in 2010 . 
To convert annual incomes to real incomes , the CBO used the price deflator for consumer expenditures , which many believe is better for this purpose than the consumer price index . 
The CBO also presented a separate analysis that adjusted for household size . 
With the traditional definition of money income , the CBO found that real median household income rose by just 15 % from 1980 to 2010 , similar to the Census Bureau &apos;s estimate . 
Adjusting for household size boosted this gain to 53 % . 
And , again , even this more substantial rise probably represents a substantial underestimate of the increase in the real standard of living . 
The authorities arrive at their estimates by converting dollar incomes into a measure of real income by using a price index that reflects the changes in the prices of existing goods and services . 
Thus , if everyone &apos;s money incomes rose by 2 % from one year to the next , while the prices of all goods and services also rose by 2 % , the official calculation would show no change in real incomes , even if new products and important quality improvements contributed to our wellbeing . 
Indeed , the US government does not count the value created by Internet services like Google and Facebook as income at all , because these services are not purchased . 
No one knows how much such product innovations and improvements have added to our wellbeing . 
So the US middle class has been doing much better than the statistical pessimists assert .
