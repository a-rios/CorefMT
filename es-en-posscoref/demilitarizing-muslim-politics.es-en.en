Demilitarizing Muslim Politics 
ISLAMABAD - Can Muslim governments free themselves from their countries &quot; powerful militaries and establish civilian control comparable to that found in liberal democracies ? 
This question is now paramount in countries as disparate as Egypt , Pakistan , and Turkey . 
To predict how this struggle will play out , it helps to understand the region &apos;s past . 
Since Islam &apos;s founding in the seventh century , it has maintained a tradition of deep military engagement in politics and governance . 
Indeed , Islam &apos;s increasing military prowess helped it to spread rapidly around the world . 
The military was responsible for Islam &apos;s implantation throughout the Middle East , as well as in Persia , Southern Europe , and the Indian sub-continent . 
And once a Muslim state was established in newly conquered lands , the military became integral to its governance . 
The military &apos;s incorporation into the state was most prominent in the Ottoman Empire , whose rulers created a new type of military force that drew its manpower mostly from Islamic-ruled parts of Europe . 
These Janissaries ( Christian boys conscripted to serve in Ottoman infantry units ) were either recruited from Europe or abducted from countries under Ottoman control . 
Janissaries were not allowed to marry or to own property , which prevented them from developing loyalties outside of the imperial court . 
But , after these restrictions were removed in the sixteenth century , and up until their extermination in the nineteenth century , the Janissaries became extremely powerful in Istanbul ( and even established their own dynasty in Egypt ) . 
Military domination in Muslim countries survived right up to the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early twentieth century . 
The colonial powers that filled the vacuum left by the declining empire had their own militaries , and therefore did not need local forces to govern . 
But when Europeans withdrew from the Muslim world in the twentieth century , these forces rushed back in to wrest control of politics . 
The military rose to power in Egypt , Pakistan , and other Arab countries in the early and mid-twentieth century . 
In Turkey , the military proclaimed itself the guardian of the secular Republic of Turkey , founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , himself a military man . 
Today , the revolutions rocking much of the Muslim world are bedeviled by Islam &apos;s military past . 
In the first phase of these popular uprisings , those who had been politically and economically excluded began to demand inclusion and participation . 
Now a second phase is underway , marked by a serious effort to divest the old military establishment of its power . 
This struggle is manifesting itself in different ways in Egypt , Turkey , and Pakistan . 
In Egypt , the military &apos;s takeover of the political transition after the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak is unacceptable to Muslim and secular forces alike . 
Most Egyptians want the soldiers to leave politics and return to their barracks . 
Essam el-Erian , whose Islamist Freedom and Justice Party recently won the most seats in Egypt &apos;s parliamentary elections , recently said that the Muslim Brotherhood ( to which the party is closely tied ) , does not expect the military rulers to relinquish power voluntarily . 
They will have to be persuaded to leave , and , if that does not work , forced out . 
The parliament &apos;s first step in ultimately removing them would be to defend its authority to choose the members of a planned 100-person constitutional assembly . 
Meanwhile , in Turkey , the Justice and Development Party , which has strong roots in the country &apos;s Islamic tradition , is now seeking to limit the military &apos;s role . 
The armed forces , however , claim a constitutional mandate to protect the Republic &apos;s secular traditions . 
And Turkey &apos;s generals have intervened in politics several times to defend Kemalism - Atatürk &apos;s secular ideology of modernization that pushed Islamic Turkey towards European-style liberalism . 
But , of the three countries , Turkey has most successfully demilitarized its politics . 
The charismatic prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , having won three consecutive elections , has been able to exert his authority over the military . 
Controversially , he has jailed the army &apos;s top general , İlker Başbuğ , whom Turkish prosecutors have accused - many say implausibly - of plotting to overthrow the government . 
Finally , Pakistan &apos;s military , which has governed the country for half of its 64-year history , is fighting hard to retain influence over policymaking . 
Humbled by its inability to control United States military operations , including the one that killed Osama bin Laden , the army is struggling to play a hand in the country &apos;s evolving relations with India and the US . 
Since the Arab Spring began , four long-established regimes have been removed , while others are under increasing pressure , giving ordinary Arabs hope that their demands will no longer be ignored , and that those who govern will be mindful of citizens &quot; needs . 
But that - the real revolution - will happen only when true representatives of citizens , rather than the military , begin to set their countries &quot; political course .
