Countdown to Withdrawal from Iraq 
How long will the United States maintain a large deployment of troops in Iraq ? 
That is now the central question of George W. Bush &apos;s second term . 
Until recently , the Bush administration answered with an evasive clich√© : &quot; as long as it takes and not one day longer . &quot; 
But not anymore . 
The ice began to crack on November 17 , when Representative John Murtha , a hawkish Democratic congressman and marine veteran , suggested pulling troops out of Iraq in six months . 
Soon after , the Republican-controlled Senate voted for &quot; a significant transition to full Iraq sovereignty in 2006 . &quot; 
After initial resistance , Bush began to change his rhetoric by suggesting that a troop drawdown would occur sooner than previously expected . 
The erosion in public support for Bush &apos;s Iraq policy is stark . 
Fifty-four percent of Americans now say that the US erred in sending troops , up from 24 % at the start of the war in March 2003 . 
In part , this reflects the rising casualty rate , with more than 2,100 American soldiers killed thus far . 
But it also reflects a growing belief that the war is failing . 
As Duke University &apos;s Peter Feaver , an expert on public opinion who is now serving as a White House advisor , recently pointed out , Americans will tolerate casualties when they believe that a war is just and has a reasonable prospect of success . 
The administration is paying the price for overselling the reasons for the war and bungling the post-invasion occupation . 
Not surprisingly , Bush &apos;s new rhetoric stresses that he has a &quot; strategy for victory . &quot; 
If &quot; victory &quot; remains defined as stable democracy in Iraq , it is unlikely that Bush will have enough time to implement his strategy . 
In September , General George Casey , the senior American military commander in Iraq , testified to Congress that modern insurgencies last about a decade , and that the Iraqi army had only one battalion capable of fighting without help from American military forces . 
A month later , the influential International Institute for Strategic Studies in London estimated that US troop withdrawals next year were likely to be small , and that it would take at least five years for Iraq to build the 300,000-strong army needed to fight the insurgency on its own . 
But , with Congressional elections in 2006 and a presidential election in 2008 , five years is too long . 
It seems more realistic that the Republican administration will have only 18 months to two years to implement its strategy . 
The Democrats , meanwhile , are divided . 
Some , like John Murtha and Nancy Pelosi , the minority leader in the House of Representatives , want a short timetable , while others , like Senator Joseph Biden , resists a firm timetable but predicts a withdrawal of 50,000 US troops in 2006 , with many of the remaining 100,000 to follow in 2007 . 
Those of us who believe that invading Iraq was a mistake , and that Bush is guilty of hubris in his failure to plan adequately for the aftermath , face a dilemma : if America withdraws too precipitously , it may compound these mistakes . 
Iraq is not like Vietnam , where American departure was followed by stability imposed by an authoritarian government . 
In Iraq , the danger is that departure could be followed by civil war and chaos - ideal conditions for terrorists to maintain havens . 
Iraq differs from Vietnam in another way as well . 
Unlike the North Vietnamese , the Sunni insurgents will have a difficult time taking over a country where they represent only 20 % of the population . 
Indeed , with Shia Arabs and Kurds making up 80 % of the country , the insurgency is focused on only four of Iraq &apos;s 18 provinces . 
So long as a large number of American troops remains as an occupying force , they serve as a recruiting tool for insurgents . 
As the political scientist Robert Pape has shown in a careful study , resistance to foreign occupation is a prime motivation for suicide bombers . 
But , if America leaves too soon , the elected Iraqi government may be unable to cope with the insurgency , sending Iraq the way of Lebanon in the 1980 &quot; s or Afghanistan in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Similarly , if Bush sets a short timetable , he may encourage the insurgents to wait him out . 
The key to resolving this dilemma will be to press for local compromises that involve Sunnis in the political process , and to step up the rate of training of Iraqis to manage their own security . 
Even then , success is uncertain . 
One failure is already clear : that of the neo-conservative dream of creating a military ally that could serve as a long-term base for American troops in the campaign to transform and democratize the Middle East . 
Three elections have produced some degree of legitimacy for the Shia-dominated Iraqi government , but without a sense of community and effective institutions , elections merely create a tyranny of the majority . 
That may be better than Saddam Hussein &apos;s tyranny of the minority , but it is hardly modern democracy . 
Bush compares his goal in Iraq to the democratization of Japan after World War II . 
Even then , success took seven years . 
Instead , Bush should plan on a two-year window to give the Iraqi government as strong a chance as possible before the Americans leave , while emphasizing that Iraqis will thereafter be responsible for their own security and political salvation .
