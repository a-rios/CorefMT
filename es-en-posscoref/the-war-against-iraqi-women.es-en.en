The War Against Iraqi Women 
BAGHDAD - Iraqi women &apos;s organizations and international observers point to an escalating war against women in Iraq , aided by the widespread chaos and lawlessness under the US occupation . 
In addition to violence by US troops inside and outside of prisons , women in Iraq face daily violence from militants under the guise of religion and &quot; liberation . &quot; 
In Iraq &apos;s second largest city , Basra , a stronghold of conservative Shia groups , as many as 133 women were killed last year for violating &quot; Islamic teachings &quot; and in so-called &quot; honor killings , &quot; according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs . 
The methods are brutal evidence of a backlash by previously subdued tribal forces that have been unleashed by the occupation : women strangled and beheaded , and their hands , arms and legs chopped off . 
With US forces in Iraq now funding both Sunni and Shia tribal leaders in an effort to stabilize the country , conditions for women grow deadlier by the day . 
Islamist leaders have imposed new restrictions on women , including prohibitions on work , bans on travel without a muhram ( male guardian ) , and compulsory veiling . 
According to the Organization of Women &apos;s Freedom in Iraq ( OWFI ) , formed in Baghdad in 2003 , women are harassed if they appear in the streets of most Iraqi cities and towns , educational institutions , or work places . 
Now there are even &quot; no woman zones &quot; in some southern cities controlled by Islamist parties and tribal leaders . 
Honor killings of Iraqi women are justified by alleged promiscuity or adultery . 
In fact , the practice targets holders of PhD &apos;s , professionals , political activists , and office workers . 
&quot; Politically active women , those who did not follow a strict dress code , and women human rights defenders were increasingly at risk of abuse , including by armed groups and religious extremists , &quot; Amnesty International said in its 2007 report . 
Indeed , a top police official in Basra reported that as many as 15 women are killed every month in the city . 
Ambulance drivers in Basra , paid to &quot; clean the streets &quot; before people go to work , pick up many more bodies of women every morning . 
Ironically , the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under Saddam Hussein . 
But , following the US-led invasion in 2003 , southern Iraq was opened to forces known as Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ( PVPV ) - militant gangs and individuals committed to archaic Islamic rule and suppression of women &apos;s rights . 
Some members of these groups now serve in government , others in militias or as self-appointed vigilantes or hired guns . 
The goal of the PVPV is to confine women to the domestic realm and end all female participation in public and political life . 
To date , Iraqi officials have not been willing to deal with this escalating violence against women , or even to discuss it . 
But , as elected representatives , they are obligated to address these crimes . 
So must the US . 
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention , the responsibility for protecting civilian populations in an occupied country belongs to the occupying forces , which , in this case , are clearly failing to protect Iraqi women . 
Two measures are urgently needed . 
First , the Iraqi government must immediately establish &quot; Protection of Women &quot; security patrols in Iraq &apos;s southern cities . 
These patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women &apos;s security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values . 
Second , pursuant to its obligations under the Geneva Convention , the US must immediately take steps to protect the lives and freedoms of Iraqi civilians . Unless the US does so , it must withdraw from Iraq , because the occupation would merely continue to sustain a breeding ground for violence against women . 
The timetable for action is not subject to debate . 
It must begin today .
