Reviving Muslim Democracy 
DAKKA - As fears about the Islamization of politics in the Muslim world grow , Bangladesh , with the world &apos;s fourth-largest Muslim population ( 126 million ) , has moved dramatically in the opposite direction . 
Bangladesh is usually heard about only when cyclones and tsunamis ravage its low coastline , but the country &apos;s relatively anonymous international stature belies its strategic importance . 
Its secular politicians &quot; ability to defeat the country &apos;s Islamists decisively in the recent parliamentary election may , indeed , have revived the viability of &quot; Muslim democracy &quot; around the world . 
The recent landslide victory ( with a huge turnout ) for the Awami League in Bangladesh &apos;s first election in seven years , after two years of a military-backed caretaker government , has moved the country to the forefront of the battle between secular democrats and Islamists that is now underway across South Asia . 
The election was a credit to the country &apos;s democratic yearnings - and I say that as the chairman of the European Parliament &apos;s short-term election observation mission to Bangladesh . 
The new electoral register was more robust than in many Western countries , with a photo ID picture alongside each elector . 
The violence that had been widespread in previous Bangladeshi elections was entirely absent , with the security services &quot; professionalism in policing the elections - and the army &apos;s willingness to return voluntarily to its barracks - playing a key role . 
In Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , Bangladesh now has a charismatic leader whose massive electoral mandate augurs well for creating the type of strong , secular government that the country needs . 
She returned to Bangladesh from exile , which the army had imposed on her . After her return she still had to endure imprisonment and trumped-up murder charges . 
Hasina &apos;s enormous popularity as a former prime minister , and her status as one of only two surviving daughters of Bangladesh &apos;s founder , Sheikh Mujib Rahman , always ensured that she would be a leading contender in the election . 
Her overwhelming triumph has vindicated her belief that ordinary Bangladeshis want a secular and stable future for their country - one that , in contrast to Pakistan , is characterized by warm relations with their giant neighbor , India . 
The comprehensive defeat of the Islamist parties that sought to take Bangladesh away from its democratic and secular roots , and which had sought in 1971 to impose Urdu as a national language and suppress Bengali language and culture , is the real story of the election . 
The vote demonstrated that Bangladesh &apos;s 153 million people have little appetite for bringing Islamism into politics . 
Bangladesh needs only to look west to India and Pakistan to see the threat posed by Islamist terrorism . 
But if Hasina is to succeed in continuing to blunt Islamism , she must address the fundamental problems that have destabilized Bangladeshi society for decades . 
Chief among these is the poverty endured by the majority of her country &apos;s population . 
To some extent , it is surprising that the Islamist parties did not do better , considering their success elsewhere in mobilizing the most marginalized and vulnerable in society . 
If the Awami League is unable to address the country &apos;s systematic poverty and social inequality , Islamism may well yet succeed in rallying the impoverished to its banner . 
The Jamaat-e-Islami Party , indeed , told me during my stay that they had a 30-year agenda to introduce Sharia law into Bangladesh . 
The example of Hamas and Hezbollah provide a salutary reminder of the challenges faced by the new government in Bangladesh . 
Although these terrorist groups are better known internationally for atrocities against Israel , they have established strong political support by providing organized social services such as schools and clinics for poor people . 
Hamas and Hezbollah prospered in this way because the governing authorities were either unable or unwilling to address grassroots poverty . 
In the case of Hamas , this displacement was due largely to the massive corruption of the Palestinian Authority under Yassir Arafat , whose cronies pocketed billions of dollars intended to alleviate poverty and suffering in the Gaza Strip . 
Given that endemic corruption in Bangladesh is perhaps the primary obstacle to providing essential services for poor people , it is essential that Hasina adopt a tough approach to corruption from the outset . 
Corruption is also a potential trigger for intervention by the military , a recurring feature of Bangladesh &apos;s history that has consistently impeded the country &apos;s development . 
Beyond fighting corruption , Hasina must also ban all foreign donations to political parties , in particular the &quot; Wahhabi gold &quot; that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states use to fund Islamist parties . 
The challenges facing the Awami League are many and varied , but it is not without resources . 
Bangladesh is in a better position to weather the global financial storm than most Asian countries , because its banks are not over-exposed and its garment industry focuses on the lower end of the market , which , so far , appears to be holding up . 
With its constitutional majority , the government should ensure this outcome by restoring the 1972 Constitution , which established Bangladesh as a secular democratic state . 
Bangladesh is a country rich with human potential , but that potential can only be realized by making poor people &apos;s needs - which Islamists around the world have previously made their own political territory - the new government &apos;s top priority .
