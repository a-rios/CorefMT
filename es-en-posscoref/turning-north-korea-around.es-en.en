Turning North Korea Around 
SEOUL - Negotiations over the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula look set to resume . 
Sadly , they are unlikely to end soon . 
Talk of a &quot; grand bargain &quot; remains just that - talk . 
Trust between North Korea and the United States , South Korea , and Japan is almost non-existent . 
While all leaders - including North Korea &apos;s Kim Jong Il - remain committed to denuclearization in public , none appears ready to risk much in terms of domestic politics to achieve that end . 
So the best the world can currently hope for is revived dialogue , an agreement to freeze the North &apos;s Yongbyon nuclear plant , and perhaps a moratorium on further missile and nuclear tests . 
To speed the process , a new long-term strategy aimed at the underlying factors at work in North Korea - and in relations with its rulers - is needed . 
Simply put , the US and other powers need to pursue constructive economic engagement with North Korea to help the regime achieve &quot; strength and prosperity &quot; through economic transition and integration with the global economy . 
Constructive economic engagement will benefit ordinary North Koreans , who have suffered as much as any people on Earth since the Cold War &apos;s end . 
The root cause of North Korea &apos;s economic difficulties is its isolation from the forces of globalization , from which East Asia in particular has profited . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s , as China and Vietnam were posting rapid GDP growth , North Korea was ravaged by one of the worst famines in modern history . 
Today , North Korea is a de-industrializing , near-subsistence economy . 
The best hope for most North Koreans is the subterranean market economy that fills the gaps in the state &apos;s planned economy and public distribution system . 
Trade with China is keeping those market forces supplied with goods and business opportunities across the border . 
Rather than pressure China to shut down the cross-border flow of fuel and food in order to &quot; teach Pyongyang a lesson , &quot; the US and its allies must find ways to support North Korea &apos;s economic integration with the region . 
More effective than freezing accounts and barring travel by officials with ties to the missile and nuclear programs would be to work with North Korea &apos;s younger technocrats , banking and financial officials , and economic advisers to improve their expertise in managing North Korea &apos;s economic transition . 
Of course , economic engagement will not solve the nuclear conundrum in the short term . 
Nothing will . 
The Korean Peninsula will most likely achieve &quot; complete , verifiable , and irreversible denuclearization &quot; only when North Korea is already moving in the direction of economic growth and integration . 
North Korea &apos;s regime will require demonstrable evidence that a secure , prosperous , non-nuclear development model is available to it before it abandons its nuclear program . 
So , as nuclear talks proceed , the US and its partners should help North Korea lay the foundations for a new political economy based on international commerce , investment , and cooperation , as an alternative to the current model predicated on a hostile security environment . 
We should think of North Korea &apos;s economic transition process as a prerequisite for full denuclearization , rather than simply holding out the promise of a big assistance package as a quid pro quo . 
Of course , some of the big-ticket items in an economic engagement policy will remain contingent on progress in security arrangements and peninsular denuclearization . 
But North Korea and the international community can already take some substantive steps . 
These include opening diplomatic and official channels in order to improve mutual understanding and the general climate for exchanges ; promoting US-North Korea economic dialogues and workshops ; encouraging US universities , research institutes , and non-governmental organizations with expertise in economic transition and development to initiate and develop contacts with North Korean counterparts ; and permitting the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the Asian Development Bank to increase North Korean participation , with the ultimate goal of membership . 
During the recent visit of a high-level North Korean delegation to the US , there were encouraging signals that its rulers would welcome increased economic contacts , including with international financial institutions . 
Moreover , North Korea is actively courting foreign investment . 
The United Nations Development Program recently reopened its office in Pyongyang , another positive sign of the regime &apos;s readiness to work toward common development goals . 
Of course , new sources of growth in North Korea could threaten vested interests , leading to institutional rivalries , factional tension , or a conservative backlash . 
And the regime will not want the process of economic opening to get too far ahead of security agreements and political normalization . 
After all , the main lesson that North Korean leaders take from China &apos;s success is that security ( Mao Zedong &apos;s rapprochement with the US ) precedes economic transition ( Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reform and opening policy ) . 
Constructive economic engagement will be a tough sell outside North Korea . 
In the US , North Korea is seen mostly through the prism of nuclear non-proliferation , and the new administration is wary of being tricked into giving its rulers anything without getting fissile material in return . 
In South Korea , President Lee Myung-bak &apos;s political base wants to roll back , not reinvigorate , the Sunshine Policy , and there is a widespread ( though by no means universal ) weariness with engagement . 
In Japan , fear of North Korea &apos;s nuclear threat and anger over the abduction of Japanese citizens generates powerful political pressure against engagement . 
China is the one place that quietly implements a constructive economic engagement approach . 
Instead of pressing Beijing to cut off North Korea , the US and its allies should further develop their own efforts to draw North Korea out of its insularity .
