Unrealpolitik in Russia and China 
PARIS - In her recent book on the origins of World War I , The War That Ended Peace , Margaret MacMillan concludes that the only thing one can say with certainty about its causes is that leadership matters . 
No one really wanted war , but no one knew how to oppose it , because great statesmen like Germany &apos;s Otto von Bismarck , whose self-restraint preserved peace in Europe for decades , were missing in Europe in 1914 . 
A similar leadership void has become palpable in recent behavior by Russia and China . 
In the run-up to WWI , political and military leaders failed to grasp how industrial production and mass transportation had altered the character of warfare . 
The American Civil War should have served as a warning for Europeans . 
But a Europe that considered itself the center of the world , exporting its rivalries to Africa and Asia in the name of a &quot; civilizing mission , &quot; was utterly incapable of paying attention to the harsh lessons of the New World . 
Today , neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese President Xi Jinping seem to have learned those lessons , either . 
In Ukraine , Russia must choose what kind of relationship it wants to have with Europe . 
If Ukraine returns to the Kremlin &apos;s orbit , whether through direct reintegration or some kind of &quot; Finlandization , &quot; Russia will end up reenacting an old European problem : like France from 1643 to 1815 and Wilhelmine Germany , it will be both &quot; too much &quot; for its neighbors and &quot; not enough &quot; for its ambitions . 
Leaving aside why Russia should want to pay so much money to sustain a Ukrainian regime that is even more corrupt and dysfunctional than its own , Ukraine , with a territory greater than France and a population of 45 million , is the de facto linchpin of Europe &apos;s geopolitical equilibrium . 
Unlike Poland three times in the eighteenth century , there can be no question of partition , with western Ukraine joining Europe and the country &apos;s east returning to Russia . 
As a result , Ukraine &apos;s civilizational choice - between a democratic European Union and an autocratic Russia - will necessarily have major strategic consequences for the entire European continent . 
The problem that China faces in the South China Sea - and now in its airspace - is of a similar nature . 
Is China , too , losing the sense of restraint that characterized its foreign policy until recently ? 
The Chinese seem now to be displaying an impatience that is contrary to their country &apos;s long-term interests . 
China &apos;s heightened global status is obvious and recognized by all . 
But where is the serenity of a great power so confident in the superiority of its civilization , and so secure in its future , that it bides its time ? 
By flaunting its hegemonic regional ambitions , China has managed to unify against it countries as diverse as Vietnam , Indonesia , and the Philippines . 
Indeed , transcending their historical enmity with Japan , they tend to show more understanding for the rhetoric of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s government - and its new and more muscular defense policy - than for China &apos;s recent demonstration of force . 
It is sometimes said that history teaches us nothing , for it contains everything . 
Yet the teachings of classical diplomacy are probably more useful today than they were in the twentieth century . 
The age of grand ideologies is behind us ; an era marked by strict calculation of interest beckons . 
In the interim , war may have changed more than diplomacy - and probably for the worse . 
Our weapons &quot; destructive power has peaked at a time when the &quot; enemy &quot; is becoming more diffuse . 
How do you make war on instability ? 
How do you fight an adversary that disappears into civil society ? 
Even if technological progress has changed the diplomat &apos;s job , the rules of the diplomatic game remain fundamentally the same . 
Success presupposes an understanding of the interests and perceptions of one &apos;s counterparts , as well as an innate sense of moderation and self-limitation , something that both Russia and China seem to be lacking . 
By contrast , one may wonder whether US President Barack Obama should not also learn from Bismarck - but from Bismarck the Iron Chancellor , who united Germany behind Prussia . 
Is he demonstrating enough toughness and clarity of vision in his policy toward Iran - or , even more to the point , toward Syria ? 
Cold-blooded realpolitik , as Bismarck showed , is the best way to keep the peace .
