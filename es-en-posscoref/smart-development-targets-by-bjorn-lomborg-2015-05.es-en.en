Smart Development Targets 
ABUJA , NIGERIA - Over the next 15 years , the international community will spend $ 2.5 trillion on development , with national budgets contributing countless trillions more . 
In September , the world &apos;s 193 governments will meet at the United Nations in New York to agree on a set of global targets that will direct these resources . 
With so much at stake , it is vital that we make the smartest choices . 
Because it is only natural for politicians to promise to do everything , the UN is currently poised to consider an impossibly inclusive 169 targets . 
The proposed targets range from the ambitious ( &quot; end the epidemics of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria &quot; ) to the peripheral ( &quot; promote sustainable tourism &quot; ) to the impossible ( &quot; by 2030 achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men , including for young people and persons with disabilities &quot; ) . 
But promising everything to everyone provides no direction . 
In truth , having 169 priorities is like having none at all . 
That is why my think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus , asked 82 of the world &apos;s top economists , 44 sector experts , and UN organizations and NGOs to evaluate which targets would do the most good for every dollar , euro , or peso spent . 
A team of eminent economists , including several Nobel laureates , then prioritized these targets in value-for-money terms . 
It turns out that not all targets are equal . 
Some generate amazing economic , social , and environmental benefits per dollar spent . 
Many others generate only slightly more than a dollar per dollar spent . 
Some even generate a net loss , doing less than a dollar of good per dollar spent . 
If the world were to spend money equally across all 169 UN targets , it would do about $ 7 of social good for each dollar spent . 
That is respectable , but we could do much better . 
The panel of eminent economists has produced a much shorter list of just 19 targets that will do the most good for the world . 
Every dollar spent on these targets will likely produce $ 32 of social good - more than four times more effective than spending on all 169 . 
Being smart about development spending could be better than quadrupling the global aid budget . 
The short list covers a lot of ground ; what connects the targets is the amount of good they will do for people , the planet , and prosperity . 
Consider a few targets that would do so much to help people . 
Tuberculosis is a &quot; hidden &quot; disease , but a much bigger problem than headline-grabbing Ebola . 
More than two billion people carry the TB bacterium , and at some point about 10 % of them will develop the disease , which kills some 1.5 million victims per year ( compared to 20,000 dead in the recent Ebola outbreak ) . 
Yet treatment is inexpensive and , in most cases , highly effective . 
Spending a dollar on diagnosis and treatment pays back $ 43 by giving people many more years of productive life . 
Another outstanding use of resources is to reduce childhood malnutrition . 
Good nutrition is especially critical for young children , because it allows their brains and bodies to develop better , producing life-long benefits . 
Well-nourished children stay in school longer , learn more , and end up being much more productive members of society . 
The available evidence suggests that providing better nutrition for 68 million children each year would produce $ 45 in long-term social benefits for every dollar spent . 
Some targets that benefit the planet also provide excellent value . 
Cutting fossil-fuel subsidies , which amount to nearly $ 550 billion a year - would reduce pollution and CO2 emissions while freeing up resources for investment in health , education , and infrastructure . 
In total , each dollar not spent on fossil-fuel subsidies would provide more than $ 15 of planetary benefits . 
Focusing on coral reefs turns out to be a surprisingly efficient target . 
It preserves biodiversity , with healthy reefs producing more fish and attracting more tourists . 
Each dollar spent protecting them can provide benefits worth $ 24 . 
Perhaps the most important , cross-cutting problem is poverty , which afflicts billions of people and underlies most other development problems . 
When you are poor , your children will more likely suffer malnutrition and succumb to TB . 
When you are poor , you are more likely to slash and burn rain forest or fish atop coral reefs with dynamite . 
Better nutrition and greater access to education will help . 
As we have seen repeatedly - in China , South Korea , Chile , India , and elsewhere - fewer trade restrictions can lift incomes and reduce poverty . 
Economic models show that a successful reduction of trade barriers like that foreseen in the ongoing Doha Round of multilateral trade talks could add $ 11 trillion to global GDP by 2030 . 
This list of smart targets will not solve all of the world &apos;s problems ; no realistic list , however ambitious , can . 
These targets will do more than four times as much good per dollar spent as spending across all 169 targets would do . 
Governments should stop promising everything to everyone and start focusing on delivering the most possible .
