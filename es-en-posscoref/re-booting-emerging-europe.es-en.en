Re-Booting Emerging Europe 
LONDON - After the 1997-1998 financial crisis , policymakers in Asia &apos;s major emerging markets - South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , and even Indonesia - vowed &quot; never again &quot; to be humiliated by international capital markets . 
They set out to address the structural weaknesses that had brought their systems down . 
Many countries in emerging Europe had similar near-death experiences in the recent global crisis . 
Thanks to international and national policy interventions , their currencies and banking systems were saved from collapse , but many of them saw massive output drops and soaring unemployment . 
Unfortunately , they have not to the same extent embraced their Asian counterparts &quot; determination to address the vulnerabilities . 
Following the Asian crisis , the region &apos;s economies underwent intense internal and external scrutiny . 
It was clear that they had become more vulnerable due to loss of competitiveness , weak governance , and lack of transparency . 
Badly regulated banking sectors , feeble market structures , and weak competition , as well as trade and current-account restrictions , were also among the shortcomings identified . 
Not all Asian countries walked the line to the same extent , and some opportunities for reform were undoubtedly lost , but important lessons were learned and institutions improved . 
Similarly , emerging economies in Latin America changed their economic-policy course after devastating crises - in some cases a series of them - and moved toward strengthening monetary frameworks to reduce dollarization and build local capital markets , liberalize markets , and improve governance . 
These measures contributed to the improved economic fundamentals that helped limit the impact of the global financial crisis . 
The countries of emerging Europe must go through a similar bout of introspection , but the fact that they were saved from worst-case scenarios seems to make it more difficult to launch this process . 
The region needs to find its way back not only to rapid growth , but also to safer , more sustainable growth . 
In the decade leading up to the crisis , the emerging European economies were remarkably successful . 
Many of them grew at rates that compared favorably to other emerging markets , if not to China . 
In terms of exports , they did almost as well as , and in some respects even surpassed , the Chinese . 
But it was clear even before the crisis that emerging Europe was losing many of the strengths that explained its success . 
Labor costs grew much faster than for most competitors . 
In Latvia , for example , unit labor costs grew ten times faster than in the United States from 2001-2008 . 
Similarly , the potential gains from improved trade arrangements were being exhausted as they joined the European Union . 
Looking ahead , the region &apos;s main export markets , primarily in advanced Europe , are not expected to grow as fast as in the past . 
Moreover , the region had relied excessively on foreign savings to support growth , with many countries running large long-term current-account deficits . 
A significant part was financed by non-debt-creating inflows of foreign direct investment , but external borrowing , particularly by the private sector , also grew very rapidly . 
Foreign financing fueled foreign-currency credit growth , even for borrowers without foreign-currency income . 
As a result , the exchange-rate risk was passed on to those least able to manage it : households . 
And banks were saddled with large exposures . 
As wages grew faster than productivity in the run-up to the crisis , competitiveness also suffered , and domestic demand became the main engine of growth . 
Easy access to cheap funding and high commodity prices alleviated the need to press ahead with difficult reforms of infrastructure , utilities , education , and health care , to name a few areas . 
Diversification of production took a back seat in policy decisions as commodity prices continued to fuel rapid growth . 
Emerging Europe needs new sources of competitiveness . 
There are still important gains to be had from further improvements in the broader business environment . 
A large-scale survey of business managers , reported in this year &apos;s EBRD Transition Report , reveals grave concerns with the availability of skilled labor , the predictability and transparency of taxation , and corruption . 
There are no shortcuts to progress on addressing these problems , but lessons from the region should inspire emulation . 
Some countries , like Hungary , have managed to sustain the quality of education , critical for long-term competitiveness . 
Estonia has shown the way towards a simplified tax administration , modeled on the Scandinavian experience . 
Georgia has managed to reduce low-level corruption radically , through deep staff cuts , improved compensation to remaining government employees , and stiffer penalties for bribery . 
Emerging Europe &apos;s fundamental growth model is sound . 
If these economies introduce the necessary reforms , they will improve their potential growth . 
Equally important , they will create the buffers needed to offset external shocks and , as in emerging Asia and Latin America , to implement countercyclical policies that contain the extent and costs of future systemic crises .
