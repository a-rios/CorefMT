Medellin Moves to Africa 
An unfamiliar country keeps popping up in press reports about drug trafficking : Guinea Bissau . 
This West African state of 1.5 million people is one of the poorest in the world . 
Its chief exports ? 
Cashews , shrimp , and cocaine . 
Cocaine , in a country with no coca bush ? 
That &apos;s right . 
More than four tons of cocaine have been seized in West Africa this year , a 35 % increase over the entire haul for 2006 . 
Drugs are also being seized in international waters off the Gulf of Guinea . 
One reason why this region is becoming a major drug trafficking hub is its location . 
West Africa is an ideal staging point along the route from South America to the cocaine markets of Europe . 
Big shipments are hidden on fishing boats and freighters , then broken up into smaller 
Moreover , Africa &apos;s weak states offer the least resistance as a substitute for traditional cocaine smuggling routes in Central America and the Caribbean , which are being blocked . 
Many countries in the region cannot control their own territory , cannot administer justice , and are plagued by corruption . 
To appreciate the malaise of a country like Guinea Bissau , imagine that you are a policeman there and are tipped off about a drug shipment coming in by plane . 
First , you have to find a car to drive to the landing strip , and get official permission and money to fill up the gas tank . 
There is no way to call for backup without a two-way radio and no electricity to charge your mobile phone . 
If you reach the scene of the drop in time , the next challenge is to build a makeshift roadblock to stop the truck from off-loading the cocaine . 
Strangely , the truck &apos;s driver is wearing an army uniform and is not too concerned when you seize his cargo . 
You take him to the police station in the back of the car - without handcuffs , because you don &apos;t have any . 
A senior government official intervenes to try to secure his release . 
The police chief refuses , and is so incorruptible that he sleeps beside the drugs to prevent the multi-million-dollar evidence from disappearing . 
Later that week , the suspect is released into the care of the military , and the police chief is fired . 
This is a true story . 
And it is not an isolated case . 
Nor is Guinea Bissau the only country in the region vulnerable to serious organized crime . 
Convoys of heavily armed four-wheel-drive vehicles travel at high speed across the Sahel region of Western Africa , bringing hasish from Morocco via Mauritania , Mali , and Niger to Chad and beyond . 
This drug trafficking equivalent of the Dakar Rally covers 4,000 kilometers of inhospitable terrain , across regions controlled by rebel groups and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb . 
These forces are probably profiting from the drug trade . 
At the very least , their collusion enables the traffickers to obtain fuel , spare parts , accommodation , and guides . 
What can be done ? 
Criminal justice must be made a centerpiece of security and development . 
Such an approach has vaulted Cape Verde off the bottom of development indices into the respectable ranks of middle-income countries within a decade . 
Likewise , there must be a crackdown on corruption , as in Nigeria , where an anti-corruption revolution has swept an impressive list of greedy public officials from high office . 
Fighting organized crime requires the state to recapture control over its own territory . 
Improved security at ports in Ghana and Senegal is putting a dent in illicit trade passing through those countries . 
A few major drug seizures by a professional group of counter-narcotics agents would make drug traffickers change their perception of West Africa as a low risk / high benefit transit route . 
It would also deprive their venal local accomplices of the incentive to exploit public office for private gain . 
Countries like Guinea Bissau need help , fast . 
While the amount of investment needed is minimal , failure to act will be very costly .
