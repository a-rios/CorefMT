Is Iraq Safe Yet ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - The Obama administration &apos;s decision to withdraw the bulk of United Sates troops from Iraq over the next 19 months has sparked fears that Iraq will once again plunge into the wide-scale and debilitating violence that it endured from 2004 to 2007 . 
Those fears are , for the most part , overblown . 
There are good reasons to believe that the level of stability achieved in Iraq can be maintained even without a large-scale US presence . 
To understand why , it is important to know what else was going on inside Iraq in 2007 , when President George W. Bush ordered the &quot; surge &quot; of 20,000 additional troops and General David H. Petraeus shifted US forces to a more aggressive strategy . 
For , although the surge was important , two other factors played a critical role in bringing Iraq back from the brink . 
First , Baghdad had been transformed into a Shiite-dominated city . 
Although exact statistics are hard to come by , in 2003 approximately 35 % of Baghdad &apos;s population was Sunni . 
Today , based upon the results of the recently held regional election , Baghdad is only 10 % to 15 % Sunni . 
This means that between one million and 1.5 million Sunnis have fled the capital . 
Most now are refugees in Jordan and Syria , and they are unlikely to be welcomed home anytime soon by the new Shiite elite running the country . 
The ethnic cleansing of many Baghdad neighborhoods in 2006 and 2007 was deplorable . 
But it made it difficult for Sunni insurgents to hide or blend in with the population , and deprived them of logistical and financial support . � It also provided a degree of safety and security for the Shiite-led government , which was largely the purpose of the well-organized campaign in the first place . 
The second critical factor in stabilizing Iraq was its regional neighbors &quot; recognition of , and in some cases support for , Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s government . 
This was a major change from the 2003-2005 period , when Iraq &apos;s Sunni neighbors , fearing the country &apos;s new Shiite elite , actively opposed the US occupation . 
The multiple insurgencies that developed in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 were supported at least in part by money , materiel , and fighters from abroad . � Suicide bombers from all over the Arab world crossed into the country through the porous Syrian and Jordanian borders . 
Regional governments may not have openly supported the insurgents , but they clearly avoided cracking down on the jihadist groups operating within their borders . 
Foreign governments began to change these polities after al-Qaeda in Iraq bombed three hotels in Amman , Jordan , in November 2005 , killing 60 people . 
Frightened governments in the region realized that the type of violence occurring almost daily in Iraq was starting to spill across the country &apos;s borders . 
Soon after this incident , the highly effective Jordanian intelligence service began assisting the Iraqi government in going after the al-Qaeda network in Iraq . 
By June 2006 , this effort was paying off . 
Jordanian agents were instrumental in providing the intelligence that enabled US forces to kill Abu Zarqawi , the mastermind of the Amman bombing . 
Slowly but surely , throughout 2006 and 2007 , Jordanian intelligence , working with Iraqi Sunni tribes , chipped away at al-Qaeda . 
Moreover , quiet efforts were made in the Arab world to curtail the recruitment and funding of suicide bombers headed to Iraq . 
Iran &apos;s role in Iraq also changed . 
The Iranian government had been a major backer of Shiite militia groups , including the Mahdi Army , led by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr . � But the Iranians also had close ties from the beginning with elements of the Shiite-led coalition government . 
In 2008 , following Maliki &apos;s military operation to clean out militia groups in Basra , Iran &apos;s leaders seem to have decided that this two-faced strategy had run its course . 
Iran then helped broker a ceasefire that was highly favorable to Maliki , and cemented his commanding position inside the Iraqi coalition government . 
No doubt Maliki &apos;s hard-line stance on the need for a firm timetable for the withdrawal of US troops was critical to Iran &apos;s decision to throw its weight behind him . 
Both the transformation of Baghdad into a Shiite city and the recognition and support of Iraq &apos;s neighbors for the country &apos;s new political order have been instrumental in stabilizing the country . � These changes are likely to be permanent , and offer hope that the wide-scale violence that afflicted the country between 2003 and 2007 will not return after US forces depart .
