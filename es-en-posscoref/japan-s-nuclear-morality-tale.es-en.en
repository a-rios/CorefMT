Japan &apos;s Nuclear Morality Tale 
NEW DELHI - The troubles of the Fukushima nuclear-power plant - and other reactors - in northeast Japan have dealt a severe blow to the global nuclear industry , a powerful cartel of less than a dozen major state-owned or state-guided firms that have been trumpeting a nuclear-power renaissance . 
But the risks that seaside reactors like Fukushima face from natural disasters are well known . 
Indeed , they became evident six years ago , when the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 inundated India &apos;s second-largest nuclear complex , shutting down the Madras power station . 
Many nuclear-power plants are located along coastlines , because they are highly water-intensive . 
Yet natural disasters like storms , hurricanes , and tsunamis are becoming more common , owing to climate change , which will also cause a rise in ocean levels , making seaside reactors even more vulnerable . 
For example , many nuclear-power plants located along the British coast are just a few meters above sea level . 
In 1992 , Hurricane Andrew caused significant damage at the Turkey Point nuclear-power plant on Biscayne Bay , Florida , but , fortunately , not to any critical systems . 
All energy generators , including coal- and gas-fired plants , make major demands on water resources . 
Light-water reactors ( LWRs ) like those at Fukushima , which use water as a primary coolant , produce most of the world &apos;s nuclear power . 
The huge quantities of local water that LWRs consume for their operations become hot-water outflows , which are pumped back into rivers , lakes , and oceans . 
Because reactors located inland put serious strain on local freshwater resources - including greater damage to plant life and fish - water-stressed countries that are not landlocked try to find suitable seashore sites . 
As global warming brings about a rise in average temperatures and ocean levels , inland reactors will increasingly contribute to , and be affected by , water shortages . 
During the record-breaking 2003 heat wave in France , operations at 17 commercial nuclear reactors had to be scaled back or stopped because of rapidly rising temperatures in rivers and lake . 
Spain &apos;s reactor at Santa María de Garoña was shut for a week in July 2006 after high temperatures were recorded in the Ebro River . 
Paradoxically , then , the very conditions that made it impossible for the nuclear industry to deliver full power in Europe in 2003 and 2006 created peak demand for electricity , owing to the increased use of air conditioning . 
Indeed , during the 2003 heat wave , Électricité de France , which operates 58 reactors - the majority on ecologically sensitive rivers like the Loire - was compelled to buy power from neighboring countries on the European spot market . 
The state-owned EDF , which normally exports power , ended up paying 10 times the price of domestic power , incurring a financial cost of € 300 million . 
Similarly , although the 2006 European heat wave was less intense , water and heat problems forced Germany , Spain , and France to take some nuclear power plants offline and reduce operations at others . 
Highlighting the vulnerability of nuclear power to environmental change or extreme-weather patterns , in 2006 plant operators in Western Europe also secured exemptions from regulations that would have prevented them from discharging overheated water into natural ecosystems , affecting fisheries . 
France likes to showcase its nuclear power industry , which supplies 78 % of the country &apos;s electricity . 
Freshwater scarcity is a growing international challenge , and the vast majority of countries are in no position to approve of such highly water-intensive inland-based energy systems . Nuclear plants located by the sea do not face similar problems in hot conditions , because ocean waters do not heat up anywhere near as rapidly as rivers or lakes . 
But , as Japan &apos;s reactors have shown , coastal nuclear-power plants confront more serious dangers . 
And , unlike Fukushima , which bore a direct impact , Madras was far away from the epicenter of the earthquake that unleashed the tsunami . 
And , decades after Lewis L. Strauss , the Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Agency , claimed that nuclear power would become &quot; too cheap to meter , &quot; the nuclear industry everywhere still subsists on munificent government subsidies . 
While the appeal of nuclear power has declined considerably in the West , it has grown among the so-called &quot; nuclear newcomers , &quot; which brings with it new challenges , including concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons . 
Moreover , with nearly two-fifths of the world &apos;s population living within 100 kilometers of a coastline , finding suitable seaside sites for initiation or expansion of a nuclear-power program is no longer easy . 
Fukushima is likely to stunt the appeal of nuclear power in a way similar to the accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 , not to mention the far more severe meltdown of the Chernobyl reactor in 1986 . 
If the fallout from those incidents is a reliable guide , however , nuclear power &apos;s advocates will eventually be back .
