Revolution in a Vacuum 
MADRID - The Cold War is long over , but superpower rivalry is back . 
As a result , the international community &apos;s capacity to unite in the face of major global challenges remains as deficient as ever . 
Nowhere is this more clearly reflected than in the case of Syria . 
What was supposed to be a coordinated effort to protect civilians from ruthless repression and advance a peaceful transition - the plan developed by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan - has now degenerated into a proxy war between the United States and Russia . 
Russia &apos;s leaders ( and China &apos;s ) seek to uphold an international system that relies on the unconditional sovereignty of states and rejects the Western-inspired , humanitarian droit d &apos;ing√©rence . 
Concerned that the Arab rebellions would radicalize their own repressed minorities , they refuse to allow the UN Security Council to be used to promote revolutionary changes in the Arab world . 
And Syria , the last Russian outpost of the Cold War , is an asset the Kremlin will do its utmost to maintain . 
But Russia and China are not the only problem . 
Major emerging democracies like Brazil , India , and South Africa have been especially disappointing in their response to the Arab Spring . 
All are outspoken paladins of human rights when it comes to condemning any Israeli defensive attack in Gaza as &quot; genocide , &quot; but are equally united in opposing Security Council action on Syria , even as the repression there grows ever more appalling . 
The Arab uprisings either clashed with their commitment to the inviolability of national sovereignty , or stoked their fear that &quot; humanitarian intervention &quot; would merely be another tool of Northern dominance . 
The West &apos;s response has been far more supportive of Arabs &quot; aspirations , but it has also been contradictory and erratic . 
For years , both the US and Europe engaged in a monumental exercise in political hypocrisy , preaching the gospel of democratic change while supporting Arab tyrants . 
Not surprisingly , they found themselves with no tools to deal with the Arab revolutions . 
Indeed , at no time since the Arab Spring began has one been able to discern a coherent Western strategy to address its many challenges and uncertainties . 
Each case has elicited a different response , owing either to the constraints of international power politics , as is now the case with respect to Syria , or to economic and strategic considerations , as in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain . 
The US , for its part , did not abandon authoritarian allies such as Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia &apos;s Zine el Abidine Ben Ali immediately . 
Had they been swifter and more effective in repressing the mass protests , they might still be in power today - with America &apos;s blessing . 
The US turned against them not because they were autocrats , but because they were inefficient autocrats . 
Meanwhile , Europe finds itself paralyzed by a financial crisis that threatens the European Union &apos;s very existence . 
The EU &apos;s traditional foreign-policy tools - &quot; promoting civil society &quot; and &quot; encouraging trade &quot; - are no substitute for a strategy to confront the new power game in the Mediterranean . 
And yet Europe has proven utterly incapable of developing an appropriate response to conditions in which Islamist regimes are independently shaping their priorities and external actors - Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , Russia , China , and perhaps even Iran - are vying for influence with an extraordinary combination of financial firepower and political muscle . 
Europe cannot afford to remain on the sidelines . 
NATO &apos;s &quot; Operation Unified Protector &quot; in Libya was a major success for the alliance , but America &apos;s decision to let Europe assume the leading role also signaled its intention to &quot; rebalance &quot; its global priorities . 
With the US intent on shifting its attention from Europe &apos;s sphere of vital interests , the Mediterranean and the Middle East , to Asia and the Pacific , it can no longer be expected to take the lead in resolving crises in Europe &apos;s backyard . 
Indeed , grand designs for the Middle East are no longer on America &apos;s agenda . 
Since its victory in the Cold War , America &apos;s hegemony in the Middle East has been a story of frustration and unrewarded investment of blood , sweat , and treasure . 
A shift to foreign-policy realism is now expected , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s recent meeting with Egypt &apos;s Islamist president , Mohamed Morsi , is a clear indication of America &apos;s new orientation . 
The implications of such a shift are far-reaching . 
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the US viewed the Islamic world almost exclusively through the prism of the &quot; global war on terror . &quot; 
Now , however , policymakers admit that it was precisely the persistence of secular Arab autocracies that encouraged Islamist terrorism . 
As a result , the major premise of current US policy is that a loss of trust by the Islamists in the democratic process would have adverse consequences , and that the restoration of the old regimes could threaten Western interests more than a Muslim Brotherhood government would . 
America is now wisely building working relations with the new Islamist leaders , in the hope that they will not endanger the region &apos;s US-brokered peace agreements ( Israel-Jordan and Israel-Egypt ) or interfere with America &apos;s drive to halt Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Realizing that hope is no easy task . 
Turmoil in Arab societies is bound to persist for years to come , and emerging regional and world powers can be expected to exploit the international order &apos;s fragmentation to advance their interests in the region . 
With Europe in disarray , and Iran &apos;s nuclear crisis still resistant to diplomatic resolution , America &apos;s new foreign-policy realism could well imply that the US , however reluctantly , will ultimately be forced to revisit its &quot; rebalancing strategy . &quot;
