Provincial Europe 
BERLIN - Multitasking is not exactly the strong point of Europe &apos;s current generation of leaders . 
They have rightly given the eurozone crisis - the central question bearing on the European Union &apos;s future - top priority . 
But all other important issues - above all , a common foreign and security policy - have been almost completely ignored . 
And it is here - Europe &apos;s external relations , an issue absolutely vital to the future of all EU citizens - that renationalization is rearing its ugly head again . 
Today , we can recognize the outlines of a post-American international ( dis ) order - not only its emerging structures , but also its risks , threats , and conflicts , all of which are intensifying . 
For Europe - and for the rest of the world - the financial crisis has proven to be an accelerant of far-reaching changes . 
In East Asia , the world &apos;s most dynamic and dominant region in terms of future global economic development , confrontation is escalating between the key powers - China , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan - over border issues , territorial claims , prestige , and unfinished historical business . 
Add to this the perennial crisis on the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan conflict , which could flare up again anytime . 
East Asia &apos;s regional powers operate almost without any multilateral framework , a state of affairs comparable to that of Europe toward the end of the nineteenth century . 
Only the United States &apos;s military and political presence ensures regional stability . 
Yet , at least in the medium term , that presence implies a significant risk of inciting a global confrontation between China and the US . 
Moreover , Russia - which extends to East Asia , but , owing to its economic and political weakness , has been a background player there - would certainly seek to benefit from this development . 
Europe , however , will play no part in the region , simply because any attempt to do so would place too much strain on its reach and resources . 
Yet , given Europe &apos;s growing economic dependence on East Asia , its interests are massively engaged - a mismatch that could cause the EU considerable discomfort in the medium term . 
The same is true , to varying degrees , of Europe &apos;s relationship with South Asia ; but here the India-Pakistan conflict , a looming &quot; post-American &quot; Afghanistan in 2014 , and uncertainty concerning Iran and the Persian Gulf have a direct security impact on the EU . 
This is where discomfort meets danger . 
Russia , under Vladimir Putin &apos;s third presidency , has made its choice . 
Under the banner of a &quot; Eurasian Union , &quot; and relying on the renationalized oil and gas sectors as both a carrot and a stick , the Kremlin wants to tie as many of the former Soviet territories as possible to the Motherland . 
At the center of this policy is Ukraine , the linchpin of Europe &apos;s post-Soviet order . 
Yet Putin is caught in a fundamental contradiction . 
His Great Russia policy requires economic strength , and therefore successful modernization of the country . 
But , to achieve this , he must encourage reforms that would lead to a strong middle class , which , as can already be seen in Russia &apos;s big cities , opposes Putin &apos;s clientilist &quot; guided democracy &quot; and the massive corruption that comes with it . 
Putin &apos;s dilemma poses a real challenge for the EU and the US - but also an opportunity , if they choose significant long-term engagement . 
On both sides of the Atlantic , however , ignoring the issue seems to have been mistaken for a policy . 
That is a grave oversight , for it is clear that Russian foreign policy has again taken a provocative and confrontational turn . 
Russia remains a steadfast supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , and is not shying away from conflict with Turkey , or from forging a de facto alliance with Iran , in order to defend the Assad regime . 
Together with the war clouds hovering over the Iranian nuclear program , the failed Israeli-Palestinian peace process , and radical political change throughout the wider Middle East , the conflict in Syria shows that Europe &apos;s southeast will continue to be a major security challenge . 
Yet , despite Russia &apos;s ambitions for reshaping its neighborhood - and despite decreasing US involvement in the Middle East - Europe is hardly prepared to act . 
Clearly , the relationship between Turkey and the EU needs its own &quot; reset . &quot; 
Otherwise , both sides will find themselves among the losers . 
Turkey is currently confronting the limits of its possibilities , while the EU finds that it can do very little in this region without Turkey . 
And , to Europe &apos;s immediate south , across the Mediterranean , new risks are emerging in the vastness of North Africa and the Sahara , including the threat of an Al Qaeda state in northern Mali . 
If one adds to this European sketch of global development the fact that , whatever the outcome of the US election , America will shift its strategic focus to East Asia ( and otherwise mainly look after itself ) , nearly everything cries out for a robust EU foreign and security policy . 
Unfortunately , exactly the opposite is happening : here , too , renationalization is uppermost in the minds of Europe &apos;s peoples and decision-makers . 
In Berlin , the question asked more and more often is , &quot; What does this mean for Germany ? &quot; rather than , &quot; What does this mean for Europe ? &quot; 
The same is true in other European capitals . 
But the wrong question leads to wrong answers , because Europe &apos;s security interests can be defended only within a European and Western context , not at the national level . 
That is why it is high time for Europeans to abandon their provincialism , launch a common foreign policy worthy of the name , and finally start to invest properly in their future security . 
Europe must grow up and develop the capacity to defend its own interests , because the day is fast approaching when others will be less able and willing to do this for us than they once were .
