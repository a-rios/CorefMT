After Dictatorship 
The war in Iraq had barely begun when the minds of those who conceived the invasion turned to what should happen after the victory over Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime-a victory everyone assumed to be inevitable . 
Politicians and experts have invariably sought to draw comparisons with recent examples like Afghanistan , Sierra Leone , East Timor , but also with more remote and fundamental cases . 
After all , what is expected in Iraq is the fall of a highly ideological dictatorship . 
Is there anything we can learn from the last examples of this kind , from the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 , or the end of the Third Reich in Germany in 1945 and the process of &quot; de-Nazification &quot; that followed ? 
The risks of such comparisons are almost too obvious for words . 
Every case has its own defining features . 
Regarding the demise of communism , the experiences of , say , Poland and Romania are profoundly different . 
As we cross even more profound cultural boundaries , comparisons become still less relevant . 
Yet there are a few issues that are common to the unraveling of most ideological dictatorships . 
One such issue has to do with memory , and dealing with the past . 
This is connected with a practical question : who is in a position to build a new country on the ruins of the old regime ? 
It is rare for a counter-elite to emerge quickly , much less for an elite-in-waiting to take over . 
In Germany in the 1950s , there were many complaints about old Nazis reappearing in a democratic guise and occupying important positions . 
Many of us fought against the apparent &quot; restoration &quot; of the old regime . 
In Eastern Europe , the old leaders initially disappeared from the scene , but not for long . 
Ex-communists were often reincarnated politically as social democrats . 
Those who had been in the resistance-like VÃ¡clav Havel in Prague-found this hard to take . 
Yet these communist apparatchiks were not the same people they had been . 
Circumstances had changed and the people with them . 
This has a great deal to do with methods of dealing with the past . 
Post-1945 Germany and post-1989 Poland are examples of countries that moved forward without much attention to the past . 
Intellectuals complained that too little time and energy was spent on &quot; mastering &quot; the past . 
They had good reasons to complain . 
Indeed , after a decade or so , the need to draw clear lines and tell all , including the painful stories , became overwhelming . 
But the most successful postcommunist countries moved forward first and coped with the past later . 
Those who could not lift their eyes from the horrors of the past made less progress . 
A second general issue has to do with priorities . 
There is a natural tendency-especially in Anglo-Saxon countries-to regard elections as the most effective institutional remedy for countries emerging from ideological dictatorships . 
To be sure , elections are important ; but by themselves they do not solve problems . 
Indeed , if they disappoint , the very principles on which they are based-democracy and civil liberties-will be discredited . 
I am a strong , almost old-fashioned believer in parliamentary democracy , but when it comes to situations like postwar Iraq , two other imperatives are equally pressing . 
One is the need to establish an effective administration to make certain that new policies of tolerance and market economics are actually implemented . 
In East European countries , this was a major problem , and it is only through accession negotiations with the European Union that such administrative reform has been assured . 
The second imperative is the rule of law . 
The law has a different place in different cultures , and it presents special problems in Islamic countries . 
However , it is crucial that every effort be made to educate and install an impartial and incorruptible judiciary . 
Judges must not only be honest , but must be seen to be so and , as such , trusted . 
The process of establishing the rule of law has been difficult and has remained incomplete in most post-dictatorial countries ; yet it will be a key to successful recovery in Iraq as well . 
One of the key points that I emphasized in my 1990 book 
This is notably the case in economic terms . 
Even post-War Germany &apos;s acclaimed , miracle-working Economics Minister , Ludwig Erhard , was deeply unpopular in the early 1950s , because it appeared as if only a few were getting rich , while most West Germans remained poor or got poorer . 
For a certain period in the process of recovery , it is simply necessary for people to keep their nerve . 
Poland is a recent example of a country that achieved this feat . 
It requires plausible leadership and the reasonable hope that things will get better before long . 
If this time of transition goes wrong , the alternative is renewed turmoil and the victory of fundamentalists of one kind or another . 
The warning &quot; Beware of the valley of tears ! &quot; is thus the one that must be taken most seriously by those responsible for rebuilding an Iraq scarred by the terrors of dictatorship and the ravages of war .
