Global Disaster Recovery 
PALO ALTO - With the global economy mired in recession and financial crisis , policymakers everywhere have launched a series of monetary , financial , and fiscal responses . 
Nevertheless , economies continue to contract , unemployment to rise , and wealth to decline . 
Countries &quot; policy responses have ranged from modest to immense . 
China has undertaken a 6 % -of-GDP stimulus package aimed ( mostly ) at infrastructure ; the United States has enacted a two-year $ 800 billion spending and tax rebate package . 
The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered short-term interest-rate targets to near zero and are adopting &quot; quantitative easing &quot; - i.e. , continuous infusions of money . 
Despite all this , massive excess bank reserves remain unlent . 
During Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decade , &quot; the Bank of Japan mostly bought Japanese government bonds , whereas the Fed is trying to reopen secondary markets for securitized private lending ( which in the US is as important as bank lending ) , buying mortgage-backed securities and consumer and business loans , as well as U.S. Treasury bonds . 
The Bank of England is buying UK government bonds ( &quot; gilts &quot; ) . 
The European Central Bank , reflecting a strong inflation concern , has responded more slowly . 
The US government is now insuring , lending or spending over $ 10 trillion from guaranteeing money market funds to the AIG bailout to the Fed &apos;s swap lines supporting foreign central banks . 
Analogous guarantees and bank bailouts have occurred in the other major economies ( the ECB does not play this role for Europe ; national governments do ) . 
The fiscal response - tax cuts and spending increases - has varied considerably , being somewhat more tepid in debt-averse Europe than in the US and China . 
The US is hectoring Europe for more fiscal stimulus , while the Europeans pressure the US for greater and more globally coordinated financial regulation . 
Will near-zero interest rates , financial-sector bailouts , and fiscal stimulus work ? 
What else could be done ? 
As for fiscal measures , the empirical evidence suggests that three-quarters of consumption is based on longer-term economic prospects , not short-run disposable income . 
Thus , temporary tax rebates are mostly saved , not spent . 
Targeting liquidity-constrained people , especially the unemployed , is a bit more effective , as well as humane . 
Some claim that infrastructure spending creates a big Keynesian &quot; multiplier , &quot; a bigger increase in incomes than the initial spending ( estimates range up to about 1.5 times the initial increase in spending ) . 
But infrastructure spending is usually slow - and almost always driven heavily by parochial political considerations . 
Japan &apos;s annual 15-20 trillion yen infrastructure-intensive stimulus didn &apos;t prevent its lost decade . 
Nor did American government spending end the Great Depression ( unemployment was still over 15 % in 1939 , a decade after the depression &apos;s onset ) . 
A more effective stimulus would speed up spending that needs to be done anyway . Or cut taxes to change the marginal calculus of firms on layoffs and consumers on spending - for example , by suspending the payroll tax on firms and workers for a year or suspending part or all of the sales tax or national value-added tax . 
Better yet would be permanent rate reductions and controls on future spending . 
But governments should be wary of expensive fiscal stimulus . 
It is likely to yield little cushion for employment and income per dollar spent , while servicing the large debt accumulation will impede long-run growth , either by forcing substantial future tax increases or spending cuts , or by forcing central banks to inflate . 
Indeed , China frets over the safety of the US Treasury bonds that it holds . 
In theory , enough quantitative easing implies future inflation , motivating people to buy big-ticket items , like cars and appliances , now to avoid the run-up in prices later . 
( In practice , it is an experiment . ) 
High and rising inflation creates great costs and is difficult to reverse . 
After mitigating the downturn , central bankers must withdraw the immense infusion of liquidity before inflation takes off , a tricky maneuver . 
The bottom line , though , is that better policies can at best mitigate the economic consequences of this horrible recession . 
We will not get out of this mess completely any time soon . 
Sometimes , strong recoveries follow recessions , but recovery following financial crises is always immensely painful , time-consuming , and traumatic . 
The economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have argued that the major financial crises of the last century typically lasted a half-decade or longer . 
In many of the previous banking crises , it was a country or a region that was hit hard ( Argentina , Japan , etc . ) . 
This time , virtually every economy is suffering substantially and the banking crisis is global . 
Policymakers will continue to throw whatever ammunition they can find at the problem , but it will take time for the deleveraging from the boom to run its course . 
At times of serious economic distress , policymakers thrash about seeking solutions , and some people lose confidence in the economic system itself . 
Indeed , in the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s , it was common for Western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea . 
Some never returned from that intellectual journey , despite the collapse of communism . 
There is , of course , no case for going back to socialism and central planning . 
Once off government lifelines , we will need a better-regulated financial system . 
Any financial institution that is too big or too interconnected to fail , or could quickly become so , must be closely regulated and monitored for risk and capital adequacy in real time , or be broken up into smaller firms . 
In the meantime , let &apos;s hope that Messrs. Bernanke , King , Trichet , and the world &apos;s other central bank governors get monetary policy roughly right , and that our politicians don &apos;t waste vast sums on ineffective fiscal stimulus .
