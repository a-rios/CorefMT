Obama &apos;s Flawed Peace Process 
MADRID - Since its inception in Oslo almost two decades ago , the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stymied by the dysfunctional political systems of both sides . 
Hostage of an impossible coalition and of a settlement movement of free-lance fanatics , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s leadership is seriously compromised . 
His Palestinian counterparts are hardly in a better position . 
Today , the clique that surrounds Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas embodies the bitter deception which the peace process that began with the Oslo agreement has meant for the Palestinians . 
Moreover , the Palestinian Authority has come neither to represent the majority of Palestinians nor to rule by democratic means . 
Abbas &quot; presidential term has expired , and elections are constantly being postponed . 
The PA prime minister , Salam Fayyad , like his Hamas counterparts in Gaza , rules by decree , keeps parliament inactive , and silences the opposition . 
With no institutionalized democratic legitimacy , the PA is bound to rely on its security forces and on those of the occupier , Israel , to enforce its will . 
Of course , throughout history , national liberation movements have had to marginalize their own radicals and fanatics in order to reach the Promised Land . 
This was true of Zionism , of the Italian Risorgimento , and most recently of the Catholics in Northern Ireland . 
A peace process conceived as a means to weaken and isolate the winners of an election - Hamas - is unlikely to gain much traction . 
Like George W. Bush , President Barack Obama confines his diplomatic engagement largely to friends rather than adversaries . 
This , more than anything else , explains the growing disconnect between Arab public opinion and the Obama administration . 
The assumption - dear to the architects of the current process - that peace can be achieved by driving a wedge between &quot; moderates &quot; and &quot; extremists &quot; is a fatal misconception . 
The paradox here is double . 
Not only does one negotiate with the illegitimate &quot; moderates , &quot; but it is precisely because of their legitimacy deficit that the moderates are forced to be unyielding on core issues , lest the radicals label them treasonous . 
The Palestinian negotiators &quot; dangerous deficit of legitimacy - and , indeed , the disorientation of the entire Palestinian national movement - is reflected in the return of the PLO to its pre-Arafat days , when it was the tool of Arab regimes instead of an autonomous movement . 
The green light was given to the current negotiators by the Arab League , not by the elected representatives of the Palestinian people . 
Obama &apos;s endorsement of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s claim that if Israel is recognized as a Jewish state and its security needs accepted , &quot; I will surprise , and the sky is the limit , &quot; has made the current process possible . 
For Netanyahu , creation of a Palestinian state means the end of conflict and the finality of claims . 
By reopening Israel &apos;s demand to be recognized as the state of the Jewish people , he is forcing the Palestinians to insist even more on the constituent issues of the conflict , first and foremost on the so-called &quot; right of return &quot; of Palestinians who fled or were driven out after Israeli independence in 1948 . 
Abbas is too weak and compromised to accept any final settlement with which Netanyahu can live . 
Arafat set the standard as to what is acceptable and what is not , and Abbas cannot allow himself the luxury of deviating from it . 
As he admitted in a recent interview with the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds , if pressured to concede on sacred Palestinian principles such as refugees , Jerusalem , and borders , he &quot; would pack his suitcase and go away . &quot; 
It is not impossible that with Hamas in the picture , an agreement could end the occupation , if not the conflict . 
In other words , such a process would deal with the issues of 1967 - defining a border ( including Jerusalem ) , withdrawing and dismantling settlements , putting in place security arrangements , and the Palestinians &quot; assumption of full governance responsibility - while shelving for the future those of 1948 . 
Hamas is a far more convenient partner for such a settlement than the PLO . 
Oddly , Hamas and Israel might have more common ground than Israel and the PLO . 
Israel wants an end to the conflict but is incapable of paying the price , whereas Hamas can better reconcile its ideology with a peace agreement with Israel if it is not defined as final . 
The end of the conflict , like the requirement that Israel be recognized as a Jewish state , is a concept that has unnecessarily acquired mythical meaning . 
Instead of insisting on what the Palestinians cannot give , Israel should focus on what is essential : the international legitimacy of its borders . 
United Nations Resolution 181 in 1947 has already recognized Israel as a Jewish state . 
Whatever route is taken , the great question today concerns the enigma that is Bibi Netanyahu , a would-be Churchill who believes that his mission is to thwart the designs of Iran &apos;s evil new Shia empire , something which requires the goodwill of the international community , particularly of the Obama administration . 
It is not entirely far-fetched to assume that Netanyahu finally calculated that if he wants more room to maneuver to deal with Iran , he must participate in the peace process with the Palestinians . 
But , in that case , Iranian quiescence , not peaceful relations with an independent Palestine , might be Bibi &apos;s true objective .
