Dynastic Asia 
SINGAPORE - To the extent that culture matters in politics , the recent spate of leadership changes in Northeast Asia suggests that Asian societies are more tolerant - if not supportive - of dynastic succession . 
South Korea &apos;s recently elected president , Park Geun-hye , is the daughter of Park Chung Hee , who ruled the country from 1961 to 1979 . 
China &apos;s incoming president , Xi Jinping , is the son of Xi Zhongxun , a former vice premier . 
Japan &apos;s new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , is the grandson and grandnephew of two former Japanese prime ministers , and the son of a former foreign minister . 
Kim Jong-un is the son and grandson of his two predecessors in North Korea . 
This pattern is not confined to Northeast Asia . 
President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines is the son of former President Corazon Aquino . 
Prime Ministers Najib Abdul Razak and Lee Hsien Loong of Malaysia and Singapore , respectively , are also sons of former prime ministers . 
In India , Rahul Gandhi is waiting in the wings , preparing to step into the shoes of his great-grandfather ( Jawaharlal Nehru ) , grandmother ( Indira Gandhi ) , and father ( Rajiv Gandhi ) . 
In Pakistan , Bilawal Bhutto Zardari - son of President Asif Ali Zardari and the assassinated former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto , and grandson of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto - recently made his political debut . 
Is dynastic succession becoming the norm throughout Asia ? 
There is no denying that a distinguished lineage gives political candidates an advantage over rivals . 
But it is also clear that having distinguished relatives is no guarantee of success . 
Consider the checkered record of former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo . 
Her father was a respected president ; yet she could well be remembered as one of the country &apos;s most corrupt . 
The key issue is leaders &quot; attitude when they assume office . 
If they do so with a sense of entitlement from their lineage , they are likely to fail , as Arroyo did . 
Fortunately for East Asia , most seem to approach power with a keen sense of duty and a commitment to strengthening their countries . 
The term &quot; princeling &quot; is probably an unfair description of China &apos;s Xi . 
After all , he hardly can be said to have led a charmed life . 
After his father was purged by Mao Zedong , he went to work in the countryside , even before the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution , experiencing firsthand all of the hardships that many of his generation endured . 
Having risen to the top , he feels no sense of entitlement . 
From all accounts , he feels an even greater sense of responsibility to prove that he gained his position on the basis of merit , not privilege . 
Xi must also be aware that the children of the People &apos;s Republic &apos;s second generation of leaders face considerable public resentment , owing to their rapid accumulation of wealth . 
That explains his focus on combating corruption . 
If he fails to do so , he will be deemed a failure , and the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s political monopoly may end sooner than anyone anticipates . 
Xi carries a huge burden on his shoulders . 
So does Park Geun-hye . 
Like Xi , she had to struggle to reach the top . 
Her father lifted South Korea out of poverty and turned it into an economic tiger . 
But his rule was also brutally repressive . 
To make matters worse for Park , many of her predecessors are perceived as failures . 
Two former presidents , Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan , were prosecuted ; another , Roh Moo-hyun , committed suicide . 
There are also unkind rumors swirling around outgoing President Lee Myung-bak . 
South Korea is clearly a successful country that is struggling to define itself . 
In theory , it should be celebrating its economic and cultural achievements . 
In practice , as a small country in a troubled neighborhood - and with North Korea a constant source of tension - it lives in existential anxiety . 
And Park , whose victory has not diminished her people &apos;s ambivalent attitude toward her father , must know that healing the obvious divisions in South Korean society will not be easy . 
The most difficult job is the one that awaits Rahul Gandhi . 
No single party can dominate Indian politics as the Congress Party has done since independence , implying a future of difficult and quarrelsome coalitions . 
In these circumstances , India needs , above all , decisive leadership . 
Yet , like Hamlet , Rahul seems uncertain . 
He could have taken the job several years ago , if he had chosen to do so . 
His hesitation must reflect a deep anxiety . 
Yet his reluctance is understandable . 
Again , dynastic succession does not ensure success . 
Malaysia &apos;s Razak , for example , has made an enormous effort to reunify his country with his &quot; 1Malaysia &quot; message . 
Yet all the indications are that he will face an extremely hard-fought election in 2013 . 
Though unlikely , his Barisan Nasional coalition could fall apart . 
No such prospect faced his predecessors . 
In Japan , Abe is universally regarded to have performed badly in his first stint as Prime Minister in 2006-2007 , despite his distinguished lineage . 
Now he takes over an even more troubled country with huge domestic and external challenges . 
Few are betting on his succeeding . 
In short , Asia &apos;s pattern of dynastic leadership does not render it immune from the challenges that the rest of the world faces . 
As Asia creates the world &apos;s largest middle class - projected to grow more than three-fold , from 500 million to 1.75 billion , by 2020 - it will also have to cope with demands for more competent and more accountable governments . 
In Asia today , uneasy lies the head that wears the crown .
