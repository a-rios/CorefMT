The New Delhi Consensus 
NEW DELHI - One of the more remarkable ( though largely unremarked ) developments in recent Indian politics has been the startling shift in the country &apos;s discourse about capitalism . 
As in many developing countries , &quot; self-reliance &quot; and economic self-sufficiency were India &apos;s national mantras after independence - and , in India &apos;s case , remained so for more than four decades . 
Whereas most Westerners axiomatically associate capitalism with freedom , India &apos;s nationalists associated it with slavery . 
After all , the British East India Company , that harbinger of capitalism , had come to trade and stayed to rule . 
One of the lessons that history teaches us is that history often teaches us the wrong lessons . 
For India &apos;s nationalist leaders , this meant that every foreigner with a briefcase should be viewed as the thin edge of a neo-imperial wedge . 
This had serious implications for India &apos;s role in the world economy . 
Instead of integrating India into the global capitalist system , as only a handful of post-colonial countries - for example , Singapore - chose to do , India &apos;s leaders ( and those of most former colonies ) were convinced that the political independence that they had fought for could be guaranteed only through economic independence . 
As a result , self-reliance became the official credo , protectionist barriers went up , and India spent 45 years largely divorced from global trade and investment flows . 
Bureaucrats , not businessmen , controlled the &quot; commanding heights &quot; of the economy , and India shackled itself to statist controls that emphasized distributive justice over economic growth , stifled free enterprise , and discouraged foreign investment . 
While the &quot; Asian tigers &quot; roared ahead , the Indian economy sputtered along , growing at a 2-3 % annual rate . 
Economists spoke derisively of a &quot; Hindu rate of growth . &quot; 
&quot; Self-reliance &quot; guaranteed both political freedom and freedom from economic exploitation . 
The result was that for most of the first five decades after independence , India , despite the best of intentions , pursued an economic policy of subsidizing unproductivity , regulating stagnation , and redistributing poverty . 
We called this socialism . 
Indian-style socialism was a compound of nationalism and idealism . 
It embodied the conviction that goods and services vital to Indians &quot; economic well-being must remain in Indian hands - and not in the hands of Indians seeking to profit from producing and selling such goods and services , but rather in the disinterested hands of the state , the father and mother to all Indians . 
Given this mindset , performance was not a relevant criterion for judging the utility of the public sector . 
Inefficiencies were masked by generous subsidies from the national treasury , and a combination of vested interests - socialist ideologues , bureaucratic managers , trade unions , and monopolies - kept it beyond political criticism . 
The &quot; permit-license-quota &quot; culture of statist socialism allowed politicians and bureaucrats to use public service as a vehicle for private gratification , giving birth to a culture of corruption that still persists . 
India &apos;s misfortune , in the economist Jagdish Bhagwati &apos;s famous aphorism , was to be afflicted with brilliant economists . 
Add to that clamorous politicians and growing demands on a national economic pie that decades of protectionism prevented from growing . 
It is impossible to quantify the economic losses inflicted on India during four decades in which entrepreneurs frittered away their time and energy applying for licenses rather than manufacturing products ; paying bribes instead of hiring workers ; wooing politicians instead of understanding consumers ; and &quot; getting things done &quot; through bureaucrats rather than doing things for themselves . 
It was only after a massive balance-of-payments crisis in 1991 , when India &apos;s government literally had to ship its gold reserves to London to serve as collateral for an International Monetary Fund loan , that India liberalized its economy under then-Finance Minister ( now Prime Minister ) Manmohan Singh . 
In Indian culture , the gold possessed by a household &apos;s women has often been seen as a guarantee of the family &apos;s honor ; surrendering the nation &apos;s gold to foreigners was a national humiliation that the old protectionism could not survive . 
Since then , India has become a poster child for globalization . 
A country whose share of global trade had fallen from 2 % in 1947 to 0.2 % by 1987 decided to open up to the world economy . 
Foreign investment , once viewed as a threat , was now seen as a lifeline . 
The revolution in information technology connected India &apos;s bright young white-collar workers to Western employers and clients ; 
The rate of GDP growth more than tripled , averaging more than 9 % per year from 2005 to 2007 . 
It is now widely accepted across the political spectrum that India &apos;s growth and prosperity would be impossible without the rest of the world . 
The young generation has grown up with liberalization , and will not accept its rollback . 
Young Indians today are likely to spend a lot of their adult lives interacting with people who don &apos;t look , sound , dress , or eat like them . 
Unlike their parents , they may well work for an internationally oriented company with clients , colleagues , or investors around the globe ; and they are increasingly likely to take their holidays in far-flung destinations . 
The change has now been deeply internalized . 
Three different coalitions have led India &apos;s government since 1991 , including one ( from 1996 to 1998 ) that included Communists , and none has departed from the new &quot; New Delhi &quot; consensus . 
In his historic budget speech to Parliament in 1991 , Singh , quoting Victor Hugo , declared that &quot; no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come . &quot; 
His words were prophetic . 
The liberalization of the Indian economy , and of the Indian political mind , has proved irreversible . 
Its time has come , and will not pass .
