Thailand in Yellow and Red 
BANGKOK - After three consecutive years of deadly street protests , Thailand has arrived at the point where it will need to hold new elections , as the current term of its national assembly expires this December . 
Indeed , Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has indicated that he will call for the dissolution of the lower house by the first week of May . 
This follows a parliamentary no-confidence motion , which his government barely survived . 
Accordingly , the stage is set for a general election at mid-year . 
But , in view of the political volatility of recent years , this semblance of stability and constitutional regularity is deceptive . 
Echoing popular movements elsewhere , Thailand remains locked in conflict and polarization between an entrenched regime propping up Abhisit and burgeoning new voices clamoring for enfranchisement . 
Any peaceful outcome to this conflict will require far-sighted concessions and compromises . 
Thailand &apos;s street politics during this political crisis date back to 2005 , when the corrupt and abusive government of Thaksin Shinawatra , which had been re-elected in a landslide that year , was toppled by a military coup . 
Two years later , after the military regime rammed through a new constitution , Thaksin &apos;s proxy political party won another election , as his popular base of &quot; red shirts &quot; in Thailand &apos;s downtrodden northeast and northern regions remained loyal to him . 
Thaksin &apos;s yellow-clad royalist foes , the People &apos;s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , took to the streets against him again in 2008 , as the judiciary ordered the dissolution of his party for the second time . 
In April 2009 , and again in April-May 2010 , the disenfranchised red shirts camped in the streets of Bangkok to demand new elections , but were dispersed by the army , with 91 fatalities . 
Despite their setbacks and lost credibility following the torching of Bangkok &apos;s central business district , the red shirts have grown in number and demonstrate monthly against Abhisit &apos;s government . 
PAD ringleaders now denounce all politicians as corrupt and extol the virtue of the monarchy . 
Using the weapons of an anti-corruption drive and rising nationalism ( the result of a periodically violent border dispute with Cambodia ) , the royalist-conservative movement is implicitly pointing to an extra-constitutional solution to Thailand &apos;s political standoff . 
Another military coup is their unspoken answer . 
While these machinations are par for the course for Thailand &apos;s topsy-turvy democracy , they point to a deeper structural schism . 
Thailand &apos;s six-decade-old incumbent regime , which relies on symbiosis between the monarchy and the military , is unable to tolerate elections that empower the rural masses unwittingly awakened by Thaksin &apos;s premiership . 
These masses , along with the urban poor , make up the bulk of the red shirts . 
They demand a voice in politics , a stake in the country &apos;s grossly unequal economy , and the chance for upward mobility that they saw in Thaksin and his populist programs . 
They know that elected politicians are prone to graft , but now refuse blatant disenfranchisement and the formation of governments like Abhisit &apos;s , which was brokered in an army barracks . 
For Thailand &apos;s military-political axis and its supporting pillars in the judiciary and bureaucracy , suppressing these voices has become increasingly unworkable . 
Moreover , Thailand already attracts unwanted attention for its draconian security laws . 
Bangkok , for example , has been under either a state of emergency or provisions of the internal security act for more than a year , in violation of basic civil liberties . 
There are now unprecedented scores of political prisoners . 
Around the country , many red shirts are persecuted , and several have been murdered under mysterious circumstances . 
More than 100,000 Web pages have been blocked for &quot; subversive &quot; content . 
More charges of lèse majesté have been filed , and with more convictions than ever . 
But the establishment &apos;s efforts to put a lid on the seething Thai kettle appear untenable . 
Cold War exigencies , which benefited and cemented the military-monarchical alliance in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , have been replaced by the imperatives of democracy . 
The electorate is no longer passive in the face of rampant corruption and vote-buying . 
But solutions for the country &apos;s ills must be found within the boundaries of law and constitutionalism . 
Another military putsch would nudge Thailand backwards , from a democratic outlier on the world stage to an authoritarian outcast . 
A way forward beckons . 
The remarkable 64-year reign of 83-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej deserves credited for Thailand &apos;s unity and stability , which kept communism at bay and enabled steady economic development , warts and all . 
But times have changed . 
Of course , Thaksin &apos;s legacy of corruption and of a pandering populism must be rejected , but the profound awakening of the Thai electorate that did occur , almost accidentally , during his premiership needs to be built upon , not suppressed . 
Thailand needs elections that are not subverted by judicial decisions . 
The coup-era constitution will then require a revamp . 
Perhaps the Royal Household itself should be tasked with filing such charges . 
The list goes on . 
The opacity of the Crown Property Bureau , worth an estimated $ 30 billion , eventually will have to be addressed . 
These are delicate issues , given Thailand &apos;s raw and rabid polarization between those with vested interests in the old order and those intent on putting an end to what they claim are neo-feudalistic privileges and entitlements . 
Unless good-faith efforts at compromise are shown by all sides , Thailand will not retake its rightful place among the world &apos;s up-and-coming democracies .
