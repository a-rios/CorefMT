Has the US Recovery Begun ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Although the American economy is continuing to decline , it is no longer falling as fast as it was at the beginning of the year or in the weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . 
In that sense , it is reasonable to say that the worst of the downturn is now probably behind us . 
But my reading of the evidence does not agree with that of those who claim that the economy is actually improving , and that a sustained cyclical recovery is likely to begin within the next few months . 
Although the stimulus package of tax cuts and increased government outlays enacted earlier this year will give a temporary boost to growth , we are unlikely to see the start of a sustained upturn until next year at the earliest . 
The optimists back their claims of an earlier recovery by pointing to a variety of statistics . 
They note that construction activity is rising , home prices are declining more slowly , disposable personal income increased in the first quarter , consumer spending is up , and the labor market is improving . 
But a careful look at these data is less reassuring . 
In each case , the details do not support what the headline number appears to indicate . 
While total construction spending recently rose by a very small 0.3 % ( less than the measurement error ) , private construction spending actually fell and residential construction was down a much more significant 4 % . 
Likewise , home prices declined at a very rapid rate of 18.7 % in the 12 months to March , which is not meaningfully lower than the 19 % fall over the 12 months to February . 
Moreover , disposable personal income rose in the first quarter only because of a massive jump in tax rebates and government pension payments . 
In contrast , salaries , self-employment income , dividends , and interest all fell . 
The anomaly of rising consumption driven only by tax rebates and social-welfare payments ended in March , when consumer spending declined in response to lower employment and falling labor incomes . 
Finally , employment continues to contract rapidly . 
Although the pace of decline slowed between March and April , half of that improvement was the result of an increase in government employment , owing to a one-time hiring of more than 60,000 temporary staff to conduct the 2010 census . 
But , although the recent news is not as encouraging as some have claimed , I expect that the next few months will see some real improvements that will reduce the rate of overall economic decline , or even produce a temporary rise in the GDP growth rate , owing to the Obama administration &apos;s fiscal stimulus measures . 
The stimulus package will add about $ 60 billion to overall GDP during April , May , and June , or roughly 1.5 % of quarterly output . 
If economic activity apart from the stimulus package is continuing to decline at nearly the 6 % annual rate that was recorded in the last two quarters , the temporary boost from the stimulus package will suffice to make the overall GDP change close to zero or even positive . 
But the key thing to bear in mind is that the stimulus effect is a one-time rise in the level of activity , not an ongoing change in the rate of growth . 
While the one-time increase will appear in official statistics as a temporary rise in the growth rate , there is nothing to make that higher growth rate continue in the following quarters . 
So , by the end of the year , we will see a slightly improved level of GDP , but the rate of GDP growth is likely to return to negative territory . 
The positive effect of the stimulus package is simply not large enough to offset the negative impact of dramatically lower household wealth , declines in residential construction , a dysfunctional banking system that does not increase credit creation , and the downward spiral of house prices . 
The Obama administration has developed policies to counter these negative effects , but , in my judgment , they are not adequate to turn the economy around and produce a sustained recovery . 
Having said that , these policies are still works in progress . 
If they are strengthened in the months ahead - to increase demand , fix the banking system , and stop the fall in house prices - we can hope to see a sustained recovery start in 2010 . 
If not , we will just have to keep waiting and hoping .
