From Copenhagen to Copenhagen 
This week the EU &apos;s 15 Heads of state and government from the current Member States and the leaders of the 13 candidate countries meet in Copenhagen . 
We meet with a clear task - to decide on enlargement of the EU . 
We will finish a process that began almost ten years ago at another Summit in Copenhagen . 
In 1993 , the EU took the first step towards integrating the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU . 
Now we are ready to conclude negotiations with the first new Member States . 
From &quot; Copenhagen to Copenhagen &quot; has thus been the motto of the Danish EU Presidency . 
It is the expression of a contribution to a vision of a unique project and process , and of Denmark &apos;s ambition to accomplish a task that has been placed in our hands . 
EU enlargement is the greatest political task of our generation . 
It is a challenge and an opportunity reaching beyond the present day . 
It marks the end of the tragedy of the division of Europe that marred the 20th century , and provides a gateway to a common future for our peoples , in freedom , peace and prosperity . 
The 20th century was a tragedy for Europe . 
Before the First World War , our Continent was characterized by optimism , self-confidence and faith in the future . 
These values were lost in the Great War , and we never really recovered the optimism and faith in the future that preceded it . 
Two horrible world wars tore our Continent apart . 
The mayhem of the Second World War was followed by more than 40 years of Communist dictatorship in Central and Eastern Europe . 
For nearly half a century , we lived with an unnatural division of Europe . 
Now , at long last , we can close one of the darkest and most bloodstained chapters in Europe &apos;s history . 
EU enlargement marks the beginning of a new era . 
It can give Europe both the dynamism and the drive to create the foundation of a new European consciousness . 
It is the key to the future of Europe . 
In the Convention on the future of the EU , member states and candidate countries are already discussing how to organize the EU in the years ahead . 
It is important that we secure efficient institutions and decision procedures . 
This is necessary in order to develop our internal market and economies , create new jobs , promote sustainable growth , and strengthen our competitiveness . 
It is a prerequisite for the EU to be able to play a strong and positive role internationally , promoting peace , sustainable development , free trade , and good governance . 
Together we shall build this common future , and to move toward this goal , the discussions in Copenhagen will focus on three questions . 
First , we will complete negotiations with up to ten countries : Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , the Slovak Republic and Slovenia . 
This is a realistic ambition . 
But all involved - both candidate countries and current member states - must show the necessary flexibility in the final round of negotiations . 
The second question is how to continue the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania . 
These two countries are not yet ready for membership . 
At the Summit in Brussels in October , we decided to support these two countries in their efforts to achieve EU membership in 2007 . 
In Copenhagen we will make concrete decisions on how we may strengthen their preparations for membership . 
The Commission has presented a very reasonable proposal for how this can be done . 
I expect that we can find reach agreement on this basis . 
The third question relates to Turkey , with which accession negotiations have not yet begun . 
The expectations of the new Turkish government - and of the Turkish people - are high . 
At the same time , however , it is the assessment of the Commission that Turkey is still not yet ready to initiate accession negotiations . 
It must first fulfill the clear political criteria defined by the EU in Copenhagen ten years ago . 
In Copenhagen this time around , we will make decisions on the next stage of Turkey &apos;s candidacy . 
We must find a balanced answer reflecting both the present situation and the potential for development in Turkey . 
As a candidate country , Turkey will , of course , be treated like all other candidate countries , and it will be important to send a clear signal to the Turkish people confirming their belief in the perspective of membership and a future based on Western and European values . 
Europe &apos;s leaders meet in Copenhagen this week to unite our continent in peaceful cooperation . 
What generations of Europeans have dreamt of is at long last within reach . 
Leaders from both member states and candidate countries face a historic decision . 
After ten years of preparation the time has come to make the final crucial decisions on enlargement .
