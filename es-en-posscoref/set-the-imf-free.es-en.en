Set the IMF Free 
BRUSSELS - The International Monetary Fund is back in business . 
During the bubble years , neither its advice nor its money seemed to be needed . 
But now more and more countries need balance-of-payments support , and there is general agreement that the global monetary system needs a body to oversee its overall stability . 
The IMF is the only candidate for this task , but experience has shown that the Fund can fulfill this role only if its governance is reformed . 
Granting balance-of-payments support has important fiscal implications , and it is natural that there should be continuing close oversight by those who ultimately provide the capital - the IMF &apos;s member states . 
But looking after the stability of the global financial system , including the assessment of exchange-rate policies and global payment imbalances , is a different responsibility . 
For these analytical functions , there is no need for close oversight . 
On the contrary , independence and professional expertise should be decisive . 
Thus , a key change should be to distinguish between the IMF &apos;s financial measures and its analytical functions , especially the surveillance of exchange rates and other sources of global financial risk . 
The IMF &apos;s Executive Board , which consists exclusively of representatives of member countries , currently runs the Fund &apos;s daily business . 
The Board thus does not perform oversight functions , but rather serves essentially as an extended Management Board , which delegates the execution of its decisions to the Managing Director and the staff . 
This modus operandi needs to be changed in order to give the IMF the independence it needs if it is to become a credible , impartial judge of balance-of-payments disequilibria and sources of risk to global financial markets . 
This requisite independence of the IMF staff can be achieved by stipulating that the Board oversees only the work of the Fund &apos;s analytical functions and , more importantly , that its composition and decision-making mode are overhauled in the following ways : 
- The Executive Board should be enlarged by the addition of several ( possibly 3-5 ) independent members ( as in the private sector ) , and the voting principle should be one person , one vote . 
The independent board members would constitute only a small minority , but their presence and professional expertise would give them disproportionate weight . 
- Management would be free to take a position on all issues not involving the use of Fund resources , unless it is was explicitly overruled by the expanded board . 
This would give management considerable de facto independence , since under the one person , one vote principle the larger member countries could no longer block issues just because they are politically inconvenient . 
For all decisions involving the resources of the Fund ( lending to member countries or the size of quotas , etc . ) , the existing decision-making procedure could remain unchanged . 
All financial decisions would thus continue to be taken by the existing Executive Board , with weighted voting reflecting the financial contributions of member countries . 
The European Central Bank provides an interesting analogy , because it has two voting procedures , depending on the issue at hand . 
The ECB &apos;s Governing Council comprises the six members of the Executive Board plus the governors / presidents of the 16 national central banks of the eurozone countries . 
The Governing Council takes the really important decisions on monetary policy based on one person , one vote . 
When the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated , the Germans considered this provision an important concession . 
But it is indispensable if the ECB is really to be independent , and if one expects that all members of the Governing Board , particularly the governors of national central banks , base their decisions only on the interests of the entire euro area ( and not of their home country ) . 
However , on financial matters ( in particular the distribution of profits and losses ) , the voting rules are different : the Executive Board does not participate and the votes of the national central bank presidents in the Governing Council are weighted by their respective capital shares . 
When the G-20 leaders meet in London , they should consider giving the IMF the independence it needs to become an effective guardian of global financial stability . Putting independent experts on this Board will be a key step in that direction .
