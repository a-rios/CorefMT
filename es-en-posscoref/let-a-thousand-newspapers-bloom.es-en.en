Let a Thousand Newspapers Bloom 
Whenever I tell a Westerner what I do for a living , many are doubtful . 
&quot; Are there really independent journalists ? &quot; 
The answer is yes and no . 
Ever since Deng Xiaoping launched his reforms in 1978 , China has been moving from a planned economy to the free market . 
Its media industry is undergoing a transition equally as wrenching . 
Yet the government &apos;s attitude to the press is not one of constant suspicion . 
After it ( belatedly ) recognized the importance of transparency in capital markets , journalists gained greater freedom to pursue investigative journalism . 
So , while the line between the permissible and the prohibited has shifted , it still exists . 
Some of us walk right up to the line , even nudging it every once in a while . 
Crossing it , however , remains another matter . 
All the same , journalists and editors like myself are increasingly confident in our role as economic watchdogs . 
In its first issue in April 1998 , the magazine that I edit , Caijing ( Business and Finance Review ) , published a cover story on Qiong Min Yuan , a little-known real estate company whose share prices skyrocketed by 400 % . 
The company &apos;s stock was suspended from trading in 1997 , after it was charged with overstating profits . 
A few insiders were tipped off beforehand and unloaded their shares , while 50,000 individual investors lost millions of dollars . 
Although everyone knew what happened , no one dared publish details of the inflated profits or the tip-off until we broke the silence . 
Our article -  &quot; Who is Responsible for Qiong Min Yuan ? &quot;  - offered no investigative scoops or new information . 
By simply reporting the story and pointing out places where the system failed to protect small investors , we incited a stir . 
Government watchdogs immediately criticized Caijing . 
Our recent focus has been on securities markets . 
In October 2000 , we published a groundbreaking article called &quot; The Inside Story of Fund Management , &quot; which disclosed a previously suppressed Shanghai Stock Exchange analysis that showed that most of China &apos;s fledgling investment-fund-management companies were trading illegally and irregularly on the securities market . 
By publishing that article , our magazine became the first serious publication ever to report criticism of the fund-management sector and the stock market . 
The ten government-affiliated companies mentioned in the report threatened to sue us . 
But our readers came to our defense , while the prominent Chinese economist Wu Jinglian supported our report in an interview on Central Chinese Television , China &apos;s main officially sponsored statewide broadcast network . 
In many ways , the fund management story was a watershed moment for Caijing and for the Chinese press in general . 
The government left us entirely alone , neither banning nor criticizing our report . 
In a speech around that time , the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission , Mr. Zhou Xiaochuan , announced that the securities market welcomed media criticism and supervision . 
Since then , China &apos;s financial media has become bolder . 
We &apos;ve exposed cases involving price manipulation and falsified profits . 
Last August we reported that Yinguang Xia Holdings , the second largest listed company in China &apos;s A share market in 2000 , posted a falsified claim of 700 million renmenbi ( US $ 87 million ) in profits online . 
Within hours of publication , the company was suspended from trading , and within a week , security regulators had launched an investigation . 
Despite these successes , establishing independent media in China remains a daunting task . 
In addition to criticism from people in industry , we must overcome other obstacles . 
Official pressure remains enormous . 
Information that should be public is not available . 
Key officials reject requests to be interviewed without explanation . 
Some listed companies try to prevent us from publishing stories by appealing to government agencies . 
In China , where there are no laws protecting the media or freedom of speech , companies who don &apos;t like our reports can sue us for allegedly damaging their reputations . 
More often than not , they win . 
There are also internal obstacles to a free , independent press . 
China boasts 7,000 newspapers and 8,000 magazines , but the government controls free access to the media market by issuing special licenses . 
Only high-ranking state-owned organizations are qualified to hold these licenses , which grant the ability to publish . 
Those outside the industry , including readers , are unaware of this closed market structure . 
Despite these obstacles , I am optimistic that the media will become a viable monitor of Chinese industry , if for no other reason than that most authorities recognize by now that economic development will falter without it . 
As the public becomes familiar with Caijing &apos; s brand of journalism , it is sure to raise demand for more tough-minded and scrupulous reporting in general , not only on markets , but also on developments in people &apos;s communities and governments . 
Thousands of important stories remain to be told in China . 
Caijing is but one voice struggling to tell them .
