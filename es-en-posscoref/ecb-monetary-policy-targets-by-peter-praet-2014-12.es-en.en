Is the ECB Doing Enough ? 
FRANKFURT - Konrad Adenauer , Germany &apos;s first chancellor after World War II , famously said : &quot; Why should I care about the things I said yesterday ? &quot; 
What he meant was that events can sometimes unfold at a speed that outpaces our ability to understand them . 
So , as 2014 winds down , it is worth asking ourselves , with the benefit of hindsight : Have we at the European Central Bank reacted swiftly enough to maintain price stability in the face of threats , as our mandate requires ? 
I think the answer is yes . 
We noticed that our monetary policy was no longer having the effect on private borrowing costs to which we were accustomed . 
It was obvious that the lending channels in the banking system had become dysfunctional ; excessively restrictive borrowing conditions were suppressing demand . 
In response , the ECB did precisely what any central bank would have done : we acted to restore the relationship between our monetary policy and the cost of borrowing , aiming to bring down the average rate that households and firms have to pay . 
In June , we introduced a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations ( known as TLTROs ) to provide funding for banks at very low fixed rates for a period of up to four years . 
The TLTROs were designed to maximize the chances that banks would pass on the funding relief to borrowers . 
Our programs to purchase asset-backed securities and covered bonds were tailored to help lubricate further the transmission of lower funding costs from banks to customers . 
Together , these measures offer a powerful response that addresses the root causes of impaired bank lending , thereby facilitating new credit flows to the real economy . 
And tentative evidence suggests that they are delivering some initial tangible benefits to the euro area &apos;s economy . 
At the same time , inflation has continued trending down . 
In November , annual inflation in the euro area fell to a cyclical low of 0.3 % , largely owing to the sharp fall in oil prices since the end of the summer . 
But falling core inflation ( which excludes volatile energy and food prices ) also points to weak aggregate demand . 
And , indeed , the ECB &apos;s latest staff projections entail a notable downgrading of the macroeconomic outlook . 
Falling oil prices and the prospect of a prolonged period of low inflation also seem to have affected inflation expectations . 
Given the potency of the recent oil-price shock , the risk is that inflation may temporarily slip into negative territory in the coming months . 
Normally , any central bank would welcome a positive supply shock . 
After all , lower oil prices boost real incomes and may lead to higher output in the future . 
But we may not be able to celebrate . 
That is why the ECB Governing Council has reiterated its unanimous commitment to use additional unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to address a prolonged period of low inflation , or should the monetary stimulus fall short of our intention to move our balance sheet toward its size in early 2012 . 
This would imply altering the scope , pace and composition of our measures early next year , and staff from the ECB and national central banks have stepped up technical preparations for further measures , if needed , with a view to implementing them in a timely manner . 
If we were to judge that the economy is in need of further stimulus , one option could be to extend the ECB &apos;s outright asset purchases to other asset classes . 
But it is important to remember that asset purchases are not an end in themselves . 
They are an instrument , not a target , of monetary policy . 
An important criterion for the choice of additional measures should be the extent of their influence over broad financing conditions in the private economy . 
For example , purchases of bonds issued by euro-area non-financial corporations ( NFCs ) would probably have some direct pass-through effect on firms &quot; financing costs . 
But , compared to other asset classes , the market for NFC bonds is relatively thin . 
It would be a different matter if we were to decide to buy bonds issued by euro-area sovereigns - the only market where size would generally not be an issue . 
Interventions in this market would likely entail a stronger signal that the ECB is committed to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy for an extended period of time . 
The effectiveness of interventions in the sovereign-bond market - that is , their ability to lower the borrowing costs of households and firms further - will also rest on the state of the banking sector . 
Higher capital ratios , lower exposure to bad loans , and more transparent balance sheets increase the chances that the ECB &apos;s quantitative impulses will be transmitted to the wider economy . 
That is why the completion of the ECB &apos;s comprehensive assessment of banks &quot; balance sheets and the start of Europe-wide banking supervision will help revitalize sluggish lending in the euro area . 
In particular , increased clarity and transparency about banks &quot; balance sheets , together with a better-capitalized banking sector , will create a more supportive lending environment . 
But a decision to purchase sovereign bonds would also need to build on and factor in the institutional specificities of the euro area , including the limits set by the EU Treaty . 
The year ahead will be challenging and rife with uncertainty . 
But if the past holds any lesson , it is that , if our ability to fulfill our mandate is at risk , we will not hesitate to act .
