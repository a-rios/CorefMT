Russia and the West After Iraq 
The US-led invasion of Iraq called into question the efficacy of today &apos;s international system . 
While the US will probably not achieve all of its goals in Iraq , the war has clearly confirmed and strengthened its global supremacy . 
How should Russia respond ? 
Where do its interests lie , and what kinds of policy should its leaders pursue ? 
In particular , how should Russia position itself vis-Ã -vis the incipient rivalry between Europe and the United States ? 
The Iraqi crisis revealed deep differences between the US and Western Europe in matters of political culture , ethics , approaches to international politics , and the role of military force . 
These differences will hardly break the basic trans-Atlantic alliance built on the foundation of common values and interests . 
The war in Iraq has also revealed the critical state of the European Union &apos;s foreign and defense policies . 
Attempts to have Europe speak with one voice obviously failed . 
In light of even greater differences resulting from the enlargement , they are not likely to succeed in the near future . 
Moreover , as confrontation with the US intensifies , Washington will probably act to forestall any trend toward the unification of EU foreign and defense policy . 
In the absence of such common policy , the EU and its leading members will remain in the second league of world-class players for the foreseeable future . 
In this context , it was a mistake for Russia to side so strongly with France and Germany against the US . 
It was not as bad as during Soviet times , when we used to side with the Third World against both America and Europe , but it was still not in Russia &apos;s long-term interest . 
France was pursuing its own Gaullist goal of strengthening French national prestige by inflicting damage or even humiliation upon the US . 
Germany &apos;s chancellor was not motivated by European goals , either , but took an anti-war stand on Iraq to deal with his own domestic problems : the weakness of his government and pacifist sentiments among the majority of Germans . 
A struggle for preserving the vestiges of greatness may be a worthy goal ; perhaps France , a country richer than Russia , can afford these objectives . 
But do Russians really want to tickle their vanity at the expense of the long-term interests of our economically devastated country ? 
Nor does Russia need to cater to pacifism for domestic political considerations , as a pacifist movement is non-existent in my country . 
One goal of European foreign policy has always been to prevent excessive rapprochement between Russia and the US . 
Good US-Russian relations , however , could strengthen both countries , and especially Russia . 
Some people in Russia - traditional leftists and corrupt bureaucrats afraid of a more open system - indulge in anti-American rhetoric . 
But anti-Americanism is simply irrational for Russia , which only stands to gain from an alliance with the world &apos;s economic and political leader . 
Of course , good relations with Europe are a priority for Russia , especially economic links , human contacts , and social interactions . 
Russia will also benefit from an active foreign-policy engagement with the EU &apos;s leading members . 
But a strategic alliance with the EU in foreign and security policies remains unrealistic and inefficient . 
Europe will most likely continue to grow weaker , rather than stronger , in this field . 
That is why Europe will inevitably be a minor priority if Russia manages to restore and maintain special relations with the US . 
Russia could also play the role of a &quot; transatlantic integrator , &quot; mediating the various conflicts and differences in the traditional Atlantic community . 
Obviously , we are more suited for this role than , say Poland , which is also trying to play it . 
A similar bridging role could perhaps be played by Russia with respect to China and India , with which we should establish maximally close relations . 
But close relations with the US do not mean that Russia must neglect its own interests , both political and economic . 
In the context of Iraq , for example , Russia should constructively support the rebuilding effort , even if , as of now , its participation has not been sought . 
But while supporting the new Iraqi government , Russia should not break off contacts , if they still exist , with moderate members of the Baath party , many of whom may come back to power . 
After all , Iraq has few other elites to rely upon , much as Russia had no non-Communist elite after 1991 . 
Should such a possibility arise , Russia should take part in peacemaking and reconstruction operations in Iraq , rather than trying to put a spoke in Washington &apos;s wheel . 
Indeed , unlike Kosovo , where we have no serious interests and should withdraw from the peacekeeping efforts , Russia stands both to gain and lose a lot in Iraq . 
We have our interests to protect , the most important of which are economic : recovery of Iraqi debts owed to Russia , the contractually agreed-upon development of oil fields , restoration of public infrastructure . 
More generally , Russia must play the oil card , which still gives the country a powerful trump in international relations , especially in light of long-term destabilization of the Middle East . 
Russia will both derive large revenues from oil for many decades and can also play the role of an &quot; energy stabilizer &quot; that will be important for maintaining world peace . 
Wise use of oil resources will not only provide a long-term foundation for Russia &apos;s modernization , but will also enhance Russia &apos;s geopolitical influence .
