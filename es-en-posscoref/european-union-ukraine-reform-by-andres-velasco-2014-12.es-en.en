Betting on Ukraine 
KYIV - A year ago , young Ukrainians were risking their lives on Kyiv &apos;s Independence Square to defend an agreement that would bring their country closer to the European Union . 
That uprising ended a corrupt regime and brought to power - after a free and fair election - what appears to be Ukraine &apos;s most reform-minded government ever . 
One might have expected the heroic commitment of Ukrainians to Europe &apos;s democratic ideals to trigger a rush of Western support for the country in its battle against Russian aggression and economic instability . 
But that has not been the case . 
Indeed , though the last EU leadership summit of 2014 brought the courageous decision to &quot; stay the course &quot; on Russian sanctions , it produced little movement on aid to Ukraine . 
Donald Tusk , the former Polish prime minister who was chairing his first summit as President of the European Council , supports additional financing for Ukraine . 
But , as the Financial Times reports , several EU countries &quot; willingness to come up with the money remains &quot; lukewarm at best . &quot; 
When confronted with a debt crisis in the eurozone , European leaders repeatedly kicked the can down the road . 
Now , they are about to make the same mistake in Ukraine , with even more devastating potential consequences . 
Ukraine is facing a steady drain on bank deposits , large fiscal and current-account deficits , and sizeable external debt payments in the next few years . 
With its international reserves dwindling , the country cannot finance these gaps with its own dollar resources . 
The International Monetary Fund has estimated that Ukraine will need $ 15 billion in outside help in 2015 , in addition to the $ 17 billion bailout that it received last year . 
The funding gap extends into 2016 and beyond . 
Stabilizing Ukraine &apos;s economy will , of course , require deep domestic reforms . 
The government will have to cut energy subsidies to reduce the yawning deficit of Naftogaz , the state-owned oil and gas company . 
At the same time , the central bank must continue to clean up and close insolvent banks and ensure the recapitalization of viable financial institutions . 
And , with Transparency International &apos;s corruption perceptions index ranking Ukraine 142nd out of 175 countries , drastic measures to improve and professionalize governance are imperative . 
But these reforms can succeed only in an environment of financial stability . 
With the fiscal deficit being financed through money creation , inflation is high and the hryvnia , Ukraine &apos;s currency , has depreciated ( though nowhere near as much as the Russian ruble ) . 
An external aid package that is large enough to restore confidence and assuage financing doubts is a precondition for successful structural reform . 
The other prerequisite is political legitimacy . 
After all , reform demands tremendous sacrifices from citizens . 
Elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe , citizens readily accepted such sacrifices , because generous financial assistance from the West and the prospect of EU membership lent credibility to the promise of democracy and future prosperity . 
Ukrainians must perceive that the pain of adjustment is being shared fairly , which means that the country &apos;s oligarchs must become subject , at long last , to the rule of law . 
But , given that a free , stable , and prosperous Ukraine is very much in Europe &apos;s strategic interest , the EU &apos;s member governments should also share the burden of financing reform . 
The funding that Ukraine will need to stabilize its economy over the next four years looks paltry when compared to the more than $ 300 billion , from different sources , devoted to bailing out Greece - a country where there is far less at stake strategically . 
During previous financial crises , from Mexico in 1994 to southern Europe recently , the international community has proved that it can be very creative when it comes to finding mechanisms to channel emergency funds . 
This suggests that the problem today is not insufficient money or institutional constraints , but a lack of political will . 
Skeptics in the EU and the German government acknowledge the urgency of Ukraine &apos;s plight ; but they fear that the money will go to waste in the absence of comprehensive reforms . 
Cynics privately add that hyperinflation may not be such a bad thing after all , because it would force local politicians to reform . 
But that ignores history : Ukraine suffered hyperinflation in the 1990s , only to elect governments headed by President Leonid Kuchma , whose misrule incited the Orange Revolution in 2004 , and President Viktor Yanukovych , who was overthrown in February 2014 . 
Clearly , such complacent views are both wrongheaded and terribly dangerous . 
The success of reform efforts can never be assured in advance . 
The current government in Ukraine has an unprecedented electoral mandate for change . 
It has also drawn into public service some of the country &apos;s best and brightest ( including from the Ukrainian diaspora ) to fight a war and stave off an economic meltdown simultaneously . 
One hesitates to consider what might happen if they fail . 
Plan B in Ukraine is surely not more reform , but less of it - and probably the kind of reckless economic populism that Latin America has witnessed in recent years , from Hugo Chávez &apos;s Venezuela to Néstor and Cristina Kirchner &apos;s neo-Peronist Argentina . 
That possibility alone should be sufficient to spur the IMF , the United States , and , above all , the EU to act . 
In the grey and depressing days of the Soviet Union , an independent and democratic Ukraine seemed unimaginable . 
Yet it happened . 
Today , economic and political reform seems similarly daunting ; but it remains just as attainable . 
For Western governments , coming to the aid of Ukraine is a gamble , but one that is surely worth taking .
