Whither the Strong Dollar ? 
CAMBRIDGE : In his first international outing America &apos;s new Treasury Secretary Paul O &apos;Neill got tripped up - by telling the truth . 
During the Clinton Administration , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and then Lawrence Summers stated that America had a &quot; strong dollar policy . &quot; 
O &apos;Neill reportedly said that &quot; We are not pursuing ... a policy of a strong dollar . &quot; 
Immediately attacked for reversing a long-held policy , he quickly retreated . 
Too bad , because his comment made a lot more sense than his predecessors &quot; statements . 
The truth is , America really doesn &apos;t have an exchange rate policy . 
When Alan Greenspan ponders the next move in US interest rates , little attention is paid to the dollar &apos;s exchange rate vis-à-vis the Euro , Yen , or other currencies . 
American monetary policy decisions depend on the strength or weakness of the domestic economy and on US inflation . 
If the economy is slowing , if there is excess capacity , and if inflation is low , interest rates are reduced ; if the economy is strong , if excess capacity is limited , and if inflationary pressures are growing , interest rates are raised . 
Nor does the Fed intervene directly in foreign exchange markets except in extraordinary circumstances . 
In only one sense does the US actually pursue a &quot; strong dollar &quot; policy : the Federal Reserve &apos;s monetary policy is designed to keep inflation low . 
The dollar is kept &quot; strong &quot; in terms of its purchasing power over US goods and services . 
But this is not what markets believed the &quot; strong dollar &quot; policy meant . 
They believed that the strong dollar policy referred to exchange rates . 
In this sense , the &quot; strong dollar &quot; policy would mean that America has a &quot; weak Euro &quot; policy or a &quot; weak Yen &quot; policy . 
It has no such thing . 
So why did successive Treasury Secretaries say that the US has a strong dollar policy ? 
Part of the answer is that support for a strong dollar is an easy slogan ; it sounds patriotic . 
Moreover , it would have been viewed as hostile if Secretaries Rubin and Summers insisted that they believed in a &quot; weak Euro , &quot; even if they were implicitly saying that . 
A truer statement for Rubin and Summers would have been to say that America actually has no exchange rate policy , the answer that O &apos;Neill tried to give . 
Another reason exists for their statements . 
Some US officials believe that the &quot; strong dollar &quot; statements helped stabilize foreign exchange markets , even if American monetary policy was not directed at the dollar &apos;s strength vis-à-vis the Euro or Yen . 
Some believe that , without such statements , the dollar would plunge relative to the Euro and Yen . 
After all , if the USTreasury Secretary does not support the dollar , what would sustain its value ? 
According to this interpretation , market participants would begin to predict the decline of the dollar . 
They would sell dollars in anticipation of its decline . 
Those currency sales would indeed lead to a collapse of the currency . 
The decline in the dollar &apos;s value would be a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Self-fulfilling swings in a currency do seem to operate . 
Statements about a &quot; strong dollar &quot; policy could support the value of the dollar over a short period of time , even years . 
But eventually , fundamental economic strengths and weaknesses have more effect on the exchange rate than self-fulfilling prophecies . 
If , as now seems to be the case , America &apos;s economy is weakening while Europe &apos;s economies remain strong , the dollar will weaken vis-à-vis the Euro whether or not the US Treasury Secretary promotes the dollar . 
A weaker dollar vis-à-vis the Euro will help sustain demand in the US as the economy slows . 
Similarly , the Yen will tend to weaken vis-à-vis both the dollar and the Euro because of Japan &apos;s underlying weaknesses . 
If statements about a strong dollar policy had any effect at all , they probably helped promote America &apos;s financial bubble during 1998-2000 . 
Investors in the US and the rest of the world believed for this short period that investments in the US guaranteed riches ; this contributed to the boom and bust in US technology stocks . 
The naive view that the dollar would always remain strong ( and would strengthen even more ) vis-à-vis the Euro added fuel to the capital inflows into America . 
Now that the bubble is bursting , US stock markets are down and the dollar is weakening relative to the Euro . 
The earlier excesses could bring on a recession in the US this year . 
So what should America &apos;s exchange rate policy be ? 
Basing American monetary policy on domestic business conditions , rather than on the exchange rate , is correct . 
Small economies closely integrated with their trading partners might set exchange rate targets , or fix their exchange rate to the currencies of their trading partners , but large and relatively closed economies like the US , EU , and Japan , do better to focus on their own business conditions , letting markets determine the exchange rate . 
The dollar should be left to rise or fall vis-à-vis the Euro and Yen depending on the underlying strengths and weaknesses of the three economic areas . 
In today &apos;s context , market forces will probably lead to a further weakening of the dollar vis-à-vis the Euro , and a further weakening of the Yen vis-à-vis both the dollar and the Euro . 
Secretary O &apos;Neill therefore had it right , even if his words were clumsy . 
America should have neither a strong dollar nor a weak dollar policy , only a policy of sensible domestic monetary policies , and a belief that foreign exchange markets should determine exchange rates .
