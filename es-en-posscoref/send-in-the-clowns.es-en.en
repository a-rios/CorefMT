Send in the Clowns 
New York  -  
Beppo Grillo is one of Italy &apos;s most famous comics . 
He is also one of Italy &apos;s most influential political commentators . 
His blog attracts 160,000 hits daily , and if he could run for prime minister ( he can &apos;t , because of a criminal record ) , more than half of Italy &apos;s voters , according to a poll last year , would have considered voting for him . 
Grillo is yet another reminder of a modern phenomenon : the important role of comedians in contemporary politics . 
Until a few years ago , the one TV program most Mexicans turned to for political information was called The Morning Quickie , broadcast from 6-10 a.m. 
The host , interviewer , and main commentator was Victor Trujillo , better known as Brozo the Clown , adorned with a green wig and a red rubber nose . 
It was Brozo the Clown who exposed a major corruption scandal in the office of a former Mexico City mayor . 
While staid TV pundits ask the usually vapid questions during presidential debates in the United States , candidates know that the really important thing is to get laughs on the comedy shows of David Letterman or Jay Leno . 
And , for several years , American liberals have looked to Jon Stewart , another comic talent , for critical political commentary . 
Of course , comic entertainment in politics is not just a modern phenomenon . 
Nero was a murderer who understood that he had to amuse the masses to gain popular support . 
Then there is the long tradition of the court jester with license to criticize the despot by sweetening his barbs with jokes . 
The annual Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington , where the president is lampooned by the press , is a relic of this custom . 
In the US , especially , the borderlines between showbiz and politics ( or indeed religion ) have always been porous . 
The similarities between the variety show , the evangelical meeting , and the party convention are striking . 
Europeans like to sneer at American political jamborees as being hopelessly vulgar . 
In fact , democracy demands a degree of showmanship and pizzazz ; politicians need to appeal to the mass of voters , and not just to an elite , which can afford to ignore hoi polloi . 
To be utterly boring , holding forth for hours on end , regardless of entertainment value , is the privilege of autocrats . 
Only communist rulers could force millions of people to buy their complete works , filled with wooden ideas written in turgid prose . 
The problem with many democratic politicians today is that they have become almost as dull as the old communist autocrats . 
Most , especially in Europe , are professional politicians with no experience apart from working the levers of party machines . 
Gone , for the most part , are the colorful rogues and public-spirited idealists who used to liven up parliamentary politics . 
Like bureaucrats , professional politicians have mastered the art of saying nothing interesting in public . 
They are managed by equally professional press handlers , masters of spin and the television sound bite . 
In these dying days of serious newspaper journalism , slick television shows , packaged by highly-paid anchormen - who never utter an original thought themselves , and would never expect a politician to do so - are the only venues where professional politicians feel secure enough to &quot; face &quot; the public . 
As a result , the public is turned off . 
Not since the 1930 &quot; s has popular disgust with politicians in Europe , the US , as well as Japan , run so high . 
This is dangerous , because such sentiments can end in disgust with liberal democracy itself . 
Does the future belong , then , to the clowns , the anarchic blogosphere , the anti-politicians , and the populist showmen who entertain the masses with jokes , slurs , and indiscretions on TV channels , which some of them actually own ? 
If the success of a TV pundit with a red rubber nose is a rebuke to the dull and fawning anchormen , the political success in recent years of entertainers , demagogues , and public figures who make a virtue of their indiscretion is a slap in the face of the professional political class which they profess to despise . 
The recent re-election of the great showman Silvio Berlusconi illustrates this perfectly . 
Although none of the aspiring candidates for the US presidency can match him in terms of zaniness , similar trends are plain to see . 
John McCain managed to defeat his more conventional Republican rivals by seeming to be totally different from them : a maverick who says what he damned well wants , a tough guy with the knowing wink of the old ladies &quot; man . 
Barack Obama , at least when he began his campaign , had all the charisma of the holy roller , turning on the crowds with the rhetorical spark of a great evangelist . 
That is why he barged his way past Hillary Clinton , the consummate operator of the party machine . 
In some ways , Obama &apos;s candidacy illustrates the problems facing our democracies today . 
People don &apos;t trust the professionals . 
But electing a clown is not the answer either . 
Obama happily combines showmanship and seriousness in a way that could inject new life into the democratic system . 
But he has been maneuvered into a peculiar dilemma . 
Attacked for being shallow , indiscreet , and flashy by the Hillary camp , he has toned down his revivalist rhetoric , and adopted a more sober , more cautious , more professional air . 
Yet , by doing so , he may have made himself less popular , and is being accused of elitism to boot . 
Here is one case where a bit more vulgar showbiz may be exactly what democracy requires .
