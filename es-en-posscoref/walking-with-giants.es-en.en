Walking with Giants 
PARIS -In the aftermath of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit last year , European and American officials insisted that G20 membership was imposing &quot; new responsibilities . &quot; 
They invited policymakers from the emerging giants to become more involved in designing a new global economic framework - implicitly suggesting that this has not been the case so far . 
Yet the evidence does not support this view . 
Brazil , China , India , Korea , and Mexico had already been playing a decisive role in two major areas - the global trade regime and the management of the worldwide economic crisis ; the jury is still out on a third - climate change . 
Few people appear to realize the fundamental contribution of the emerging economies to the success of the current global trade regime . 
During the last three decades , the amazing success of China &apos;s trade liberalization has done much more to convince other developing countries of the gains from trade than all the OECD countries &quot; exhortations . 
Similarly , among World Trade Organization members , China has made the deepest commitment to liberalization of services , India has raised the issue of wider services liberalization , and Brazil has been decisive in cracking American and European agricultural protection . 
During key WTO ministerial negotiations in July 2008 , Brazil was the most pro-active negotiator . 
Those negotiations failure are generally attributed to India and the United States , but most observers seem to agree that America &apos;s responsibility was greater . 
On crisis management in the wake of the financial meltdown in 2008 , the emerging economies have been as diligent and active as the US and the European Union . 
The deterioration of the overall fiscal balances of South Korea , China , and India has been just as severe as in the larger EU member states . 
Crisis-related discriminatory macroeconomic measures taken in 2009 by all the main emerging economies other than India and Brazil are comparable to those in the US and throughout the EU . 
Last but not least , the core emerging economies have abstained from increasing tariffs , and their stimulus packages grant much more limited subsidies to the banking and automobile sectors than do comparable packages in OECD countries . 
The exception has been China &apos;s dramatic stimulus measures , which , being industrial policies , will be a source of severe trouble in the future . 
As for climate change , the positions of the emerging economies were until mid-2009 negative or defensive . 
But India did much to change the mood when it became pro-active in the climate-change debate in the run-up to last December &apos;s Copenhagen summit . 
Just before the meeting , China announced a substantial cut in the increase , although not the level , of its emissions . 
The leadership credentials of other G20 countries , such as Argentina , Indonesia , South Africa , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , and Turkey , have been less convincing . 
These countries have been more hesitant in trade matters , more ambiguous in the instruments they have chosen for managing the crisis , and remain reluctant to deal with environmental issues . 
These attitudes also largely echo their less convincing economic performance . 
The fact that the core emerging economies have contributed substantially to shaping the new global economic framework does not mean that they do not still face serious challenges . 
In particular , the huge income discrepancies between them and the rich countries endanger their own long-term growth and political stability , and could yet impair their future involvement in the G20 process . 
It is fashionable nowadays to look to stricter international rules as &quot; the solution &quot; to most global problems , But such a strategy is not well-suited to an ongoing shift in international economic relations . 
The emergence of new world powers , combined with the diminishing influence of current powers , is not propitious for stricter disciplines . 
The world &apos;s rising powers are likely to be increasingly disinclined to accept constraints that they see as American or European tutelage . 
At the same time , they are still far from being able either to exert leadership or introduce more discipline themselves . 
This means that the OECD countries will have to lead by example . 
What , in concrete terms , would such an approach mean ? 
First , when reforming their own domestic regulatory frameworks , they should avoid dramatic swings away from allegedly rational markets to allegedly rational governments . 
Rather , they should improve the quality of regulation , along with enforcement and monitoring . 
As regulation is a form of competition between governments , focusing on improved regulation increasingly looks like the best channel of influence available to OECD countries . 
Second , OECD countries should keep their markets open , and open those that are closed - in agriculture ( crucial to the sustained growth of emerging economies like Argentina , Brazil , and Indonesia ) or in services ( crucial for countries like India or Korea ) . 
Above all , these areas hold the key to generating more domestically-based growth in all the emerging economies . 
All of this implies much stronger support from OECD countries , especially the US , for a successful conclusion of the Doha WTO trade round . 
This year , South Korea - one of the best performers during the global crisis - will hold the G20 chair . 
Giving strong support to South Korea &apos;s initiatives offers a splendid opportunity for the OECD countries to show that , though they remain proud of the disappearing post-WWII world , they do not fear the new world that is emerging .
