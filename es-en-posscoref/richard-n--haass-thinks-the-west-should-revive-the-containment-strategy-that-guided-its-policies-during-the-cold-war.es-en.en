The Sources of Russian Conduct 
NEW YORK - No set amount of time must pass before journalism gives way to history , but normally historians write with the advantage of perspective that reflects the passage of years , decades , or even centuries . 
Time is necessary for information to come to light , memoirs to be written , and the significance of events to reveal itself . 
What seems relatively trivial now may prove to have been anything but , just as what appears to loom large can fade in importance . 
But , for better or worse , the West does not have the luxury of waiting to make sense of recent events in Ukraine , simply because there is no assurance that what occurred in Crimea is unique . 
Thousands of Russian troops remain on Ukraine &apos;s eastern border ; every day , there are new reports of unrest inside Ukraine , many allegedly instigated by Russia . 
We thus need to move quickly to understand what recent events imply about Russia , its president , Vladimir Putin , and the international order . 
It is no less important to apply the lessons swiftly . 
Putin wants to restore Russia to what he regards as its rightful place in the world . 
He is genuinely angry over what he views as the humiliations suffered since the end of the Cold War , including the Soviet Union &apos;s breakup and NATO &apos;s enlargement - though he will never admit that Russia actually lost the Cold War . 
At the same time , Putin is preoccupied with perpetuating his rule and ensuring that he does not suffer the same fate as former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych , who had been his proxy in Kyiv . 
And he clearly recognizes that the restoration of Russia &apos;s former greatness is a goal shared by many of his countrymen . 
Foreign policy can make for good domestic politics . 
As a result , Putin can be expected to continue to interfere in Ukraine for as long as he can - and so long as it serves his aim of strengthening his grip on power at home . 
Western policy should seek to frustrate this strategy . 
Countering Russian interference in Ukraine does not warrant incorporating Ukraine into NATO . 
US President Barack Obama was correct in describing Russia as a regional rather than a global power - on its periphery , it is strong , and it has a substantial stake in Ukraine &apos;s future . 
Still , the West has several options . 
One is to strengthen Ukraine politically ( helping with elections and getting a new government up and running ) and economically . 
The recently agreed two-year , $ 27 billion financial-aid package , largely funded by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund , will help . 
Security assistance should emphasize intelligence and policing so that Ukraine is less vulnerable to Russian attempts to sow discord and cause unrest . 
Another option is to prepare a new round of economic sanctions against Russia - far stronger than those introduced following Russia &apos;s invasion and annexation of Crimea . 
The new measures should target Russian financial institutions and limit what may be exported to Russia , and the US and EU should communicate their agreement on such sanctions to Putin , so that he understands the full price he will pay for destabilizing Ukraine . 
A public-diplomacy dimension to Western policy is also needed . 
Russians might think twice about supporting their government &apos;s foreign policy if they came to appreciate its impact on their standard of living . 
And they might be surprised to learn the full extent of Putin &apos;s personal wealth , a matter that should be documented and publicized . 
Steps can also be taken to weaken Russia &apos;s energy stranglehold on Ukraine and much of Western Europe . 
The US , for its part , can begin exporting oil and increase its capacity to export natural gas . 
Europeans can take steps to introduce the technologies that have led to the boom in US gas production , and Germany can revisit its position on nuclear power . 
Recent events should also serve as a wake-up call for NATO . 
People and governments need to rid themselves of the comforting illusion that countries &quot; use of military force to acquire territory is an anachronism . 
European defense spending and capacity needs to increase , as does America &apos;s presence in select NATO countries - something that can be achieved even as the US increases its presence in Asia . 
The strategy needed to resist Putin &apos;s efforts to expand Russia &apos;s influence beyond its borders - and to induce change within them - resembles nothing so much as the &quot; containment &quot; doctrine that guided Western policy for the four decades of the Cold War . 
Russia , a country of only 143 million people that lacks a modern economy , should be offered the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of international integration , but only if it acts with restraint . 
But there is a strong case for adopting a policy that has proved its effectiveness in confronting a country with imperial pretensions abroad and feet of clay at home .
