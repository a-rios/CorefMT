The Fight for Pakistan &apos;s Soul 
CAMBRIDGE - As its army confronts , ever more bloodily , the Taliban in the Swat Valley , Pakistan is fighting for its very soul . 
The army appears to be winning this time around , in marked contrast to its recent half-hearted confrontations with Taliban forces in neighboring tribal areas . 
For now , the Taliban are on the run , some with shaved beards and some in burqas , to avoid being recognized and thrashed . 
The reason is simple : increasingly , people across Pakistan support the army &apos;s action . 
This round of fighting was preceded by a negotiated calm , as the government sought to quell militants in Pakistan &apos;s tribal areas by striking a deal with the Taliban leader , Sufi Mohammad . 
The deal , which instituted a version of Sharia law in the region in exchange for a commitment that militants would lay down their weapons , was blessed by the comparatively liberal Awami National Party ( ANP ) , which governs the North-West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) , where Swat is located . 
But the Taliban &apos;s assurances of a lower profile were upended by two incidents that exposed its real face . 
First , private news channels broadcast across the country a video clip recorded on a cell phone of the public flogging of a 17-year-old Swat girl . 
This gave the public a stark sense of what Taliban justice really meant . 
Then , Mohammad was interviewed on GEO TV , where he explained his political views . 
According to Mohammad , democracy is un-Islamic , as are Pakistan &apos;s constitution and judiciary , and Islam bars women from getting an education or leaving their homes except to perform the Hajj in Mecca . 
Religious conservatives were stunned . 
Leaders of the religious parties rushed to denounce Mohammad &apos;s views . 
The Pakistani media revisited a famous comment by Mohammad Iqbal , the poet-philosopher who devised the idea of an independent Muslim state in Pakistan . 
Still , it &apos;s not over until it &apos;s over - and in the short term a lot depends on the state &apos;s capacity to hold the Swat area and re-establish civilian institutions there . 
And , even if the state succeeds , re-asserting control over Swat will only be the first step . 
The Taliban is spread throughout the NWFP and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas . 
&quot; Punjabi Taliban &quot; militants from the fighting in Kashmir against India continue to shuttle between the Punjab heartland and the Northwest Territories , posing another serious challenge to government authority . 
In the long-term , however , what really matters is whether the Muslims of South Asia will be able to roll back the spread of Talibanization altogether . 
The answer to that question lies within the various Muslim communities of the region , not just in Pakistan . 
Afghanistan faces an election later this year . 
A clear and transparent vote will make a real difference in establishing the credibility of the Afghan government . 
In Pakistan , the democratic transition , after years of military rule , is still not complete . 
There is much hope , though , in the vibrancy of the Pakistani media , as well as in the energy that the legal community generated last March in restoring deposed Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry to his seat on the Supreme Court . 
Then there is the Pakistani army , the country &apos;s &quot; super political party . &quot; 
To a large degree , Pakistan &apos;s relations with India , Afghanistan , and the United States depend on the military . 
Army commander Ashfaq Kiyani has shown no interest in taking over the state , as his predecessor , General Pervez Musharraf , did . 
But the army must accept its subservience to Pakistan &apos;s political leadership . 
The army command must finally recognize that repeated military interventions have not served the country well . 
Most significantly , in the face of martial law and political assassination , Pakistanis have not given up their dream of democracy . 
A living example of this is Afzal Lala , a Pashtun politician associated with the Awami National Party who , despite all the threats from the bloodthirsty Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , remained in Swat through the recent fighting . 
Democracy will be decisive because it generates investments in education , health , and economic empowerment that reward ordinary voters . 
Talibanization gains ground when people lose faith in the capacity of the modern state to improve their lives . 
While poor law enforcement needs urgent attention , counter-terrorism is never solely a military affair . 
Financial pledges from the US and the &quot; Friends of Pakistan &quot; consortium ( the European Union , China , and Japan ) are important , but when it comes to investing wisely in development projects , Pakistan &apos;s track record is nothing to be proud of . 
Effective oversight from donors and Pakistan &apos;s private sector will be critical . 
Only one condition should be imposed on aid for Pakistan : the first money should be spent on rebuilding all the bombed-out girls &quot; schools in Swat . 
If need be , the army should guard these schools around the clock .
