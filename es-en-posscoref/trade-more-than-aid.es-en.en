Trade More than Aid 
The recent G-8 meeting in Scotland , as well as concerts and celebrity activism , has put a spotlight on the amount of international assistance reaching the countries and peoples of Africa . 
This is understandable in light of the continent &apos;s persistent poverty , seemingly endless conflicts , and the prevalence of HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases . 
If properly targeted and conditioned on reforms , international aid can make a positive difference . 
But aid is no panacea . 
The fact that so many problems persist despite tens of billions of dollars of assistance and years of effort is a sad reminder that aid can allow governments to undertake foolish investments that accomplish little , or can easily be siphoned off by corrupt officials . 
Moreover , aid is inherently uncertain , leaving Africans at the mercy of outside forces beyond their control . 
Another problem with the emphasis on aid ( in addition to the near impossibility of accurately measuring the scale of the flows from all sources ) is that the political effort to increase it absorbs attention that would be better spent on a more powerful instrument of economic development : trade . 
Trade is the all-but-forgotten weapon in the battle against poverty , but it can provide more help to the poor than aid can . 
If rich countries - in particular , the United States , the 25 members of the EU , and Japan - really want to help poor people , they will open their markets to what poor countries produce , especially textiles , apparel , agricultural products , and commodities . 
Phasing out tariffs and import quotas for poor countries &quot; exports - and phasing out subsidies for their own producers of agricultural products - would have a dramatic effect on the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Africa and elsewhere . 
Private businesses would develop , jobs would be created , and incomes would rise . 
Moreover , trade benefits the world in many other ways , providing a major boost to the advanced economies of the world . 
One recent study estimates that incomes in the US alone could rise by $ 500 billion a year if global trade were to become truly free . 
Similarly , incomes around the world would rise significantly from liberalizing more global trade in both goods and services . 
Trade is also an engine of political and economic reform . 
What countries must do to join the World Trade Organization is precisely what they must do to become productive and democratic : accept the rule of law , reduce corruption , and become open , accountable , and transparent . 
At the same time , increased trade can help create and sustain a middle class - precisely the social group that often stands at the forefront of movements for democratic reform . 
Trade has a strategic benefit as well , for it gives countries a stake in good relations with one another and in maintaining order and stability . 
A China that trades extensively with the US and its Asian neighbors will think twice before it pursues any policy that would place those relationships at risk . 
Likewise , trade between India and Pakistan could contribute to the normalization of ties between these long-estranged neighbors . 
But if the case for expanding world trade is compelling , the prospects for actually doing so are clouded , owing to a simple but nonetheless fundamental political reality : those who gain from trade , which is almost everyone , are not always aware of it . 
The benefits of freer trade , such as job creation , lower inflation , and greater consumer choice , are often invisible or only partly visible . 
By contrast , those who lose from trade , or who fear that they could lose , while relatively small in number , are anything but invisible . 
They feel the threat acutely and act accordingly , often dominating their country &apos;s political process . 
Highly motivated minorities can and do overwhelm the general interests of majorities who are not seized with an issue . 
What is needed , therefore , is a pledge by governments to make global trade liberalization a much higher political priority . 
This will happen only if all of the major trading countries demonstrate a commitment to play by the rules . 
For China , this means respecting and enforcing intellectual property rights , allowing non-Chinese firms to compete on an equal basis , and setting its currency at a fair level rather than one that is artificially low . 
For the US , the EU , and Japan , it means ending massive subsidies to farmers and curtailing other forms of protection provided to uncompetitive sectors . 
Governments can take these steps if they introduce and expand programs designed to assist those who would lose their jobs as a result of trade liberalization . 
Displaced farmers and workers must be provided with the education and training required to enter new jobs , as well as the funds , health care , and other essential services that they need to tide them through the transition . 
There is urgency in all of this . 
The current ( Doha ) round of global trade negotiations is behind schedule ; the next session , to be held in Hong Kong , is only months away . 
Where are the many people who benefit from trade , including the celebrities who care so deeply about alleviating poverty and promoting development ?
