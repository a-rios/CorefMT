Lessons from the Black Tsunami 
The world has been horrified at America &apos;s response to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in New Orleans . 
Four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , and with billions of dollars allegedly spent on &quot; preparedness &quot; for another emergency , America has shown the world that it was not prepared - even for an event that came with ample warning . 
The difference between the Tsunami in Asia last December and what is coming to be called the Black Tsunami in America - because it brought so much devastation to the poor , mostly black , people of Louisiana - is striking . 
The Asian disaster showed the ability of those affected to overcome long-standing rifts , as Aceh rebels put down their arms in common cause with the rest of Indonesia . 
By contrast , the disaster in New Orleans - and elsewhere along America &apos;s Gulf Coast - exposed and aggravated such rifts . 
The Bush administration &apos;s response to the hurricane confirmed the suspicion among blacks that , while they might send their boys to fight America &apos;s wars , they had not only been left behind in America &apos;s prosperity , but that there was neither understanding nor concern when they needed it most . 
An evacuation was ordered , but no means to do so were provided for the poor . 
When help came , it was , as one New York Times columnist noted , like the Titanic : the rich and powerful got out first . 
I was in Thailand right after the Tsunami , and I saw that country &apos;s impressive response . 
The Thais flew consular and embassy officials to the affected areas , aware of the sense of helplessness among those stranded far from home . 
America kept foreign officials from coming to the aid of their nationals in New Orleans - embarrassed , perhaps , at what they would see . 
Even the richest country in the world has limited resources . 
If it gives tax cuts to the rich , it will have less to spend on repairing levees ; if it deploys the National Guard and reserves to fight a hopeless war in Iraq , there will be fewer resources at home to cope with a domestic crisis . 
Choices must be made , and choices matter . 
Shortsighted politicians like Bush often skimp on long-term investments in favor of short-term advantage . 
He recently signed a lavish infrastructure bill that included , among other payoffs to political supporters , an infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska . 
Money that could have been used to save thousands of lives was spent to win votes . 
Seldom do the &quot; chickens come home to roost &quot; as quickly as they have in recent years - an ill-conceived war , attempted on the cheap , has not brought peace to the Middle East . 
Now America has had to pay the price for ignoring loud warnings about the weakened levees of New Orleans . 
Clearly , nothing could have spared New Orleans completely from Katrina &apos;s impact , but the devastation could certainly have been lessened . 
Markets , for all their virtues , often do not work well in a crisis . 
Indeed , the market mechanism is often revolting to behold in emergencies . 
The market did not respond to the need for evacuation by sending in huge convoys of buses to get people out ; in some places , it did respond by tripling hotel prices in neighboring areas , which , while reflecting the marked change in supply and demand , is reviled as price gouging . 
Such behavior is so odious because it brings little allocative benefit - no significant increase in supply in the short run - and carries a huge distributive cost , as those with resources take advantage of those without . 
The Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has emphasized that most famines are associated not with a shortage of food , but the failure to get food to the people who need it , largely because they lack purchasing power . 
America , the richest country in the world , clearly had the resources to evacuate New Orleans . 
Bush simply forgot the poor - the tens , perhaps hundreds of thousands , who simply did not have the resources to pay for their own evacuation . 
When you &apos;re poor , you don &apos;t have a credit card , and most of the stranded were especially strapped for funds because it was the end of the month . 
That &apos;s one of the reasons why the military does not use a price system to allocate resources . 
Last January , after the tsunami , in response to widespread calls for an early warning system , I observed that the world had been given an early warning on global warming . 
The rest of the world has begun to take heed , but Bush , having ignored warnings about Al Qaeda &apos;s plans prior to September 11 , 2001 , and having not only ignored the warnings about New Orleans levees , but actually gutted funding to shore them , has not led America to do likewise . 
Scientists increasingly believe that global warming will be accompanied by larger climatic disturbances . 
Recent evidence is at least consistent with that hypothesis . 
Perhaps Bush had hoped that the consequences of global warming would be felt long after he left office - and would be felt more by poor , low-lying , tropical countries like Bangladesh than by a rich country astride the temperate zones . 
Yet there is perhaps a silver lining in the clouds over New Orleans . 
Perhaps America , and especially Bush , will be persuaded to join the rest of the world in the fight against poverty and to protect our planet &apos;s environment . 
In facing and planning for disasters , whether natural or man-made , we must do more than hope and pray for the best .
