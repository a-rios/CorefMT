The Great Firewall of China 
Writing from 1930 &quot; s Shanghai , China &apos;s great essayist Lu Xun once observed : &quot; Today there are all kinds of weeklies . 
Although their distribution is not very wide , they are shining in the darkness like daggers , letting their comrades know who is attacking the old , strong castles . &quot; 
Muckraking broadsheets in the first half of the last century played cat-and-mouse games with Chinese government censors , ultimately helping to expose the corruption and moral bankruptcy of the Nationalist ( KMT ) government and contributing to the Communist victory in 1949 . 
If that sounds familiar , its is because the Chinese Communist Party never forgets its history - and is determined to prevent history from repeating itself . 
Thus , China &apos;s rulers acted in character last December , when they cracked down on news organizations that were getting a bit too assertive . 
The editor and deputy editors of Beijing News , a relatively new tabloid with a national reputation for exposing corruption and official abuse , were fired . 
In protest , more than 100 members of the newspaper &apos;s staff walked out . 
Most Chinese might not have known about the walkout if it hadn &apos;t been for Chinese bloggers . 
An editorial assistant at the New York Times , Zhao Jing , writing under the pen name Michael Anti , broke the news on his widely read Chinese-language blog . 
He exposed details of behind-the-scenes politics and called for a public boycott of the newspaper , evoking strong public sympathy for the journalists , expressed online in chatrooms and blogs . 
Zhao &apos;s blog wasn &apos;t under the direct control of the Party &apos;s Propaganda Department . 
It was published through a Chinese-language blog-hosting service run by Microsoft &apos;s MSN Spaces . 
On December 30 , Zhao &apos;s blog disappeared . 
Since then , Microsoft has confirmed that its staff removed the blog from an MSN Internet server , citing the need to respect Chinese law when doing business in China . 
Microsoft &apos;s contribution to Chinese political repression follows Yahoo &apos;s role in the sentencing of a dissident reporter and Google &apos;s decision not to display search results that are blocked by what has become known as the &quot; Great Chinese Firewall . &quot; 
Indeed , China has developed the world &apos;s most sophisticated system of Internet blocking and censorship , thereby hiding information unfavorable to China &apos;s rulers from all but the most technologically savvy . 
The system is bolstered by human surveillance and censorship carried out not only by government employees , but also by private service providers . 
Some liken Microsoft &apos;s behavior to IBM &apos;s infamous collaboration with the Nazis in Germany . 
Human rights activists in the United States are calling for legislation that would prevent American companies from engaging in business practices that help repressive regimes stifle democratic movements . 
But the companies argue that there is absolutely no other way to compete - they must either comply with censorship or discontinue business . 
If MSN Spaces did not censor its Chinese blogs , Microsoft argues , the Great Chinese Firewall would simply be programmed to block Chinese Internet users from accessing its service . 
In fact , most international blog-hosting services are blocked in China , which provides a competitive boon to several hundred domestic blog-hosting services . 
These services , with names like Bokee.com , Blogbus.com and Blogcn.com , all comply with Chinese government censorship requirements . 
Software prevents users from posting politically sensitive words , and provocative content that gets past the automated controls is frequently removed . 
These businesses would not be allowed to exist otherwise . 
Despite the censorship , the Chinese blogosphere is blossoming , with probably somewhere between 5-10 million active blogs . 
The Chinese public has grown expert over the years at finding plenty of things to do and talk about while avoiding politically dangerous issues . 
Chinese bloggers are no different . 
New pop cultural celebrities are emerging online , and people are creating their own radio and even TV shows . 
Naturally , the Chinese companies that provide most of the tools used to create and host this content have censorship built into their software , management structure , and business models . 
They are not willing to fight for greater freedom of speech and are even willing to censor each other in order to preserve what they have . 
Which brings us back to China &apos;s greatest modern writer , Lu Xun . 
In 1921 , he wrote a biting piece of social criticism , &quot; The True Story of Ah Q , &quot; about a hapless character who adjusts his values to whatever the circumstances and people around him seem to demand . 
Unfortunately , faced with a choice between protecting the long-term interests and human rights of their customers and complying with laws implemented by unelected power-holders , technology firms like Microsoft , Yahoo , and Google seem to have embraced the Ah Q spirit . 
In the long run , this does not bode well for their global reputations , which depend on users &quot; trust in the openness and independence of their products and services . 
One day , perhaps , censorship will no longer make good business sense anywhere .
