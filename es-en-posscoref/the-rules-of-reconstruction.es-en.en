The Rules of Reconstruction 
Lebanon &apos;s reconstruction , so painstakingly carried out in the 1990 &quot; s , is now at risk of being undone . 
But Lebanon is not alone in that respect : according to the UN and several independent studies , countries in transition from war to peace face roughly a 50 % chance of sliding back into warfare . 
Indeed , in East Timor , Iraq , Afghanistan , Kosovo , and many other countries , the transition to peace seems to be failing . 
Likewise , there is unfinished business in many other countries undergoing reconstruction . 
The Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , for example , just held its first elections in 40 years . 
The stability of the Great Lakes region of Africa , perhaps that continent &apos;s most violent area , will depend on the success of its transition and reconstruction . 
When wars end , countries confront a multi-pronged transition . 
Violence must give way to security for inhabitants ; lawlessness and political exclusion must give way to the rule of law and participatory government ; ethnic , religious , or class / caste polarization must give way to national reconciliation ; and ruined war economies must be transformed into functioning market economies that enable ordinary people to support themselves . 
These multiple tasks make economic reconstruction fundamentally different from &quot; development as usual . &quot; 
To succeed , the transition to peace requires demobilization , disarmament and reintegration of former combatants , as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation of services and infrastructure . 
To meet these goals , the objective of peace should prevail over that of development if the two come into conflict . 
Often , optimal economic policies and best practices are not attainable - or even desirable . 
This also means that peace-related programs should get priority in budget allocations . 
Of course , the legitimacy of the government or other policymaking body will determine what is possible in economic policymaking . 
A weak interim national government - or a United Nations or foreign occupying administration - should not attempt to implement policies such as privatizing national resources when doing so might incite political resistance . 
Indeed , early privatization is likely to be destructive in its own terms , because property rights will remain in question for some time . 
Thus , a new yardstick is needed to measure success . 
Projects must be judged by whether they contribute to peace and reconciliation , rather than on purely economic grounds . 
Effective demobilization and reconciliation in El Salvador , for example , ensured the consolidation of peace after that country &apos;s brutal civil war of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Elsewhere , however , disregarding the primacy of politics in a transition to peace has had tragic consequences . 
The failure to demobilize and reconcile factions in Lebanon , where Hezbollah remained armed despite its transformation into a political party , meant that belligerency was always bubbling below the surface . 
Likewise , the collapse of peace processes in Angola and Haiti and the various setbacks in Cambodia and Nicaragua during the 1990 &quot; s reflect a failure to demobilize and integrate . 
On the surface , the UN seems ideally placed to lead reconstruction efforts because , unlike development institutions like the World Bank , it can integrate the political and economic objectives that are equal parts of a transition to peace . 
Yet , time and again , the UN has shown itself to be incompetent in this role . 
In Kosovo , for example , the transformation of the Kosovo Liberation Army into a civilian peace force has caused great insecurity over the years , which the UN administration might ultimately regret if the resolution of the province &apos;s final status does not lead to independence . 
Treating the transition to peace as &quot; development as usual &quot; has , moreover , led to new violence in East Timor , a country that the UN once trumpeted as a success story . 
The commercial exploitation of rich oil and gas reserves in the Timor Gap could have facilitated reconstruction and created jobs for the 30 % of the labor force that is unemployed . 
Instead , with the strong approval of the IMF , East Timor created a Norwegian-style &quot; petroleum fund &quot; to save the money for a rainy day . 
Iraq provides numerous examples of the dangers created by misplaced priorities . 
Early efforts to privatize Iraq &apos;s oil industry proved disastrous , confirming for many Iraqis that the occupying Americans were determined to &quot; steal &quot; the country &apos;s wealth and thus fanning the flames of violent resistance . 
Indeed , privatization was all the more bizarre as a policy choice because it was doomed in advance : investors clearly would not be attracted to buy assets where property rights might change once a legitimate Iraqi government took over - a huge impediment to investment in Kosovo as well . 
But the United States has not learned its lesson . 
On the verge of civil war , Iraq just announced a restructuring of its foreign debt . 
Rather than improving services and living conditions in areas where it could have helped consolidate peace , the government , at America &apos;s behest , will allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to pay investment banks , accounting firms , and legal advisors who assist with that refinancing . 
Any transition to peace may well prove ephemeral unless policymakers make political reconciliation and integration - not optimal economic policies - the bedrock priority . 
Despite its failures , the UN is probably still the best-placed organization to oversee such efforts . 
But the complexity of the tasks that post-conflict countries face underscores the urgent challenge of providing the UN with the capacity to meet them .
