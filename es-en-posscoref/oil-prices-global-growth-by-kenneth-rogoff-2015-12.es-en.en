Oil Prices and Global Growth 
CAMBRIDGE - One of the biggest economic surprises of 2015 is that the stunning drop in global oil prices did not deliver a bigger boost to global growth . 
Despite the collapse in prices , from over $ 115 per barrel in June 2014 to $ 45 at the end of November 2015 , most macroeconomic models suggest that the impact on global growth has been less than expected - perhaps 0.5 % of global GDP . 
The good news is that this welcome but modest effect on growth probably will not die out in 2016 . 
The bad news is that low prices will place even greater strains on the main oil-exporting countries . 
The recent decline in oil prices is on par with the supply-driven drop in 1985-1986 , when OPEC members ( read : Saudi Arabia ) decided to reverse supply cuts to regain market share . 
It is also comparable to the demand-driven collapse in 2008-2009 , following the global financial crisis . 
To the extent that demand factors drive an oil-price drop , one would not expect a major positive impact ; the oil price is more of an automatic stabilizer than an exogenous force driving the global economy . 
Supply shocks , on the other hand , ought to have a significant positive impact . 
Although parsing the 2014-2015 oil-price shock is not as straightforward as in the two previous episodes , the driving forces seem to be roughly evenly split between demand and supply factors . 
Certainly , a slowing China that is rebalancing toward domestic consumption has put a damper on all global commodity prices , with metal indices also falling sharply in 2015 . 
( Gold prices , for example , at $ 1,050 per ounce at the end of November , are far off their peak of nearly $ 1,890 in September 2011 , and copper prices have fallen almost as much since 2011 . ) 
New sources of oil supply , however , have been at least as important . 
Thanks to the shale-energy revolution , American oil production has risen from five million barrels per day in 2008 to 9.3 million barrels in 2015 , a supply boom that has so far persisted , despite the price collapse . 
Anticipation of post-sanctions Iranian oil production has also affected markets . 
A decline in oil prices is to some extent a zero-sum game , with producers losing and consumers gaining . 
The usual thinking is that lower prices stimulate global demand , because consumers are likely to spend most of the windfall , whereas producers typically adjust by cutting back savings . 
In 2015 , though , this behavioral difference has been less pronounced than usual . 
One reason is that emerging-market energy importers have a much larger global economic footprint than they did in the 1980s , and their approach to oil markets is much more interventionist than in the advanced countries . 
Countries such as India and China stabilize retail energy markets through government-financed subsidies to keep price down for consumers . 
The costs of these subsidies had become quite massive as oil prices peaked , and many countries were already looking hard for ways to cut back . 
Thus , as oil prices have fallen , emerging-market governments have taken advantage of the opportunity to reduce the fiscal subsidies . 
At the same time , many oil exporters are being forced to scale back expenditure plans in the face of sharply falling revenues . 
Even Saudi Arabia , despite its vast oil and financial reserves , has come under strain , owing to a rapidly rising population and higher military spending associated with conflicts in the Middle East . 
The muted effect of oil prices on global growth should not have come as a complete surprise . 
Academic research has been pointing in this direction for a long time . 
Oil is now thought to be less of an independent driver of business cycles than was previously believed . 
Also restraining growth is a sharp decline in energy-related investment . 
After years of rapid growth , global investment in oil production and exploration has fallen by $ 150 billion dollars in 2015 . 
Eventually , this will feed back into prices , but only slowly and gradually : Futures markets have oil prices rising to $ 60 per barrel only by 2020 . 
The good news for 2016 is that most macroeconomic models suggest that the impact of lower oil prices on growth tends to stretch out for a couple years . 
For oil producers , though , the risks are rising . 
Only a couple - notably governance-challenged Venezuela - are in outright collapse ; but many are teetering on the brink of recession . 
Countries with floating exchange rates , including Colombia , Mexico , and Russia , have managed to adjust so far , despite facing significantly tighter fiscal constraints ( though Russia &apos;s situation remains especially vulnerable if low oil prices endure ) . 
By contrast , countries with rigid exchange-rate regimes are being tested more severely . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s long-standing peg to the dollar , once apparently invulnerable , has come under enormous pressure in recent weeks . 
In short , oil prices were not quite as consequential for global growth in 2015 as seemed likely at the beginning of the year . 
And strong reserve positions and relatively conservative macroeconomic policies have enabled most major producers to weather enormous fiscal stress so far , without falling into crisis . 
But next year could be different , and not in a good way - especially for producers .
