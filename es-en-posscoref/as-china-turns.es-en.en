As China Turns 
When Deng Xiaoping began to open China in the late 1970 &quot; s , he said , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter if a cat is black or white . 
As long as it catches mice , it is a good cat . &quot; 
This motto helped catalyze China into becoming what it is today : an increasingly materialistic , money-worshipping society that has lost touch with traditional ethics . 
Nothing captures this moral vacuum more vividly than the recent television drama , &quot; Wo Ju &quot; ( &quot; Crowded Spaces &quot; ) , which has been riveting Chinese audiences . 
The program &apos;s &quot; hero , &quot; Guo Haizao , is a fair-skinned and innocent 25-year-old woman living near Shanghai . 
Initially she follows in her older sister &apos;s footsteps in quest of their common dream , to attend one of China &apos;s top universities . 
But , even with a university degree , life in go-go Shanghai turns out not to be as she had imagined . 
&quot; Why is the world so full of unfairness , with the limelight only splashing on the prettiest spots in the city ? &quot; she wonders one night , as she worries about her and her sister &apos;s struggle to buy a home . 
As Song Siming , a handsome , successful , and Audi-driving - but also married - secretary to the Mayor , tells her , &quot; On those unsightly corners in the dark where dirt , flies , and rats wander , nobody &apos;s paying attention . &quot; 
Song is a resourceful man who oozes charm . 
Guo soon becomes intoxicated by his air of can-do and success . 
When problems arise , he makes a quick phone call and gets things &quot; settled . &quot; 
Little by little , Guo finds herself taken in by his charm and ability to get things done . 
Before long , she is cheating on her boyfriend and swooning into Song &apos;s arms and bed . 
When Guo overhears fights between her sister and brother-in-law in their crammed rented room , her aspirations to get an apartment through hard work , and to start a family with her boyfriend and soon-to-be husband , begin to fade . 
She is tempted by the shortcut Song promises and allows herself to be seduced by him in turn for a large sum of cash and luxury apartment . 
Soon she is even pregnant . 
Song certainly knows how &quot; to catch mice &quot; ! 
&quot; Wo Ju &quot; is an adaptation of a novel about recent skyrocketing housing prices in Chinese cities - especially in Shanghai - and the effect of real-estate fever on young Chinese men and women in today &apos;s get-rich-by-any-means China . 
Through the soap opera , viewers get a sense of how the Chinese dream has begun to center around property ownership rather than education or love , and how this change has been transforming Chinese society , sometimes in startling ways . 
These changes have created a new kind of hope and despair among the generation of Chinese now coming of age . 
But , of course , the sub-text is that if this fixation on property has also led to greater pragmatism in affairs of the heart , it has also led to a worrisome property bubble that many economists now fear could soon burst . 
Then , because this is a soap opera , Song suddenly dies in a car crash , just as he is rushing to the hospital - while being chased by corruption investigators ! - to check on his sweetheart and their unborn baby boy . 
But , as it happens , only days before Guo secretly had an abortion , right after a dramatic fight with Song &apos;s wife . 
As fantastic and convoluted as the plot sometimes gets , &quot; Wo Ju &quot; offers a truthful look at what animates contemporary Chinese society : property , money , sex , cars , and power . 
Perhaps because it captures the zeitgeist so well , the program has become hugely popular , so much so that it has recently caught the attention of media censors . 
Indeed , its realistic use of profanity and its depiction of the spiritual vacuum that grips China got it banished from one of Beijing &apos;s TV channels . 
While the official media are flooding television and cinema screens with propaganda about Confucius , ancient fairytales , and kung fu epics , &quot; Wo Ju &quot; engages a broad cross-section of contemporary society , which sees in it troubling aspects of their own lives : official corruption , mistresses , even house slaves . 
As Song arrogantly says to Guo before he dies , &quot; As long as it &apos;s a problem that we can solve with money , then it &apos;s not a big problem . &quot; 
The program has caused a tsunami of online reflection . 
Many Web sites and bulletin boards have run surveys with questions like , &quot; If you were Guo Haizao , would you choose Song Siming and an apartment or Xiaobei ( the dumped boyfriend ) and true love ? &quot; 
On one of China &apos;s largest sites , 46 % picked Song , while only 22 % chose the young boyfriend , a choice that suggests where the new generation &apos;s values now lay . 
The traditional virtues of &quot; true love &quot; have been replaced by pragmatism and a willingness to become a mistress before youth expires and all chances of getting a good apartment are lost . 
After all , many netizens now argue , does not such a practical course of action save many years of hard work ? 
One recent Internet match-making effort attracted applications from more than 10,000 young women , all seeking a chance to marry a Shenzhen multi-millionaire sight unseen . 
That was not the first lottery marriage in today &apos;s China , and it surely will not be the last . 
The most interesting thing about &quot; Wo Ju &quot; may be that most viewers do not dislike Song , the string-pulling mayor &apos;s secretary . 
Indeed , while Song may be cast as an anti-hero , in contemporary China , he is considered a &quot; good catch . &quot; 
More and more young women are making just such practical choices : putting an apartment before love and pragmatism before principle .
