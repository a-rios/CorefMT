The Economic Costs of Fear 
BERKELEY - The S P stock index now yields a 7 % real ( inflation-adjusted ) return . 
By contrast , the annual real interest rate on the five-year United States Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ( TIPS ) is -1.02 % . 
Yes , there is a &quot; minus &quot; sign in front of that : if you buy the five-year TIPS , each year over the next five years the US Treasury will pay you in interest the past year &apos;s consumer inflation rate minus 1.02 % . 
Even the annual real interest rate on the 30-year TIPS is only 0.63 % - and you run a large risk that its value will decline at some point over the next generation , implying a big loss if you need to sell it before maturity . 
So , imagine that you invest $ 10,000 in the S P index . 
Now , imagine that , of that total , the companies pay out $ 250 in dividends ( which you reinvest to buy more stock ) and retain $ 450 in earnings to reinvest in their businesses . 
If the companies &quot; managers do their job , that reinvestment will boost the value of your shares to $ 10,450 . 
Add to that the $ 250 of newly-bought shares , and next year the portfolio will be worth $ 10,700 - more if stock-market valuations rise , and less if they fall . 
In fact , over any past period long enough for waves of optimism and pessimism to cancel each other out , the average earnings yield on the S P index has been a good guide to the return on the portfolio . 
So , if you invest $ 10,000 in the S P for the next five years , you can reasonably expect ( with enormous upside and downside risks ) to make about 7 % per year , leaving you with a compounded profit in inflation-adjusted dollars of $ 4,191 . 
If you invest $ 10,000 in the five-year TIPS , you can confidently expect a five-year loss of $ 510 . 
That is an extraordinary gap in the returns that you can reasonably expect . 
It naturally raises the question : why aren &apos;t people moving their money from TIPS ( and US Treasury bonds and other safe assets ) to stocks ( and other relatively risky assets ) ? 
People have different reasons . 
And many people &apos;s thinking is not terribly coherent . 
But there appear to be two main explanations . 
First , many people are uncertain that current conditions will continue . 
Most economists forecast the world a year from now to look a lot like the world today , with unemployment and profit margins about the same , wages and prices on average about 1.5 % higher , total production up roughly 2 % , and risks on both the upside and the downside . 
But many investors see a substantial chance of 2008 and 2009 redux , whether triggered by a full-fledged euro crisis or by some black swan that we do not yet see , and fear that , unlike in 2008 and 2009 , governments would lack the power and will to cushion the economic impact . 
These investors do not view the 7 % annual return on stocks as an average expectation , with downside risks counterbalanced by upside opportunities . 
Rather , they see a good-scenario outcome that only the foolhardy would trust . 
Second , many people do see the 7 % return on stocks as a reasonable expectation , and would jump at the chance to grab it - plus the opportunity of surprises on the upside - but they do not think that they can afford to run the downside risks . 
Indeed , the world seems a much more risky place than it seemed five or ten years ago . 
The burden of existing debts is high , and investors &quot; key goal is loss-avoidance , not profit-seeking . 
Both reasons reflect a massive failure of our economic institutions . 
The first reason betrays a lack of trust that governments can and will do the job that they learned how to do in the Great Depression : keep the flow of spending stable so that big depressions with long-lasting , double-digit unemployment do not recur . 
The second reveals the financial industry &apos;s failure adequately to mobilize society &apos;s risk-bearing capacity for the service of enterprise . 
As individuals , we appear to view a gamble that has a roughly 50 % chance of doubling our wealth and a roughly 50 % chance of halving it as worthy of consideration - not a no-brainer , but not out of the question , either . 
Well-functioning financial markets would mobilize that risk-bearing capacity and put it to use for the benefit of all , so that people who did not think that they could run the risks of stock ownership could lay that risk off onto others for a reasonable fee . 
As an economist , I find this state of affairs frustrating . 
We know , or at least we ought to know , how to build political institutions that accept the mission of macroeconomic stabilization , and how to build financial institutions to mobilize risk-bearing capacity and spread risk . 
Yet , to a remarkable degree , we have failed to do so .
