The World Cup and African Women 
NAIROBI - When I was born , 25 years ago , it would have been rare - even taboo - to find African women discussing soccer . 
But that is what my girlfriends and I now do . 
I grew up in Kenya , where my compatriots follow the English Premier League zealously , perhaps because of our colonial connection to England . 
Kenyans are so passionate about the Premier League that last year an Arsenal fan , Suleiman Omondi , hanged himself after his team lost to Manchester United . 
This year , another Arsenal fan in the coastal town of Lamu stabbed a Manchester United fan in the stomach . 
Kenyan women love soccer , too . 
I &apos;m a Chelsea fan , and so are most of my girlfriends . 
We rarely disagree . 
We console each other when Chelsea loses , and worry together when our team plays big clubs , like recently when they played Liverpool , the only major contender that stood between Chelsea and the English title . 
Fortunately , Chelsea won . 
But , as the World Cup moves into its quarter and semi-final matches , my girlfriends have started to argue . 
Although we don &apos;t exchange blows like men , we are just as passionate , especially since the world &apos;s most famous tournament is being played on our continent . 
Sometimes it seems like we spend more time arguing about soccer than we do chatting about men . 
At the tournament &apos;s start , my girlfriends and I could not seem to agree on which team to support . 
Should we pick from Algeria , Cameroon , Cote d &apos;Ivoire , Ghana , Nigeria , and South Africa , the countries representing Africa ? 
We were torn between the natural instinct to root for our brothers and the urge to side with the likes of Argentina , Brazil , Italy , Germany , and others who seemed more likely to win . 
Initially , I supported France , because I like Chelsea &apos;s Nicolas Anelka , though as an African woman I also could not resist the dream of chanting with joy those times when an African team won . 
That we , young African women , are talking more about the sport is a sign of hope for women &apos;s soccer on the continent . 
A senior sports writer with a Kenyan daily paper recently told me that this time women seem to be interested in learning the rules of the game and knowing more about players and their positions . 
They want to enjoy the game , rather than sit in the company of their male relatives , oblivious to what &apos;s happening on the pitch . 
But will the 2010 World Cup bring African women more than just fodder for gossip ? 
Holding the 1994 World Cup in the United States increased soccer &apos;s popularity there and led to the creation of Major League Soccer in 1996 . 
And , in 1999 , the US hosted and won its second women &apos;s World Cup , leading to a women &apos;s soccer revolution in the country . 
The label &quot; soccer mom &quot; has become common in the US , as more women enroll their children in soccer camps . 
Will holding the world &apos;s greatest single sporting event in Africa spark similar interest for the continent &apos;s women ? 
I was encouraged recently to read about Simphiwe Dludlu , a female player who has become one of South Africa &apos;s top sports personalities . 
FIFA has invited her to assist at the official World Cup opening ceremony . 
Dludlu has been playing since the age of 10 , and currently plies her trade at Tuks FC in Pretoria , where she is also studying at university . 
In 2006 Dludlu got her first call to join the Banyana Banyana , as the South African women &apos;s team is called , and has 33 caps . 
Her success clearly shows that African women football players can reach great heights . 
But for most African young women and girls , it &apos;s not that simple . 
Although women &apos;s soccer in Africa is as old as the republics themselves ( the first teams appeared in West Africa in early 1960 ) , soccer on the continent is still a man &apos;s sport . 
Most African wives dread the season . 
They become soccer widows , as their husbands flock to bars . 
Every day at dinner , mothers are left alone to answer when children ask if daddy still lives in the house . 
Even wives of men who watch the game at home have got other issues to deal with . 
For instance , Joyce , my former workmate , has a husband who is a diehard Manchester United fan . 
Every season , he breaks at least one piece of furniture when his team loses . 
Couches are stained with beer , and kicked as he cheers his favorite teams . 
She has changed her furniture at least twice since she got married four years ago . 
Given male dominance in African politics and soccer , any chance to improve the state of the sport that might arise from the 2010 World Cup will most likely benefit men . 
That is because in most African countries , even men &apos;s national teams are struggling . 
Male youth soccer camps and leagues are either nonexistent or mediocre . 
Until brought to a level where they can compete in international tournaments beyond Africa , women &apos;s soccer teams will continue to struggle . 
And , considering the rampant corruption that plagues our continent , it might take a century to see male soccer teams managed and funded sufficiently . 
American women improved their game because soccer moms do not heavily rely on husbands to fund their daughters &quot; training . 
As more African women continue to be educated , I dream of the day when we , too , will be able to decide for ourselves . 
I was , however , encouraged to learn that in South Africa , women of my mother &apos;s generation have been playing in a soccer league for five years . 
After the World Cup , Vakhegula Vakhegula ( The Grannies ) , a team of women between 50 and 84 years old , will travel to the US to play in the Veteran &apos;s Cup . 
Our boys may not win in South Africa , but maybe The Grannies can show how it is done .
