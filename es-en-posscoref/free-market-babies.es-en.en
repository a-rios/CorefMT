Free-Market Babies ? 
LONDON - Does India need a new independence struggle ? 
The fight this time would not be against British colonialism , but rather against the United Kingdom &apos;s approach to regulating reproductive medicine . 
At a time when India is considering a sort of matchmaking service for Western couples seeking to hire Indian surrogate mothers , the UK government has announced the abolition of two leading medical regulatory agencies . 
Meanwhile , as these countries move farther down the road to free markets in reproductive medicine , France is debating all of its bioethics laws - and continuing to stand up for a different model , focused on social justice and protection of vulnerable women . 
There is an alternative simply to letting the market decide , the French Assembly insists . 
At some point , many countries are likely to find themselves embroiled in similar debates and controversies over reproductive rights and obligations . 
So it is necessary to clarify what is at stake in how we regulate - or de-regulate - in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , egg sales , and surrogacy . 
It may come as a surprise to American observers , in particular , that the UK approach could be considered &quot; free market . &quot; 
After all , the UK forbids outright payment for eggs , whereas in the United States , a highly differentiated market has grown up around &quot; consumer demand . &quot; 
And the UK has a national regulatory agency for IVF , whereas the US has a patchwork of state regulations ( or a lack thereof ) . 
But the UK &apos;s Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) might not be around for much longer . 
Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government announced last July that it intended to abolish the HFEA by 2014 , along with the Human Tissue Authority , which deals with non-reproductive tissues . 
Already , the HFEA appears to be attempting to preempt the government by softening its regulatory touch . 
Last month , the HFEA finished a consultation on increasing the level of &quot; expenses &quot; payable for eggs used in IVF . 
European law forbids outright payment for eggs , but the Authority suggests that increasing &quot; expenses &quot; considerably would not constitute an impermissible inducement . 
The HFEA is merely &quot; removing disincentives , &quot; not &quot; creating incentives . &quot; 
You could be forgiven for missing the difference . 
Proponents of the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Regulation Bill 2010 , now before the Indian Parliament , employ a similar rhetorical twist . 
They say that the bill actually protects surrogate mothers - for example , by limiting the number of pregnancies they can undergo . 
But the law would make surrogacy contracts legally binding , requiring the mother to give up the baby even if she changes her mind . 
Opponents say that the agencies making the arrangements will be the biggest winners - that the huge profits they reap will dwarf the fees paid by foreign couples to the women bearing their children . 
As N.B. Sarojini and Aastha Sharma wrote in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics , &quot; The Bill actively promotes medical tourism in India for reproductive purposes . &quot; 
France , like most European countries , has a problem with reproductive tourism : a yearly shortage of about 700 egg donors sends some couples over the Pyrenees to Spain , where private IVF clinics pay providers more in &quot; expenses &quot; than the UK allows . 
Even so , the draft bill continues to prohibit payment for eggs . 
And it &apos;s not just France &apos;s official ethics committee that takes an anti-commodification stance . 
The French have recently conducted a series of two-day meetings in several provincial cities . 
In Rennes , the panel debating reproductive medical issues supported the policy of not paying for eggs or sperm - not even by the back door of increasing the level of &quot; expenses . &quot; 
While the HFEA document calls for ethical concerns to be &quot; balanced &quot; against increasing egg supply , French Assembly members insist that law , morality , and progress are compatible . 
They reject the view that ethics is optional , even though some influential professors , like Ren√© Frydman , who helped to create the first French IVF baby , have warned that France will fall behind in the science race unless it abandons its principles . 
The upper house , the Senate , was much more minded to listen to that view , so the outcome is still uncertain . 
France is not a Shangri-La , isolated from global markets or the pressures of international research . 
In the words of Emmanuel Hirsch , professor of medical ethics at the University of Paris-XI , &quot; How long can our bioethical standards continue to resist the rise of other logics - particularly financial ones ? &quot; 
To be sure , French regulation can be heavy-handed - for example , IVF is restricted to heterosexual couples who are married or in long-term relationships . 
The official rationale was that eggs and sperm are not commodities , but gifts from a fertile couple to an infertile one . 
That is also one reason why the French restricted egg donation to women who had already had at least one baby ( though this is being changed ) . 
But the limitation to heterosexual couples was rightly condemned as homophobic by the French public in the consultations . 
So the draft bill has been amended to allow lesbian women to receive donated eggs . 
( Gay men will still be barred , because they would require a surrogate , and surrogacy remains prohibited . ) 
That sort of responsiveness to popular sentiment in the legislative process gives the lie to the canard that French regulation is inflexible and hopelessly bureaucratic . 
In fact , the free-market &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; attitude sounds like nothing so much as the old prejudices about the French that have been around since the novelist Thackeray told English readers : &quot; The Frenchman has after his soup a dish of vegetables , where you have one of meat . 
You are a different and superior animal - a French-beating animal . &quot; 
Of course , we now know that a diet of bully beef is likely to result in hardening of the arteries , whereas the vegetable-centered Mediterranean diet is much better for human health . 
Enough said ?
