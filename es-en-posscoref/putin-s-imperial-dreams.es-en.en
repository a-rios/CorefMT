Putin &apos;s Imperial Dreams 
To divide a people in order to conquer them is an immoral strategy that has endured throughout recorded history . 
From Alexander the Great to Stalin the Cruel , variants of that strategy have been used to keep nations in thrall to the will of an emperor . 
We are now seeing this strategy at work again as President Vladimir Putin stealthily seeks to restore Kremlin supremacy over the lands treated as &quot; lost &quot; when the USSR imploded in 1991 . 
In so overplaying his hand in Ukraine &apos;s recent election , however , Putin clearly revealed to the world his neo-imperialist designs . 
In the wake of the euphoric mass protests in Kyiv , Russia &apos;s president has since said that he can work with whatever government Ukraine &apos;s people choose . 
These are mere words , for in mind and action Putin does not want anyone to rule Ukraine that he has not put in place . 
No price is too high to achieve that end , so traditional threats about dividing Ukraine have been used . 
I speak as someone who has been on the receiving end of Russian imperialist designs . 
When Lithuania and then the other Baltic States - Estonia and Latvia - which were occupied by Stalin early in WWII , seized their opportunity for freedom in 1990-91 , the Kremlin did not sit on its hands . 
It knew that the rest of Russia &apos;s colonies - the so-called &quot; Soviet republics &quot; - would want to follow the ungrateful Baltic countries into freedom . 
Although Russia &apos;s rulers were by then communists in name only , they didn &apos;t hesitate to reach for the old Leninist recipes . 
They began to foster and incite splits and confrontations . 
They stoked supposed resentments among different national or ethnic communities based on Lenin &apos;s idea that even small groups of villages could demand territorial autonomy . 
Note the word &quot; territory . &quot; 
The demands were never about normal cultural autonomy as a means of continued identity and supposed self-protection . 
Only territorial autonomy , it seems , would do . 
This way , minorities become easily manipulated majorities . 
Divide enough , stoke enough resentment , and a nation becomes nothing more than a ruined society within a national territory . 
Arm some of these manufactured minority structures so that they can demand autonomy at the barrel of a gun , and you get the kind of chaos the Kremlin can use to reassert its control . 
Fortunately , Lithuanians - as well as Estonians and Latvians - understood this game . 
It failed also in Crimea when Russia sought to deploy its old strategy of divide and rule there in 1991 . 
But these defeats did not inspire the Kremlin to abandon the basic strategy . 
On the contrary , Russia &apos;s imperial ambitions persisted , and persistence has paid off . 
Around the Black Sea , Russia has called into being a series of artificial statelets . 
Georgia and Moldova have both been partitioned through the creation of criminal mini-states nurtured by the Kremlin and which remain under its military umbrella . 
Indeed , in the very week that Putin was meddling in Ukraine &apos;s presidential election , he was threatening to blockade one of those statelets , Georgia &apos;s Abkhazia region , after it had the temerity to vote for a president the Kremlin did not like . 
Moldova has been particularly helpless in the face of the Kremlin &apos;s imperial designs . 
A huge Russian garrison remains deployed in Transdneister , where it rules in collaboration with local gangs . 
Proximity to this lawless territory has helped make Moldova the poorest land in Europe . 
To the east , Armenia and Azerbaijan were pushed into such bloody confrontation at the Kremlin &apos;s instigation that the only way for them to end their ethnic wars was to call in the Russians - as in Transdneister - for a kind of &quot; Pax Ruthena . &quot; 
Now Ukraine &apos;s people may face a similar test after supporters of Viktor Yanukovych threatened to seek autonomy should the rightful winner of the country &apos;s presidential vote , Viktor Yushchenko , actually become president . 
Who can doubt that the hand of Russia is behind this ? 
Would Moscow &apos;s mayor Yuri Luzkhov , a loyal creature of Putin , have dared to attend the rally where autonomy was demanded without the sanction of the Kremlin &apos;s elected monarch ? 
Indeed , Putin openly claims this part of Ukraine as a Russian &quot; internal matter . &quot; 
It is to be hoped that Ukraine &apos;s Russian-speaking citizens , having witnessed the economic despair - and sometimes the bloodshed - caused by the Kremlin &apos;s manufactured pro-autonomy movements , will realize that they are being turned into Putin &apos;s pawns . 
The test for Viktor Yushchenko and his Orange revolutionaries , as it was for Lithuania &apos;s democrats in 1990-91 , is to show that democracy does not mean that the majority suppresses any minority . 
Lithuania passed that test ; 
I am confident that Viktor Yushchenko and his team will do so as well . 
But Europe and the world are also being tested . 
Russia is passing from being the Russian Federation of Boris Yeltsin to a unitary authoritarian regime under Vladimir Putin and his former KGB colleagues . 
Europe , America , and the wider world must see Putin &apos;s so-called &quot; managed democracy &quot; in its true light , and must stand united against his neo-imperialist dreams . 
The first step is to make Russia honor its binding commitment to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , as well as to the Council of Europe , to remove its troops from Moldova and Georgia . 
Any plans to &quot; defend &quot; Yanukovych and the eastern part of Ukraine by military force must be confronted .
