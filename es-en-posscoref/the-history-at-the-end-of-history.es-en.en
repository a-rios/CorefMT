The History at the End of History 
Fifteen years ago in my book The End of History and the Last Man I argued that , if a society wanted to be modern , there was no alternative to a market economy and a democratic political system . 
Not everyone wanted to be modern , of course , and not everyone could put in place the institutions and policies necessary to make democracy and capitalism work , but no alternative system would yield better results . 
While the &quot; End of History &quot; thus was essentially an argument about modernization , some people have linked my thesis about the end of history to the foreign policy of President George W. Bush and American strategic hegemony . 
But anyone who thinks that my ideas constitute the intellectual foundation for the Bush administration &apos;s policies has not been paying attention to what I have been saying since 1992 about democracy and development . 
President Bush initially justified intervention in Iraq on the grounds of Saddam &apos;s programs to develop weapons of mass destruction , the regime &apos;s alleged links to al-Qaida , as well as Iraq &apos;s violation of human rights and lack of democracy . 
As the first two justifications crumbled in the wake of the 2003 invasion , the administration increasingly emphasized the importance of democracy , both in Iraq and in the broader Middle East , as a rationale for what it was doing . 
Bush argued that the desire for freedom and democracy were universal and not culture-bound , and that America would be dedicated to the support of democratic movements &quot; with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world . &quot; 
Supporters of the war saw their views confirmed in the ink-stained fingers of Iraqi voters who queued up to vote in the various elections held between January and December 2005 , in the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon , and in the Afghan presidential and parliamentary elections . 
Inspiring and hopeful as these events were , the road to liberal democracy in the Middle East is likely to be extremely disappointing in the near to medium term , and the Bush administration &apos;s efforts to build a regional policy around it are heading toward abject failure . 
To be sure , the desire to live in a modern society and to be free of tyranny is universal , or nearly so . 
This is demonstrated by the efforts of millions of people each year to move from the developing to the developed world , where they hope to find the political stability , job opportunities , health care , and education that they lack at home . 
But this is different from saying that there is a universal desire to live in a liberal society - that is , a political order characterized by a sphere of individual rights and the rule of law . 
The desire to live in a liberal democracy is , indeed , something acquired over time , often as a byproduct of successful modernization . 
Moreover , the desire to live in a modern liberal democracy does not translate necessarily into an ability to actually do so . 
The Bush administration seems to have assumed in its approach to post-Saddam Iraq that both democracy and a market economy were default conditions to which societies would revert once oppressive tyranny was removed , rather than a series of complex , interdependent institutions that had to be painstakingly built over time . 
Long before you have a liberal democracy , you have to have a functioning state ( something that never disappeared in Germany or Japan after they were defeated in World War II ) . 
This is something that cannot be taken for granted in countries like Iraq . 
The End of History was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization . 
Following Alexandre Koj√®ve , the Russian-French philosopher who inspired my original argument , I believe that the European Union more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States . 
The EU &apos;s attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational rule of law is much more in line with a &quot; post-historical &quot; world than the Americans &quot; continuing belief in God , national sovereignty , and their military . 
Finally , I never linked the global emergence of democracy to American agency , and particularly not to the exercise of American military power . 
Democratic transitions need to be driven by societies that want democracy , and since the latter requires institutions , it is usually a fairly long and drawn out process . 
Outside powers like the US can often help in this process by the example they set as politically and economically successful societies . 
They can also provide funding , advice , technical assistance , and yes , occasionally military force to help the process along . 
But coercive regime change was never the key to democratic transition .
