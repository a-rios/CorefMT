Beware of FDI Protectionism 
NEW YORK - During their most recent meetings , the G-8 took a strong stance against protectionist measures in the area of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , echoing calls for a moratorium in such measures issued earlier by the G-20 . 
Both were right to do so . 
According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , only 6 % of all the changes in national FDI regulations around the world between 1992-2002 were in the direction of making the investment climate less welcoming . 
That figure doubled to 12 % of all regulatory changes in 2003-2004 , and almost doubled again , to 21 % of all FDI regulatory changes , in 2005-2007 . 
In Latin America , for example , some 60 % of all FDI regulatory changes in 2007 were unfavorable to foreign investors . 
Overall , countries that had implemented at least one regulatory change that made the investment framework less welcoming in 2006-2007 accounted for some 40 % of world FDI inflows during that period - an impressive figure that demonstrates that something very dubious is afoot . 
And these data refer to formal changes in laws and regulations ; no data are available on the extent to which unchanged laws and regulations are implemented in a more restrictive manner , increasing informal barriers to the entry and operations of foreign firms . 
Of course , not every measure that makes the climate less welcoming for foreign direct investors is protectionist . 
Basically , there are two situations that should qualify . 
In the case of inward FDI , protectionism involves new official measures that are used to prevent or discourage investors from coming to or staying in a host country . 
For outward FDI , protectionism involves measures that require domestic companies to repatriate assets or operations to the home country , or that discourage certain types of new investments abroad . 
But the definition of FDI protectionism can become more complicated , because measures taken in the interest of legitimate public policy objectives - for example , protecting national security or increasing FDI &apos;s contribution to the host economy - are not necessarily instances of it , even if they make the foreign-investment climate less hospitable . 
Nevertheless , even with this caveat , there has been a rise of FDI protectionism that predates the current financial crisis and recession . 
This suggests that a reevaluation of the costs and benefits of FDI was already underway , led , interestingly enough , by developed countries , which in the past had championed liberalization of entry and operational conditions for foreign investors and their protection under international law . 
For some countries , like the United States , this reevaluation is grounded in national security concerns ( largely undefined ) that arose in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
But there also seems to be a bit of a reaction against the &quot; new kids on the block , &quot; namely multinational enterprises from emerging markets , especially when these are state-owned and seek to enter the US market through mergers and acquisitions . 
Hence the strengthening of the active screening mechanism of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US . 
In the case of some other developed countries ( for example , Canada , France , Germany ) , national security concerns extend to economic considerations and the protection of &quot; national champions . &quot; 
In these countries , too , screening mechanisms have been strengthened , and China and Russia , as well as some other emerging markets , are following suit . 
In some of these cases , legitimate public-policy objectives may well be involved . 
But the boundary line between such objectives and protectionism can be a very fine one . 
The financial crisis and recession may dampen the rise of FDI protectionism , as countries seek capital to shore up local firms and increase investment to help them promote economic recovery . 
But the global downturn may also accentuate protectionism , especially if nationalistic impulses gain the upper hand , perhaps stimulated by fire-sales of domestic assets ( as we saw during the Asian financial crisis ) . 
The bottom line is that the investment climate for foreign direct investors is becoming less welcoming . 
While this is certainly not the dominant approach toward FDI , we need to be vigilant that it does not become so . 
What would be helpful in this respect is an objective FDI Protectionism Observatory that monitors FDI protectionist measures and names and shames countries that adopt them .
