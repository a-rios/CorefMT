Changing China &apos;s Growth Path 
MILAN - China is poised to begin its transition from middle-income to developed-country status . 
Relatively few economies ( five to be precise , all in Asia : Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , and Singapore ) successfully managed this transition while sustaining high growth rates . 
No country of China &apos;s size and diversity has ever done so . 
China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan , adopted last month , provides the road map it will follow . 
Yet it is not really a plan ; rather , it is a coherent interconnected set of policy priorities to support the economy &apos;s structural evolution - and thus to maintain rapid growth - over the period of the plan and beyond . 
So a great deal is at stake , both internally and externally . 
Growth in the world &apos;s emerging economies now depends on China , the main export partner for a growing list of major economies including Japan , South Korea , India , and Brazil . 
There are at least five important interconnected transitions embedded in China &apos;s new Five-Year Plan : 
Â· Changing the economy &apos;s growth model or supply side structure , as labor costs rise , global market shares become large enough to limit expansion , and advanced countries &quot; growth momentum slows for an unknown period of time ; 
The challenge for China is implementation , which means reform and systemic change . 
International experience suggests that the balance between planning and markets shifts toward markets as countries becomes richer . 
The structural evolution that underpins growth will increasingly be driven by market opportunities and entrepreneurial initiative . 
A huge number of new businesses need to be created . 
To support this shift , much is required . 
Labor-intensive industries in the tradable sector must be allowed to decline . 
Many companies may survive , but only by moving to different parts of the global economy or up the value-added chain domestically : up or out . 
A rising nominal and real exchange rate can propel structural change ; a weak-currency policy is a trap . 
The financial sector must be developed in order to create more savings options and supply credit and equity capital efficiently to new and growing businesses , which China needs in order to attract the rural population to cities ( even as export sectors move up the skill and value-added hierarchy ) . 
Many of these jobs will be in the domestic , urban , non-tradable service sector . 
But urbanization faces another obstacle : the hukou system of residency permits , which restricts mobility and bars migrants ( an estimated 200 million people ) from becoming full-status urban citizens . 
Chinese officials &quot; reluctance to eliminate hukou quickly reflects their observation of the social consequences of rapid or unbalanced urbanization elsewhere , though problems caused by internal migration in other countries typically reflect the absence of opportunity in rural areas , not the attraction of opportunities in urban areas . 
As the scope of the private sector expands , legal structures and policies that support competition , entry and exit , market openness , intellectual property , and social safety nets will also be needed . 
The move to higher-value-added links of domestic and global supply chains will require more effective education and expanded investment in the economy &apos;s intellectual and technological underpinnings . 
The balance between technology imports and domestic innovation will continue to shift steadily toward the latter . 
The Chinese public sector has a huge balance sheet , including land , a vast array of infrastructure , massive foreign-exchange reserves , and major equity positions in state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , which account for more than one-half of net fixed assets and one-third of profits in the corporate sector . 
In all countries , these assets should be held in trust for citizens and deployed in pursuit of economic and social development . 
China has an exemplary record in this area . 
Unlike most countries , China has not struggled to get public-sector investment up to levels that support sustained high growth . 
But there are now issues . 
Investments are justified and support economic and social development when they have high private and social returns . 
Elements of the investment portfolio in the public sector and the SOEs are beginning to fail this test . 
To be fair , given the SOEs &quot; legacy costs ( stemming from their responsibilities for social services and insurance ) , together with their financial distress in the 1990 &quot; s , it made sense for a while to let them keep their retained earnings and not place additional claims on them through the government budget . 
No longer . 
If SOEs &quot; reinvested income is not subject to a high return criterion , growth will eventually slow . 
The portion that falls short needs to be redirected to higher-return investments in either the public or private sector , to household income , or to essential public services and social insurance . 
The SOEs compete in product and labor markets with the private sector , but less so in capital markets . 
While wages and incomes are rising now and appear to have broken the iron grip of the surplus labor pool , the growth pattern requires this structural demand-side shift toward more disposable income , greater government consumption , and high-return investment . 
We suspect but do not know that consumption will increase . 
Properly recycled savings , including corporate profits , could go back mainly into high-return public- or private-sector investments . 
Both contribute to aggregate domestic demand , and the structural shifts on the supply side will be driven by the &quot; right &quot; mix of aggregate demand , with the low-return component on the investment side removed . 
Thus , the Five-Year Plan &apos;s goal is to recompose ( not expand ) aggregate demand in order to sustain growth and avoid the diminishing-returns trap that is the principal risk of China &apos;s current investment pattern . 
Changing that pattern will require a restructured financial system that allocates savings efficiently , based on fiscal and capital-market discipline and corporate-governance reform . 
Designing that system will be an important part of achieving the high-return investment and expanded consumption that Chinese leaders want - and that China &apos;s economy needs .
