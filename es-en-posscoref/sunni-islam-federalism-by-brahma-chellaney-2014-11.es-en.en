The Sunni Arc of Instability 
ABU DHABI - While international observers fixate on the Sunni-Shia rivalry &apos;s role in shaping geopolitics in the Islamic world , deep fissures within the Sunni arc that stretches from the Maghreb-Sahel region of North Africa to the Afghanistan-Pakistan belt are increasingly apparent . 
Moreover , it is Sunni communities that produce the transnational jihadists who have become a potent threat to secular , democratic states near and far . 
What is driving this fragmentation and radicalization within the ranks of Sunni Islam , and how can it be managed ? 
The importance of addressing that question cannot be overstated . 
The largest acts of international terror , including the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington , DC , and the 2008 Mumbai attack , were carried out by brutal transnational Sunni organizations ( Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba , respectively ) . 
The Sunni militant group Boko Haram , known internationally for abducting 276 schoolgirls in April and forcing them to marry its members , has been wreaking havoc in Nigeria for years . 
And the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State , whose dramatic rise has entailed untold horrors to Iraq and Syria , are seeking to establish a caliphate , by whatever means necessary . 
The influence of these organizations is far-reaching . 
Just last month , individuals inspired by these groups &quot; activities carried out two separate attacks , one in the Canadian parliament and another on police officers in New York . 
Political and tribal sectarianism in the Sunni Middle East and North Africa is both a reflection and a driver of the region &apos;s weakening political institutions , with a series of failed or failing states becoming hubs of transnational terrorism . 
A lawless Libya , for example , is now exporting jihad and guns across the Sahel and undermining the security of fellow Maghreb countries and Egypt . 
Several largely Sunni countries - including Syria , Iraq , Yemen , Libya , Somalia , and Afghanistan - have become de facto partitioned , with little prospect of reunification in the near future . 
Jordan and Lebanon could be the next states to succumb to Sunni extremist violence . 
The Sunni tumult has underscored the fragility of almost all Arab countries , while diluting the centrality of the Israel-Palestine conflict . 
The post-Ottoman order - created by the British , with some help from the French , after World War I - is disintegrating , with no viable alternative in sight . 
The sectarianism plaguing the Sunni belt is affecting even the relatively stable oil sheikdoms of the Gulf , where a schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council is spurring new tensions and proxy competition among its members . 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates view Qatar &apos;s efforts to aid Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat , even as their own wealth has fueled the spread of Salafi jihadism and Al Qaeda ideology . 
Both countries , along with Bahrain , have recalled their ambassadors from Qatar . 
This rupture is compounded by a rift between the Middle East &apos;s two main Sunni powers , Egypt and Turkey , whose relationship soured last year , after the Egyptian military ousted the Muslim Brotherhood government , backed by pro-Islamist Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan . 
Egypt recalled its ambassador from Ankara and expelled the Turkish ambassador from Cairo . 
In September , the Egyptian foreign ministry accused Erdoğan of seeking to &quot; provoke chaos &quot; and &quot; incite divisions in the Middle East region through his support for groups and terrorist organizations . &quot; 
A similar divide exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the latter &apos;s provision of aid and sanctuary to Afghan militants - a divide that will only deepen when the United States-led NATO coalition ends its combat operations in Afghanistan this year . 
Pakistan &apos;s support has spawned two incarnations of the Taliban : the Afghan Taliban , sponsored by the Pakistani military , and the Pakistani Taliban , the Pakistani military &apos;s nemesis . 
Successive Afghan governments have refused to recognize the frontier with Pakistan known as the Durand line , a British-colonial invention that split the large ethnic Pashtun population . 
Such conflicts are spurring the militarization of Sunni states . 
The UAE and Qatar have already instituted compulsory military service for adult males . 
And Kuwait is considering following in Jordan &apos;s footsteps by reintroducing conscription , which is already in place in most Sunni states ( and Iran ) . 
Against this background , efforts to tame the deep-seated Sunni-Shia rivalry ( by , for example , improving relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran ) , though undoubtedly important , should not take priority over a strategy to address the sectarianism plaguing the Sunni belt . 
That strategy must center on federalism . 
Had federalism been introduced in Somalia , for example , when the north-south rift emerged , it probably would not have ended up as a failed state . 
Today , federalism can allow for the orderly management of key Sunni countries , where a unitary state simply is not practical . 
The problem is that federalism has become a dirty word in most Sunni countries . 
And the emergence of new threats has made some governments , most notably Saudi Arabia &apos;s , staunchly opposed to change . 
What these countries do not seem to recognize is that it is the petrodollar-funded export of Wahhabism - the source of modern Sunni jihad - that has gradually extinguished more liberal Islamic traditions elsewhere and fueled the international terrorism that now threatens to devour its sponsors . 
Stagnation is not stability . 
On the contrary , in the Sunni arc today , it means a vicious cycle of expanding extremism , rapid population growth , rising unemployment , worsening water shortages , and popular discontent . 
Political fissures and tribal and ethnic sectarianism add fuel to this lethal mix of volatility and violence . 
It is time for the Sunni world to recognize the need for a federalist approach to manage the instability and conflict that plagues it . 
Even the US must reconsider its regional policy , which has long depended on alliances with despotic Sunni rulers . 
In a region ravaged by conflict , business as usual is no longer an option .
