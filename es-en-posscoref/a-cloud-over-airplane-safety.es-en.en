A Cloud over Airplane Safety 
PRINCETON - When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland &apos;s Eyjafjallajökull volcano , it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped , but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed . 
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban , or was it a reflection of the hardship , both personal and economic , that the ban was causing ? 
Over six days , about 95,000 flights were canceled , at a cost to airlines of more than $ 1 billion . 
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed . 
The British economy lost £ 1.5 billion , and others were similarly affected . 
Flower growers in Kenya , who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe , suddenly had no income . 
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada . 
In the past , jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power , and in one case , dropped thousands of feet , although all managed to land safely . 
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems . 
The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft , and that no matter how slight that risk might be , the government &apos;s job was , as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it , &quot; to make sure that safety was paramount . &quot; 
Indeed , in closing their skies , European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else . 
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas . 
Some 3,000 people die on the world &apos;s roads every day . 
Cutting speed limits to , say , 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives . 
We don &apos;t do it , because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving . 
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite . 
It is distasteful to put a price on human life , but the more we spend on safety , the less we will have for our other goals . 
The British government uses a figure of a little more than £ 1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life - for example , by improving road safety . 
In the US , the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $ 5.8 million - nearly four times as much , at current exchange rates - for the same purpose . 
Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US , but not in Britain ? 
Giovanni Bisignani , the head of the International Air Transport Association , an industry group , criticized the shutdown , saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken . 
On the whole , though , the public seemed to support the decision . 
Stranded travelers , interviewed at airports , typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky . 
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk , or just a more urgent need to travel , than others ? 
John Stuart Mill , in his classic book On Liberty , considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe . 
In Mill &apos;s view , we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger . 
Once he knows of it , the decision is his to make , because only he can judge the importance of his journey , and balance that against the risk he is running . 
Air safety is slightly different , because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground , but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew . 
If they are fully informed of the risks , and are still willing to fly - perhaps the crew has been offered more money , as workers in dangerous occupations often are - should we prevent them from making the decision to fly ? 
In the end , after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage , and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere , Europe &apos;s skies were reopened . 
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly . 
Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety , we know that this is not only a technical question . 
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question : how safe should we aim to be ?
