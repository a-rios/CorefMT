Will Human Rights Survive Africa &apos;s Latest Oil Boom ? 
Who says that Francophone Africa can &apos;t thrive ? 
The Central African Economic and Monetary Union ( CEMAC ) , with six countries and an estimated 30 million people , is taking off . 
Equatorial Guinea and Chad , now the CEMAC &apos;s leading lights , have risen out of oblivion into the top ranks of oil exporters . 
Add to them the two old regulars , Congo and Cameroon , and the CEMAC zone shapes up as an increasingly attractive market for foreign investors and local businesses alike . 
But will rapid development exact an excessively high toll on human rights ? 
The region &apos;s economic stature was bolstered in 2003 with the advent of the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline , a $ 4.2 billion project brokered by the World Bank that is expected to boost exploration and output in Chad and at offshore sites in Equatorial Guinea , while spreading the benefits more widely . 
For example , with the pipeline crossing 890 kilometers of its territory , Cameroon will net $ 540 million annually in fees and royalties for the next 25 to 30 years . 
All of this was made possible by what has been , by historical standards , an exceptional period of political stability . 
Oil was discovered in Chad &apos;s southern Doba region in 1975 , with 300 wells drilled so far . 
But none of the reserves could be exploited until 1988 , when Chad &apos;s protracted civil war finally ended . 
With the subsequent oil boom , one would have expected the fortunes of Chadians and Cameroonians to improve at the individual , local , and national levels . 
But instead we see a landscape of widespread poverty set against a backdrop of endemic corruption and official mismanagement . 
So far , the governments in neither Chad nor Cameroon have been willing to publish any earnings records concerning the pipeline project . 
This lack of transparency is not surprising . 
Indeed , the Chad-Cameroon pipeline - the biggest such project yet realized in sub-Saharan Africa , covering a 1,070-kilometer trajectory from Doba to Cameroon &apos;s Atlantic port of Kribi - was launched amid considerable controversy regarding its benefits for ordinary citizens . 
For this reason , the World Bank imposed stringent conditions on Chad and Cameroon . 
Both countries were required to deposit 10 % of the expected oil income in a blocked foreign account intended for future generations . 
At least 80 % was to be invested in schools , healthcare , roads , electricity , and provision of potable water , while 5 % would be allocated to the oil-producing areas and to settlements along the pipeline &apos;s route . 
Periodic audits of oil accounts also were to be carried out . 
Moreover , Chad and Cameroon were each to contribute $ 140m to the project , although this sum was paid entirely by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank . 
During its 20-month construction period , the project promised business opportunities for subcontractors , compensation to communities and individuals for properties destroyed , 435 kilometers of road , and more than 7,000 jobs . 
Oil started to flow through the pipeline in July 2003 , 16 months ahead of schedule , with the flow peaking at 225,000 barrels per day by the end of that year . 
Now , 30 months later , interested groups and the larger public are angrily asking about the oil wealth that is yet to touch their lives . 
Much attention is being focused on the terms of the so-called &quot; host government agreements &quot; concluded by the ExxonMobil-led financing consortium and the governments of Chad and Cameroon to govern the construction and operation of the Doba oil fields and the pipeline . 
According to a new report published in September by Amnesty International , Contracting Out of Human Rights : The Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project , the pipeline risks freezing human-rights protection for the multitude of Chadians and Cameroonians who live along its path . 
The report finds that the host government agreements place a price tag on protecting human rights by imposing large financial penalties if the operation of the oil fields or the pipeline is interrupted - even to enforce valid laws . 
This constitutes a powerful disincentive for Chad and Cameroon to act against company malfeasance or to defend individuals adversely affected by the project . 
That conclusion is no mere abstraction . 
The project &apos;s realization has already led to alleged human rights abuses against poor farmers in the region , who claim that they have been denied access to their land . 
Similarly , villages have reportedly been denied access to their sole supply of portable water , while the pipeline has seriously threatened the livelihoods of Kribi &apos;s fishermen . 
The host government agreements open the door for further abuses , without effective redress , throughout the lifetime of the project - up to 70 years . 
Moreover , the agreements lack transparency , as they were considered commercially confidential - and were thus shielded from public scrutiny - until they were passed into law . 
Amnesty International argues that human rights are more likely to be respected when the legal agreements behind major infrastructure projects are known in advance , and it apportions some of the responsibility for the dangers posed in Chad and Cameroon to the World Bank and its private-sector lending arm , the International Finance Corporation . 
The Chad-Cameroon pipeline project is one African project that wasn &apos;t strangled in the cradle , and it cannot be allowed to fail . 
For example , Chad &apos;s yearly oil earnings , at $ 2 billion , now account for 40-50 % of its annual budget , and small-scale business , indirect investments , human-resources development , and other incidental benefits are likely to follow . 
All of this is to be welcomed . 
But ignoring people &apos;s fundamental rights might well lead the region back to a time when none of it was possible .
