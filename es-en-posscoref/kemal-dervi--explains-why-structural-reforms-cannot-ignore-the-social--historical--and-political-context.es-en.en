Revamping Europe &apos;s Tattered Social Contract 
WASHINGTON , DC - For most of the beginning of 2014 , the eurozone seemed to be in a state of recovery - weak and unsteady , but nonetheless real . 
In April , the International Monetary Fund estimated that overall GDP growth would reach 1.2 % this year , with slowly declining unemployment , up from its previous forecast of 1 % growth . 
With the threat of unsustainably high interest rates in the countries of the eurozone periphery having disappeared , the path to moderate recovery was supposedly open , to be followed by some acceleration in growth in 2015 . 
While it is important not to overreact to quarterly figures , recent data , as well as some of the revised data for the first quarter , are deeply disappointing . 
The pessimism of two years ago has returned - with good reason . 
Italy is in an outright recession , and , far from showing hoped-for signs of vitality . 
French growth is close to zero . 
Even Germany &apos;s GDP declined in quarterly terms in the first half of the year . 
Finland , a staunch supporter of firm austerity policies , is in negative territory for the first half of the year . 
Nominal interest rates for periphery countries &quot; sovereign debt have remained extremely low , and , even when taking into account expectations of very low inflation ( or even deflation ) , real interest rates are low . 
The eurozone now is facing not only a financial crisis , but a stagnation crisis . 
Tensions with Russia may make recovery even more difficult , and it is unlikely that the eurozone can attain 1 % growth in 2014 without major policy changes . 
The European Central Bank has announced that it will offer new monetary-policy support and has decided to use all instruments short of direct quantitative easing ( it is still not buying sovereign bonds ) . 
But it is far from clear whether the proverbial horse led to water will actually drink . 
If growth and employment expectations remain dismal , it will be difficult to rekindle demand , particularly private business investment , no matter how low interest rates are , or how many resources banks have for potential lending . 
ECB President Mario Draghi &apos;s message in his speech last month in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , as well as at his September press conference was a clear call for more fiscal support to boost effective demand . 
The essential economic problem is clear : there is an almost desperate need for more fiscal space in the eurozone to boost aggregate demand , including more investment in Germany . 
But there is also a persistent need for deep structural reforms on the supply side , so that fiscal stimulus translates into sustainable long-term growth , not just temporary spurts and further increases in countries &quot; debt ratios . 
What the &quot; best &quot; structural reforms actually are remains a matter for debate . 
But in most countries , they include some combination of tax , labor-market , service-sector , and education reforms , as well as reforms in territorial administration , particularly in France . 
These reforms should seek to achieve a thoroughly revamped social contract that reflects the realities of twenty-first-century demographics and global markets , but that also remains sensitive to Europeans &quot; commitment to distributive fairness and political equality , and insures citizens against shocks . 
It is easy to call for &quot; reforms &quot; without specifying their content or taking into account the social , historical , and political context . 
At the same time , it will not be possible to design this new social contract country by country . 
Europe has become too interwoven in myriad ways - not just in purely financial and economic terms , but also psychologically . 
It must have come as a surprise to many that it was a German court , not a French one , that banned Uber , the mobile app that is revolutionizing the taxi business . 
If the new social contract cannot be forged Europe-wide , it must at least apply to the eurozone to enable the necessary structural reforms . 
Otherwise , given that the politics and economics of eurozone reform are inseparably linked , fiscal expansion could prove to be as ineffective as efforts by monetary policymakers to foster growth . 
Italy &apos;s finance minister , Pier Carlo Padoan , is rightly pushing for a eurozone &quot; reform scorecard , &quot; which would enable direct comparison among national reforms . 
But , beyond such a scorecard , the will to overcome the stagnation trap must be more than a sum of national wills . 
Germany must be reassured by what is happening in France and Italy ; conversely , Southern Europeans must be able to trust that their efforts will gain additional traction from greater investment throughout the region , particularly in Germany . 
A new social contract will not appear out of thin air . 
Now is the time for the new European Commission to propose - and the new European Council and European Parliament to endorse - a political pact to legitimize and sustain the reforms needed to solve Europe &apos;s economic problems .
