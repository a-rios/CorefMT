The Indians Strike Back 
Long quiescent , Ecuador &apos;s Indians - like native groups in much of Latin America - are finding their political voice and making their presence felt . 
In November , Indians &apos; votes were the key factor behind the election of a populist political outsider , ex-army colonel Lucio Gutierrez , as president of this small Andean nation . 
The victory of Gutierrez , who participated in the failed coup against President Jamil Mahuad in 2000 , is a serious blow to speedy approval of the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA )  - the Bush administration &apos;s effort to create a hemispheric trade bloc rivaling the European Union . 
Ecuador &apos;s election demonstrates the growing strength of Indians and other groups estranged from governments that adhere too closely to policies dictated from Washington . 
Gutierrez is the first president to have the support of Ecuador &apos;s powerful Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador ( CONAIE ) . 
Historically marginalized and impoverished indigenous peoples make up between 25 % and 40 % of Ecuador &apos;s population . 
CONAIE , founded in 1986 , originally focused on cultural rights and land redistribution . 
After winning a bilingual education system in the late 1980 &apos;s and securing land titles for many peasants in 1992 , CONAIE expanded its agenda . 
Today , it is the leading critic of Ecuador &apos;s &quot; neo-liberal &quot; policies related to globalization . 
In the last ten years , CONAIE has spearheaded protests to stop privatization , the extraction of natural resources , and export-oriented agricultural policies . 
After leading massive street protests to unseat the corrupt president , Abdalá Bucarám , in 1997 , indigenous leaders from CONAIE helped to forge a new constitution that guarantees collective rights for indigenous peoples , participatory environmental reviews of resource extraction projects , and fixed increases in budgetary spending on health and education . 
In January of 2000 , following the economic implosion caused by a banking scandal that implicated President Mahuad , and Mahaud &apos;s subsequent replacement of the Sucre with the US dollar as Ecuador &apos;s currency , CONAIE solidified its role at the heart of Ecuadorian politics . 
Tens of thousands of indigenous peoples - who were too repressed only 15 years earlier to participate even minimally in national public life - marched on the capital , Quito , demanding Mahuad &apos;s resignation . 
On the initiative of Lucio Gutierrez , Indians and a contingent of mid-level army officers took control of the presidential palace and announced a short-lived ruling triumvirate that included then CONAIE president Antonio Vargas . 
However , pressure by the US Embassy and the Organization of American States resulted in a change of heart by Ecuador &apos;s military and jail sentences for Gutierrez and Vargas . 
Gutierrez began campaigning for the presidency shortly after his release from prison , but his chances looked slim until CONAIE decided to support his candidacy last summer . 
Indians and campesinos , who get their information from provincial organizations &apos; radio programs , voted overwhelmingly for Gutierrez . 
Gutierrez &apos;s past as a fomenter of coups has linked him in the minds of many to Venezuela &apos;s Hugo Chavez , another former military officer who also authored a failed coup before becoming president . 
But unlike Chavez , who leads one of the world &apos;s top oil producers , the need to stabilize an economy closely monitored by international financial markets forced Gutierrez to abandon campaign promises that helped secure his victory . 
For example , he has backtracked on ending &quot; dollarization &quot; and has stopped opposing America &apos;s military presence at the coastal Manta Air Base , both key CONAIE demands . 
Even so , Guttierrez &apos;s election will have a significant impact on hemispheric geopolitics , particularly on the question of the FTAA . 
CONAIE opposes the FTAA and is advancing a proposal entitled Alternatives for the Americas , which offers a more balanced approach to trade liberalization . 
It would ensure enforceable international human rights , environmental , and labor laws . 
Gutierrez , following CONAIE &apos;s lead , has called the FTAA &quot; suicide &quot; and proposes strengthening ties with the Andean Community and with Brazil and Venezuela , who are also skeptical of the FTAA . 
So far , the Bush administration is playing tough and trying to force South American countries to submit by discussing trade agreements with Chile and Central America . 
Maybe it is time , though , to look at why South America &apos;s peoples are voting for candidates who question free trade and America &apos;s military policy in the region . 
Groups like CONAIE see the FTAA as a project initiated to give US corporations more access to Latin America &apos;s natural resources and cheap labor . 
Even if America were to reverse its current policies and reduce its domestic agricultural subsidies - just one reason that Latin Americans view the FTAA as rank hypocrisy - a focus on export-oriented agriculture in Ecuador tends to favor large landowners over small farmers , shifting income from the poor to the rich . 
The FTAA is far too concerned with protecting corporations to be capable of addressing the issues that most trouble Latin America &apos;s citizens . 
Countries like Ecuador , hobbled by massive external debt , poor infrastructure , a corrupt ruling class , and yawning inequality , need international agreements akin to those of the European Union that help reduce debt burdens , boost technology transfer , and promote social and economic justice . 
Latin America &apos;s native peoples have awakened . 
Policies throughout the continent must and will begin to reflect their desires .
