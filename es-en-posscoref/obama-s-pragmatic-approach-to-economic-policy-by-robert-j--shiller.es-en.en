A Man Without a Plan 
NEW HAVEN - During the United States &quot; recent presidential election campaign , public-opinion polls consistently showed that the economy - and especially unemployment - was voters &quot; number one concern . 
The Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , sought to capitalize on the issue , asserting : &quot; The president &apos;s plans haven &apos;t worked - he doesn &apos;t have a plan to get the economy going . &quot; 
Nonetheless , Barack Obama was reelected . 
The outcome may reflect the economy &apos;s slight improvement at election time ( as happened when Franklin Roosevelt defeated the Republican Alf Landon in 1936 , despite the continuing Great Depression ) . 
But Obama &apos;s victory might also be a testament to most US voters &quot; basic sense of economic reality . 
Economic theory does not provide an unambiguous prescription for policymakers . 
Because controlled experiments to test policy prescriptions are impossible , we will never have a definitive test of macroeconomic measures . 
Romney had no miracle cure , either , but he attempted to tap into voters &quot; wishful-thinking bias , by promising to reduce the size of the government and cut marginal tax rates . 
That would work if it were true that the best way to ensure economic recovery were to leave more money on the table for individuals . 
The idea that Obama lacks a plan is right in a sense : nothing he has proposed has been big enough to boost the US economy &apos;s painfully slow recovery from the 2007-9 recession , nor to insulate it from shocks coming from Europe and from weakening growth in the rest of the world . 
What Obama does have is a history of bringing in capable economic advisers . 
Is there anything more , really , that one can ask of a president ? 
And yet US presidential campaigns generally neglect discussion of advisers or intellectual influences . 
Although a president &apos;s advisers may change , one would think that candidates would acknowledge them , if only to suggest where their own ideas come from ; after all , realistically what they are selling is their ability to judge and manage expertise , not their own ability as economists . 
This time , too , however , there was no mention by name of any deep economic thinker , or of any specific economic model . 
Obama originally had a wonder team of economic advisers , including Lawrence Summers , Christina Romer , Austan Goolsbee , and Cass Sunstein . 
Today , the most powerful economic adviser remaining in the White House is Gene Sperling , head of the National Economic Council ( NEC ) , the agency created by President Bill Clinton in 1993 to serve as his main source of economic policy ( somewhat shunting aside the Council of Economic Advisers ) . 
Because this position does not require Congressional approval , the president may appoint whomever he wants , without having his choice raked over the coals in the US Senate . 
That is why Obama could appoint the highly talented but politically unpopular Summers , the former president of Harvard University . 
Sperling is not nearly so well known as Summers . 
He was the NEC &apos;s deputy director from its beginning in 1993 until 1996 , and its director from 1996 to 2000 . 
Obama reappointed him as head of the NEC in January 2011 . 
His 2005 book The Pro-Growth Progressive contains many ideas about how to make the economy perform better . 
None is grandiose , but together they might help substantially . 
Some of these ideas found their way into the American Jobs Act , which might have had some real impact had Congress passed it in 2011 . 
The AJA embodied some of what Sperling describes in his book : subsidies for hiring , wage insurance , and job training , as well as support for education and early learning . 
Moreover , the AJA would have offered some balanced-budget stimulus - the kind of stimulus that would boost the level of economic activity without increasing the volume of government debt . 
But the public , despite its concern about unemployment , is not very interested in the details of concrete plans to create more jobs . 
Sperling is just not very visible to the public . 
His book was not a best seller : in commercial terms , it might be better described as a dud . 
Sperling is fundamentally different from the typical academic economist , who tends to concentrate on advancing economic theory and statistics . 
He concentrates on legislation - that is , practical things that might be accomplished to lift the economy . 
He listens to academic economists , but is focused differently . 
At one point in his book , Sperling jokes that maybe the US needs a third political party , called the &quot; Humility Party . &quot; 
Its members would admit that there are no miraculous solutions to America &apos;s economic problems , and they would focus on the &quot; practical options &quot; that are actually available to make things a little better . 
In fact , Americans do not need a new political party : with Obama &apos;s reelection , voters have endorsed precisely that credo of pragmatic idealism .
