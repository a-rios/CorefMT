Will NATO &apos;s Prodigal Son Return ? 
PARIS  -  
Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s just completed trip to Washington may be an exception , because the French President may be preparing to bring NATO a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009 : France &apos;s return to NATO &apos;s integrated military structure , from which Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966 . 
In retrospect , de Gaulle &apos;s decision proved to be much more detrimental for France than for the Alliance . 
By withdrawing from NATO &apos;s integrated military command , France excluded itself from political decision-making within the Alliance and thus became the equivalent of the &quot; Harkis &quot; - the local soldiers who served with the French army during the Algerian war : fine soldiers , but with virtually no reward for their service . 
How realistic is the possibility of scenario French return to NATO &apos;s military fold ? 
Historically , aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French / NATO relationship , the latest being Jacques Chirac &apos;s failed attempt to patch up France &apos;s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995 . 
Success is not guaranteed this time , either , but the chances are much higher now , because France , the United States , and the world have changed . 
For starters , the US now has a real friend and ally in the Élysée Palace . 
To speak of Sarkozy as a substitute for Tony Blair in Europe would be premature - and unhelpful , given Blair &apos;s inability to exert significant influence on US policy . 
But Sarkozy is both eager to transform France &apos;s relations with the Alliance and has a strategy to do so . 
Moreover , the French army supports such a move , while only a small segment of the Foreign Ministry is opposed . 
Sarkozy &apos;s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO . 
More Europe in security terms means more Alliance . 
So , because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced European , he must normalize France &apos;s relations with a new Alliance based on two pillars - European and American . 
Moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated , while France and Britain want to restart the Saint-Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago . 
As a result , for the sake of Europe , France must move closer to the Alliance . 
Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France &apos;s approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states . 
Unlike Chirac , he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like Bulgaria or Romania to choose between their European or Atlantic loyalties . 
Here , again , strengthening Europe requires strengthening the Alliance . 
Sarkozy &apos;s approach may work , because America , too , has changed . 
In American eyes , the Kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated NATO &apos;s glaring and myriad shortcomings , while the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , moved America still further away from the Alliance , particularly after President George W. Bush disparagingly rejected NATO &apos;s offer of help . 
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide-and-rule tactics by pitting &quot; New &quot; Europe against the &quot; Old &quot; Europe led by France and Germany , which opposed the Iraq war . 
Those divisions are now history , and American reservations about a European security pillar cannot trump America &apos;s pressing needs for allied support . 
Confronted with disaster in Iraq , the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into chaos , and the escalating crisis with Iran , the US can no longer treat the NATO allies with disdain . 
Although Europe remains militarily weak , America &apos;s power is now in doubt . 
If a European pillar within NATO is needed to strengthen the Alliance , why not accept it ? 
Beyond the changes in France and the US , the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of NATO is the transformation of the international system itself . 
Aside from the explosive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terrorism , the West is now confronted with the rise of Asia , the return of a more assertive Russia , and new energy and environmental challenges . 
Both France and America have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively . 
Sarkozy &apos;s trip to Washington , and his address to a receptive US Congress , was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together .
