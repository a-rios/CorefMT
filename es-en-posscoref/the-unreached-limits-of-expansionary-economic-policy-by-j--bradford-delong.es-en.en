Grand Mal Economics 
BERKELEY - Across the North Atlantic region , central bankers and governments seem , for the most part , helpless in restoring full employment to their economies . 
Europe has slipped back into recession without ever really recovering from the financial / sovereign-debt crisis that began in 2008 . 
The United States &quot; economy is currently growing at 1.5 % per year ( about a full percentage point less than potential ) , and growth may slow , owing to a small fiscal contraction this year . 
Industrial market economies have been suffering from periodic financial crises , followed by high unemployment , at least since the Panic of 1825 nearly caused the Bank of England to collapse . 
Such episodes are bad for everybody - workers who lose their jobs , entrepreneurs and equity holders who lose their profits , governments that lose their tax revenue , and bondholders who suffer the consequences of bankruptcy - and we have had nearly two centuries to figure out how to deal with them . 
So why have governments and central banks failed ? 
There are three reasons why the authorities might fail to restore full employment rapidly after a downturn . 
For starters , unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment . 
That was the problem in the 1970 &quot; s , but it is not the problem now . 
The second reason might be that even with anchored inflation expectations ( and thus price stability ) , policymakers do not know how to keep them anchored while boosting the flow of spending in the economy . 
And here I stop , flummoxed . 
At least as I read the history , by 1829 , Western Europe &apos;s technocratic economists had figured out why these periodic grand mal economic seizures occurred . 
That year , Jean-Baptiste Say published his Cours Complet d &apos;Economie Politique Pratique , admitting that Thomas Malthus had been at least half right in arguing that an economy could suffer for years from a &quot; general glut &quot; of commodities , with nearly everybody trying to reduce spending below income - in today &apos;s jargon , to deleverage . 
And , because one person &apos;s spending is another &apos;s income , universal deleveraging produces only depression and high unemployment . 
Over the following century , economists like John Stuart Mill , Walter Bagehot , Irving Fisher , Knut Wicksell , and John Maynard Keynes devised a list of steps to take in order to avoid or cure a depression . 
1 . 
Don &apos;t go there in the first place : avoid whatever it is - whether external pressure under the gold standard , asset-price bubbles , or leverage-and-panic cycles such as that of 2003-2009 - that creates the desire to deleverage . 
2 . 
3 . 
If you still find yourself there , stop the desire to deleverage by having the Treasury guarantee risky assets , or issue safe ones , in order to raise the quality of debt in the market ; this , too , will make holding debt more attractive . 
4 . 
If that fails , stop the desire to deleverage by promising to print more money in the future , which would raise the rate of inflation and make holding cash less attractive than spending it . 
5 . 
In the worst case , have the government step in , borrow money , and buy stuff , thereby rebalancing the economy as the private sector deleverages . 
There are many subtleties in how governments and central banks should attempt to accomplish these steps . 
And , indeed , the North Atlantic region &apos;s governments and central banks have tried to some degree . 
So we remain far short of full employment for the third reason . 
The issue is not that governments and central banks cannot restore employment , or do not know how ; it is that governments and central banks will not take expansionary policy steps on a large enough scale to restore full employment rapidly . 
And here I reflect on the 1930 &quot; s , and on how historical events recur , appearing first as tragedy and then , pace Karl Marx , as yet another tragedy . 
Keynes begged the policymakers of his time to ignore the &quot; austere and puritanical souls &quot; who argue for &quot; what they politely call a &quot; prolonged liquidation &quot; to put us right , &quot; and professed that he could &quot; not understand how universal bankruptcy can do any good or bring us nearer to prosperity . &quot; 
Today &apos;s policymakers , so eager to draw a bold line under expansionary measures , should pause and consider the same question .
