Central Banks &quot; Outdated Independence 
BUENOS AIRES - The global financial crisis has raised fundamental questions regarding central banks &quot; mandates . 
Over the past few decades , most central banks have focused on price stability as their single and overriding objective . 
This focus supported the ascendancy of &quot; inflation-targeting &quot; as the favored monetary policy framework and , in turn , led to operational independence for central banks . 
The policy was a success : the discipline imposed by strict and rigorous concentration on a sole objective enabled policymakers to control - and then conquer - inflation . 
But , as a consequence of this narrow approach , policymakers disregarded the formation of asset- and commodity-price bubbles , and overlooked the resulting banking-sector instability . 
Moreover , after the financial crisis erupted , central banks were increasingly compelled to depart from inflation targeting , and to implement myriad unconventional monetary policies in order to ameliorate the consequences of the crash and facilitate economic recovery . 
With advanced economies struggling to avoid financial collapse , escape recession , reduce unemployment , and restore growth , central banks are being called upon to address , sometimes simultaneously , growing imbalances . 
In particular , central banks &quot; behavior during the crisis has called into question whether inflation-targeting is an effective framework in the presence of systemic shocks , and , more broadly , whether it can be sustained throughout economic cycles . 
After all , a policy regime that sets aside its only goal during a crisis seems to lack the ability to cope with unexpected challenges . 
Critics identify this &quot; crisis straitjacket syndrome &quot; as the main problem with single-minded inflation targeting . 
While theoretical arguments can be made to justify recent departures from policy , the reality is that in the post-crisis world , advanced-country central banks &quot; goals are no longer limited to price stability . 
In the United States , the Federal Reserve has essentially adopted a quantitative employment target , with nominal GDP targets and other variations under discussion in other countries . 
And financial stability is again a central-bank responsibility , including for the more conservative European Central Bank . 
This shift toward multiple policy objectives inevitably reduces central-bank independence . 
Some analysts have recently claimed that this is because the pursuit of GDP growth , job creation , and financial stability , as well as the establishment of priorities when there are tradeoffs , clearly requires political decisions , which should not be made by unelected officials alone . 
Moreover , by pushing interest rates toward zero , the current policy of quantitative easing ( increasing money supply by buying government securities ) has strong , often regressive , income effects . 
Opponents of central-bank independence contend that , given the allocational and distributional consequences of current monetary-policy interventions , central banks &quot; decision-making should be subject to political control . 
But this argument neglects an important point . 
While it is true that multiple policy targets tend to increase the political sensitivity of central banks &quot; decisions , concentrating only on price stability also has important distributional consequences and political implications . 
In fact , politicization is a matter of scale , not a substantive transformation of monetary policymaking . 
The real reason why central-bank independence tends to create a democratic deficit under a multi-target monetary-policy regime , and why it has become increasingly vulnerable , is that the two main arguments in favor of it no longer apply . 
The first argument in favor of central-bank independence is that , without it , politicians can exploit expansionary monetary policy &apos;s positive short-run effects at election time , without regard for its long-run inflationary consequences . 
( By contrast , fiscal and exchange-rate policies rarely imply comparable temporal trade-offs , and thus are difficult to exploit for political gain . ) 
But this argument becomes irrelevant when ensuring price stability is no longer monetary policymakers &quot; sole task . 
The second argument for institutional independence is that central banks have a clear comparative advantage in dealing with monetary issues , and can therefore be trusted to pursue their targets independently . 
Given that central banks are likely to continue to pursue multiple objectives for a long time , their independence will continue to erode . 
As long as governments do not encroach excessively on central-bank decision-making , this development will restore balance in policymaking and support policy coordination , particularly in times of stress . 
To ensure a positive outcome , policymakers should develop a fully transparent framework with well-defined &quot; rules of engagement . &quot; 
A strict framework for allowing , and at the same time limiting , government &apos;s involvement in central-bank decision-making is particularly crucial in emerging markets , given that , in most of them , central-bank independence has contributed not only to the eradication of inflation , but also to institution-building . 
Central-bank independence is a peculiar institutional innovation . 
Seemingly irrefutable theoretical models underlie a paradigm that has changed in significant ways , and that , if preserved , is bound to cause serious political problems . 
Like it or not , policymakers must accept that central-bank independence will continue to weaken , and they should prepare to cope with the consequences .
