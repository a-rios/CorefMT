Iran &apos;s Nuclear Lies 
Mohammad El-Baradei , the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , is pressing the agency &apos;s board of governors to make one last effort to find a diplomatic solution to Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions before sending the case to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions . 
A decision to refer Iran to the Security Council could come as early as November 24 , when the IAEA &apos;s board meets to discuss &quot; new information &quot; discovered by inspectors on the ground . 
Thanks to the IAEA &apos;s inspectors , we now have a fairly detailed picture of Iran &apos;s nuclear archipelago - at least those facilities that the Iranian government has been forced to open . 
We know that Iran has discovered , mined , and milled natural uranium , the basic building block of any enrichment program , without telling the IAEA . 
We know that Iran built a uranium conversion facility in Isfahan to convert uranium yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride gas ( UF6 ) , the feedstock for uranium enrichment , without the required prior notifications to the IAEA . 
We also know that Iran built an underground uranium enrichment plant at Natanz , hardened it against missile attack , and erected dummy buildings on the surface to conceal it from overhead surveillance . 
The authorities agreed to open this facility to the IAEA only after its existence was confirmed by commercial satellite imagery , and they appear to have swept the underground halls of whatever equipment was installed before the inspectors arrived . 
Once fully operational , these facilities will give Iran mastery of the entire nuclear fuel cycle . 
For eighteen years , Iran &apos;s government concealed these activities from the IAEA , in clear violation of its safeguards agreement . 
For this reason alone , the IAEA &apos;s board must refer Iran to the Security Council for further actions , as required by the agency &apos;s charter . 
Non-nuclear nations that sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty , as Iran has , pledge to abandon all efforts to develop nuclear weapons . 
In exchange , they are given access to nuclear technologies . 
Instead , Iran has been playing cheat and retreat , in clear violation of Article II of the NPT . 
&quot; With Iran , we realized that mastery of the fuel cycle makes you a virtual nuclear weapons state , &quot; a top aide to El-Baradei told me . 
&quot; That was a wake-up call for all of us . &quot; 
But a wake-up call that allows the IAEA &apos;s board to go back to sleep is useless . 
For two and a half years , the European Union has made every effort to get Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA and come clean about its nuclear activities , to no avail . 
When the IAEA announced it wanted to inspect a suspected enrichment cascade within the Revolutionary Guards complex at Lavizan-Shian , Iran &apos;s government stalled for months until it could raze the site . 
When it asked to visit a suspect lab within the Parchin defense production plant , the Iranians stalled . 
When they finally allowed a small team in , they limited their movements , in violation of Iran &apos;s commitments . 
El-Baradei has stated that the IAEA has found &quot; no evidence &quot; of a weapons program in Iran - a statement that Iranian leaders have since cited as proof of their peaceful intentions . 
But the IAEA has no authority to determine whether or not a country has a nuclear weapons program . 
That is up to the UN Security Council . 
Understanding the intentions of Iran &apos;s leaders is not as difficult or as ambiguous as some believe . 
Eighteen years of concealment constitutes a powerful track record . 
For example , in 1986 , then-president Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave a pep talk at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran . 
&quot; Our nation has always been threatened from outside , &quot; he said . 
&quot; The least we can do to face this danger is to let our enemies know that we can defend ourselves . &quot; 
In 1988 , Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani - the supposed &quot; moderate &quot; candidate in Iran &apos;s recent presidential election - spelled out what that meant in an address to the Revolutionary Guards Corps . 
At a Jerusalem Day rally at Tehran University in December 2001 , he uttered one of the regime &apos;s most sinister threats . 
&quot; The use of an atomic bomb against Israel would destroy Israel completely , while &#91; the same &#93; against the world of Islam only would cause damages . &quot; 
Iran &apos;s regime has only grown bolder since then . 
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi declared in June 2004 that Iran &quot; won &apos;t accept any new obligations , &quot; and must &quot; be recognized by the international community as a member of the nuclear club . &quot; 
Similarly , in March 2005 , Rafsanjani reiterated Iran &apos;s refusal to dismantle its nuclear fuel cycle facilities , as the EU and the IAEA had demanded , insisting that &quot; we can &apos;t stop our nuclear program and won &apos;t stop it . &quot; 
In these circumstances , the risk entailed by doing nothing far outweighs the costs of referring Iran to the Security Council . 
Indeed , Iran may already be enriching uranium secretly . 
If it used the centrifuges that it purchased from Pakistan &apos;s nuclear impresario A.Q. Khan , it could have enough fissile material to produce 20 bombs . 
With Iran continuing to shelter top al-Qaeda leaders , this raises an even graver threat : that terrorists get hold of nuclear weapons . 
The dangers of allowing Iran to go nuclear ought to be obvious .
