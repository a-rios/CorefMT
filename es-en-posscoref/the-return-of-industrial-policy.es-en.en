The Return of Industrial Policy 
CAMBRIDGE - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown promotes it as a vehicle for creating high-skill jobs . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy talks about using it to keep industrial jobs in France . 
The World Bank &apos;s chief economist , Justin Lin , openly supports it to speed up structural change in developing nations . 
McKinsey is advising governments on how to do it right . 
Industrial policy is back . 
In fact , industrial policy never went out of fashion . 
Economists enamored of the neo-liberal Washington Consensus may have written it off , but successful economies have always relied on government policies that promote growth by accelerating structural transformation . 
China is a case in point . 
Its phenomenal manufacturing prowess rests in large part on public assistance to new industries . 
State-owned enterprises have acted as incubators for technical skills and managerial talent . 
Local-content requirements have spawned productive supplier industries in automotive and electronics products . 
Generous export incentives have helped firms break into competitive global markets . 
Chile , which is often portrayed as a free-market paradise , is another example . 
The government has played a crucial role in developing every significant new export that the country produces . 
Chilean grapes broke into world markets thanks to publicly financed R D. Forest products were heavily subsidized by none other than General Augusto Pinochet . 
And the highly successful salmon industry is the creation of Fundaci√≥n Chile , a quasi-public venture fund . 
But when it comes to industrial policy , it is the United States that takes the cake . 
This is ironic , because the term &quot; industrial policy &quot; is anathema in American political discourse . It is used almost exclusively to browbeat political opponents with accusations of Stalinist economic designs . 
Yet the US owes much of its innovative prowess to government support . 
As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner explains in his book Boulevard of Broken Dreams , US Department of Defense contracts played a crucial role in accelerating the early growth of Silicon Valley . 
The Internet , possibly the most significant innovation of our time , grew out of a Defense Department project initiated in 1969 . 
Nor is America &apos;s embrace of industrial policy a matter of historical interest only . 
Today the US federal government is the world &apos;s biggest venture capitalist by far . 
According to The Wall Street Journal , the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) alone is planning to spend more than $ 40 billion in loans and grants to encourage private firms to develop green technologies , such as electric cars , new batteries , wind turbines , and solar panels . 
During the first three quarters on 2009 , private venture capital firms invested less than $ 3 billion combined in this sector . 
The DOE invested $ 13 billion . 
The shift toward embracing industrial policy is therefore a welcome acknowledgement of what sensible analysts of economic growth have always known : developing new industries often requires a nudge from government . 
The real question about industrial policy is not whether it should be practiced , but how . 
Here are three important principles to keep in mind . 
First , industrial policy is a state of mind rather than a list of specific policies . 
Its successful practitioners understand that it is more important to create a climate of collaboration between government and the private sector than to provide financial incentives . 
Through deliberation councils , supplier development forums , investment advisory councils , sectoral round-tables , or private-public venture funds , collaboration aims to elicit information about investment opportunities and bottlenecks . 
Second , industrial policy needs to rely on both carrots and sticks . 
Given its risks and the gap between its social and private benefits , innovation requires rents - returns above what competitive markets provide . 
But open-ended incentives have their own costs : they can raise consumer prices and bottle up resources in unproductive activities . 
That is why patents expire . 
The same principle needs to apply to all government efforts to spawn new industries . 
Government incentives need to be temporary and based on performance . 
Third , industrial policy &apos;s practitioners need to bear in mind that it aims to serve society at large , not the bureaucrats who administer it or the businesses that receive the incentives . 
To guard against abuse and capture , industrial policy needs be carried out in a transparent and accountable manner , and its processes must be open to new entrants as well as incumbents . 
The standard rap against industrial policy is that governments cannot pick winners . 
Of course they can &apos;t , but that is largely irrelevant . 
What determines success in industrial policy is not the ability to pick winners , but the capacity to let the losers go - a much less demanding requirement . 
Uncertainty ensures that even optimal policies will lead to mistakes . 
The trick is for governments to recognize those mistakes and withdraw support before they become too costly . 
Thomas Watson , the founder of IBM , once said , &quot; If you want to succeed , raise your error rate . &quot; 
A government that makes no mistakes when promoting industry is one that makes the bigger mistake of not trying hard enough .
