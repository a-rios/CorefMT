The Elusive Search for Global Financial Rules 
BRUSSELS - If the financial crisis is global , it is said , then the solution must be global : an international financial system that works better . 
And , because the Bretton Woods institutions ( BWIs ) - the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - form the center of the international financial system , they must be included in the solution . 
An enhanced international financial system must pursue two main lines of action . 
The first is to broaden the scope of international cooperation . 
At the moment , the Financial Stability Board , whose members include the G-20 countries , mainly pursues initiatives in this field . 
A second line of action is to strengthen the international institutions &quot; soft powers to aim for more consistent economic policies , especially by systemically important economies . 
This would directly involve the Bretton Woods institutions , notably the IMF . 
A strengthening of the IMF was agreed after the Asian crisis in the 1990 &quot; s , and the G-7 summit in Cologne in 1999 mandated the Fund to play a strong surveillance role to ensure greater transparency and encourage early adjustment by countries with unsustainable balance-of-payments positions . 
But , over the last decade , the expectations raised by this mandate have not been met . 
Some emerging economies did not let their currencies float but , instead , continued to peg them at undervalued exchange rates in order to promote their exports and build up reserves as a form of insurance in case of crisis . 
Moreover , the IMF has not succeeded in convincing countries to pursue macroeconomic policies consistent with sustainable current-account positions . 
Nor have advanced economies , particularly the United States , taken IMF advice fully into consideration . 
The accumulation of large surpluses , especially in emerging Asian economies and oil-exporting countries , enabled the US to finance its current-account deficit . 
It also lowered long-term interest rates in the US and made monetary conditions there more expansionary . 
Emerging economies , following the advanced countries , also attached less importance to Fund surveillance , especially as their accumulation of external assets made them less dependent on IMF financing and advice . 
For example , the Fund has been unable to complete a surveillance program with China for three years . 
All this occurred against the background of emerging-market economies &quot; claims that their relatively low representation in the BWIs denied the IMF legitimacy . 
In recent months , the Fund played an important role in resolving the crisis , in particular by assessing the gravity of the situation and providing countries with external finance . 
There seems to be a sense of denial in several countries that large external imbalances were a cause of the crisis . 
These imbalances ultimately reflected the accumulation of excessive international liquidity by countries like the US , stemming from excessive savings by countries like China . 
This spurred an unsustainable consumption boom , as well as unwarranted risk-taking by consumers and financial institutions , which contributed to the large distortions and bubbles in global financial markets that were the preconditions for the current crisis . 
The risk now is that the forces favoring earlier and effective adjustment of imbalances have been weakened . 
Indeed , few today are calling for the IMF to play a stronger role in preventing the accumulation of excessive external imbalances and in fostering more disciplined domestic policies . 
An example of this is the way the IMF &apos;s Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members &quot; Policies , aimed at identifying fundamental exchange-rate misalignments , was modified to allow greater discretion in surveillance , especially over exchange rates . 
This might look like a tactical choice , but I doubt that it will result in a stronger hand for the IMF . 
Emerging and developing countries are demanding a stronger voice in the IMF , but they also seem to be suggesting that they would like it to be less intrusive and less able to impose conditionality - while simultaneously providing more and cheaper financing . 
This might be appropriate in times of systemic crisis , but it is not sustainable in normal times . 
Indeed , some thought should be given to an exit strategy from cheap and unconditional IMF financing . 
Instead , most IMF shareholders seem to favor making the organization &apos;s financing easier . 
Enhancing the role of its Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) , or supplementing the dollar with another world reserve currency , would help facilitate the financing needs of both deficit and surplus countries . 
For deficit countries , borrowing from international institutions outside the markets would be easier , giving the issuer of such currency some form of international lender-of-last-resort function . 
For surplus countries that want to accumulate reserves , it would reduce exchange-rate risk . 
But , if financing were to become easier , it would be unclear how both creditors and debtors would perceive the risk of excessive imbalances . 
The real danger is that adjustment would take place even later , with imbalances left to accumulate for a longer period of time . 
Under these circumstances , crises could be even greater , and the adjustments harsher - as occurred under the last world currency , the gold standard . 
A viable international financial system requires a mechanism to keep imbalances in check . 
An essential element of such a mechanism is to give the IMF a prominent role in two areas : strong and effective surveillance in order to prevent crises , and responsible lending to countries in need , but with appropriate limits and conditionality . 
We don &apos;t need to reinvent the wheel ; we just need to follow up on the commitments made ten years ago . 
Dealing with the short-run challenges of the current crisis should not distract us from the objective of preventing future meltdowns .
