Religious Pluralism for a Pluralist Age 
The election of Pope Benedict XVI and the global war on terror have brought unprecedented attention to the role of religion in our world . 
There has been particular interest ( most specifically in the case of Islam ) as to whether specific religious traditions are compatible with the institutions and values of liberal democracy . 
Despite massive evidence to the contrary , many people - not least theologians - fear that we live in a secular age . 
The modern age is as religious as any previous historical period , and in some places more so . 
One exception is geographical : Western and Central Europe have indeed experienced a significant decline of religion , which has become an important ingredient of European cultural identity . 
The other exception is sociological , comprising a relatively thin but influential international intelligentsia , for whom secularization has become not only a fact , but , at least for some of its members , an ideological commitment . 
These are exceptions . 
What modernity more or less inevitably brings about is not secularization but pluralism - the peaceful co-existence of different racial , ethnic , or religious groups in the same society . 
Modernity undermines communities &quot; traditional homogeneity , because insiders and outsiders constantly rub up against each other , either physically ( through urbanization and travel ) or &quot; virtually &quot; ( through mass literacy and mass communication ) . 
Pluralism - accelerated , expanded , and intensified by globalization - has become a pervasive fact of social life and individuals &quot; consciousness . 
On the institutional level , pluralism means that established religions can no longer take for granted that a particular population will supinely submit to its authority . 
If freedom of religion is guaranteed - the typical situation in liberal democracies - religious institutions cannot rely on the state to fill their pews . 
Instead , people must be persuaded to accept such authority , giving rise to something like a religious market . 
Even if one religious tradition still claims a majority of a population as its nominal adherents , individuals can still choose to disaffiliate from the institution representing that tradition ( as in the Catholic majority countries of Europe ) . 
At the level of individual consciousness , this means that religious certainty is now harder to come by . 
A religious decision can be a matter of passionate commitment ( as in Kierkegaard &apos;s &quot; leap of faith &quot; ) , or , more commonly , an emotionally low-intensity consumer option ( expressed in the telling American phrase &quot; religious preference &quot; ) . 
In either case , the individual is thrown back on himself to reflect upon and come to terms with his native religious tradition . 
Even if an individual decides to affirm a very conservative version of a tradition , this decision may , at least in principle , be revoked at some future time . 
As a result , pluralism pressures churches to become denominations . 
A denomination has the characteristics of a church , into which one is born , but individuals adhere to it voluntarily and it accepts other denominations &quot; right to exist . 
From the standpoint of their compatibility with modern liberal democracy , acceptance of pluralism , more than adherence to particular beliefs and practices , may be what most clearly distinguishes religions . 
Within Christianity , for well-known historical reasons , Protestantism has had a comparative advantage in adapting to pluralism . 
The Roman Catholic Church , after a long period of fierce resistance , also has adapted successfully to pluralist competition , legitimating it theologically in the declarations on religious liberty that began with the Second Vatican Council . 
Acceptance of the market economy has been slower , but that , too , has begun since the encyclical Centesimus Annus of John Paul II . 
Eastern Christian Orthodoxy is , however , a different matter . 
The relation of divine and secular fuels passionate debate throughout the Islamic world and in Israel , but the Orthodox idea of sinfonia - the harmonious unity between society , state , and church - constitutes a distinctive challenge to the acceptance of liberal democracy . 
And comparable Orthodox ideas about communal solidarity ( Russian sobornost ) make it difficult to accept capitalism , because competition and individual entrepreneurship are seen as a morally repulsive expression of ruthlessness and greed . 
Responses to the challenge of global pluralism will take different forms in different parts of the Orthodox world . 
There may be efforts to re-establish something like the traditional sinfonia , as in Russia ; embrace of &quot; Eurosecularity , &quot; as in Greece , Cyprus , and other countries entering the EU &apos;s orbit ( Romania and Bulgaria sooner , Armenia and Georgia later ) ; or moves toward voluntary association , as in the US . 
But the challenge facing Orthodoxy underscores the three options that all contemporary religious communities now face : to resist pluralism , to withdraw from it , or to engage with it . 
None is without difficulties and risks , but only engagement is compatible with liberal democracy . 
Engagement means that the tradition is carried into the open discourse of the culture , and that those who represent the tradition make unapologetic truth claims . 
This will inevitably lead to charges of &quot; proselytizing , &quot; a term that has come to carry a pejorative meaning . 
But proselytizing means only that one tries to convince others of the truths to which one is committed . 
A self-confident community will usually do just that . 
To put it bluntly : instead of worrying that Roman Catholics will &quot; steal &quot; Orthodox souls , the Orthodox should try to steal Catholic souls . 
Barring that , in an age when religions must persuade , they must still &quot; proselytize &quot; within the community - pointing out the truth , the values , and the beauty of the tradition - even if they refrain from doing so outside it . 
Otherwise , they will lose their children .
