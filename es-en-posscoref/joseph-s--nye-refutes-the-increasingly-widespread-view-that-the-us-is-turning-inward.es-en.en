The Myth of Isolationist America 
CAMBRIDGE - Is the United States turning inward and becoming isolationist ? 
That question was posed to me by a number of financial and political leaders at the recent World Economic Forum at Davos , and was heard again a few days later at the annual Munich Security Conference . 
In a strong speech at Davos , Secretary of State John Kerry gave an unambiguous answer : &quot; Far from disengaging , America is proud to be more engaged than ever . &quot; 
Yet the question lingered . 
Unlike the mood at Davos a few years ago , when many participants mistook an economic recession for long-term American decline , the prevailing view this year was that the US economy has regained much of its underlying strength . 
Economic doomsayers focused instead on previously fashionable emerging markets like Brazil , Russia , India , and Turkey . 
The anxiety about US isolationism is driven by recent events . 
For starters , there is America &apos;s refusal ( thus far ) to intervene militarily in Syria . 
Then there is the coming withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan . 
And President Barack Obama &apos;s cancellation of his trip to Asia last autumn , owing to domestic political gridlock in the US Congress and the resulting government shutdown , made a poor impression on the region &apos;s leaders . 
Indeed , with Kerry &apos;s time and travel focused on the Middle East , many Asian leaders believe that Obama &apos;s signature foreign policy - strategic &quot; rebalancing &quot; toward Asia - has run out of steam , even as tension between China and Japan , evident in their leaders &quot; statements at Davos , continues to mount . 
Particularly egregious from the point of view of &quot; Davos &quot; was the recent refusal by Congress to approve the reform and refunding of the International Monetary Fund , even though a plan that added no significant burden to the American taxpayer had been agreed years earlier by the G-20 under Obama &apos;s leadership . 
When I asked a prominent Republican senator why Congress had balked at keeping an American commitment , he attributed it to &quot; sheer orneriness , &quot; reflecting the mood of right-wing Tea Party Republicans and some left-wing Democrats . 
Further evidence of American isolationism can be found in a recent opinion poll taken by the Pew Research Center and the Council on Foreign Relations . 
According to the survey , fifty-two percent of Americans believe that the US &quot; should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own . &quot; 
About the same number said that the US is &quot; less important and powerful &quot; than it was a decade ago . 
The problem with these perceptions - both at home and abroad - is that the US remains the world &apos;s most powerful country , and is likely to remain so for decades . 
China &apos;s size and rapid economic growth will almost certainly increase its relative strength vis-Ã -vis the US . 
But even when China becomes the world &apos;s largest economy in the coming years , it will still be decades behind the US in terms of per capita income . 
Moreover , even if China suffers no major domestic political setback , projections based on GDP growth alone are one-dimensional and ignore US military and soft-power advantages . 
They also ignore China &apos;s geopolitical disadvantages within Asia . 
America &apos;s culture of openness and innovation will ensure its role as a global hub in an age when networks supplement , if not fully replace , hierarchical power . 
The US is well positioned to benefit from such networks and alliances , if American leaders follow smart strategies . 
In structural terms , it matters greatly that the two entities in the world with economies and per capita income similar to the US - Europe and Japan - are both American allies . 
In terms of balance-of-power resources , that boosts America &apos;s net position , but only if US leaders maintain these alliances and ensure international cooperation . 
Decline is a misleading metaphor for today &apos;s America , and Obama fortunately has rejected the suggestion that he should pursue a strategy aimed at managing it . 
As a leader in research and development , higher education , and entrepreneurial activity , the US , unlike ancient Rome , is not in absolute decline . 
We do not live in a &quot; post-American world , &quot; but we also no longer live in the &quot; American era &quot; of the late twentieth century . 
In the decades ahead , the US will be &quot; first &quot; but not &quot; sole . &quot; 
That is because the power resources of many others - both states and non-state actors - are growing , and because , on an increasing number of issues , obtaining America &apos;s preferred outcomes will require exercising power with others as much as over others . 
The capacity of US leaders to maintain alliances and create networks will be an important dimension of America &apos;s hard and soft power . 
The problem for US power in the twenty-first century is not just China , but the &quot; rise of the rest . &quot; 
The solution is not isolation , but a strategy of selectivity similar to what President Dwight Eisenhower advocated in the 1950 &quot; s . 
A smart power strategy starts with a clear assessment of limits . 
The preeminent power does not have to patrol every boundary and project its strength everywhere . 
That is why Eisenhower prudently resisted direct intervention on the French side in Vietnam in 1954 . 
Eisenhower was right about something else , too : America &apos;s military strength depends on preservation of its economic strength . 
Nation-building at home is not the isolation that critics fear ; on the contrary , it is central to a smart foreign policy . 
A smart strategy would avoid involvement of ground forces in major wars on the Asian continent . 
Yet such prudence is not the same as isolationism . 
The US needs to combine its soft- and hard-power resources better . 
As Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address , &quot; in a world of complex threats , our security depends on all elements of our power - including strong and principled diplomacy . &quot; 
Eisenhower could have said that , and no one would accuse him of being an isolationist .
