Adapt or Die 
MILAN - In rapidly growing emerging markets , a combination of internal economic forces , supportive policies , and the shifting nature of the global economy drive high-speed and far-reaching change . 
The transformation of economic structures occurs so quickly that it is virtually impossible not to notice - though the complexity of the change is , at times , bewildering . 
In this fluid environment , mistakes are frequently made . 
In the economy &apos;s tradable sector , comparative advantage always shifts , causing structural change and creative destruction . 
Countries undergoing a &quot; middle-income transition &quot; out of poor-country status frequently try to resist these changes , but doing so causes growth to slow , if not stop altogether . 
While the private sector ( domestic and external ) drives these shifts , government policies and public-sector investment patterns play an essential supporting and complementary role . 
These need to adapt , too . 
The policy framework that has proven to serve the major emerging economies best is one that focuses not only on macro and monetary stability , but also on adaptation , guided by a forward-looking ( though inherently imperfect ) assessment of coming micro and macro structural shifts and the measures needed to support them . 
What of the large advanced countries ? 
For historical reasons , the policy mindset is less flexible and adaptive . 
Structural change is viewed largely as the province of the private sector , and hence not as a key part of long-term policy thinking . 
In the postwar period , until recently , advanced economies dominated the global economy . 
Emerging economies &quot; impact on them was relatively small , and they have yet to respond adequately to the rapid structural changes in the global economy . 
A small example : as recently as July 8 , after the latest disappointing employment report in the United States , President Barack Obama expressed the widely held view that an agreement on the debt ceiling and deficit reduction would remove the uncertainty that is holding back business investment , growth , and employment . 
In other words , America &apos;s fiscal problems explain its extremely weak economic recovery . 
Once a fiscal deal is done , government can step aside and let the private sector drive the structural changes that are needed to restore a pattern of inclusive growth . 
To be fair , there have been exceptions to this stance . 
In the US , a postwar alliance of government , business , and academia created the human capital and technology base of a dynamic economy , reinforced by the post-Sputnik commitment to scientific and technological excellence and innovation . 
In Germany , the post-2000 reforms that reset the economy &apos;s productivity , flexibility , and competitiveness have proved crucial to the country &apos;s current economic strength and resilience . 
Despite these examples , economic and financial commentators appear increasingly puzzled about the weak US recovery , with its modest GDP growth and meager employment gains . 
Growth estimates since the 2008 crisis have been revised downward several times . 
The political narrative runs in parallel . 
A recent ( admittedly partisan ) study by the US Congress &apos;s Joint Economic Committee documents the relative weakness of the current recovery . 
Indeed , the differences between the current situation and other postwar US recoveries are so large that the term &quot; recovery &quot; in today &apos;s context is dubious . 
But US leaders nonetheless accept the cyclical view of the economy , see a weak recovery , and blame it on post-crisis policy failures . 
But , while that might play well politically , the sensible conclusion is that this is not just a cyclical recovery , but rather the beginning of a delayed process of structural adaptation to a rapidly shifting global economy , to emerging economies &quot; growth and shifting comparative advantage , and to powerful technological forces . 
While these changes are difficult to think about with any degree of precision , that doesn &apos;t make them unimportant . 
Of course , no one would deny that there are cyclical elements in the downturn of 2008 . 
But they were accompanied by structural imbalances that had been building over at least 15 years , and that are at the heart of the US economy &apos;s inability to bounce back in a normal cyclical way . 
Skeptics might well question why , if these alleged structural imbalances are now impeding GDP and employment growth , they did not appear before the crisis . 
The answer is that they did , but not in growth and employment figures . 
Other signals were missed , ignored , or deemed unimportant . 
A short list of these signals would include excess consumption ( now gone ) and deficient savings , based on an asset bubble and high debt ; a persistent and growing current-account deficit ( signaling that domestic consumption and investment exceeded income and output ) ; and negligible net employment growth ( over two decades ) in the economy &apos;s tradable sector . 
With domestic aggregate demand in short supply , the only functioning growth engine , external trade in goods and services , is not an employment engine . 
Missing all of these signals produced the pre-crisis illusion of sustainable growth and employment , and helps explain why the crisis , rather than its causes , is viewed as the culprit . 
The crisis , however , merely exposed the underlying imbalances and unwound some of them . 
The &quot; grand bargain &quot; that PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian recently alluded to in describing the appropriate response to the current situation in the US needs to include a fiscal stabilization plan . 
But it also must include a shift to a policy framework that accurately reflects the non-cyclical nature of the longer-term structural adaptations that will be required to restore growth and employment .
