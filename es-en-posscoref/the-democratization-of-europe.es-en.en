The Democratization of Europe 
Europe &apos;s integration project is historically unprecedented . 
For the past millennium Europe has lived in an uneasy equilibrium , giving birth to every great empire that dominated and pacified the world in the last 500 years . 
Its eight or nine principal nations made war on each other whenever one threatened to seek and secure mastery over the others . 
Europe gave us the last two world wars , and to the balance sheet of monstrosities must be added its grotesque refinements in the art of murder : the Holocaust and the Gulag . 
Sixty years after the end of the last war - a pittance in the light of history - 
The institutionalization of Europe makes war impossible and it motivates reconciliation : between France and Germany , between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland , and soon between Hungarians and Romanians . 
At the same time , deep economic integration and a common commercial policy make the European Union a zone of prosperity that is relatively well protected against contemporary financial crises . 
Those who dreamt of a single federal nation , capable of asserting a strong foreign policy backed by potent armed forces , are perhaps disappointed by the shape of today &apos;s EU . 
Although Europe is more a space governed by a shared rule of law than an expression of a unitary political will , it is currently becoming the greatest economic power in the world . 
This is a historical event of enormous significance . 
This is true , but only up to a point . 
In the past , Europe has suffered from a lack of democratic legitimacy . 
What was originally a consultative body has slowly evolved into a parliament like any other . 
Indeed , the only attribute of a national parliament that the European Parliament still lacks is the power of legislative initiative . 
Otherwise , it is a normal legislature , evolving into the bearer of popular confidence - or the lack thereof - in the government ( in this case the European Commission ) . 
Although the authority to vote a government in or out stems from the treaty of Amsterdam , which was ratified in 1997 , the European Parliament has not used it - until now . 
In the last week of October , Italy &apos;s candidate for the position of European Commissioner for justice , freedom and security , Rocco Buttiglione , declared before the Parliament that homosexuality is a sin and that women &apos;s purpose should be to stay at home and be protected by men , so that they can raise children . 
Nobody questions Buttiglione &apos;s right to think this way . 
Nor did the European Parliament stop with Buttiglione . 
MP &apos;s were also shocked to learn that the Dutch candidate for the position of Commissioner for Competition sat on the boards of many powerful financial institutions , which would make her both a judge and a party in proceedings before the Commission . 
The arrogance of the Commission &apos;s president-designate , Jos√© Barroso , and his obvious contempt for Parliament , did the rest . 
With the confirmation vote about to take place , Barroso preemptively withdrew his proposed Commission , knowing that he would lose . 
Some have called the withdrawal of a proposed Commission an institutional crisis . 
But that is absurd . 
After all , checking the power of the executive is what parliaments are supposed to do . 
Barroso remains personally charged with forming the Commission , and has a few weeks to propose another team . 
The same thing could happen in any of our national parliaments . 
Europe needed this rebalancing of powers so that it could be recognized as a fully democratic polity . 
The legitimacy of the new Commission will only be strengthened after a second round of scrutiny . 
By asserting its democratic prerogative , Europe &apos;s Parliament has strengthened Europe .
