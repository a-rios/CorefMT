The Security Trap 
CHICAGO - Even as the world becomes more integrated , the word &quot; security &quot; crops up again and again , as in &quot; food security &quot; or &quot; energy security . &quot; 
Typically , this means a country creating and controlling production facilities no matter what the cost . 
Thus , Arab countries grow water-hungry grain in the desert , and China acquires part ownership of oil companies in Sudan . 
Are these economically sensible actions ? 
If not , what should the world do to reduce the need for them ? 
Let &apos;s start with ownership of foreign resources . 
One might think that a country that owns foreign oil can use the profits from sales to insulate its economy from high world oil prices . 
The world market prices oil according to its opportunity cost . 
Rather than subsidizing the price in the domestic oil market ( and thus giving domestic manufacturers and consumers an incentive to use too much oil ) , it would make far better sense to let the domestic price rise to the international price and distribute the windfall profits from foreign oil assets to the population . 
The key point is that fundamental economic decisions should not be affected by the ownership of additional foreign oil assets . 
As a result , the acquiring country will , if anything , make suboptimal economic decisions . 
Could the purchase of foreign resources lead to smoother national income ? 
A purchase will always look beneficial if one looks backward after the resource price has risen . 
Assuming the foreign oil assets are priced fairly at the time of purchase , the country benefits only when the purchase helps smooth its income ; however , purchases may increase income volatility even for a country that relies heavily on oil . 
For example , in large countries like the United States or China , which account for a significant portion of world demand , the world price of oil is likely to be high when the country is growing strongly and citizens have lots of income , whereas the price is likely to be low when the country is doing poorly . 
Foreign oil assets are a bad hedge in such cases , for they subtract from citizens &quot; income when it is already low and add to it when it is high . 
Even if owning oil assets is a useful hedge ( as in a small , oil-consuming country ) , it is not clear that buying stakes in opaque companies in foreign countries is the best strategy . 
A country &apos;s property rights in foreign oil assets are likely to diminish as the oil price rises . 
Even if the foreign company does not start squeezing out its minority owners , its government will be tempted to expropriate foreign owners through windfall taxes ( if the government is sophisticated ) or nationalization ( if it is unsophisticated ) - especially if its voters feel , with the benefit of hindsight and populist incitement , that the assets were sold too cheaply . 
But perhaps what countries really fear is not so much high prices but a total market breakdown and descent into an autarkic &quot; Mad Max &quot; world in which oil is scarce , no country is willing to allow trade in the oil it produces , and there is no world market clearing price . 
If such a situation were to occur , ownership of oil assets abroad would most likely become worthless , as each country would only get to use oil produced within its political borders ( or within nearby borders that could be invaded ) . 
It is in this kind of world that seemingly nonsensical behavior like growing grain in the desert to ensure food security begins to make sense . 
Alternatives do need to be explored , including more efficient use , diversification into more easily accessible substitutes , and reduction of overall consumption ( though in all these cases , it is easier to deal with energy shortages than food shortages ) . 
Moreover , even in such a bleak world , it is difficult to imagine the market breaking down completely or for long . 
Indeed , one can imagine black marketeers and smugglers buying where grain is available and transporting it to sell to countries where it is not . 
Unless governments build leak-proof barriers around their countries - and the costs would likely be prohibitive - an implicit world market would be re-established . 
Nevertheless , and understandably , many countries make decisions to locate production locally and to protect it against foreign trade , fearing market breakdown through war , trade sanctions , or simply shortsighted decisions by foreign governments to protect their own populations from price increases . 
Paradoxically , once a country ensures its own security , it has weaker incentives to avoid the market breakdown that prompts the initial search for security . 
International agreement to ensure that countries do not prohibit exports , especially of critical commodities , except under severely ( and verifiably ) adverse domestic circumstances , would help reduce fear of market breakdown . 
Similarly , the creation of international strategic resource reserves on neutral territory and under neutral management could help alleviate concerns about politically motivated disruptions . 
Unfortunately , all of this requires substantial international political consensus , cooperation , and goodwill - all of which are in short supply today . 
Until we find the collective will , the drive for national economic security will continue to lead to collective insecurity .
