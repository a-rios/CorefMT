Asia \ u0027s Dysfunctional Democracies . 
Asia has been gripped by election fever all year . 
The Philippines and Taiwan have chosen new presidents ; 
India and Malaysia have ushered in new parliaments and prime ministers . 
September brings two more vital polls : a legislative election in Hong Kong and a presidential election in Indonesia . 
Voters there may also extend a disturbing paradox that has emerged in the region : the more &quot; vigorous &quot; Asian democracy becomes , the more dysfunctional it is . 
There is no shortage of examples . 
The attempt by opposition parties to impeach South Korea &apos;s President Roh Moo Hyun on the flimsiest of excuses ; 
If deadlock and confusion were the only results , such political impasses might be tolerable . 
But chronic stalemate has confronted many Asian democracies with the threat of being discredited , a potential for violence , and the prospect of economic decline . 
Indeed , the precedents of democratic immobility in Asia are hardly encouraging . 
For example , since Pakistan &apos;s creation in 1947 , partisan divisions have ensured that no elected government has been able to serve its full term . 
So Pakistanis have grimly accepted military rule as their destiny . 
The problem in Asia often arises from something the French call &quot; cohabitation &quot; - an awkward arrangement by which a directly elected president must co-exist with a parliament controlled by a rival party or parties . 
The United States and Europe &apos;s mature democracies may function well enough with the &quot; checks and balances &quot; of divided government ( though the Republicans &apos; bid to impeach President Clinton a few years ago might suggest otherwise ) , but in Asia the failure to bestow executive and legislative powers on a single institution is usually a terrible drawback . 
This seems especially true when a government tries to enact radical economic or political reforms . 
The elected president wants to act , but the assembly refuses to approve the necessary laws . 
Or vice versa . 
The pattern begins in parliamentary deadlock . 
Incompetent leaders blame legislatures for their failures ; legislators blame presidents from rival parties . 
Finger pointing replaces responsibility , fueling popular demand for a strongman ( or woman ) who can override political divisions . 
Indira Gandhi &apos;s brief &quot; emergency rule &quot; in the 1970 &apos;s was partly the result of such institutional dysfunction . 
Divided government also plays into the hands of Asia &apos;s separatists . 
At a critical moment for Sri Lanka &apos;s peace process , President Kumaratunga was so incensed by the policies of her political rival , Prime Minister Wickremessinghe , that she sacked three of his ministers and called elections almost four years early . 
The only people who seem to have benefited from this democratic division are the murderous Tamil Tigers . 
Similarly , in Nepal , a Maoist insurgency has taken advantage of divisions between the King and parliament to gain control of much of the countryside . 
True , Asian democracies , however unstable , are preferable to autocracies , whether military , as in Pakistan and Burma , or communist , as in China and Vietnam . 
But the danger in a weakened democracy is not merely blocked legislation and ineffective government . 
Ambitious but thwarted presidents are easily tempted to take unconstitutional measures ; after all , they reason , the people elected them directly . 
The same is true of some prime ministers , like Thailand &apos;s authoritarian Thaksin Shinawatra , who now stands accused of weakening his country &apos;s democratic traditions in favor of personal rule . 
Given these precedents and the widespread instability exposed by this year &apos;s elections , perhaps Asian policymakers should consider the merits of doing away with &quot; cohabitation &quot; and adopting systems where electoral victory translates into real power . 
Of course , parliamentary political systems are far from perfect . 
Neither Singapore nor Malaysia , where ruling parties have long dominated the parliaments , has a political culture as healthy as in Taiwan or South Korea . 
But in parliamentary democracies such as Japan and India , an elected leader runs the country until the day his or her party or coalition loses its legislative majority . 
This means that governments are judged not by their ability to outmaneuver legislatures , but by the quality of their policies . 
This seems to be a more efficient - and politically more stable - form of democracy than the unhappy cohabitation that produces such ugly confrontations in Taiwan , South Korea , and the Philippines . 
By contrast , the threats posed by divided government could be greater than mere parliamentary rumbles . 
Cohabitation could very soon become a problem even in the quasi-democracy of Hong Kong , if voters there on September 12 elect a legislature hostile to Tung Chee-hwa , the territory &apos;s Beijing-anointed chief executive , later this month . 
Indonesia also risks deadlock if , as seems likely , the election on September 20 produces a president from a different party than the one that controls parliament . 
Abraham Lincoln was right : a house divided against itself cannot stand . 
In many Asian democracies , only institutional reconstruction will prevent a collapse .
