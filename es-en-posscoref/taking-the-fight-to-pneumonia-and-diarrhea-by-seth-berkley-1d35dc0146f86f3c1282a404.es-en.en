Beating the Child Killers 
GENEVA - Ask most people to name the two biggest causes of death among children , and they will most likely say malaria and HIV . 
In fact , it is pneumonia and diarrhea - the &quot; forgotten killers &quot; - that are responsible for the highest death toll , claiming more than two million of the most vulnerable lives every year . 
Together , these two diseases account for 29 % of all deaths of children under five years old . 
Yet as shocking as these statistics are , what is perhaps even more surprising is just how preventable pneumonia and diarrhea are - so much so that it would be quite feasible to introduce measures that by 2025 would reduce their death toll to almost zero . 
That is precisely what we are now aiming to do . 
An ambitious new plan , called the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea , launched this month by the World Health Organization and UNICEF , aims to step up existing interventions and pool global efforts , with the goal of reducing the number of deaths from pneumonia to less than three children per 1,000 , and of diarrhea-related deaths to below one in 1,000 . 
This would effectively end the preventable deaths of more than two million children every year . 
For any other infectious disease or global health threat , achieving this kind of reduction in incidence rate and mortality would be nothing short of miraculous . 
Yet , for pneumonia and diarrhea , we have every reason to believe that we can succeed , because we already know what works . 
For example , infants who are not exclusively breastfed for the first six months have a ten-fold increase in the risk of death from diarrhea , and are 15 times more likely to die from pneumonia . 
Similarly , basic sanitation , such as improved hand washing and access to clean water , and better nutrition can also produce significant risk reduction , much of which can be achieved through simple education programs . 
Immunization is also highly effective . 
Vaccinating children against rotavirus , for example , can protect them from a pathogen that is responsible for 37 % of all diarrhea deaths in children under five , thus saving 450,000 lives every year . 
Similarly , vaccines exist to protect against pneumococcal disease , which accounts for a half-million pneumonia-related deaths annually . 
When combined , these interventions significantly reduce both pneumonia and diarrhea ; the problem is that , too often , they do not reach the children most at risk , such as those living in extreme poverty or hard-to-reach communities in the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
That is why we now need the Integrated Global Action Plan . 
The two diseases share so many common causes and risk factors , prevention strategies and interventions , and delivery platforms for care in clinics , communities , and schools that it makes sense to bring them together . 
But , if those hard-to-reach children are to benefit , our efforts must be scaled up significantly . 
The vaccines protecting against rotavirus and pneumococcal disease are both barely more than a decade old . 
In the past , such new vaccines would take , on average , 15 years to reach developing countries - and then at prices that would place them beyond the reach of those most in need . 
This is one of the reasons why my organization , the GAVI Alliance , was created : to help accelerate the introduction of new vaccines and make them more affordable and accessible in developing countries . 
Through our unique public-private business model , we have worked with our partners to help increase supplies of these vaccines while simultaneously bringing down their price . 
Indeed , since 2006 , the price of rotavirus vaccine has fallen by 67 % , to just $ 2.50 per dose , while the price of a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has plummeted by 90 % , to $ 3.50 . 
Such price reductions have and will continue to play a crucial role in saving the lives of millions of children and achieving the Millennium Development Goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds . 
To date , GAVI has helped countries immunize more than 13 million children against pneumococcal disease and five million children against rotavirus , with plans to strengthen its efforts in countries where immunization coverage is below 70 % . 
None of this means that we will not still face significant obstacles . 
But the one thing that we know about immunization is that we can reach everyone . 
We did it with smallpox , which has now been eradicated , and we are doing it with polio ( with less than 100 cases worldwide this year ) . 
The challenge now is to do the same with all of our life-saving vaccines - particularly those that target the biggest killers of children .
