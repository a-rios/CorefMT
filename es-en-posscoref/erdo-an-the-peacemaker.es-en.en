Erdoğan the Peacemaker ? 
ISTANBUL - Turkey &apos;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has taken on a daunting challenge . 
After participating in the nuclear-security summit in South Korea at the end of March , he went to Tehran to urge Iran &apos;s leaders to make a deal during the next round of nuclear talks between Iran and the United Nations Security Council &apos;s five permanent members ( Britain , China , France , Russia , and the United States ) plus Germany . 
And Erdoğan will host those talks in Istanbul in mid-April . 
Erdoğan last traveled to Tehran in May 2010 to finalize an agreement that he had negotiated under which Iran was to send large quantities of its low-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for nuclear fuel for Iran &apos;s research reactor . 
The deal , mediated by Turkey and Brazil , was presented to the rest of the world as a groundbreaking confidence-building initiative . 
But the US and its allies quickly rejected the agreement as an Iranian ploy designed to halt the growing momentum for additional sanctions . 
Turkey &apos;s insistence on pressing ahead with the deal caused tension with the US and fueled criticism at home and abroad that Erdoğan &apos;s government was shifting away from its long-standing alliance with the West . 
The memory of this short-lived crisis with the US is still fresh in Turkish government circles . 
So why , despite having burned his fingers two years ago , is Erdoğan taking up the issue again ? 
What did he hope to accomplish in Tehran ? 
Much has changed in the Middle East during the past two years , and not to Turkey &apos;s advantage . 
As a result , Turkey is now seeking to contain a rapidly deteriorating regional security situation . 
Events in Syria are forcing Turkish authorities to accept the harsh reality of the Assad regime &apos;s resilience - and now its hostility towards Turkey . 
Iraq , another of Turkey &apos;s neighbors , faces the risk of a protracted sectarian power struggle following withdrawal of US troops . 
Given this , Turkey &apos;s main objective now is to prevent a military intervention against Iran . 
From Turkey &apos;s perspective , an Israeli or American strike against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities would destabilize the region further , as Iran would undoubtedly retaliate by fueling sectarian tensions and undermining the prospects of a settlement in both Syria and Iraq . 
As a result , Turkey wants to prolong , at all costs , the time available for diplomacy . 
But Erdoğan &apos;s specific objective was more modest this time than it was in 2010 , because Turkey does not want to play the role of mediator and will not seek to negotiate the details of an agreement . 
Instead , Erdoğan emphasized to his Iranian counterparts the international community &apos;s resolve to bring transparency to Iran &apos;s nuclear program , and insisted on the importance of concrete progress in the next round of the nuclear talks . 
He warned that Iranian intransigence would doom the talks to failure , raising the prospects of yet another military confrontation in the Middle East . 
In particular , Erdoğan stressed the need for Iran to offer a gesture of goodwill about its nuclear program . 
The Iranian regime should , at the very least , commit itself to halt uranium enrichment at 20 % , a figure short of the threshold needed to produce weapons . 
Having had direct meetings with both Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Erdoğan was in a unique position , as a prime minister of a NATO country , to convey these critical messages to a regime whose top-level decision-making processes remain as opaque as ever to the West . 
Paradoxically , however , Erdoğan &apos;s task , while more modest than in 2010 , is also more difficult , owing to the prospect of new sanctions on Iran , including a ban on oil exports , that are to enter into force in July . 
Advocates of sanctions argue that they are having a crippling effect on the Iranian economy . 
The value of the Iranian rial has fallen by 50 % against the US dollar since the beginning of the year , and the country is suffering from a severe shortage of foreign exchange . 
So now is not the time to pull back . 
Moreover , US President Barack Obama , facing an election in November , does not wish to be accused of being soft on Iran , making it difficult for the West to reciprocate potential Iranian overtures . 
Yet Erdoğan &apos;s best ally in his risky gambit may be the US consumer . 
Faced with rising gasoline prices as a result of the ongoing crisis with Iran , Americans &quot; concerns about the cost of driving have contributed to Obama &apos;s shaky popularity ratings . 
Thus , the Obama administration may find it more politically expedient to seek a deal with Iran . 
If Iran displays a real willingness to compromise , the West should hold off on the new sanctions . 
It will soon become clear whether Erdoğan &apos;s visit succeeds . 
If Iran decides to engage the international community with concrete confidence-building measures at the next round of multilateral talks , Erdoğan will take much of the credit for giving diplomacy a last chance - and quite possibly for averting a disastrous military confrontation in the Middle East .
