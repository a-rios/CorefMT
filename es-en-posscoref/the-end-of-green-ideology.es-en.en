The End of Green Ideology 
PARIS - The meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant has sent political aftershocks racing around the globe . 
More often than not , however , the shocks have been ideological , with no basis in science . 
The managers of Tokyo Electric Power ( TEPCO ) , which operates the Fukushima reactors , have been justly criticized for using an old generation of poorly maintained generators . 
The Japanese , who perceive themselves as the world &apos;s best engineers , now feel humiliated . 
But , despite street protests , the collective reaction in Japan has not been to repudiate nuclear energy . 
After all , the Fukushima accident has severely injured only a few people - probably less than a dozen workers are dangerously irradiated . 
Almost all of the thousands of Japanese victims were drowned by the tsunami wave , not wiped out by a nuclear meltdown . 
Japan will not stop using nuclear power . 
Instead , its engineers will develop better and safer plants , most likely relying on the miniaturized nuclear reactors that were planned to replace the aging plant at Fukushima . 
Most Japanese have remained rational in the face of their country &apos;s tragedy , as have most people in neighboring Asian countries like China and South Korea , which , likewise , have not abandoned their commitment to nuclear energy . 
This is not the case in Europe and the United States , where Fukushima &apos;s ideological aftershocks have been most destructive . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government was the first to overreact by deciding to close down all nuclear reactors in the coming years - a radical move driven by domestic politics . 
Merkel &apos;s government does not include Germany &apos;s Greens , but the Green ideology has become a widely shared national creed in Germany . 
Indeed , one can relate popular hostility toward nuclear energy to Germany &apos;s traditional romantic cult of nature , not to science . 
Germany &apos;s nuclear plants will be replaced by more thermal plants , implying a large increase in German carbon emissions - so much for Green concern with global warming ! 
And so much for intellectual honesty , because a Germany without nuclear power of its own will be compelled to buy it from France , which has no intention of closing its nuclear plants . 
In the US , the ideological aftershock is closer to Germany &apos;s than to France &apos;s : the US may not be overly prone to romanticism , but a cult of nature remains part of the American psyche . 
This may go some way toward explaining why the Democrats , who control the presidency and the Senate , are so committed to so-called alternative energies . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has thrown billions of dollars at wind , solar , ethanol , and other alternative-energy resources . 
Now the Fukushima tragedy is being used to justify continuing these economically dubious programs . 
We can bet that none of these alternative energies will easily replace oil , gas , and nuclear power in the foreseeable future . 
At market prices , without public subsidies , a unit of energy produced by solar or wind in the US costs five times more than a unit produced by oil , gas , or nuclear plants . 
Moreover , supporters of alternative energies systematically downplay their negative environmental impact . 
A wind turbine requires 50 tons of steel and half a square mile of ground space . 
If California were to rely on solar power for its electricity consumption , the entire state would have to be covered with photovoltaic cells . 
The great irony of the current situation is that real innovation and entrepreneurial activity , without government support , is taking place in the field of energy generation , such as in the creation of miniaturized nuclear reactors . 
The most promising breakthrough may well be the discovery of huge reserves of shale gas all over the planet . 
Indeed , thanks to the new techniques in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling , shale gas may well become the dominant energy resource of the future . 
Shale gas could thus reduce dependency on OPEC oil and gas while reducing carbon emission . 
Gas generates ten times less carbon than biomass or ethanol , which ecologists so heavily promote . 
Beyond Fukushima , future energy supplies will most likely rely more and more on miniaturized nuclear plants and shale gas - a mix capable of responding to a rapidly urbanizing world population &apos;s growing demand for electricity . 
Such a renewed energy balance would impact the current global balance of power . 
Shale gas is abundant in Europe and North America , in contrast to oil and gas . 
Thus , the energy of tomorrow could well reinforce the world &apos;s democracies and weaken its most repressive regimes , where most oil is to be found nowadays . 
Within this new geopolitical framework , green ideology will survive like a cult or a recipe for economic suicide .
