Steady on the Renminbi 
NEW HAVEN - Currency wars are raging worldwide , and China is bearing the brunt of them . 
The renminbi has appreciated sharply over the past several years , exports are sagging , and the risk of deflation is growing . 
Under these circumstances , many suggest that a reversal in Chinese currency policy to weaken the renminbi is the most logical course . 
That would be a serious mistake . 
It would also be highly problematic for the global economy . 
On the surface , the situation certainly appears worrisome - especially when viewed through the currency lens , which captures shifts in Chinese prices relative to those in the rest of the world . 
According to the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , China &apos;s real effective exchange rate - an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted average of the renminbi &apos;s value relative to the currencies of a cross-section of China &apos;s trading partners - has increased by 26 % over the last four years . 
China &apos;s currency has appreciated more than any of the other 60 countries that the BIS covers ( apart from dysfunctional Venezuela , where the figures are distorted by multiple foreign-exchange regimes ) . 
By comparison , the allegedly strong US dollar is up just 12 % in real terms over the same period . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s emerging-market counterparts have experienced sharp currency depreciations , with the Brazilian real falling by 16 % , the Russia ruble by 32 % , and the Indian rupee by 12 % . 
This currency shift is , of course , the functional equivalent of a large hike in the price of Chinese exports . 
Add to that continued sluggishness in global demand , and the once-powerful Chinese export machine is suffering , with total exports down by 3 % year on year in January . 
For an economy in which exports account for about 25 % of GDP , that is not a trivial development . 
At the same time , a stronger renminbi has made imports less expensive , putting downward pressure on China &apos;s price structure . 
Unsurprisingly , this has exacerbated the fear of deflation , with the consumer price index ( CPI ) rising by just 0.8 % year on year in January , and the annual decline in producer prices steepening , to 4.3 % . 
While these trends are undoubtedly being amplified by plummeting world oil prices , China &apos;s core CPI inflation rate ( which excludes volatile food and energy prices ) was near 1 % in January . 
Against this background , it is easy to see why many anticipate a tactical adjustment in China &apos;s currency policy , from appreciation to depreciation . 
Such a move would certainly seem appealing as a way to provide temporary relief from downward pressure on growth and prices . 
But there are three reasons why such a move could backfire . 
First and foremost , a shift in currency policy would undermine - indeed , undo - the progress that China has made on the road to reform and rebalancing . 
In fact , a stronger renminbi is consistent with China &apos;s key objective of shifting from export-intensive growth to consumer-led development . 
The generally steady appreciation of the renminbi - which has risen by 32.6 % against the US dollar since mid-2005 - is consistent with this objective and should not be reversed . 
It strengthens Chinese consumers &apos; purchasing power and reduces any currency-related subsidy to exports . 
During the recent financial crisis , the authorities temporarily suspended China &apos;s renminbi-appreciation policy , and the exchange rate was held steady from mid-2008 through early 2010 . 
Given that current circumstances are far less threatening than those in the depths of the Great Crisis , the need for another tactical adjustment in currency policy is far less acute . 
Second , a shift to currency depreciation could inflame anti-China sentiment among the country &apos;s major trading partners - especially the United States , where Congress has flirted for years with the prospect of imposing trade sanctions on Chinese exporters . 
A bipartisan coalition in the House of Representatives recently introduced the so-called Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act , which would treat currency undervaluation as a subsidy , allowing US companies to seek higher countervailing duties on imports . 
Similarly , President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has just brought yet another action against China in the World Trade Organization - this time focusing on illegal subsidies that China provided to exporters through so-called &quot; common service platforms &quot; and &quot; demonstration bases . &quot; 
If China intervenes to push its currency lower , US political support for anti-China trade actions will undoubtedly intensify , pushing the world &apos;s two largest economies closer to the slippery slope of protectionism . 
Finally , a renminbi-depreciation policy would lead to a sharp escalation in the global currency war . 
In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing , competitive currency devaluation has become the norm for the world &apos;s major exporters - first the US , then Japan , and now Europe . 
If China joined this race to the bottom , others would be tempted to escalate their actions and world financial markets would be subject to yet another source of serious instability . 
Just as China resisted the temptation of renminbi depreciation during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 - a decision that may have played a pivotal role in arresting regional contagion - it must stay the course today . 
That is all the more important in a disorderly climate of QE , where China &apos;s role as a currency anchor may take on even greater importance than it did in the late 1990s . 
Strategy is China &apos;s greatest strength . 
Time and again , Chinese officials have successfully coped with unexpected developments , without losing sight of their long-term strategic objectives . 
They should work to uphold that record , using the strong renminbi as an incentive to redouble efforts at reform and rebalancing , rather than as an excuse to backtrack . 
This is no time for China to flinch .
