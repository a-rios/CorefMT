Youth Without Work 
ROME - Among the many devastating effects of the current global financial crisis , one of the most pernicious in the developed world is the upward trajectory of the unemployment rate for youth , which rose by six percentage points in the OECD area from 2007 to 2009 , with Spain experiencing an alarming 42 % youth unemployment rate in 2010 . 
When young people cease to be the engine of an economy , long-run economic growth is endangered , and social unrest becomes a real threat to the democratic political order . 
In this sense , Italy represents an extreme case , since even highly skilled young workers , though usually over the age threshold of the youth-unemployment rate ( 29.5 % in the country ) , are being marginalized . 
Nevertheless , understanding this phenomenon and its political consequences sheds light on what other OECD countries might face in the near future . 
As one of the fastest aging societies in the world , with an economy and a political system inaccessible to its young people , Italy has all the makings of a gerontocracy . 
According to a study by LUISS University , half of the country &apos;s top business leaders and political officials are 60 or older . 
Moreover , the national statistical institute , ISTAT , points out that in 2009 about 60 % of people aged 18-34 ( and 30 % among people aged 30-34 ) were living with their parents as a result of their inability to support themselves . 
Two million in the same age range were classified as NEETS ( not in employment , education , or training ) . 
The system is slowly cracking , and Italian youth risk becoming the first generation in modern history that is worse off than its predecessors . 
It comes as no surprise that 79 % of the unemployment generated by the financial crisis is attributable to young , precarious workers . 
Even if the country is still far from the radical impulses of &quot; 1968 , &quot; Italy &apos;s lockout of its young people sets the stage for a generational revolt . 
Over the last 30 years , Italy has fallen into an old-age trap - a self-reinforcing mechanism whereby rent-seekers ( old people ) have used control of the political system to prevent new generations ( the most dynamic and innovative part of the population ) from getting a slice of the pie . 
Young people used to believe that , once old and with access to power , their own welfare would be at least as high as that of previous generations . 
Instead , the gerontocracy has simply realized older generations &quot; dreams of equity and social security at the expense of today &apos;s youth , who have been shouldered with a crushing burden of public debt . 
Lavish favors , demographic trends , and the absence of serious family policies guaranteed the demise of the social contract now under threat . 
First , high levels of debt will limit both welfare benefits and future governments &quot; ability to swap favors for votes . 
Second , globalization , a low-quality educational system , and weak institutions generate uncertainty and insecurity for young people , thereby threatening Italy &apos;s growth prospects - and thus the prospect that future generations will be compensated in old age for a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice . 
The process of escaping the old-age trap , and allowing younger generations to assume their key role in the economy , can be either gradual and relatively smooth , or abrupt and relatively traumatic . 
In the former case , politicians implement structural reforms aimed at redistributing costs and benefits among generations . 
In the latter case , we face an inter-generational clash . 
This situation resembles that of declining organizations , as described in Albert O. Hirschman &apos;s seminal treatise Exit , Voice , and Loyalty . 
When the quality of an institution or a political system decreases , its members can withdraw ( &quot; exit &quot; ) , improve the situation through direct action ( &quot; voice &quot; ) , or passively accept the decline in conditions ( &quot; loyalty &quot; ) . 
&quot; Exit &quot; and &quot; loyalty &quot; dominate in Italy . 
The former can be physical ( according to some studies , Italy is the only European country experiencing a &quot; brain drain &quot; rather than a &quot; brain exchange &quot; ) or silent ( for example , low voter turnout ) . 
But the difficulty of critical thought in an environment of low press freedom , together with intra-family wealth transfers to young people , keep the majority loyal to the system . 
&quot; Voice &quot; is almost absent in Italy , as dissatisfaction , however widespread , remains far from sufficient to give rise to an organized protest movement . 
Instead , &quot; Exit &quot; and &quot; loyalty &quot; delay the collective consciousness-raising that Italy needs in order to ensure a gradual escape from the old-age trap . 
Once all citizens are aware of the situation , it will be too late : the system will have collapsed , and &quot; voice &quot; will become so strong that inter-generational conflict will be unavoidable . 
Will that conflict be peaceful or violent ? 
In the former case , a youth party might use democratic institutions to press for sharp cuts in old people &apos;s benefits . 
In the latter case , violent protests could lead to a revolutionary wave similar to 1968 . 
Then , protesters wanted to free disadvantaged classes from the oppression of capitalism ; nowadays , they would seek to free disadvantaged generations from the fetters of gerontocracy . 
Unfortunately , demographic trends make the latter scenario more likely , since young people will be a minority , unable to win power through democratic channels . 
Only by adopting serious family policies , or by enfranchising new immigrants , who are usually quite young , would a democratic economic transition be more likely . 
Leaders of OECD countries should look at Italy and recognize the dangers emerging from their young people who are being left behind . 
In Italy itself , it is high time that older generations start acting with wisdom .
