Europe &apos;s Instability Mechanism 
MUNICH - By 2010 , Europe was to be &quot; the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society in the world . &quot; 
This was the official proclamation in 2000 of the European Commission in the so-called Lisbon Agenda . 
Now a decade has passed since that bold pledge , and it is official : Europe is the world &apos;s growth laggard rather than its champion . 
While current EU members grew by 14 % over the last ten years , North America grew by 18 % , Latin America by 39 % , Africa by 63 % , the Middle East by 60 % , Russia by 59 % , Singapore , South Korea , Indonesia , and Taiwan by 52 % , India by 104 % , and China by 171 % . 
The Europeans wanted to achieve their goal through , among other means , further environmental protection and more social cohesion - desirable aims , but certainly not growth strategies . 
The Lisbon Agenda turned out to be a joke . 
The European Stability and Growth Pact of 1995 has fared no better . 
EU countries agreed to limit their fiscal deficits to 3 % of GDP to ensure debt discipline under the euro , so that no country could use the new currency to take its neighbors hostage and force them into bailout operations . 
In fact , the EU countries exceeded the 3 % limit 97 times . 
In 29 of these cases , the breaches were permissible under the Pact &apos;s original formulation , because the countries were in recession . 
In the remaining 68 cases , however , deficits above 3 % of GDP were clear violations of the Pact , and the European Council of Finance Ministers ( Ecofin ) should have imposed sanctions . 
Yet not a single country was ever penalized . 
The political debt constraints that the eurozone &apos;s members had self-imposed were never taken seriously after that , because the sinners and the judges were one and the same . 
A subject worthy of Kafka and Moli√®re . 
Indeed , this year , two countries , Greece and Ireland , were bailed out by the rest of the EU , even though Article 125 of the consolidated EU treaty stipulates that no member state is to stand in for the debt of another , a guarantee that Germany required as a pre-condition for giving up its beloved Deutschmark . 
That doctrine of hard discipline was abolished in a coup in May 2010 , when it was claimed that the world would collapse unless Germany opened its purse . 
It is emblematic of the laxity with which the Stability and Growth Pact was pursued that Greece was able to join the euro through plain fraud , claiming that its deficit ratio was below the 3 % -of-GDP threshold when it was , in fact , far above it . 
In view of Greece &apos;s deceptive behavior , Eurostat , the EU &apos;s statistical agency , declared that its Greek counterpart and the supreme Greek supervisory authority had &quot; deliberately falsified &quot; the data . 
But no matter , Greece was already in - and willing and able to take its fellow EU members hostage . 
Germany has now opened its purse , acting as Greece &apos;s prime rescuer . 
Moreover , at their pre-Christmas summit , European heads of state agreed to amend the EU treaty by legitimizing the European Financial Stability Mechanism , now called the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , and making it a permanent institution . 
Once back home , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who had insisted for months that the facility had to be terminated , celebrated this as a victory over the rest of Europe . 
In fact , it was largely a necessary concession to Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , which had argued that the bailout measures lacked a proper legal basis . 
The participation of creditor banks , which had long been the conditio sine qua non for Merkel , was downgraded to optional status . 
The European Central Bank also lost its credibility . 
A year ago , it vowed to stop accepting BBB- rated government securities as collateral for its monetary operations . 
But that , too , went out the window in May , when it started buying even Greek junk bonds . 
Meanwhile , the ECB has announced that it will have to double its equity capital . 
The EU &apos;s maneuvers may stabilize Europe in the short run and help it to withstand better the current speculative attacks on some of the euro countries &quot; government bonds , but they risk long-term destabilization . 
While financial contagion today is limited to bank interaction , the EU &apos;s measures have broadened the channels for contagion to include government budgets . 
Indeed , the first step toward a potential chain of government insolvencies in Europe has been taken . 
The risk may be limited today , but it will become larger should the new ESM become full-coverage insurance against insolvency with no burden-sharing by creditors . 
In view of the foreseeable demographic risks from pension entitlements , a time bomb may now have been set ticking . 
When politicians try to fight the iron laws of economics , they lose . 
This time is no different . 
But politicians are averse to academic advice . 
All too often , they prefer bad jokes - until the last laugh is on them .
