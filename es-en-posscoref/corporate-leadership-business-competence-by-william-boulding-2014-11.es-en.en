Redefining Business Competence 
DURHAM , NORTH CAROLINA - One of the most interesting parts of my job as a business school dean is engaging in candid conversations with leaders across industries . 
A few years ago , I started hearing a troubling refrain : business leaders are feeling the type of public disdain once reserved for politicians . 
The problem is one of trust - or lack thereof . 
The 2014 Edelman Trust Barometer reveals that less than one-fifth of the global public believes that business and government officials will tell the truth when confronted with a difficult issue . 
That public sentiment is affecting business worldwide . 
The Duke University CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey found that nearly 60 % of chief financial officers in the United States believe that a lack of public trust has harmed the business environment . 
Those percentages are even higher in other parts of the world . 
Given the constant stream of security and data breaches and allegations of financial manipulation involving some of the world &apos;s most respected banks , who can blame the public for feeling this way ? 
Now , more than ever , we need leaders who can regain the public &apos;s trust . 
Traditionally , society has measured business competence by a person &apos;s intellectual ability to examine problems broadly and deeply . 
But , in order to seize global opportunities today , we need to emphasize a new dimension : the ability to create a shared set of values and foster a culture that embraces those beliefs . 
Doing so requires taking three , sometimes uncomfortable , steps . 
First , business leaders must overcome their fear of learning from others . 
That sounds simple , but how many executives can admit that they don &apos;t know everything or that they aren &apos;t the smartest person in the room ? 
Many business leaders talk a good game about diversity , but surround themselves with people who are just like them . 
Working closely with others who think differently can be scary and frustrating . 
But the best leaders have the courage to encourage authenticity in both themselves and others . 
Second , embrace the ambition of others . 
The downfall of many business leaders in recent years has been greed and selfish ambition . 
Great leaders are other-directed instead of self-focused . 
They adopt a &quot; your success is my success &quot; mentality . 
This attitude goes a long way toward developing trust among team members and helps foster strong commitment to a common vision . 
It also requires leaders to trust others that they will not abuse the faith placed in them . 
Finally , business leaders must value collaboration - and mean it . 
Leaders who overcome fear and frustration , embrace the ambition of others , and possess a strong character and sense of purpose are likely to build diverse teams whose members share an identity and common goals but still represent themselves authentically . 
Research has shown that such teams outperform others , which means that this approach can lead to a tremendous competitive advantage . 
In short , collaboration not only matters ; it wins . 
Imagine the immense potential we would have to solve some of the world &apos;s toughest challenges if business leaders adopted this strategy . 
Consider the global threat posed by Ebola . 
Efforts are underway to research , manufacture , and distribute experimental drugs that could treat the disease . 
The New York Times reported last month that United States officials are planning to scale up the production of one experimental drug , but it is still not likely to meet demand . 
If some of the brightest minds in business and health care had found a way to encourage the production of an Ebola drug before the outbreak , thousands of lives might have been saved . 
The type of leadership that I am advocating poses no threat to a company &apos;s bottom line . 
On the contrary , it is the starting point for scaling a business to its full potential . 
As former Procter 
Gamble CEO and current US Secretary of Veterans Affairs Bob McDonald is fond of saying , leaders have a responsibility to make sure that their organization can &quot; do well and do good . &quot; 
Business can be the common thread that weaves positive change throughout the world . 
A new standard for business competence that incorporates more than the bottom line will go a long way toward winning back the public &apos;s trust .
