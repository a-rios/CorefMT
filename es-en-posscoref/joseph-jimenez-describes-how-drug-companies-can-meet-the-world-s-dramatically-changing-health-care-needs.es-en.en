Rethinking Pharmaceutical Business Models 
ZURICH - The world &apos;s health needs are changing dramatically . 
Demographic trends , shifting patterns of disease , and strained public funding are placing new burdens on health-care systems . 
For developed and developing countries alike , the new demands cannot be met if health care continues to operate in the same way . 
What is required are new business models that spread risks , take a broader view of health , and address the needs of the world &apos;s poorest people . 
Demographic changes will present significant challenges for countries &quot; long-term health planning . 
By 2050 , the number of people worldwide who are 60 or older will exceed the number of children under 15 . 
Moreover , an additional three billion people will join the global middle class over the next two decades , altering the types of health issues that countries will face , and the way health care is financed . 
At the same time , non-communicable diseases , such as cancer , heart disease , and diabetes , are rising , while previously deadly conditions , such as HIV / AIDS , are now more treatable and have been deemed chronic diseases . 
Keeping up with these changes would be difficult in the best of times . 
But a stagnant global economy is straining health-care budgets to the breaking point . 
Governments , insurers , and other health-care payers are becoming ever more concerned about getting value for money . 
In response , pharmaceutical companies and policymakers are looking for innovative ways to reduce these pressures , not just by developing new drugs , but also by rethinking how the industry operates . 
My company , for one , has tested three business models that have shown encouraging results . 
One involves risk sharing , in which the user pays for the drug only if his treatment turns out to be successful . 
If it is not , the pharmaceutical company refunds the cost . 
We have used risk-sharing programs in Germany , where we cooperate with two major payers on the pricing for Aclasta , an osteoporosis treatment . 
If a patient suffers a bone fracture after treatment ( signifying that the drug has not worked ) , Novartis repays the cost . 
The payer benefits from this system , because risk sharing minimizes the cost of failure . 
The pharmaceutical firm gains as well , because the effective guarantee underpins public confidence in its products . 
The risk-sharing model has limitations , though . 
Some payers find that the system is too complex , especially when trying to define a successful outcome , and that they must wait too long for refunds . 
Nevertheless , risk sharing is a good starting point from which to develop a fairer and more efficient business model - and one that can be refined or simplified over time . 
A second business model brings patients , payers , and health-care professionals together to provide an integrated program to complement treatment for a specific illness . 
In Brazil , for example , our Vale Mais Sa√∫de program uses this approach to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , a potentially fatal lung condition forecast to be the world &apos;s third biggest killer by 2030 . 
In addition to providing Onbrez Breezhaler , a daily treatment to improve lung function in COPD patients , the program provides a comprehensive treatment package covering all symptoms . 
Patients can receive discounted flu vaccines , nicotine replacement therapies , help in enrolling in pulmonary rehabilitation sessions , and health information sent to their homes . 
These interventions alleviate symptoms , prevent other illnesses from exacerbating them , and help patients continue their normal daily activities . 
But it is in the poorest countries with the least developed health-care systems and weakest infrastructure that new business models are needed the most . 
In the past , corporate philanthropy has gone some way to help , but such an approach is neither sustainable nor scalable . 
If companies are to make a significant difference , they must find ways to work with existing health-care systems over the long term . 
One way to do this is through social ventures . 
For example , our Arogya Parivar ( or &quot; Healthy Family &quot; ) program reaches millions of India &apos;s poorest citizens . 
It is organized around four principles : awareness , acceptability , availability , and adaptability . 
Arogya Parivar raises general public awareness of health issues by training educators to teach disease prevention and treatment in villages , helping some 2.5 million rural inhabitants in 2012 alone . 
The program reaches more than 45,000 local doctors through a network of 90 medical distributors , ensuring that medicines are available in 28,000 of India &apos;s remotest pharmacies . 
To ensure affordability , especially to those on a daily wage , we sell smaller , over-the-counter doses . 
The program is also flexible , adapting medicines , packaging , and training according to the different health and cultural needs of India &apos;s diverse communities . 
These three examples demonstrate that , with innovative thinking , we can meet the world &apos;s changing health needs . 
Pharmaceutical companies are doing what they can - but they need help . 
Most important , governments , payers , and physicians must come together to test , support , and roll out the best and most cost-effective ideas . 
Only then can we improve the health of all people , rich and poor alike , regardless of where they live .
