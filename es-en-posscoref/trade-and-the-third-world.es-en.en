Trade and the Third World 
Hypocrisy and trade-talk go together , as America &apos;s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel shows . 
Although that action is expected to be judged illegal by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , developing countries remain wary . 
Historically , they ( India prominent among them ) argued that the WTO is a tool of rich countries and so resisted much of what it sought to do . 
Indeed , before the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha earlier this year , India &apos;s line was to oppose the launch of a new trade round , resist further trade liberalization in industrial goods , and oppose the use of trade sanctions to punish countries that fail to meet minimal labor standards . 
The perception that the WTO is largely an instrument of the powerful , industrialized nations is broadly correct . 
To oppose it on all fronts , however , is wrong . 
A more sophisticated approach towards the WTO ( and the North in general ) is needed . 
The WTO says that it is a democratic organization run on the principle of one country , one vote . 
Anybody who follows the WTO knows that rich countries get around this &apos; nuisance &apos; democratic formality by lobbying behind the scenes to fix the agenda in advance . 
Despite this , constant opposition to the WTO is self-defeating . 
As the dispute about America &apos;s new steel tariffs illustrates , in today &apos;s globalized world a centralized trade ombudsman is vital . 
Eliminating the WTO would be like trying to run a modern society without a law court . 
While law courts are typically more lenient towards the rich and powerful , it is still better to have them than not . 
Chronic opposition also reveals a lack of self-confidence of the sort when you cannot decide what is good for yourself but , instead , demand the opposite of what your trading partners want in the belief that what is good for them must be bad for you . 
This implies a zero-sum view of global economics that is false . 
In economic transactions there are many instances where everyone gains or everyone loses . 
So consider in this light India &apos;s three demands . 
It is right for India to have opposed injecting international labor standards into the WTO agenda , but it is wrong that India strongly opposed a new trade round . 
India &apos;s average tariff rate is around 30 % . 
While much lower than previously , it is higher than in most industrialized nations . 
But India independently decided to lower tariffs over the next three years . 
A global program to lower tariffs means that India would only be asked to do what it planned to do anyway . 
As others would have to lower their tariffs , India &apos;s access to other markets would increase . 
Nowadays , economic policy is so complex that it is not always clear what is good for a nation and what is not . 
Last December , there was furor in India when a dispute settlement panel of the WTO ruled against India &apos;s practice of ( 1 ) forcing automobile manufacturers in India to buy a certain proportion of parts from Indian producers , and ( 2 ) requiring automotive manufacturers who need to import parts and kits to export goods worth the same value . 
If we reflect on these conditions , it is not at all clear that these policies are good for India . 
Forcibly creating a market for Indian automobile parts eases pressure on these manufacturers to improve quality . 
Forcing Indian cars to use such parts handicaps Indian cars from matching international quality . 
Similarly , coercing companies into matching every use of foreign exchange by producing foreign exchange destroys an essential feature of specialized production . 
Hence , the WTO ruling , at least in this case , may be a blessing in disguise . 
At times it is useful to be compelled to do what you may not have the will to do on your own . 
India and other emerging economies must engage with the WTO , keeping pressure on it to give more voice to developing countries . 
There are , for example , 18 African countries without any representation in the WTO &apos;s office in Geneva . 
What benefit can they expect from the WTO ? 
When there is a WTO legal tussle and big countries bring in expensive lawyers to argue their case , what chance do poor countries have ? 
As a democratic country with considerable expertise in economics and law , India should fight for better representation throughout the WTO . 
Once that is achieved , it will be easier to entrust the WTO with tasks , such as assuring minimal labor standards that appear contentious today . 
But a rule to remember is that even if this is not achieved , India and countries like it will gain more by being active participants in WTO deliberations than by withdrawing or being habitual naysayers . 
Postscript : Fortunately , not all North-South engagements are politically charged . 
Some years ago I left Delhi to lecture in a city in the developing world . 
I told my host that I was planning to explore his city on foot . 
With the hospitality that comes so spontaneously to &quot; Third Worlders , &quot; he said he could not allow it , rang the bell on his desk , and asked his assistant to find out if the &quot; Fertility car &quot; was available . 
I was intrigued and , while the assistant was away on his errand , through deft questioning discerned the etymology of the &quot; Fertility car . &quot; 
The institute , it seems , had received money from a Northern nation for a project on fertility and some of the funds were used to buy a car , which was christened accordingly . 
Soon , the assistant reappeared , panting , to report that the Fertility car was unavailable . 
The next day , nursing a slight feeling of ambivalence I explored that beautiful city in &quot; Poverty , &quot; never finding out what view the Northern donor took of this excursion .
