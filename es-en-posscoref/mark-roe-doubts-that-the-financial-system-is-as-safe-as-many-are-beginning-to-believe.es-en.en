The Regulatory Confidence Cycle 
CAMBRIDGE - Late last month , the Federal Reserve released the transcripts of the Federal Open Markets Committee ( the Fed &apos;s monetary-policy-setting body ) meetings from the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis . 
Unfortunately , too many reports on the transcripts miss the big picture . 
Criticizing the Fed for underestimating the dangers from the underground rumblings that were about to explode makes it seem that particular players just got it wrong . 
In fact , underestimating financial risk is a general problem - the rule , not the exception . 
Even after the investment bank Bear Stearns failed in March 2008 , Fed leaders believed that the institutional structure was strong enough to prevent a crisis . 
New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner thought that banks had enough capital to withstand the potential losses . 
Likewise , Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn told the US Senate that losses in the mortgage market would not threaten banking viability . 
Tellingly , academic opinion was similar . 
Too big to fail was no longer a big problem , a prominent view had it , as the banking laws of the previous decade had laid it to rest . 
Even if some leaders failed to foresee the power of the coming explosion , they managed the aftermath as well as one could expect . 
Indeed , the transcripts themselves show that Fed leaders were worried about an economic downturn and were ready to employ their macroeconomic tools , but that they thought the banking system was well capitalized and could withstand more stress . 
So what can we learn from this episode ? 
When the economy is performing well and financial failures have been few and far between , regulators are lured into granting the regulated their requests to lower capital requirements , enter new business lines , and take on more risk . 
A crisis is hard to imagine , so it seems okay to relax the rules . 
Regulators see how well financial firms are doing , become convinced that they themselves are regulating effectively , that the regulated can at last run their banks well , and that policy tools can save the financial system and spare the real economy if a crisis unexpectedly occurs . 
They update their regulatory thinking with what they see , and what they see looks stable . 
Academics validate their judgment . 
Indeed , there is a cycle in regulatory confidence . 
Regulators react to an explosion by creating new rules . 
The economy recovers , the regulators conclude that they did their job well ( which they have ) , and the regulated then resist further tightening . 
The problem has been solved , the industry argues , and further regulatory tightening will harm the economy . 
As the recovery continues and the memory of the financial crisis grows faint , the appetite for regulatory change dissipates . 
Why fix something that is no longer broken ? 
We can already see the cycle repeating . 
After the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation was enacted in the US , and after financial firms &quot; capital requirements were raised and some of their riskiest activities limited , industry leaders announced that the battle had largely been won . 
The financial sector had been made safe for the twenty-first century . 
Further regulation would be punitive and ill-considered , for it would prevent banks from doing their job - lending to the real economy . 
Meanwhile , regulators will have reason to believe that they have achieved a new safety paradigm : tighter rules that prevent banks from failing , and new ways to resolve any banks that fall through the cracks and fail anyway . 
A half-dozen years after the financial crisis , regulators will find it discouraging to conclude anything other than that they have solved the problem or are close to doing so . 
Fatigued by years of effort and beset by criticism from the industry , regulators will ease up . 
And that is when things become dangerous . 
For example , because many view the Lehman Brothers collapse as sparking , or exacerbating , the financial crisis , much of the regulatory focus has been on developing the means to handle the failure of a similarly large financial firm . 
New regulatory authority from Congress has encouraged the view that regulators will soon be able to handle a Lehman-size failure smoothly . 
But , if regulators become too confident too soon , they could consider the financial system safe from collapse , just as many did in 2008 . 
Like generals fighting the last war , regulators , academics , and industry observers will be confident that regulators can handle and defuse another Lehman explosion before it happens . 
The financial industry itself will believe that finance has been made safe ; indeed , it has already started down this road . 
And fatigued regulators , eager to declare victory , may concur . 
If this cycle is even approximately right , regulatory fatigue from battling to make finance safer will soon turn into regulatory confidence that the last war has now been won . 
In a strong economy , finance will look stronger and existing regulation will appear to be effective . 
It is common for people to update their views of the world with what they have last seen ; if what they last see is a strong economy and a stable financial system , they will conclude that they have stabilized the system . 
The Fed &apos;s 2008 transcripts reveal that its leaders saw such a world . 
It will be easy to interpret future looming crises as minor road bumps that can be absorbed . 
The question is where and how .
