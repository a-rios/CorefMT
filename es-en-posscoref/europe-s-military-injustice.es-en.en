Europe &apos;s Military Injustice 
LONDON - The cost of sending troops and military hardware around the world to provide security when and where it is needed is causing major financial headaches across Europe . 
Indeed , Europe &apos;s finance ministries face a dilemma over how much of their stretched national budgets to allocate to the military ; and European defense officials must somehow ensure that precious funding is spent in the most efficient manner . 
The problem is acute in Britain , not only because of our current troop deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq , but also because of the unfair systems by which NATO-led missions and military operations under the European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) are financed . 
Under both systems , those who accept responsibility to take military action also take on the lion &apos;s share of the financial burden . 
It is time our collective security alliances overhauled these inequitable funding methods and made sure that all member states pay a proportionate price for global security . 
It is no secret that Britain &apos;s Ministry for Defense is facing a funding crisis . 
Despite British forces having been engaged in two major military operations since 2003 , defense spending represents only 2.3 % of GDP - the lowest since the 1930 &quot; s . 
As a share of total government spending , defense expenditure has fallen from 7.8 % in 1998 to 6.1 % in 2006 . 
Owing to the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , any future British government will inherit a military that is overstretched , undermanned , and working with worn-out equipment . 
The unfunded liability associated with this will total billions of pounds . 
Better military and financial burden-sharing within both NATO and the ESDP would not only benefit the United Kingdom , but would also help to alleviate some of the pressure on other national defense budgets in Europe . 
We must take full advantage of our organized security structures to ensure that the global security burden is shared in a fair and proportionate manner . 
To date , this has not happened . 
For NATO to work properly , its members must be prepared not only to supply troops and equipment for NATO-led military operations , but also to fund and sustain these operations until missions are completed . 
Instead , certain members now do a disproportionate amount of the fighting , funding , and dying . 
This is not sustainable . 
All NATO countries must understand that membership brings implicit and explicit responsibilities to ensure that their military forces have the capability to fight and win on the modern-day battlefield . 
They must recognize the need to create a sounder financial system for alliance operations . 
There is currently common funding for certain shared costs , such as headquarters , with contributions linked to the member states &quot; GDPs . 
But the amounts covered by common funding are only a small part of an operation &apos;s total cost . 
All other expenses &quot; lie where they fall &quot; : the more troops and equipment a country contributes to a mission , the more it ends up paying . 
The cost to the UK for its contribution to the NATO operation in Afghanistan , for example , totals Â£ 3.1 billion - a heavy burden on British taxpayers . 
Because of the expeditionary nature of today &apos;s military operations , that system is an anachronism . 
Yet fixing the problem is easier said than done . 
NATO has been trying for years - without success - to get its member states to spend the required 2 % of GDP on defense . 
Compliance would mean an estimated $ 67 billion increase in Alliance-wide defense spending , or roughly the equivalent of adding another British or French defense budget - no panacea , but very helpful nonetheless . 
Last April , the leader of the UK &apos;s opposition Conservative Party , David Cameron , explained why we should establish a real operational fund for NATO expeditionary missions , with every member state required to contribute . 
Doing so would provide some reimbursement to countries that currently carry an unduly large part of the burden . 
It would also offer potential funding to countries that might deploy forces but face short-term financial difficulties in meeting the cost . 
The new NATO operational fund would clearly be more equitable than today &apos;s system , which penalizes proactive member states and rewards members that prefer to do nothing . 
Why should the few carry the many ? 
Common security implies common commitment . 
Moreover , solving NATO &apos;s burden-sharing problem is not enough . 
The European Union &apos;s crisis management missions face similar issues when military forces are involved . 
EU civilian crisis management is funded directly from the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget . 
But , apart from the common costs of an operation ( usually less than 8 % of the total ) , the ESDP uses the same funding method as NATO , which means that the bulk of the money for both ESDP and NATO-led military operations comes out of the same defense pot in each member state . 
Interestingly , there was some discussion under the French presidency about reforming the so-called Athena Mechanism , which is the means used to determine the amount that each EU member state contributes to the common costs of a mission . 
Like the NATO common fund , EU contributions are largely based on GDP . 
The French also called for the &quot; costs lie where they fall &quot; concept to be abandoned in the name of financial solidarity . 
Any change made to the Athena Mechanism must include reforms to its rules and procedures . 
Currently , non-EU members of NATO that contribute troops to an operation cannot vote - or even be present at votes - when the Athena Special Committee sets the mission budget , even though their troops will fight and possibly die . 
This is discriminatory , undemocratic , and no way to treat important allies like Norway and Turkey . 
Collective security alliances are just that - collective . 
It is time that everyone contributed their fair share to the common good .
