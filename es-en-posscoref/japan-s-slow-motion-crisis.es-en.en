Japan &apos;s Slow-Motion Crisis 
TOKYO - If you listen to American , European , or even Chinese leaders , Japan is the economic future no one wants . 
In selling massive stimulus packages and bank bailouts , Western leaders told their people , &quot; We must do this or we will end up like Japan , mired in recession and deflation for a decade or more . &quot; 
Chinese leaders love pointing to Japan as the prime reason not to allow any significant appreciation of their conspicuously undervalued currency . 
&quot; Western leaders forced Japan to let its currency rise in the second half of the 1980 &quot; s , and look at the disaster that followed . &quot; 
Yes , nobody wants to be Japan , the fallen angel that went from one of the fastest growing economies in the world for more than three decades to one that has slowed to a crawl for the past 18 years . 
No one wants to live with the trauma of the deflation ( falling prices ) that Japan has repeatedly experienced . 
No one wants to navigate the precarious government-debt dynamic that Japan faces , with debt levels far above 100 % of GDP ( even if one factors in the Japanese government &apos;s vast holdings of foreign-exchange reserves . ) 
No one wants to go from being a world-beater to a poster child for economic stagnation . 
And yet , visitors to Tokyo today see prosperity everywhere . 
The shops and office buildings are bustling with activity . 
Restaurants are packed with people , dressed in better clothing that one typically sees in New York or Paris . 
After all , even after nearly two decades of &quot; recession , &quot; per-capita income in Japan is more than $ 40,000 ( at market exchange rates ) . 
Japan is still the third-largest economy in the world after the United States and China . 
Its unemployment rate remained low during most of its &quot; lost decade , &quot; and , although it has shot up more recently , it is still only 5 % . 
So what gives ? 
First , things look a lot grimmer when one gets two hours outside of Tokyo to places like Hokkaido . 
These poorer outlying regions are hugely dependent on public-works projects for employment . 
As the government &apos;s fiscal position has steadily weakened , the jobs have become far scarcer . 
True , there are beautifully paved roads all around , but they go nowhere . 
Old people have retreated to villages , many growing their own food , their children having long abandoned them for the cities . 
Even in Tokyo , the air of normalcy is misleading . 
Two decades ago , Japanese workers could expect to receive massive year-end bonuses , typically amounting to one-third of their salary or more . 
Now these have gradually shrunk to nothing . 
True , thanks to falling prices , the purchasing power of workers &quot; remaining income has held up , but it is still down by more than 10 % . 
There is far more job insecurity than ever before as firms increasingly offer temporary jobs in place of once-treasured &quot; lifetime employment . &quot; 
Although hardly in crisis ( yet ) , Japan &apos;s fiscal situation grows more alarming by the day . 
Until now , the government has been able to finance its vast debts locally , despite paying paltry interest rates even on longer-term borrowings . 
Remarkably , Japanese savers soak up some 95 % of their government &apos;s debt . 
Perhaps burned by the way stock prices and real estate collapsed when the 1980 &quot; s bubble burst , savers would rather go for what they view as safe bonds , especially as gently falling prices make the returns go farther than would be the case in a more normal inflation environment . 
Unfortunately , as well as Japan has held up until now , it still faces profound challenges . 
First and foremost , there is its ever-falling labor supply , owing to extraordinarily low birth rates and deep-seated resistance to foreign immigration . 
The country also needs to find ways to enhance the productivity of those workers it does have . 
Inefficiency in agriculture , retail , and government are legendary . 
Even at Japan &apos;s world-beating export firms , reluctance to confront the ingrained interests of the old-boy network has made it difficult to prune less profitable product lines - and the workers who make them . 
As the population ages and shrinks , more people will retire and start selling those government bonds that they are now lapping up . 
At some point , Japan will face its own Greek tragedy as the market charges sharply higher interest rates . 
The government will be forced to consider raising revenues sharply . 
The best guess is that Japan will raise its value-added tax , now only 5 % , far below European levels . 
But is it plausible to raise taxes in the face of such sustained low growth ? 
Investors who have bet against Japan in the past have been badly burned , grossly underestimating the Japanese people &apos;s remarkable flexibility and resilience . 
But the fiscal road ahead looks increasingly perilous , with political consensus fraying badly in recent years . 
In the end , are foreign leaders right to scare their people with tales of Japan ? 
Certainly , the hyperbole is overblown ; the Chinese , especially , should be so lucky . 
But nor should apologists for deficits point to Japan as reason to be calm about outsized stimulus packages . 
Japan &apos;s ability to trudge on in the face of huge adversity is admirable , but the risks of crisis ahead are surely greater than bond markets seem to recognize .
