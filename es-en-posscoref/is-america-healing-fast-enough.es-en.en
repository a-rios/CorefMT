Is America Healing Fast Enough ? 
NEWPORT BEACH - Six internal factors suggest that the United States &quot; economy is slowly healing . 
For some observers , these factors were deemed sufficient to form the critical mass needed to propel the economy into escape velocity . 
While I hoped that they might be proven right , the recent stream of weak economic data , including May &apos;s timid net job creation of only 69,000 , confirmed my doubts . 
With this and other elements of a disheartening employment report now suddenly raising widespread worries about the underlying health and durability of America &apos;s recovery , it is important to understand the positive factors and why they are not enough as yet . 
For starters , large US multinational companies are as healthy as I have ever seen them . 
Their cash balances are extremely high , interest payments on debt are low , and principal obligations have been termed out . 
Many of them are successfully tapping into buoyant demand in emerging economies , generating significant free cash flow . 
Company cash is not the only source of considerable spending power waiting on the sidelines . 
Rich households also hold significant resources that could be deployed in support of both consumption and investment . 
The third and fourth positive factors relate to housing and the labor market . 
But recent data support the view that the housing sector could be in the process of establishing a bottom , albeit an elongated one . 
Meanwhile , job growth , while anemic , has nonetheless been consistently positive since September 2010 . 
Then there is the US Federal Reserve Board . 
Indeed , if the Fed makes an inadvertent mistake ( the likelihood of this is considerable , given the country &apos;s complex situation and the &quot; unusually uncertain &quot; outlook ) , it is more likely to err on the side of staying accommodative for too long , rather than tightening monetary policy prematurely . 
Finally , with the November elections in sight and subsequently out of the way , some believe that politicians in Washington might finally be in a better position to agree to much-needed grand policy bargains . 
In addition to removing the damaging specter of the fiscal cliff - a potentially disruptive economic hindrance equivalent to some 4 % of GDP , in the form of excessively blunt spending cuts and across-the-board tax increases - greater political effectiveness would serve to remove other uncertainties that inhibit certain economic activities . 
Each of these six factors suggests actual and potential economic healing . 
So , not surprisingly , they have provoked excitement in some circles that the US may finally be poised to leave behind the depressing trio of unusually sluggish growth , persistently high unemployment , and high and growing inequality . 
The problem is that these factors , both individually and in combination , are unlikely to be a game-changer , for four reasons : 
路 
The economic and financial headwinds from outside the US are strong and gusting , owing largely to the ever-worsening European crisis , which is now entering an even more disruptive and unpredictable phase as depositors in some countries step up their withdrawals from local banks . 
But it also reflects the beginning of a growth slowdown in the major emerging countries , including Brazil , China , India , and Russia . 
路 
Too many sectors of the US economy have not completed their balance-sheet rehabilitation process . 
This is true for the banking system , which has not de-leveraged to the satisfaction of either regulators or the markets , thus limiting the scope for credit growth . 
It is also true for many households . 
Indeed , with the average household savings rate having dropped recently to below 4 % , too many families are in the process of exhausting their cushions of emergency cash , if they have not done so already . 
路 
The unusual monetary-policy activism of the last few years risks causing collateral damage and producing unintended consequences . 
While no individual issue is overwhelming yet , together they could serve to dampen economic activity and the proper functioning of markets . 
Recall that the Fed &apos;s policy bet was that these &quot; costs and risks , &quot; to use Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s phrase , would be more than offset by the improvement in the overall economic situation . 
But this generalized benefit has failed to materialize . 
路 
Perhaps most importantly , repeated delays in removing the persistent impediments to growth and jobs means that some of them are becoming stubbornly embedded in the structure of the US economy - thus draining its dynamism and reducing its responsiveness . 
For example , with long-term joblessness at 5.4 million and the average duration of unemployment at 2.5 times the historical norm , workers are less able to regain productive employment quickly at anywhere near their previous wages and salaries . 
Similarly , the alarmingly high level of youth joblessness increases the risk of relatively new entrants into the labor force becoming unemployable . 
The bottom line is unfortunate , but it must be acknowledged . 
While the US economy is gradually healing , a lot more needs to happen - indeed , urgently - to restore its traditional vigor and vitality . 
Most important , robust recovery requires a degree of seriousness and constructive collaboration in Washington that seems elusive today . 
Unless and until this cooperation materializes , the hope of achieving economic escape velocity will remain just that - a hope . 
And , rather than surging forward , the US economy , regrettably and exasperatingly , will remain captive to unusual sluggishness , while its vulnerability to the ill winds blowing from the rest of the world will only increase .
