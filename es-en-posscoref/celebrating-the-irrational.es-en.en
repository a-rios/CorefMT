Celebrating the Irrational 
Three cheers for the new Nobel laureates in economics : Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University , and Vernon Smith of George Mason University in Virginia . 
Like many Nobel prizes , these awards recognize not only the seminal work undertaken by Kahneman and Smith , but also the schools of thought they help to lead . 
Kahneman , a psychologist , has demonstrated how individuals systematically behave in ways less rational than orthodox economists believe they do . 
His research shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently than standard economic theories predict , but that they do so regularly , systematically , and in ways that can be understood and interpreted through alternative hypotheses , competing with those utilized by orthodox economists . 
To most market participants - and indeed , ordinary observers  -  this does not seem like big news . 
Wall Street brokers who peddled stocks they knew to be garbage exploited the irrationality that Kahneman and Smith exposed . 
Much of the mania that led to the bubble economy was based on exploiting investor psychology . 
In fact , this irrationality is no news to the economics profession either . 
John Maynard Keynes long ago described the stock market as based not on rational individuals struggling to uncover market fundamentals , but as a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who guesses best what the judges will say . 
This year &apos;s Nobel prize celebrates a critique of simplistic market economics , just as last year &apos;s award ( of which I was one of the three winners ) did . 
Last year &apos;s laureates emphasized that different market participants have different ( and imperfect ) information , and these asymmetries in information have profound impact on how an economy functions . 
In particular , last year &apos;s laureates implied that markets were not , in general , efficient ; that there was an important role for government to play . 
Adam Smith &apos;s invisible hand  -  the idea that free markets lead to efficiency as if by an invisible hand  -  is invisible at least in part because it is not there . 
This , too , is not news to those who work day after day in the market ( and make their fortunes by taking advantage of and overcoming asymmetries in information ) . 
For more than twenty years economists were enthralled to so called &quot; rational expectations &quot; models which assumed that all participants have the same ( if not perfect ) information and act perfectly rationally , that markets are perfectly efficient , that unemployment never exists ( except when caused by greedy unions or government minimum wages ) , and where there is never any credit rationing . 
That such models prevailed , especially in America &apos;s graduate schools , despite evidence to the contrary bears testimony to a triumph of ideology over science . 
Unfortunately , students of these graduate programs now act as policymakers in many countries , and are trying to implement programs based on the ideas that have come to be called market fundamentalism . 
Let me be clear : the rational expectations models made an important contribution to economics ; the rigor which its supporters imposed on economic thinking helped expose the weaknesses many underlying hypotheses . 
Good science recognizes its limitations , but the prophets of rational expectations have usually shown no such modesty . 
Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics , the idea that one could test many economic propositions in laboratory settings . 
One reason that economics is such a difficult subject , and why there are so many disagreements among economists , is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments . 
Nature throws up natural experiments , but in most circumstances , so many things change so rapidly that it is often difficult to untangle what caused what . 
In principle , in a laboratory , we can conduct controlled experiments , and therefore make more reliable inferences . 
Critics of experimental economics worry that subjects bring to experimental situations modes of thought determined outside of the experiment , and thus that the experiments are not as clean and the inferences not as clear cut as in the physical sciences . 
Nonetheless , economic experiments provide insights into a number of important issues , such as the improved design of auctions . 
Most importantly , the irrationality of market participants , which was the focus of Kahneman &apos;s work , has been verified repeatedly in laboratory contexts . 
Among the more amusing results that have come out of experimental economics are those concerning altruism and selfishness . 
It appears ( at least in experimental situations ) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists have hypothesized - except for one group - the economists themselves . 
Is it because economics as a discipline attracts individuals who are by nature more selfish or is it because economics helps shape individuals , making them more selfish ? 
The answer , almost certainly , is a little bit of both . 
Presumably , future experimental research will help resolve the question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses . 
The Nobel Prize signifies how important it is to study people and economies as they are , not as we want them to be . 
Only by understanding better actual human behavior can we hope to design policies that will make our economies work better as well .
