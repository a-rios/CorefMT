The Digital Transformation of Europe 
SAN JOSE - Europe is on the cusp of an unprecedented technological transformation . 
I call it the Internet of Everything : the penetration of the World Wide Web into the everyday aspects of our lives . 
Wearable technology will tell us how well we are sleeping and whether we need to exercise . 
Sensors in the street will help us avoid traffic jams and find parking . 
Telemedicine applications will allow physicians to treat patients who are hundreds of miles away . 
This massive transition will transform how citizens interact with their governments , revolutionize entire industries , and change the way we engage with one another . 
In Europe , the Internet of Everything is emerging as the single most promising way to revive a moribund economy and tackle the continent &apos;s stubborn unemployment problem , with companies , cities , and even countries positioning themselves as leaders in innovation , growth , and the creation of jobs . 
The most recent example is France . 
Last month , Prime Minister Manuel Valls and I announced an ambitious partnership to promote a digital transformation of the entire country . 
The collaboration , which includes a $ 100 million investment from Cisco in French startups , could transform energy management , health care , and education - boosting France &apos;s economic competitiveness , job creation , dynamism , and growth in the process . 
France &apos;s program is a major step toward a digital Europe , following German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Industrie 4.0 initiative and the United Kingdom &apos;s planned expansion of innovation centers to foster technological breakthroughs and pioneer solutions in energy , transport , health care , and education . 
Cities too are embracing digitization . 
Barcelona has installed in-ground parking sensors and launched connected public transportation as part of its Smart City strategy . 
Nice has constructed a &quot; connected boulevard , &quot; including smart lighting and environmental monitoring . 
And the Port of Hamburg has a digital system to reduce water , rail , and ground traffic congestion . 
Projects like these are being replicated across the continent , generating billions of dollars in value in terms of reduced costs , productivity gains , and increased revenues . 
As a result , Europe &apos;s leaders see not only opportunities for growth , but also the need to avoid being left behind . 
To create a truly digital Europe will require a foundation of high-speed , high-quality broadband , both wired and wireless . 
As part of Europe &apos;s Digital Agenda , policymakers have set out to connect 50 % of European households to superfast broadband ( 100 mbps or greater ) by 2020 . 
They also aim to connect all residences to broadband ( at least 30 mbps ) by this time . 
These targets should be fully embraced , and policymakers should continue to encourage major investments in broadband , as well as in the infrastructure needed to support the wireless devices in which we have all come to depend . 
Of course , Europe will also have to encourage entrepreneurship , which requires fostering a culture of risk-taking , facilitating access to venture capital , and investing in strong educational institutions . 
Many countries are doing just that , implying that the next game-changing technology may not come from Silicon Valley ; it could just as easily be developed in a lab in Paris , London , or Berlin . 
Over the longer term , Europe will need a workforce trained for careers in the new digitized economy . 
It is estimated that Europe will have an e-skills gap that , if filled , could lead to 850,000 potential jobs in 2015 , rising to twice that by 2020 . 
On a continent where youth unemployment exceeds 50 % in some countries , there should be no problem finding young and eager people able to do these jobs , provided they receive the proper training . 
This gap cannot be closed overnight , but countries that do nothing to overcome it could very well fall behind . 
Widening the talent pipeline sufficiently will require a generational commitment to teaching math and science , providing technical training , and mentoring young people of all backgrounds so they understand the full range of possibilities that a career in technology affords . 
As Europe continues down the road of digital transformation , the possibilities for growth are immediate and significant . 
The continent is already the world &apos;s largest economic bloc , with a GDP of more than â‚¬ 14 trillion ( $ 15.2 trillion ) in 2014 . 
But its growth has been waning . 
The European Commission estimates - conservatively , in my opinion - that the digital revolution could spur an &quot; additional 2.1 % of GDP growth over the baseline . &quot; 
On the jobs front , the Internet of Everything will be a key driver of employment . 
Advances in cloud computing alone are expected to create 2.5 million additional jobs in Europe by 2020 . 
The digital transformation will bring opportunities and create new types of jobs : systems developers , transportation network engineers , medical device consultants , data analysts , electrical engineers for smart grids , and many more . 
As Europe charts its economic course for the next decade , its leaders must ensure that digital transformation forms the foundation of their strategy . 
This will allow them to create a Europe that is stronger , faster , more dynamic - and more digital .
