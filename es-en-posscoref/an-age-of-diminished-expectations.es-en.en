An Age of Diminished Expectations ? 
CAMBRIDGE - As the United States and European economies continue to struggle , there is rising concern that they face a Japanese-style &quot; lost decade . &quot; 
Unfortunately , far too much discussion has centered on what governments can do to stimulate demand through budget deficits and monetary policy . 
These are key issues in the short term , but , as every economist knows , long-run economic growth is determined mainly by improving productivity . 
There is no doubt that Japan &apos;s massive 1992 financial crisis was a hammer blow , from which it has yet to recover , and the parallels with the US and Europe today are worrisome . 
Both seem set for a long period of slow credit growth , owing both to necessary stricter financial regulation and to the fact that their economies remain significantly over-leveraged . 
There are no simple shortcuts in the healing process . 
Yet , in assessing the Japanese experience and its relevance today , it is important to recognize that Japan &apos;s fall to earth was due not only to its financial crisis . 
Japan also suffered a number of severe productivity shocks , which had much to do with its longer-term problems . 
Even if Japan had never experienced a real-estate and stock-market bubble , the meteoric rise of its giant neighbor China would have been a huge challenge . 
At the dawn of the 1990 &quot; s , Japan &apos;s dominance in export markets worldwide had already been dented somewhat by the rise of its smaller Asian neighbors , including Malaysia , Korea , Thailand , and Singapore . 
Moreover , even if it never had a financial crisis , Japan would have been plagued by adverse demographics , as its population is both aging and shrinking . 
Last but not least , Japan &apos;s hyper-growth years were built on a phenomenal rate of investment . 
In principle , with a healthier financial system , Japan &apos;s economy would have had more flexibility to meet these challenges to its productivity growth . 
As is usually the case , financial crisis amplified other causes of economic meltdown , rather than igniting it directly . 
The US Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s is another case in point . 
Again , a great deal of attention has been lavished on the ebbs and flow of fiscal and monetary policy . 
But New Deal economic policies , by expanding the role of the state in an often chaotic and unpredictable fashion , probably also played a role in at least temporarily impeding productivity growth . 
The US today seems to be moving towards a gentler and more European-style state , with higher taxes and possibly greater regulation . 
Supporters of the US administration might fairly argue that it is undertaking long-deferred maintenance on issues such as income inequality . 
But if the US does experience slow growth over the next decade , can it all be blamed on the financial crisis ? 
Likewise , Europe &apos;s latest existential identity crisis is again creating a great deal of policy uncertainty and unpredictability . 
In Europe , too , if there are adverse growth effects over the next decade , they cannot all be blamed on the financial crisis . 
In the short term , it is important that monetary policy in the US and Europe vigilantly fight Japanese-style deflation , which would only exacerbate debt problems by lowering incomes relative to debts . 
In fact , as I argued at the outset of the crisis , it would be far better to have two or three years of mildly elevated inflation , deflating debts across the board , especially if the political , legal , and regulatory systems remain somewhat paralyzed in achieving the necessary write-downs . 
With credit markets impaired , further quantitative easing may still be needed . 
As for fiscal policy , it is already in high gear and needs gradual tightening over several years , lest already troubling government-debt levels deteriorate even faster . 
Those who believe - often with quasi-religious conviction - that we need even more Keynesian fiscal stimulus , and should ignore government debt , seem to me to be panicking . 
Last but not least , however , it is important to try to preserve dynamism in the US and European economies through productivity-enhancing measures - for example , by being vigilant about anti-trust policy , and by streamlining and simplifying tax systems . 
For better or for worse , productivity trends are very difficult to extrapolate , depending as they do on hugely complex interactions of social , economic , and political forces . 
Nobel Prize winners Robert Solow and Paul Krugman famously once questioned whether the proliferation of computers and technology would lead to bottom-line growth . 
( This theme underlies the title of Krugman &apos;s classic 1990 book &quot; The Age of Diminished Expectations . &quot; ) 
In the end , policymakers must remember that whether or not the US and Europe avoid a lost decade depends on their ability to retain productive vitality in their economies , not simply on short-term demand-stimulation measures .
