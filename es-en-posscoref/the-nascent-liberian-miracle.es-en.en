The Nascent Liberian Miracle 
WASHINGTON , DC - In late 2003 , Liberia began to emerge from two decades of brutal military government and civil war that had left the country with no functioning public services , spawned large-scale theft of timber and diamonds , and generated massive debts to foreign creditors . 
Now , under the leadership of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , Liberia has reached a historic milestone : a comprehensive debt-reduction package that writes off more than 90 % of its foreign debt and opens up new opportunities to rebuild the country . 
Liberia joins 22 other sub-Saharan countries that have received comprehensive debt relief over the past decade . 
It is also one of a handful of countries that have achieved significant results in recovering from the deep damage of prolonged conflict by rebuilding government and establishing the rule of law . 
I began that quest for comprehensive debt relief in early 2006 while serving as Liberia &apos;s Finance Minister , representing Johnson Sirleaf &apos;s new government . 
As Director of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s African Department , I witnessed the historic &quot; completion point &quot; of the process in Washington , DC , alongside my colleagues from the World Bank . 
Liberia &apos;s progress has significance well beyond its immediate borders and those of its neighbors in West Africa . 
Its story shows that , given strong national leadership , an internationally coordinated combination of military , humanitarian , technical , and financial assistance can help to turn around failed states , enabling them to rejoin the international financial and political communities and benefit fully from linkages to the global economy . 
Liberia &apos;s post-conflict recovery is not unprecedented , but it provides a clear illustration of how coordinated and sustained multilateral support can help national leaders deliver impressive results . 
Even in the most difficult circumstances , Africa is indeed on the move . 
The approval of comprehensive and irrevocable debt relief for Liberia is historic for many reasons . 
First , the scale of the debt burden built up over close to 20 years of conflict was monumental , amounting to more than $ 4 billion - three to four times the level of indebtedness relative to income of the most severely indebted European countries currently facing difficulties . 
Second , exceptional efforts were needed , involving more than 100 countries , to mobilize the funds to cover repayment to the IMF of over $ 800 million of this debt . 
Third , the terms offered by commercial creditors , governments , and other international agencies were unusually generous , involving a reduction of between 90 % and 100 % of debts outstanding . 
Fourth , and most importantly , Liberia is now at a pivotal moment in its economic reconstruction , moving away from dependency on the goodwill of creditors to a new path of growth and development . 
Why debt relief now ? 
Liberia obtained its debt write-off by initiating profound changes in its governance and economic management in order to provide the institutional capability to manage debt prudently and spend resources wisely in the future . 
The country has put in place strong policies and systems to manage debt ; implemented new laws on financial management , procurement , and audit ; stepped up spending on health centers nationwide ; and sought to provide qualified and properly paid teachers in all public schools . 
It also has begun to tackle pervasive graft through the creation of an anti-corruption commission , accurate and validated reporting of all revenues received in the mining and timber sectors , and elimination of provisions for back-room tax deals . 
Debt relief will open doors for the financing of critical projects in electric power , roads , and ports . 
Although debt relief and the related policy reforms are a major political and economic achievement , they are not a panacea for Liberia &apos;s considerable challenges . 
Maintaining peace and security is a pre-requisite for economic development , and here the continued engagement of the sizeable United Nations peacekeeping force will be critical through the next few years . 
Creating more jobs , especially for the young and restless urban population , will cut down on the crime that is rooted in poverty and unemployment . 
Liberia &apos;s strategy to attract large-scale foreign investment in mining , agriculture , and forestry will help rebuild infrastructure and boost employment and tax receipts . 
Already , world-class American and emerging-market companies are investing in Liberia . 
Discussions are ongoing with major firms from Brazil and Russia . 
The Liberian diaspora , especially in the United States , is being actively encouraged by senior ministers to help rebuild the small- and medium-size enterprise sector . 
While poverty remains deep and widespread , Liberians &quot; aspirations for substantial economic improvement are now more clearly within reach than ever before .
