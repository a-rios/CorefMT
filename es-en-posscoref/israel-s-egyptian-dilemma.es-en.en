Israel &apos;s Egyptian Dilemma 
JERUSALEM - The Arab revolt against inertia , despair , and decline has rightly inspired the admiration of civilized people everywhere - everywhere , that is , except in Israel . 
The fall of corrupt Arab dictatorships is being met in Israel with profound skepticism , even hostility . 
For years , the Israeli discourse has been that a true peace with the Arab world would be possible only when the region embraced democracy . 
But the prospect of Arab democracy has now become a nightmare for Israeli leaders . 
They are used to dealing with autocrats in Cairo , Damascus , and Amman , and now fear the consequences of an Arab foreign policy that genuinely responds to the voice of the people . 
Egypt , where Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime was Israel &apos;s closest ally in the war against Hamas in Gaza and in curtailing Iran &apos;s drive for regional hegemony , is of special concern . 
Mubarak &apos;s ineffectiveness as broker of an Israel-Palestinian peace was not truly inconvenient for some of Israel &apos;s leaders . 
All this is now bound to change . 
It is inconceivable , for example , that an Egyptian democracy , in which the Muslim Brotherhood would be a legitimate political force , would persist in Mubarak &apos;s complicity with Israel &apos;s siege of Hamas-controlled Gaza . 
Egypt &apos;s policies concerning two of Israel &apos;s other key rivals in the region , Turkey and Iran , also might shift . 
The US had two requirements of Mubarak : that he undertake domestic political reform , and that he be a peace broker in the region . 
Mubarak conveniently focused on the &quot; peace process , &quot; which explains his jealousy at Turkey &apos;s recent attempts to usurp the role of regional broker . 
Egypt &apos;s regional power reflects its objective strategic weight , and this is not expected to change . 
But Egypt &apos;s attitude to Turkey and Iran would not be as confrontational as Israel would like it to be . 
Indeed , one of the first decisions taken by Egypt &apos;s interim government was to allow an Iranian vessel to cross into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal for the first time in three decades . 
Moreover , after 30 years of tension , preparations are under way for the exchange of ambassadors between Egypt and Iran . 
&quot; Egypt does not view Iran as an enemy , &quot; proclaimed Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil el-Arabi . 
The voice of a democratic Egypt in defense of the cause of Palestine or in putting pressure on Israel to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) would be far more credible than that of Mubarak &apos;s regime , which sometimes looked as if it were simply going through the motions on policy issues like these . 
Nor is Egypt &apos;s political discourse likely to be especially palatable to Israelis . 
Already , the new Egyptian finance minister , Samir Radwan , has made it clear that he does not favor investments from &quot; the enemy &quot; - that is , Israel - which might lead to a takeover of the Egyptian economy . 
All of this does not mean that Egypt &apos;s commitment to the two countries &quot; peace treaty is in imminent danger . 
Egypt , whose new paradigm in foreign affairs increasingly looks like an imitation of Turkey &apos;s strategy of &quot; zero problems with its neighbors , &quot; needs the treaty at least as much as Israel does . 
Any Egyptian democracy that was truly accountable to its popular base would have to address the country &apos;s colossal domestic problems , and a state of war with Israel would hardly advance that goal . 
The real threat to Egypt &apos;s security today is on its southern and eastern borders , not in Israel . 
The secession of South Sudan is a real concern in Egypt , for it might eventually lead to the disintegration of the entire Sudanese state into fiefdoms of instability and Islamic radicalism . 
Egypt is now also rightly concerned about neighboring Libya possibly splitting into its tribal components . 
Conservatism in revolutionary times is an inadequate option . 
Israel &apos;s tragedy lies in its obsession with taking ( or avoiding ) decisions only on the basis of worst-case scenarios . 
This is blatantly obvious in its failure to respond creatively to the Arab world &apos;s democratic upsurge . 
The Netanyahu government &apos;s political paralysis - its wait-and-see philosophy in the face of massive change all around it - will end up leaving the initiative in others &quot; hands , to the detriment of Israel &apos;s national interest . 
No convincing peace initiatives or major policy responses are expected from Israel at a time when the United Nations General Assembly is poised to recognize overwhelmingly the creation of a Palestinian state - a move that would further isolate the country . 
Moreover , an emerging democratic Egypt that is reconciling with Israel &apos;s sworn enemies , and that is bound to be more proactive in its defense of the Palestinian cause , is not viewed in Israel as a legitimate intermediary . 
Inertia was not always Israel &apos;s way . 
Netanyahu does not have to look very far for examples of bold and visionary Israeli leaders to follow . 
Some reached peace agreements with the country &apos;s neighbors ; others came very close - and at least succeeded in conveying to the Arab world Israel &apos;s commitment to reaching out to the region &apos;s peoples . 
The focus of Israel &apos;s regional policy should be building bridges to those peoples , the true masters of the current &quot; Arab awakening . &quot; 
A generous solution to the plight of the Palestinians is more vital to that task than ever before .
