The Grand Illusions 
Politicians are often accused of promising what cannot be delivered . 
In Argentina , economists sold politicians on two dreams that could not be fulfilled . 
Their failure plunged the country into its deepest political and financial crisis in decades . 
President Fernando de la Rúa was brought down by riots that left 29 dead . 
Citizens , facing unpaid salaries , frozen bank accounts and unemployment of 20 % , are suffering the consequences of two grand economic illusions . 
The first concerned the supposed restorative powers of a currency board . 
Call it the magic wand illusion . 
When in 1991 Argentina tied the peso to the dollar and prevented its central bank from printing pesos freely , the world applauded - with good reason . 
The new policy ended decades of high inflation and currency debauchery . 
But the currency board was not just a monetary system ; it was also a reform strategy . 
That overreach began Argentina &apos;s undoing . 
The country had not reformed previously - the theory went - because it did not need to . 
If unions bid up wages too high , a devaluation could fix the problem ; if provincial governments spent a little too much , a quick round of peso printing would save the day . 
Inflation was the grease that had kept the wheels of Argentine politics going . 
Shut off the peso spigot - economists counseled - and politics would fix itself . 
Without an inflationary cushion labor markets would have to be modernized , and peso wages would fall to the point were the country could compete internationally . 
Fiscal policy would also be straightened out because the central bank was no longer the lender of last resort . 
Local banks and corporations would never again overborrow , knowing that no safety net would catch them when they fell . 
Even politicians liked this theory , since they could blame the monetary straightjacket for some of their unfulfilled promises . 
The magic wand illusion was not invented in Argentina . 
Like many things in that country , it was imported from Europe . 
Adopt a common currency , many a Continental economist had promised , and fiscal laggards such as Italy and Greece would shape up . 
In Europe , the combined carrot of northern transfers and the stick of northern reproach did the trick . 
Most southern European nations today display public finances that are Lutheran in their prudence . 
In Argentina the currency board did the trick - at the start . 
In the early-to-mid 1990s budget deficits turned into surpluses , bank and financial supervision tightened and labor market reform was repeatedly attempted ( if never achieved ) . 
Argentina was briefly Wall Street &apos;s darling . 
Then came Mexico &apos;s crisis , and Russia &apos;s , and Asia &apos;s . 
The world economy turned sour for emerging markets . 
At that point Argentina fell victim to the second false promise - call it the golden child illusion . 
The world economy will help you as long as you help yourself , policy gurus told Argentina &apos;s politicians . 
If you suffer a shock , just turn the other cheek . 
If you need to borrow for liquidity , world market will supply those funds at reasonable interest rates . 
No matter what , don &apos;t touch the currency board , the linchpin of your credibility . 
Until late in the game , Argentina did as it was told . 
President de la Rúa countered the terms of trade and interest rate shocks from abroad with domestic tax increases , even as the economy contracted . 
Contrary to conventional wisdom , the government did not go on a spending binge . 
Despite the temptation to spend its way out of slump , Argentina &apos;s non-interest expenditure remained roughly constant . 
In 2000 the nation ran a budget surplus of 1 % of domestic output , which became a total deficit of 2.4 % once interest payments were added in . 
Public debt stood at a moderate 45 % of output . 
In short , it did as much as the once-golden child in the class could have been expected to . 
World capital markets did not reciprocate . 
Spreads charged on loans to Argentina went from huge to obscene . 
Interest payments drove up the deficit , which spooked investors who demanded even higher spreads , enlarging the deficit even more . 
Most governments forced to pay 40 % a year or more on dollar loans would eventually run out of money and stop paying . 
This is what has happened to Argentina . 
In the endgame , the consequences of a policy based on illusions reared their ugly heads . 
The temporary discipline imposed by the currency board had masked the absence of crucial reforms . 
The weakest link was the fiscal regime tying the federal government and the rest of the country together , which remained discretional and full of loopholes . 
As the budget situation deteriorated , transfers from Buenos Aires to provincial governments became a matter for day-to-day political bargaining . 
The lack of a fiscal framework hindered credibility . 
Cut off from credit , Argentina entered a deflationary spiral . 
Never mind that Cavallo promised a zero-deficit policy , spending only what the government took in . 
Budget cuts reduced demand and output , which caused revenue to collapse , making additional budget cuts inevitable . 
The lesson would have been obvious to Keynes : with monetary policy immobilized by the currency board , and with fiscal policy immobilized by lack of financing , the economy could only go down . 
The shock absorbers that were dismissed as unnecessary for a golden child ( world capital markets , remember , were supposed to finance your way out of a slump ) turned out to be crucial . 
In defending the currency board and trying to avoid a default vis-à-vis those who hold pesos in their pockets , Argentina ended up defaulting against everyone else : its public employees , whose salaries were either never paid or arbitrarily cut ; its provinces , who have not received the transfers accorded them by law ; its depositors , who can no longer withdraw their funds freely from the bank ; and , crucially , its democracy , with the mandate of a popularly elected president cut short by rioting and looting . 
Now is the time to cut free of these two illusions . 
Since no one will save Argentina , Argentines must save themselves . 
A necessary step is to abandon convertibility and let the peso float , while transforming outstanding obligations to pesos so as to prevent the devaluation from wrecking the balance sheets of local banks and corporations . 
The moratorium on foreign debt payments announced by incoming President Rodríguez Saá will help cushion the blow . 
With the currency at a level that makes Argentina competitive again , reconstruction can begin . 
With no currency board to instill a false sense of discipline , real institutional reform will have to be tried . 
Provincial finances will finally have to be cleaned up . 
It will be a long , painful road . 
But this time Argentina will not travel under the illusions fostered by economic scribblers , both dead and alive .
