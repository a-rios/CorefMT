Quantitative Quicksand 
PITTSBURGH - Almost all recoveries from recession have included rapid employment growth - until now . 
Though advanced-country central banks have pursued expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the global economic crisis in an effort to boost demand , job creation has lagged . 
As a result , workers , increasingly convinced that they will be unable to find employment for a sustained period , are leaving the labor force in droves . 
Nowhere is this phenomenon more pronounced than in the United States , where the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates to unprecedented levels and , through quantitative easing ( QE ) , augmented bank reserves by purchasing financial assets . 
But inflation - which rapid money-supply expansion inevitably fuels - has so far remained subdued , at roughly 2 % , because banks are not using their swelling reserves to expand credit and increase liquidity . 
While this is keeping price volatility in check , it is also hindering employment growth . 
Rather than changing its approach , however , the Fed has responded to slow employment growth by launching additional rounds of QE . 
Apparently , its rationale is that if expanding reserves by more than $ 2 trillion has not produced the desired results , adding $ 85 billion more monthly - another $ 1 trillion this year - might do the trick . 
America &apos;s central bankers need not search far to find out why QE is not working ; evidence is published regularly for anyone to see . 
During QE2 ( from November 2010 to July 2011 ) , the Fed added a total of $ 557.9 billion to reserves , and excess reserves grew by $ 546.5 billion . 
That means that banks circulated only 2 % of QE2 &quot; s contribution , leaving the rest idle . 
Similarly , since QE3 was launched last September , total bank reserves have grown by $ 244.1 billion , and excess reserves by $ 239.4 billion - meaning that 99 % of the funds remain idle . 
Given that banks earn 0.25 % in interest on their reserve accounts , but pay very low - indeed , near-zero - interest to their depositors , they might choose to leave the money idle , drawing risk-free interest , rather than circulate it through the economy . 
At current interest rates , banks lend to the government , large stable corporations , and commercial real-estate dealers ; they do not extend credit to riskier borrowers , like start-up companies or first-time home buyers . 
While speculators and bankers profit from the decline in interest rates that accompanies the Fed &apos;s asset purchases , the intended monetary and credit stimulus is absent . 
At some point , the Fed must realize that its current policy is not working . 
But developing a more effective alternative requires an understanding of the US economy &apos;s actual problems - something that the Fed also seems to lack . 
Indeed , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke often says that his goal is to prevent another Great Depression , even though the Fed addressed that risk effectively in 2008 . 
The US economy has not responded to the Fed &apos;s monetary expansion , because America &apos;s biggest problems are not liquidity problems . 
As every economics student learns early on , monetary policy cannot fix problems in the real economy ; only policy changes affecting the real economy can . 
The Fed should relearn that lesson . 
One major problem , insufficient investment , is rooted in President Barack Obama &apos;s effort to increase the tax paid by those whose annual incomes exceed $ 250,000 and , more recently , in his proposal to cap retirement entitlements . 
While such proposals have been met with opposition , Obama cannot be expected to sign a deficit-reduction bill that does not include more revenue . 
As long as that revenue &apos;s sources , and the future effects of new regulations , remain uncertain , those whom the policies would most harm - the country &apos;s largest savers - are unlikely to invest . 
Likewise , Obama &apos;s health-care reform , the Affordable Care Act , has hampered employment growth , as businesses reduce their hiring and cut workers &quot; hours to shelter themselves from increased labor costs ( estimates of the rise vary ) . 
Meanwhile , the faltering European economy and slowing GDP growth in China and elsewhere are impeding export demand . 
While subdued liquidity and credit growth are delaying the inflationary impact of the Fed &apos;s determination to expand banks &quot; already-massive reserves , America cannot escape inflation forever . 
The reserves that the Fed - and almost all other major central banks - are building will eventually be used .
