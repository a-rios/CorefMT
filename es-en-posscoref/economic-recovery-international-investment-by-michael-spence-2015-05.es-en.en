A World of Underinvestment 
MILAN - When World War II ended 70 years ago , much of the world - including industrialized Europe , Japan , and other countries that had been occupied - was left geopolitically riven and burdened by heavy sovereign debt , with many major economies in ruins . 
One might have expected a long period of limited international cooperation , slow growth , high unemployment , and extreme privation , owing to countries &quot; limited capacity to finance their huge investment needs . 
But that is not what happened . 
Instead , world leaders adopted a long-term perspective . 
They recognized that their countries &quot; debt-reduction prospects depended on nominal economic growth , and that their economic-growth prospects - not to mention continued peace - depended on a worldwide recovery . 
So they used - and even stretched - their balance sheets for investment , while opening themselves up to international trade , thereby helping to restore demand . 
The United States - which faced considerable public debt , but had lost little in the way of physical assets - naturally assumed a leadership role in this process . 
Two features of the post-war economic recovery are striking . 
First , countries did not view their sovereign debt as a binding constraint , and instead pursued investment and potential growth . 
Second , they cooperated with one another on multiple fronts , and the countries with the strongest balance sheets bolstered investment elsewhere , crowding in private investment . 
The onset of the Cold War may have encouraged this approach . 
In any case , it was not every country for itself . 
Today &apos;s global economy bears striking similarities to the immediate post-war period : high unemployment , high and rising debt levels , and a global shortage of aggregate demand are constraining growth and generating deflationary pressures . 
And now , as then , the level and quality of investment have been consistently inadequate , with public spending on tangible and intangible capital - a critical factor in long-term growth - well below optimal levels for some time . 
Of course , there are also new challenges . 
The dynamics of income distribution have shifted adversely in recent decades , impeding consensus on economic policy . 
And aging populations - a result of rising longevity and declining fertility - are putting pressure on public finances . 
Nonetheless , the ingredients of an effective strategy to spur economic growth and employment are similar : available balance sheets ( sovereign and private ) should be used to generate additional demand and boost public investment , even if it results in greater leverage . 
Recent IMF research suggests that , given excess capacity , governments would probably benefit from substantial short-run multipliers . 
More important , the focus on investment would improve prospects for long-term sustainable growth , which would enable governments and households to pursue responsible deleveraging . 
Likewise , international cooperation is just as critical to success today as it was 70 years ago . 
Because the balance sheets ( public , quasi-public , and private ) with the capacity to invest are not uniformly distributed around the world , a determined global effort - which includes an important role for multilateral financial institutions - is needed to clear clogged intermediation channels . 
There is plenty of incentive for countries to collaborate , rather than using trade , finance , monetary policy , public-sector purchasing , tax policy , or other levers to undermine one another . 
After all , given the connectedness that characterizes today &apos;s globalized financial and economic systems , a full recovery anywhere is virtually impossible without a broad-based recovery nearly everywhere . 
Yet , for the most part , limited cooperation has been the world &apos;s chosen course in recent years , with countries believing not only that they must fend for themselves , but also that their debt levels impose a hard constraint on growth-generating investment . 
The resulting underinvestment and depreciation of the global economy &apos;s asset base are suppressing productivity growth and thus undermining sustainable recoveries . 
In the absence of a vigorous international re-investment program , monetary policy is being used to prop up growth . 
But monetary policy typically focuses on domestic recovery . 
And , though unconventional measures have reduced financial instability , their effectiveness in countering widespread deflationary pressures or restoring growth remains dubious . 
Meanwhile , savers are being repressed , asset prices distorted , and incentives to maintain or even increase leverage enhanced . 
Competitive devaluations , even if they are not policymakers &quot; stated objectives , are becoming increasingly tempting - though they will not solve the aggregate-demand problem . 
This is not to say that sudden &quot; normalization &quot; of monetary policy is a good idea . 
But , if large-scale investment and reform programs were initiated as complements to unconventional monetary-policy measures , the economy could move onto a more resilient growth path . 
Despite its obvious benefits , such a coordinated international approach remains elusive . 
Though trade and investment agreements are being negotiated , they are increasingly regional in scope . 
Meanwhile , the multilateral trade system is fragmenting , along with the consensus that created it . 
Given the level of interconnectedness and interdependence that characterizes today &apos;s global economy , the reluctance to cooperate is difficult to comprehend . 
One problem seems to be conditionality , with countries unwilling to commit to complementary fiscal and structural reforms . 
This is especially evident in Europe , where it is argued , with some justification , that , without such reforms , growth will remain anemic , sustaining or even exacerbating fiscal constraints . 
But if conditionality is so important , why didn &apos;t it prevent cooperation 70 years ago ? 
Perhaps the idea that severely damaged economies , with limited prospects for independent recoveries , would pass up the opportunity that international cooperation presented was implausible . 
Maybe it still is . 
If so , creating a similar opportunity today could change the incentives , trigger the required complementary reforms , and put the global economy on course to a stronger long-term recovery .
