What Greece Needs to Prosper 
NEW YORK - Some economists overlook the modern idea that a country &apos;s prosperity depends on innovation and entrepreneurship . 
Looking at Greece , these economists argue that a shift in fiscal policy to &quot; austerity &quot; - a smaller public sector - has brought an acute deficiency of demand and thus a depression . 
But this claim misreads history and exaggerates the power of government spending . 
Much of the decline in employment in Greece occurred prior to the sharp cuts in spending between 2012 and 2014 - owing , no doubt , to sinking confidence in the government . 
Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around € 13.5 billion ( $ 14.8 billion ) in 2009-2012 , before falling to roughly € 9.6 billion in 2014-2015 . 
Yet the number of job holders reached its high of 4.5 million in 2006-2009 , and had fallen to 3.6 million by 2012 . 
By the time Greece began to cut its budget , the rate of unemployment - 9.6 % of the labor force in 2009 - had already risen almost to its recent level of 25.5 % . 
They indicate that Greece &apos;s turn away from the high spending of 2008-2013 is not to blame for today &apos;s mass unemployment . 
Government spending has certainly fallen - but only to where it used to be : € 9.6 billion in the first quarter of this year is , in fact , higher than it was as recently as 2003 . 
So the premise of austerity appears to be wrong . 
Greece has not departed from past fiscal norms ; it has returned to them . 
Rather than describing current government spending as &quot; austere , &quot; it would be more correct to view it as an end to years of fiscal profligacy , culminating in 2013 , when the government &apos;s budget deficit reached 12.3 % of GDP and public debt climbed to 175 % of GDP . 
The &quot; demand school &quot; might respond that , regardless of whether there is fiscal austerity now , increased government spending ( financed , of course , by debt ) would impart a permanent boost to employment . But Greece &apos;s recent experience suggests otherwise . 
The real sticking point is that the government would have to issue bonds to finance its extra spending . 
Assuming a limit to foreign investors &quot; willingness to buy these bonds , Greeks would have to buy them . 
In an economy unequipped for growth , household wealth relative to wages would soar , and the labor supply would shrink , causing employment to contract . 
So spending more is not the remedy for Greece &apos;s plight , just as spending less was not the cause . 
What is the remedy , then ? 
No amount of debt restructuring , even debt forgiveness , will suffice to achieve prosperity ( in the form of low unemployment and high job satisfaction ) . 
Then the economy &apos;s stultifying corporatism - clientelism and cronyism in the public sector and vested interests and entrenched elites in the private sector - would gain a new lease on life . 
The European left may advocate that , but it would hardly be in Europe &apos;s interest . 
The remedy must lie in adopting the right structural reforms . 
Whether or not the reforms sought by the eurozone members raise the chances that their loans will be repaid , these creditors have a political and economic interest in the monetary union &apos;s survival and development . 
They should also be ready to help Greece with the costs of making the necessary changes . 
But it is Greece itself that must take charge of its reforms . 
Greece must dismantle corporatist arrangements and practices that obstruct whatever innovation and entrepreneurship might emerge . 
Nurturing an abundance of imaginative innovators and vibrant entrepreneurs requires embracing a vision of venturesome lives of creativity and discovery .
