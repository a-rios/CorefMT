Marriage Counseling for the G-20 and the IMF 
BERKELEY - The relationship between the International Monetary Fund and the G-20 is symbiotic but conflicted . 
Like a long-married couple who habitually bicker and fight , the two can &apos;t seem to live together - but they can &apos;t live apart , either . 
The question of what to do about this relationship is coming to a head in advance of the November G-20 summit chaired by South Korea . 
Since the 1997-1998 crisis , Asian governments have sought to keep their distance from the Fund . 
It is admirable , therefore , that South Korea &apos;s government has taken the lead in discussions about reforming the IMF &apos;s mandate . 
It has contributed significantly to international thinking on the design of new lending facilities . 
The IMF &apos;s crisis-prevention efforts begin with its country surveillance , as provided for by Article IV of its Articles of Agreement . 
The problem with these exercises is that they are regularly relegated to the &quot; duly noted &quot; bin : governments receive them , file them away , and go back to doing what they were doing before . 
A further problem is that these exercises rarely address the implications of national policies for third countries and the international system . 
Article IV surveillance of the United States during the sub-prime mortgage boom said little about the dangers posed by such lending for international financial markets . 
Article IV reviews of China have similarly said little about the implications of the country &apos;s policies for global imbalances . 
To close these gaps , the IMF is now experimenting with &quot; spillover reports &quot; that focus on cross-country impacts . 
Article IV also gives the IMF a mandate to oversee the &quot; effective operation &quot; of the international monetary system . 
It is past time for the Fund to put some flesh on these constitutional bones . 
Staff and management should be tasked with producing a biannual report on the international monetary system . 
This report would evaluate the sustainability of current-account balances and exchange rates , and the adequacy or excessiveness of members &quot; foreign-exchange reserves . 
It would recommend policies for eliminating imbalances and describe what kind of exchange-rate and reserve changes must accompany any adjustments . 
It would probably be too politically sensitive for the Fund to announce by exactly how much different currencies were overvalued and undervalued , and to declare some as seriously misaligned . 
Instead , it could settle for offering a range of assessments . 
If this proved successful , it could then move toward publishing more forceful , umpire-like decisions . 
In order to better carry out the other half of its dual mandate , the IMF has signaled that it will ask for a further increase in its resources , to $ 1 trillion , up from the $ 750 billion agreed at the London G-20 meeting in April 2009 . 
In the spring of 2010 , the IMF committed upwards of $ 300 billion to Southern Europe alone . 
Clearly , more firepower is called for . 
But , in addition to more resources , the IMF needs a more effective way of deploying them . 
Here , with input from South Korea , it is developing plans for a Precautionary Credit Line ( PCL ) . 
Unfortunately , only three countries - Mexico , Colombia , and Poland - have signed up for an FCL . 
Others hesitate , either because they worry about not qualifying or because they remain concerned about the stigma of association with the Fund . 
Augmenting an FCL for countries with impeccably strong policies with a PCL for countries with reasonably strong policies might break this deadlock . 
Countries qualifying for a PCL would have to meet some , but relatively minimal and unobtrusive , conditions . 
They might have to pay somewhat higher interest rates to address concerns about moral hazard . 
The stigma problem could then be addressed if the IMF was authorized to pre-qualify unilaterally a swath of countries for one facility or the other . 
One problem with the FCL is what might happen if the IMF disqualifies a previously prequalified country . 
Investors could take this as an indication that policies had deteriorated significantly and rush for the exits . 
This danger would be attenuated if pre-qualification was not a yes-or-no decision : if there were a range of facilities for which countries could be pre-qualified , they could be moved between them as circumstances changed . 
But it is not clear that this would be enough to remove the danger that an IMF decision , taken in response to deteriorating country policies , could precipitate a crisis . 
As always , the devil is in the details . 
It is to be hoped that we will learn the details before the G-20 meets in Seoul in November .
