What the World Needs from the BRICS 
CAMBRIDGE - In 2001 , Goldman Sachs &quot; Jim O &apos;Neill famously coined the term BRIC to characterize the world &apos;s four largest developing economies - Brazil , Russia , India , and China . 
But , more than a decade later , just about the only thing that these countries have in common is that they are the only economies ranked among the world &apos;s 15 largest ( adjusted for purchasing power ) that are not members of the OECD . 
The four countries have very different economic structures : Russia and Brazil rely on commodities , India on services , and China on manufacturing . 
Brazil and India are democracies , while China and Russia are decidedly not . 
And , as Joseph Nye has written , Russia is a superpower in decline , while China and ( less markedly ) the others are on the rise . 
Yet , in a strange case of life imitating fantasy , BRICS - the original four countries , now joined by South Africa - have formed a grouping of their own with regular meetings and policy initiatives . 
Their most ambitious effort to date is the establishment of a development bank . 
At their meeting in Durban in March , the five countries &quot; leaders announced that their &quot; New Development Bank &quot; will focus on infrastructure investment in developing countries , which , they said , was constrained by &quot; insufficient long-term financing and foreign direct investment . &quot; 
A second initiative announced in Durban is the creation of a $ 100 billion contingent reserve facility to deal with &quot; short-term liquidity pressures . &quot; 
It can be cause only for celebration that the world &apos;s largest developing economies are regularly talking to each other and establishing common initiatives . 
Nonetheless , it is disappointing that they have chosen to focus on infrastructure finance as their first major area of collaboration . 
This approach represents a 1950 &quot; s view of economic development , which has long been superseded by a more variegated perspective that recognizes a multiplicity of constraints - everything from poor governance to market failures - of varying importance in different countries . 
One might even say that today &apos;s global economy suffers from too much , rather than too little , cross-border finance . 
What the world needs from the BRICS is not another development bank , but greater leadership on today &apos;s great global issues . 
The BRICS countries are home to around half of the world &apos;s population and the bulk of unexploited economic potential . 
If the international community fails to confront its most serious challenges - from the need for a sound global economic architecture to addressing climate change - they are the ones that will pay the highest price . 
Yet these countries have so far played a rather unimaginative and timid role in international forums such as the G-20 or the World Trade Organization . 
When they have asserted themselves , it has been largely in pursuit of narrow national interests . 
Do they really have nothing new to offer ? 
The global economy has operated so far under a set of ideas and institutions emanating from the advanced countries of the West . 
The United States gave the world the doctrine of liberal , rule-based multilateralism - a regime whose many blemishes highlight the lofty principles according to which the system has generally functioned . 
Europe brought democratic values , social solidarity , and , for all its current problems , the century &apos;s most impressive feat of institutional engineering , the European Union . 
But these old powers have neither the legitimacy nor the power to sustain the global order into the future , while the new rising powers have yet to demonstrate which values they will articulate and promote . 
They have to develop their vision of a new global economy , beyond complaints about its asymmetric power structure . 
Unfortunately , it is not yet clear whether they have the inclination to rise above their immediate interests in order to address the world &apos;s common challenges . 
Their own development experience makes countries like China , India , and Brazil resistant to market fundamentalism and natural advocates for institutional diversity and pragmatic experimentation . 
They can build on this experience to articulate a new global narrative that emphasizes the real economy over finance , policy diversity over harmonization , national policy space over external constraints , and social inclusion over technocratic elitism . 
But they must stop being supplicants , and act like real leaders , understanding that others , too , including advanced countries , face challenges that sometimes require policies that put the domestic economy first . 
And they must work to uphold the bedrock principles of the global economy that have served it - and them - so well in the last 60 years : non-discrimination and multilateralism . 
Ultimately , though , the BRICS must also lead by example . 
The human-rights practices in China and Russia , and their suppression of political dissent , are incompatible with global leadership . 
These authoritarian regimes must reform themselves at home if they are to exert any kind of moral claim abroad .
