Harnessing Disruption for Sustainability 
GENEVA - After decades of reluctance on the part of world leaders , a rapid , smooth , and purposeful transition toward sustainable development seems unlikely . 
Indeed , throughout human history , such major changes have more often been forced upon the world by circumstances , with leaders focusing on shorter-term concerns like political turmoil or economic stagnation until serious disruptions to their economies and societies arise . 
But this need not be the case . 
Policymakers can develop solutions that leverage immediate challenges to guide the shift toward a more sustainable , inclusive future . 
This year , which has been dubbed &quot; the year of sustainable development , &quot; provides an ideal opportunity in this regard . 
At high-level meetings in Sendai , Japan , in March and in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , in July , world leaders will pursue closer collaboration on disaster-risk reduction and on mobilizing finance for development , respectively . 
In September , the United Nations will launch its Sustainable Development Goals , to serve as the framework for global development efforts until 2030 . 
Moreover , global climate negotiations will reach a critical point in December , when world leaders meet for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris . 
Such multilateral frameworks catalyze progress . 
Indeed , agreements like last year &apos;s deal between China and the United States to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions - not to mention initiatives to mobilize business , such as We Mean Business - are unlikely to happen without them . 
Nonetheless , as Mancur Olson famously observed , it is the individual interests of the parties that drive collective success . 
For example , China &apos;s recent embrace of sustainable development , which will serve the planet &apos;s long-term interests , is driven by the domestic challenges posed by air , water , and land pollution . 
Rather than agonize over growing disruptions , China &apos;s government has decided to hasten the shift toward a dynamic green economy , even if it means stranding assets and allowing businesses that do not suit China &apos;s shifting needs to fail - an approach that will deliver a long-term competitive advantage . 
The rest of the world should recognize the benefits of allowing short-term disruptions to drive , not distract from , the sustainability agenda . 
One area where such an opportunity is already apparent is financial reform . 
Today &apos;s historically low interest rates should encourage long-term investment , as they lower the current cost of capital . 
This undermines both short-term efforts to boost employment and the long-term objective of sustainable growth . 
It does not have to be this way . 
As the UN Environment Programme emphasized in a briefing at the World Economic Forum in Davos , saving the financial sector from itself can accelerate the transition to sustainable development . 
For example , effective risk management and longer-term policy objectives would be better aligned if regulators reduced capital requirements for banks that extend loans for climate-resilient and environmentally friendly investments . 
Similarly , central banks &quot; inflated balance sheets - the result of short-term crisis-response measures - could , through refinancing arrangements , be used to boost green investment . 
Further quantitative easing , such as by the European Central Bank , could be directed toward greener asset-backed securities . 
Even perverse signals can be mitigated and leveraged . 
Instead of allowing low oil prices to encourage consumption , governments could take the opportunity to impose a small , politically acceptable energy or carbon-equivalent tax - an approach advocated by many economists and development specialists , including Jeffrey Sachs , Lawrence Summers , and Kemal Dervi≈ü . 
Such a tax would not only sustain the price signals needed to steer societies onto a more sustainable energy path ; it would also provide revenues that could be channeled toward employment creation and long-term green investments , thereby leveraging private capital . 
Likewise , central banks &quot; macro-prudential activities , which evolved largely in response to the global financial crisis , could focus on longer-term risks to the financial sector , including the cumulative impact of climate change , environmental policies , and disruptive clean technologies . 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has taken the lead in initiating a prudential review of the impact of climate change on the United Kingdom &apos;s insurance sector . 
Other institutions - including multilateral bodies like the Bank of International Settlements , the Financial Stability Board , and the G-20 - should follow suit . 
What the world needs now are leaders who are willing to bridge the gap between daunting short-term demands and desirable long-term outcomes . 
Instead of remaining preoccupied with the present , world leaders should view 2015 as an opportunity to ensure that today &apos;s disruptive crises provide the foundation for tomorrow &apos;s sustainable prosperity .
