More Skin in the Game in 2013 
NEW YORK - Those who have the upside are not necessarily those who incur the downside . 
For example , bankers and corporate managers get bonuses for &quot; performance , &quot; but not reverse bonuses for negative performance , and they have an incentive to bury risks in the tails of the distribution - in other words , to delay blowups . 
The ancients were fully aware of this incentive to hide risks , and implemented very simple but potent heuristics . 
About 3,800 years ago , the Code of Hammurabi specified that if a house collapses and causes the death of its owner , the house &apos;s builder shall be put to death . 
This simple tenet is at the origin of &quot; an eye for an eye &quot; and the Golden Rule in ethics ( &quot; Do unto others as you would have them do unto you &quot; ) . 
But , beyond ethics , this was simply the best risk-management rule ever . 
The ancients understood that the builder always knows more about the risks than the client , and can hide sources of fragility and improve his profitability by cutting corners . 
The foundation is the best place to hide risk . 
The builder can also fool the inspector ; the person hiding risk has a large informational advantage over the one who has to find it . 
Why do I believe that a certain class of people has an incentive to &quot; look good &quot; rather than &quot; do good &quot; ? 
The reason is simply the absence of personal risk . 
And the problems and remedies are as follows : 
First , consider policymakers and politicians . 
In a decentralized system - say , municipalities - these people are checked by a feeling of shame upon harming others with their mistakes . 
In a large centralized system , by contrast , the source of errors is not so visible , and a spreadsheet does not make one feel shame . 
This penalty , shame , in addition to other arguments , is a case for decentralization . 
Second , we misunderstand corporate managers &quot; incentive structure . 
Contrary to public perception , corporate managers are not entrepreneurs . 
They are not what one could call agents of capitalism . 
Since 2000 , in the United States , the stock market has lost - depending on how one measures it - up to $ 2 trillion for investors ( compared to returns had they left their funds in cash or treasury bills ) . 
So , one would be inclined to think that since managers &quot; pay is based on performance incentives , they would be incurring losses . 
Not at all : there is an asymmetry . 
Money-losing managers do not have negative compensation . 
There is a built-in optionality in the compensation of corporate managers that can be removed only by forcing them to eat some of the losses . 
Because of the embedded option , while shareholders have lost , managers have earned more than a half-trillion dollars for themselves . 
Third , there is a problem with academic economists , quantitative modelers , and policy wonks . 
The reason why economic models do not fit reality is that economists have no disincentive , and are never penalized for their errors . 
So long as they please the editors of academic journals , their work is considered fine . 
As a result , we use models such as portfolio theory and similar methods without the remotest empirical reason . 
The solution is to prevent economists from teaching practitioners . 
Again , this highlights the case for decentralization : a system in which policy is decided at a local level by smaller units - and thus is not in need of economists . 
Fourth , predictions in socioeconomic domains do not work , but predictors are rarely harmed by their forecasts . 
Yet we know that people take more risks after they see a numerical prediction . 
The solution is to ask - and only take into account - what the predictor has done , or will do in the future . 
I tell people what I have in my portfolio , not what I predict ; that way , I will be the first to be harmed . 
It is not ethical to drag people into these exposures without incurring the risk of losses . 
In my book Antifragile , I tell people what I do , not what they should do , to the great irritation of the literary critics . 
I do so not for autobiographical reasons , but only because the other approach would not be ethical . 
Finally , there are warmongers . 
To deal with them , the onetime consumer advocate and former US presidential candidate Ralph Nader has proposed that those who vote in favor of war should place themselves or a descendent into military service . 
One can only hope that something will be done in 2013 to implement some skin in the game heuristics . 
A safe and just society demands nothing less .
