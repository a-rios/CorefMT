The Climate Change Safari Park 
COPENHAGEN - As Barack Obama prepares for his inauguration , it is worth contemplating a passage from his book Dreams from My Father . 
Obama is in Kenya and wants to go on a safari . 
His Kenyan sister Auma chides him for behaving like a neo-colonialist . 
&quot; Why should all that land be set aside for tourists when it could be used for farming ? 
These wazungu care more about one dead elephant than they do for a hundred black children . &quot; 
Although he ends up going on safari , Obama has no answer to her question . 
That anecdote has parallels with the current preoccupation with global warming . 
Many people - including America &apos;s new president - believe that global warming is the preeminent issue of our time , and that cutting CO2 emissions is one of the most virtuous things we can do . 
To stretch the metaphor a little , this seems like building ever-larger safari parks instead of creating more farms to feed the hungry . 
Make no mistake : global warming is real , and it is caused by manmade CO2 emissions . 
The problem is that even global , draconian , and hugely costly CO2 reductions will have virtually no impact on the temperature by mid-century . 
Instead of ineffective and costly cuts , we should focus much more of our good climate intentions on dramatic increases in Rampamp ; D for zero-carbon energy , which would fix the climate towards mid-century at low cost . 
But , more importantly for most of the planet &apos;s citizens , global warming simply exacerbates existing problems - problems that we do not take seriously today . 
Consider malaria . 
Models shows global warming will increase the incidence of malaria by about 3 % by the end of the century , because mosquitoes are more likely to survive when the world gets hotter . 
But malaria is much more strongly related to health infrastructure and general wealth than it is to temperature . 
Rich people rarely contract malaria or die from it ; poor people do . 
Strong carbon cuts could avert about 0.2 % of the malaria incidence in a hundred years . 
The cheerleaders for such action are loud and multitudinous , and mostly come from the rich world , unaffected by malaria . 
The other option is simply to prioritize eradication of malaria today . 
It would be relatively cheap and simple , involving expanded distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets , more preventive treatment for pregnant women , increased use of the maligned pesticide DDT , and support for poor nations that cannot afford the best new therapies . 
Tackling nearly 100 % of today &apos;s malaria problem would cost just one-sixtieth of the price of the Kyoto Protocol . 
Put another way , for each person saved from malaria by cutting CO2 emissions , direct malaria policies could have saved 36,000 . 
Of course , carbon cuts are not designed only to tackle malaria . 
But , for every problem that global warming will exacerbate - hurricanes , hunger , flooding - we could achieve tremendously more through cheaper , direct policies today . 
For example , adequately maintained levees and better evacuation services , not lower carbon emissions , would have minimized the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans . During the 2004 hurricane season , Haiti and the Dominican Republic , both occupying the same island , provided a powerful lesson . 
In the Dominican Republic , which has invested in hurricane shelters and emergency evacuation networks , the death toll was fewer than ten . 
In Haiti , which lacks such policies , 2,000 died . 
Haitians were a hundred times more likely to die in an equivalent storm than Dominicans . 
Obama &apos;s election has raised hopes for a massive commitment to carbon cuts and vast spending on renewable energy to save the world - especially developing nations . 
As Obama &apos;s Kenyan sister might attest , this could be an expensive indulgence . 
Some believe Obama should follow the lead of the European Union , which has committed itself to the ambitious goal of cutting carbon emissions by 20 % below 1990 levels within 12 years by using renewable energy . 
This alone will probably cost more than 1 % of GDP . 
Even if the entire world followed suit , the net effect would be to reduce global temperatures by one-twentieth of one degree Fahrenheit by the end of the century . 
The cost could be a staggering $ 10 trillion . 
Germany has subsidized solar panels , as some hope Obama might . 
Thus , everybody , including the poor , pays taxes so that mostly wealthier beneficiaries can feel greener . 
But climate models demonstrate that Germany &apos;s $ 156 billion expense will delay warming by just one hour at the end of the century . 
For one-fiftieth of that cost , we could provide essential micronutrients to 2-3 billion people , thereby preventing perhaps a million deaths and making half the world &apos;s population mentally and physically much stronger . 
Again and again , we seem to choose the dubious luxury of another safari park over the prosaic benefits offered by an extra farm . 
Most economic models show that the total damage imposed by global warming by the end of the century will be about 3 % of GDP . 
This is not trivial , but nor is it the end of the world . 
By the end of the century , the United Nations expects the average person to be 1,400 % richer than today . 
An African safari trip once confronted America &apos;s new president with a question he could not answer : why the rich world prized elephants over African children . 
Today &apos;s version of that question is : why will richer nations spend obscene amounts of money on climate change , achieving next to nothing in 100 years , when we could do so much good for mankind today for much less money ? 
The world will be watching to hear Obama &apos;s answer .
