A Universal Library 
MELBOURNE - Scholars have long dreamed of a universal library containing everything that has ever been written . 
Then , in 2004 , Google announced that it would begin digitally scanning all the books held by five major research libraries . 
Suddenly , the library of utopia seemed within reach . 
Indeed , a digital universal library would be even better than any earlier thinker could have imagined , because every work would be available to everyone , everywhere , at all times . 
And the library could include not only books and articles , but also paintings , music , films , and every other form of creative expression that can be captured in digital form . 
But Google &apos;s plan had a catch . 
Most of the works held by those research libraries are still in copyright . 
Google said that it would scan the entire book , irrespective of its copyright status , but that users searching for something in copyrighted books would be shown only a snippet . 
This , it argued , was &quot; fair use &quot; - and thus permitted under copyright laws in the same way that one may quote a sentence or two from a book for the purpose of a review or discussion . 
Publishers and authors disagreed , and some sued Google for breach of copyright , eventually agreeing to settle their claim in exchange for a share of Google &apos;s revenue . 
Last month , in a Manhattan court , Judge Denny Chin rejected that proposed settlement , in part because it would have given Google a de facto monopoly over the digital versions of so-called &quot; orphan &quot; books - that is , books that are still in copyright , but no longer in print , and whose copyright ownership is difficult to determine . 
Chin held that the United States Congress , not a court , was the appropriate body to decide who should be entrusted with guardianship over orphan books , and on what terms . 
He was surely right , at least in so far as we are considering matters within US jurisdiction . 
These are large and important issues that affect not only authors , publishers , and Google , but anyone with an interest in the diffusion and availability of knowledge and culture . 
So , while Chin &apos;s decision is a temporary setback on the way to a universal library , it provides an opportunity to reconsider how the dream can best be realized . 
The central issue is this : how can we make books and articles - not just snippets , but entire works - available to everyone , while preserving the rights of the works &quot; creators ? 
To answer that , of course , we need to decide what those rights are . 
Just as inventors are given patents so that they can profit from their inventions for a limited time , so , too , authors were originally given copyright for a relatively short period - in the US , it was initially only 14 years from the first publication of the work . 
For most authors , that would be enough time to earn the bulk of the income that they would ever receive from their writings ; after that , the works would be in the public domain . 
But corporations build fortunes on copyright , and repeatedly pushed Congress to extend it , to the point that in the US it now lasts for 70 years after the creator &apos;s death . 
( The 1998 legislation responsible for the last extension was nicknamed the &quot; Mickey Mouse Protection Act &quot; because it allowed the Walt Disney Company to retain copyright of its famous cartoon character . ) 
It is because copyright lasts so long that as many as three-quarters of all library books are &quot; orphaned . &quot; 
This vast collection of knowledge , culture , and literary achievement is inaccessible to most people . 
Digitizing it would make it available to anyone with Internet access . 
As Peter Brantley , Director of Technology for the California Digital Library , has put it : &quot; We have a moral imperative to reach out to our library shelves , grab the material that is orphaned , and set it on top of scanners . &quot; 
Robert Darnton , Director of the Harvard University Library , has proposed an alternative to Google &apos;s plans : a digital public library , funded by a coalition of foundations , working in tandem with a coalition of research libraries . 
Darnton &apos;s plan falls short of a universal library , because works in print and in copyright would be excluded ; but he believes that Congress might grant a non-commercial public library the right to digitize orphan books . 
That would be a huge step in the right direction , but we should not give up the dream of a universal digital public library . 
After all , books still in print are likely to be the ones that contain the most up-to-date information , and the ones that people most want to read . 
Many European countries , as well as Australia , Canada , Israel , and New Zealand , have adopted legislation that creates a &quot; public lending right &quot; - that is , the government recognizes that enabling hundreds of people to read a single copy of a book provides a public good , but that doing so is likely to reduce sales of the book . 
The universal public library could be allowed to digitize even works that are in print and in copyright , in exchange for fees paid to the publisher and author based on the number of times the digital version is read . 
If we can put a man on the Moon and sequence the human genome , we should be able to devise something close to a universal digital public library . 
At that point , we will face another moral imperative , one that will be even more difficult to fulfill : expanding Internet access beyond the less than 30 % of the world &apos;s population that currently has it .
