Climate and Competitiveness 
BERLIN - As Europe &apos;s debt crisis fades , another economic disaster seems to be looming - the price of energy . 
Since the early 2000 &quot; s , average electricity prices for Europe &apos;s industries have more or less doubled , and European companies now pay twice as much for gas as their US competitors do . 
Are Europe &apos;s highly ambitious climate policies - which seek to increase costs for &quot; bad &quot; energy sources - destroying the continent &apos;s industrial base ? 
At first glance , the numbers seem to support the doomsayers . 
How can such a huge price gap not have an impact on competitiveness ? 
But if high energy prices lead to declining exports , how is it that Germany , which boasts some of the world &apos;s most ambitious climate policies , has doubled its exports since 2000 ? 
In fact , empirical evidence shows that in many cases , further reducing carbon-dioxide emissions might help to make industries more competitive . 
Exploring this potential could open up significant opportunities not only to combat climate change , but also to foster Europe &apos;s long-term economic robustness . 
Since 2005 , when the European Union introduced its Emissions Trading System , German industry has achieved massive gains in market share , despite energy prices having risen much faster than in the US and elsewhere . 
According to OECD estimates , the relative export performance of high-cost Germany increased by 10 % from 2005 to 2013 , while US exports grew only 1.2 % faster than demand in the rest of the world . 
In 2013 , both German and US exports fell slightly in relative terms - hardly a sign of an energy-driven competitiveness divide . 
The same holds true , though at a more modest level , even for energy-intensive industries , like chemicals . 
Despite already-high and rising energy prices , Europe &apos;s chemical industry has grown at about the same rate as the rest of the economy since 1995 . 
Today , EU chemical companies specialize in high-value products , and Europe exports much more of them than it imports . 
The reason is simple : there is more - much more - to competitiveness than energy prices . 
Indeed , estimates for Germany show that for most of its industrial base , energy costs account for a mere 1.6 % of gross value added . 
Of course , this burden is higher for industries such as chemicals . 
And , even in these sectors , competitiveness must be defined in a much broader sense than that given simply by comparing cost statistics . 
For example , factors like highly qualified labor , or the benefits of being integrated into well-functioning clusters , probably play a more important role . 
Clearly , such considerations provide no guarantee that rising energy prices will not at some point seriously challenge European competitiveness . 
Indeed , new investment in chemical plants has grown only slowly for years now . 
But , while this risk must be taken seriously , history suggests that there may well be a way out that does not require rolling back climate policies . 
What is notable is that rising energy prices have been accompanied not only by relatively robust competitiveness , but also by huge reductions in CO2 emissions . 
Europe &apos;s chemical industry has halved its greenhouse-gas emissions compared to 1990 , while increasing output by 20 % . 
In a pilot study on specific chemical products for the European Climate Foundation , experts from McKinsey identified the potential for a further 50-75 % reduction in CO2 emissions . 
Moreover , in an estimated 60-70 % of cases , exploring the additional abatement opportunity would have no effect - or would even strengthen - the industry &apos;s competitiveness . 
This is because greater reliance on recycling , for example , reduces costs - and thus enhances companies &quot; competitiveness - while reducing emissions and driving new approaches like cross-sector innovation . 
It would certainly not be wise to allow Europe &apos;s energy bill to explode in the name of ambitious climate policies . 
But it would be equally senseless to push for less ambitious policies , thereby stalling progress in the fight against climate change , without being sure that doing so would improve European competitiveness . 
The new paradigm should focus on finding ways to reduce CO2 emissions in ways that ultimately help to produce better products at lower cost . 
This will also help European producers capture new markets in emerging countries , which will increasingly demand the high-value chemical products that Europe already produces competitively . 
The last thing a crisis-weary Europe needs is a new competitiveness gap . 
They could even be part of the solution .
