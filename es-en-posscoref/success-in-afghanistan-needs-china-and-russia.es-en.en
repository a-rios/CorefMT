Success in Afghanistan Needs China and Russia 
NEW YORK - Preoccupation with Afghanistan &apos;s disputed presidential election is understandable . 
Ending the country &apos;s violence will require a government with both the legitimacy and capacity to tackle the underlying sources of the Taliban insurgency . 
But achieving success in Afghanistan - defined as achieving a sustainable democratic regime able to contain political violence , prevent the reconstruction of a terrorist base with global reach , and dampen a narcotics-funded insurgency that threatens neighboring countries - requires greater policy harmonization among the world powers that have a stake in the outcome . 
Much recent attention has focused on how NATO , Afghan , and Pakistani security forces can collaborate to defeat the insurgency and prevent the country from becoming a terrorist haven again . 
But the past few years have underscored NATO &apos;s inability to achieve sustained political , economic , and security improvements in Afghanistan without more effective international collaboration , particularly with China and Russia . 
For several years , representatives of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , whose dominant members are China and Russia , have identified narcotics trafficking from Afghanistan as a major regional insecurity . 
NATO should use these concerns to explore potential collaboration on Afghan security issues . 
Securing additional assistance from China and Russia - to supplement the support already provided by the SCO &apos;s Central Asian members as well as SCO observers Pakistan and India - is imperative . 
Afghanistan is an area of vital interest to the SCO . 
Its members are eager to assist the Afghan government to counter regional narcotics trafficking and terrorism . 
President Hamid Karzai has been a regular guest at SCO summits since 2004 , and has called on the SCO to make combating narcotics trafficking a priority . 
The members have established an SCO-Afghan Working Group to provide a coordinating mechanism for the large number of SCO initiatives that concern Afghanistan . 
The convening of a special conference under SCO auspices in March 2009 further confirmed the unique status Afghanistan has obtained . 
The SCO and Afghan governments adopted a joint statement that expressed support for the efforts of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) to counter regional narcotics trafficking . 
SCO members showed no interest in contributing troops to the ISAF , but the declaration did encourage &quot; other countries ... to participate in the collective efforts &quot; to combat regional terrorism and to &quot; consider taking part in transiting non-military cargoes needed by ISAF . &quot; 
Several SCO members are already assisting NATO countries to deliver supplies into Afghanistan , while Russia is allowing the United States to ferry military items across its border into Central Asia and onward to Afghanistan . 
This collaboration should be expanded , because China and Russia , perhaps more than any other countries , share common interests with the West in Afghanistan . 
A major drug route passes from Afghanistan through Central Asia and into Russia and Europe . 
The lax regimes on Russia &apos;s borders with the former Soviet republics of Central Asia facilitate the smuggling of narcotics and other contraband . 
The Taliban , and especially al-Qaeda , have also used their positions in Afghanistan to support other Eurasian terrorist movements , especially the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and its various offshoots . 
Although China is not situated along the &quot; Northern Route &quot; through which Afghan narcotics traditionally enter Central Asia and Europe , new trafficking networks have developed since 2005 that transport illicit drugs from Afghanistan through Pakistan and Central Asia into China . 
In addition , Chinese officials remain concerned about the Taliban &apos;s ties with Islamic extremist groups advocating independence for China &apos;s restive Xinjiang region . 
Moreover , China has become a major economic stakeholder in Afghanistan . 
According to Chinese government figures , as of last year , 33 projects in Afghanistan involved Chinese companies . 
In May 2008 , China obtained a major economic stake in Afghanistan when Chinese firms won a $ 3.5 billion contract to develop Afghanistan &apos;s huge Aynak copper field . 
The contract also involves the construction of a power plant and a railroad connecting the mines to China through Pakistan . 
It represents the largest foreign direct investment project in Afghanistan &apos;s history and creates hundreds of jobs . 
Yet Chinese entrepreneurs are reluctant to invest in Afghanistan due to the widespread violence there . 
Insurgent attacks have killed 11 Chinese workers since 2004 . 
Chinese investors would presumably eagerly acquire additional natural resources in Afghanistan if the security situation improved . 
For example , northern Afghanistan has unexplored reserves of oil and natural gas that could help meet China &apos;s energy needs . 
Since SCO members have stated that they are not prepared to provide combat troops to the NATO-led ISAF , closer collaboration should first concentrate on revitalizing the Afghan economy and providing alternative livelihoods to those involved in narcotics . 
Afghanistan &apos;s long-term economic viability depends on the development of improved transportation , communication , and other networks to better integrate the country into the regional economy . 
China and Russia could provide economic assistance and investment to Afghanistan , creating more projects that provide Afghanistan with badly needed jobs and revenue . 
In turn , NATO and Afghan forces could assign troops to protect these projects from further attacks , ideally with some kind of Chinese and Russian financial assistance to blunt objections that Western soldiers are dying to enrich foreign companies . 
China &apos;s close ties to Pakistan could also prove useful in assisting European and American efforts to keep the Pakistani military and intelligence services allied against the Taliban . 
Meanwhile , all these international actors could help fund and train the Afghan army and national police . 
In the end , Afghans themselves will need to sustain the economic and security progress that foreign allies can only help to jumpstart .
