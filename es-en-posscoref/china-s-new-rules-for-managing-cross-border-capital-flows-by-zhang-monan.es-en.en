China &apos;s Cold Eye on Hot Money 
BEIJING - With China feeling the pressure from large-scale inflows of short-term capital , the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) issued a notice in early May outlining a set of measures aimed at controlling &quot; hot money &quot; and reducing external risks . 
Indeed , the new regulations are essential to managing the renminbi &apos;s rapid appreciation and ensuring the accuracy of trade data . 
But will they be enough ? 
A variety of data indicates the massive scale of the inflows . 
In the first quarter of this year , Chinese banks &quot; foreign-exchange purchases skyrocketed to a record ¥ 1.2 trillion ( $ 195 billion ) - more than double last year &apos;s total . 
Such purchases increased by some ¥ 294.3 billion from March to April , which was the fifth consecutive month of growth . 
Over the same period , China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves swelled by $ 128 billion , to $ 3.4 trillion - the largest quarterly increase since 2011 and equal to the total rise in 2012 . 
Given China &apos;s $ 43 billion trade surplus and $ 30 billion in foreign investments during this period , capital inflows must have been a contributing factor . 
Furthermore , since the beginning of this year , Chinese banks &quot; valet foreign-exchange settlement ( foreign-exchange purchases that designated banks make for their clients and themselves ) has outstripped corresponding sales , resulting in a consistently large surplus - also an indication of increased capital inflows . 
The difference , which banks offset through transactions in the inter-bank currency market , has a significant impact on China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves , but is not equivalent to the net change in foreign-exchange reserves during the same period . 
According to SAFE , individuals and institutions exchanged $ 152.2 billion in foreign currency for renminbi through Chinese banks in March , and purchased $ 107.6 billion in foreign currency from financial institutions . 
As a result , the banks &quot; foreign-exchange surplus reached $ 44.6 billion , rising 38 % from February and marking the seventh consecutive month in which bank-to-client transactions created a surplus . 
The consequences of abnormal capital flows into China are becoming increasingly apparent , particularly in foreign-exchange markets . 
Despite slowing GDP growth - currently only 7.7 % annually - the renminbi has appreciated rapidly , reaching a record-high central parity of 6.2082 against the US dollar at the beginning of May . 
With no sign of improved economic fundamentals , the renminbi &apos;s rapid rise must be related to substantial foreign-currency inflows . 
Since China &apos;s current benchmark interest rate is higher than the comparable rate in the United States , individuals and institutions have an incentive to keep renminbi as assets and dollars as debt . 
The current round of monetary easing underway in many advanced countries , together with strong expectations of renminbi appreciation , are also fueling currency speculation , placing further upward pressure on the exchange rate . 
The new SAFE regulations will attempt to curb this trend by imposing , for the first time , limits on net open positions held by Chinese banks with foreign-currency loan / deposit ratios ( LDRs ) exceeding 75 % and by foreign banks with LDRs above 100 % . 
A higher foreign-currency LDR will mean tighter restrictions on long renminbi positions . 
By providing an incentive for banks to hold more foreign-exchange deposits against their loans , the new rules will drive up the price of foreign-currency loans , thereby deterring firms from using dollar loans to speculate on renminbi gains . 
Although the regulations did not take effect until June 1 , their impact was felt immediately . 
The renminbi ended its upward trend against the US dollar on May 6 , closing at 6.1667 , down 112 basis points from the previous trading day - the steepest decline since last December . 
On the same day , stricter controls on capital inflows caused the offshore renminbi to close at 6.1790 against the US dollar , down 0.4 % - the largest drop since January 2012 . 
This suggests that the measures will succeed in stemming upward pressure on the renminbi . 
At the same time , the new regulations aim to end many firms &quot; practice of channeling capital into China disguised as trade bills . 
By inflating export deals in order to move foreign currency - mostly US dollars - into China , firms have evaded capital controls and distorted trade data . 
In order to transform the funds into renminbi outflows , the firms then increase the scale of renminbi settlements in cross-border trades . 
In March and April , cross-border renminbi trade settlement increased by ¥ 412.8 billion , up 57.6 % year on year . 
The growing discrepancies between foreign-trade data and port data have cast doubt on the reliability of the former . 
Last year , China &apos;s exports grew by roughly 6.2 % , and container throughput completed at China &apos;s above-scale ports increased by 6.8 % year on year . 
By contrast , in the first quarter of this year , Chinese foreign trade increased to $ 974.6 billion , reflecting a higher growth rate than in 2012 , while Chinese ports completed 800 million tons of cargo throughput , representing a growth rate that was 4.2 percentage points lower than in the same period last year . 
In March , container traffic at China &apos;s above-scale ports was 15.29 million TEUs ( twenty-foot equivalent units ) , with month-on-month growth 1.7 percentage points slower than in the previous two months . 
Clearly , trade data are being inflated as companies carry out fake transactions to bring capital into the country . 
Firms know that as long as the hot money can reach mainland banks through Hong Kong , they can expect risk-free yields of more than 2 % . 
Considering the renminbi &apos;s recent appreciation , the rate of return could reach 3-4 % . 
According to the new regulations , SAFE will issue a warning ten days after finding that a firm &apos;s capital flows do not match its physical shipments . 
Such firms will be more closely monitored for at least three months , until the relevant figures return to normal . 
One can only hope that these measures will be sufficient to bring China &apos;s export data gradually back to reality . 
At a minimum , the new measures are an important step toward improved management of cross-border capital flows , which is bound to benefit China &apos;s economic transformation and restructuring significantly .
