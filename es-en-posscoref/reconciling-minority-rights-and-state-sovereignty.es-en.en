Reconciling Minority Rights and State Sovereignty 
When the East / West conflict ended ten years ago , many hoped that the democratic changes in Eastern Europe would inspire peaceful resolution between the claims of human rights and those of state sovereignty throughout the world . 
Instead , ethnic conflicts have multiplied , shaking many East European and Asian countries . 
Minority and ethnic rights , it appears , are only demanded at the barrel of a gun , as in Chechnya and East Timor . 
Why is this so ? 
The call for &quot; human rights , &quot; which have been made repeatedly since 1989 , accents the rights of individuals in their struggles against overweening state institutions . 
Freedom of thought , freedom of the press , freedom of assembly : these were the rights that have been stressed most often , probably because they reflected the long struggle to restore the individual liberties smothered under communism . 
But human rights confined to the context of freedom for individuals are insufficient to resolving ethnic conflicts , because ethnic communities and groups cannot use the mechanisms of human rights laws and agreements to secure an effective hearing for their claims . 
States , after all , are usually the forces suppressing their demands . 
Minority and ethnic violence arises out of the sense of frustration that results . 
In order for the international community to use the concept of human rights to resolve and settle ethnic conflicts , a concept of community must be incorporated within the framework of our understanding of human rights . 
Only if groups are offered corresponding instruments to assert their own collective human rights will there arise a chance that ethnic minorities will not resort to violence in order to achieve their ends , but will seek satisfaction in a civic forum . 
A court , a place that furnishes binding jurisdiction for both oppressed minorities and for the countries riven by ethnic disputes is now required . 
We need an International Court for Minorities that would act in similar ways to the International Court of Justice to make decisions concerning the legitimacy of claims in this area . 
Today , the most virulent examples of such minority and ethnic assertions of their group rights are to be found in Afghanistan . 
Ever since the former Soviet Union withdrew its invading army from that country , a political vacuum has existed . 
Civil war , motivated by ethnic and religious divisions , followed . 
The disintegration of what little remained of the central Afghan administration contributed decisively to the establishment of what can only be called sub-state terrorist structures . 
Terrorists rule where the Afghan state once did . 
Why did this happen , and why has this experience been repeated time and again ? 
Why does it appear to be impossible to resolve national and ethnic conflicts by civil , political , and non-violent means ? 
One reason for this failure , I believe , is that the notion of human rights , despite everything that has been done in its name over the past half-century , remains undefined in a critical way . 
After 1989 , human rights were understood as a universal code to tame state despotism . 
It is my belief , however , that human rights cannot be used as a universal idea for resolving ethnic conflicts unless the concept obtains a clear-cut and expanded definition , which includes ethnic and minority rights . 
An International Court for Minorities would provide a forum to define these collective rights . 
What would be its work ? 
First , it would be a place for minorities who consider their legitimate rights within a state as being violated to seek redress . 
Charges could be filed and justice sought . 
The Court would not only allow minority groups to stake their claims , but the accused national state would also have a chance to be heard in order to protect itself , perhaps , against undeserved propaganda . 
Should the Court conclude that the rights of the minority in question were gravely violated it could issue a binding decision demanding that the national state concerned change its laws and practices . 
Should that state fail to do so the International Court for Minorities could demand that the UN Security Council provide protection to the endangered minority . 
This court would be a place for civic and civilized settlement between ethnic minorities and state sovereignty . 
It would thus re-balance the UN charter , which now stipulates that discrimination against individuals is prohibited but says nothing about discrimination of ethnic groups . 
The Court would be a mediator issuing binding decisions and setting standards that would regulate the legitimate rights of minorities , and would so become an global authority against not only state despotism but the license of ethnic groups . 
Of course , no conflict can be resolved in a one-sided manner , benefiting either the state or an ethnic group but not the other . 
Just as states would no longer be able to stress their sovereignty as a trump card over minority claims , ethnic groups could no longer insist that their right to self-determination justified any action . 
No state may exercise its sovereignty without restriction ; not every ethnic group has a right to its own national state . 
The Court &apos;s objective must be discuss the claims made by both parties and seek a just and peaceful resolution . 
The International Court for Minorities that I propose would be both therapeutic and preventative . 
It may moderate and , optimally , settle existing conflicts - say , the Middle East conflict , for example - but it might also identify potential conflicts and hinder them from becoming violent . 
Here , I am particularly concerned about multinational countries such as China , Brazil , Indonesia and India . 
Ethnic conflicts , and in extreme cases ethnic terrorism now pose a clear and present danger to world peace . 
They will continue to pose that threat unless the world acts . 
Creating an International Court of Justice for Minorities offers a means to head-off such violence and secure global peace .
