Occupy the Classroom ? CAMBRIDGE - Early last month , a group of students staged a walkout in Harvard &apos;s popular introductory economics course , Economics 10 , taught by my colleague Greg Mankiw . 
Their complaint : the course propagates conservative ideology in the guise of economic science and helps perpetuate social inequality . 
The students were part of a growing chorus of protest against modern economics as it is taught in the world &apos;s leading academic institutions . 
Economics has always had its critics , of course , but the financial crisis and its aftermath have given them fresh ammunition , seeming to validate long-standing charges against the profession &apos;s unrealistic assumptions , reification of markets , and disregard for social concerns . 
Mankiw , for his part , found the protesting students &quot; poorly informed . &quot; 
Economics does not have an ideology , he retorted . 
Quoting John Maynard Keynes , he pointed out that economics is a method that helps people to think straight and reach the correct answers , with no foreordained policy conclusions . 
Indeed , though you may be excused for skepticism if you have not immersed yourself in years of advanced study in economics , coursework in a typical economics doctoral program produces a bewildering variety of policy prescriptions depending on the specific context . 
Some of the frameworks economists use to analyze the world favor free markets , while others don &apos;t . 
In fact , much economic research is devoted to understanding how government intervention can improve economic performance . 
And non-economic motives and socially cooperative behavior are increasingly part of what economists study . 
As the late great international economist Carlos Diaz-Alejandro once put it , &quot; by now any bright graduate student , by choosing his assumptions .... carefully , can produce a consistent model yielding just about any policy recommendation he favored at the start . &quot; 
And that was in the 1970 &quot; s ! 
An apprentice economist no longer needs to be particularly bright to produce unorthodox policy conclusions . 
Nevertheless , economists get stuck with the charge of being narrowly ideological , because they are their own worst enemy when it comes to applying their theories to the real world . 
Instead of communicating the full panoply of perspectives that their discipline offers , they display excessive confidence in particular remedies - often those that best accord with their own personal ideologies . 
Consider the global financial crisis . 
Macroeconomics and finance did not lack the tools needed to understand how the crisis arose and unfolded . 
Indeed , the academic literature was chock-full of models of financial bubbles , asymmetric information , incentive distortions , self-fulfilling crises , and systemic risk . 
But , in the years leading up to the crisis , many economists downplayed these models &quot; lessons in favor of models of efficient and self-correcting markets , which , in policy terms , resulted in inadequate governmental oversight over financial markets . 
In my book The Globalization Paradox , I contemplate the following thought experiment . 
Let a journalist call an economics professor for his view on whether free trade with country X or Y is a good idea . 
Now let the reporter go undercover as a student in the professor &apos;s advanced graduate seminar on international trade theory . 
Let him pose the same question : Is free trade good ? 
I doubt that the answer will come as quickly and be as succinct this time around . 
In fact , the professor is likely to be stymied by the question . 
&quot; What do you mean by &quot; good ? &quot; &quot; he will ask . 
&quot; And good for whom ? &quot; 
The professor would then launch into a long and tortured exegesis that will ultimately culminate in a heavily hedged statement : &quot; So if the long list of conditions I have just described are satisfied , and assuming we can tax the beneficiaries to compensate the losers , freer trade has the potential to increase everyone &apos;s well-being . &quot; 
If he were in an expansive mood , the professor might add that the effect of free trade on an economy &apos;s growth rate is not clear , either , and depends on an altogether different set of requirements . 
A direct , unqualified assertion about the benefits of free trade has now been transformed into a statement adorned by all kinds of ifs and buts . 
Oddly , the knowledge that the professor willingly imparts with great pride to his advanced students is deemed to be inappropriate ( or dangerous ) for the general public . 
Economics instruction at the undergraduate level suffers from the same problem . 
In our zeal to display the profession &apos;s crown jewels in untarnished form - market efficiency , the invisible hand , comparative advantage - we skip over the real-world complications and nuances , well recognized as they are in the discipline . 
It is as if introductory physics courses assumed a world without gravity , because everything becomes so much simpler that way . 
Applied appropriately and with a healthy dose of common sense , economics would have prepared us for the financial crisis and pointed us in the right direction to fix what caused it . 
But the economics we need is of the &quot; seminar room &quot; variety , not the &quot; rule-of-thumb &quot; kind . 
It is an economics that recognizes its limitations and knows that the right message depends on the context . 
Downplaying the diversity of intellectual frameworks within their own discipline does not make economists better analysts of the real world . 
Nor does it make them more popular .
