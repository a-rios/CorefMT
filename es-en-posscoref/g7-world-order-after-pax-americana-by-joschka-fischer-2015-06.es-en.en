The Irrelevant Seven 
BERLIN - The latest G-7 summit , in the beautiful Alpine setting of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany , has come and gone . 
No longer the G-8 , owing to Russia &apos;s suspension , the forum is again composed exclusively of traditional Western powers . 
At a time when the emergence of large , densely populated economic powerhouses like Brazil , China , India , and Indonesia is challenging Western dominance , many believe that the current international system is due for an overhaul . 
In fact , a new world order is almost certain to emerge - and very soon . 
The shape it takes will be determined by two key phenomena : globalization and digitization . 
Globalization is enabling economies that are not yet fully industrialized to reap the benefits of industrialization and become integrated into global markets - a trend that has redefined the global division of labor and transformed value chains . 
The revolution in digital communication technology has underpinned this shift . 
Of course , the impact of digitization extends beyond economics ; it has broken down many cultural barriers , giving ordinary citizens in even remote regions access to information and ideas from all over the world . 
As globalization-enabled economic development continues to raise incomes , this cultural integration will undoubtedly lead to broader political participation , especially among an increasingly large - and increasingly demanding - middle class . 
Already , this trend is complicating governments &quot; efforts at domestic monitoring and control . 
In terms of the global economic balance of power , however , the impact of globalization and digitization remains difficult to predict . 
While these trends have undoubtedly fueled the economic rise of some developing countries , the West - especially the US - retains a technological and innovative edge . 
Indeed , America &apos;s technological lead - together with its enormous capital assets and dynamic business culture , exemplified in Silicon Valley - could ultimately reinforce its global standing . 
But , with major emerging economies like China and India working hard to foster innovation , while still benefiting from technological catch-up , it is also possible that continued globalization and digitization will propel continued &quot; de-Westernization &quot; of the international order . 
Only time will tell whether these countries will successfully challenge the established powers . 
Even if the US - and , to some extent , Western Europe - does retain a competitive edge , it is unlikely to retain the kind of global geopolitical control that it has had since World War II and , especially , since the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse left it as the world &apos;s sole superpower . 
In fact , even though the US remains dominant in military , political , economic , technological , and cultural terms , its global hegemony already seems to have slipped away . 
The reality is that America &apos;s global geopolitical supremacy did not last long at all . 
After becoming overstretched in a series of unwinnable wars against much weaker - and yet irrepressible - opponents , the US was forced to turn inward . 
The power vacuums that it left behind have produced regional crises - most notably , in the Middle East , Ukraine , and the South and East China Seas - and have contributed to a wider shift toward instability and disorder . 
The question now is what will replace Pax Americana . 
One possibility is a return to the kind of decentralized order that existed before the Industrial Revolution . 
At that time , China and India were the world &apos;s largest economies , a status that they will regain in this century . 
When they do , they might join the traditional powers - the US and Europe , as well as Russia - to create a sort of &quot; pentarchy &quot; resembling the European balance-of-power system of the nineteenth century . 
But there are serious questions about most of these countries &quot; capacity to assume global leadership roles . 
With the European Union facing unprecedented challenges and crisis , it is impossible to predict its future . 
Russia &apos;s future is even more uncertain ; so far , it has been unable to rid itself of the phantom pains over its lost empire , much less arrest the deterioration of its society and economy . 
India has the potential to play an important role internationally , but it has a long way to go before it is stable and prosperous enough to do so . 
That leaves only the US and China . 
Many have predicted the emergence of a new bipolar world order , or even a new Cold War , with China replacing the Soviet Union as America &apos;s rival . 
But this , too , seems unlikely , if only because , in today &apos;s interconnected world , the US and China cannot allow conflict and competition to obscure their common interests . 
As it stands , China is financing America &apos;s public debt , and , in a sense , subsidizing its global authority . 
And China could not have achieved rapid economic growth and modernization without access to US markets . 
Simply put , the US and China depend on each other . 
That will go a long way toward mitigating the risks that a new global power &apos;s emergence inevitably generates . 
Against this background , it seems likely that the new world order will resemble the bipolar order of the Cold War - but only on the surface . 
Underneath , it will be characterized by engagement and mutual accommodation , in the name of shared interests . 
The G-7 represents a dying order . 
It is time to prepare for the G-2 .
