Forging Asia &apos;s Missing Links 
MANILA - China &apos;s government has just announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will be the main speaker at the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia , where the roster of leaders expected to participate is a virtual Who &apos;s Who of the continent : President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan , President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan , President Faure Gnassingbe of Togo , Prime Minister S. Bayar of Mongolia , Prime Minister Thein Sein of Myanmar , Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam , Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand , and Kopsak Saphawasu , Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand . 
Such meetings are vital for Asia , because the continent lacks the dense institutional infrastructure that Europe has built up over the past five decades . 
This year &apos;s Boao Forum has become even more important because of the cancellation of the East Asia summit due to the action of violent protestors . 
Multinational companies increasingly treat Asia as a single economic space , at least as far as production is concerned . 
But , although Asia is becoming more like Europe in terms of economic integration , political and diplomatic integration lags behind . 
So , because Asia lacks such institutional arrangements , personal diplomacy of the type that the Boao Forum represents , like the annual global winter gathering at Davos , remains vitally important . 
Indeed , it was at last year &apos;s Boao Forum that Chinese President Hu Jintao began to express public optimism about the positive trends in Mainland China-Taiwan relations . 
That rapprochement was possible because Taiwan &apos;s then newly elected vice president was given permission by China to attend the forum , where he was able to meet informally with President Hu . 
Last February , I headed a 40-member trade delegation to Taipei . 
That mission &apos;s highlight was my dialogue with Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou , who stressed the importance of connecting Taiwan to the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area ( CAFTA ) in the light of warmer relations developing between the Mainland and Taiwan . 
At this time of economic turmoil around the world , increasing Taiwan &apos;s formal economic links with China and its regional partners can only benefit everyone involved , because an inevitable side-effect will be a lessening of tension . 
Unfortunately , some analysts suggest that a Taiwan-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement of the likes of CAFTA may not yet be possible , so , in the interim , President Ma &apos;s administration is striving to achieve separate free-trade agreements with various ASEAN members . 
Understandably , the opposition Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has taken the stand that Taiwan should seek closer ties with ASEAN countries rather than depend too much on Mainland China , but Ma does not see the two efforts as being mutually exclusive . 
From a wider perspective , Ma and I exchanged views on the synergy of an emerging &quot; Central East Asia Growth Polygon &quot; ( CEAGPOL ) consisting of the Philippines , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Macau , and the Mainland Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian - plus , eventually , Hainan , Okinawa , and Guam / Marianas . 
With goodwill on all sides , real advantages can materialize from building up this informal grouping , as it is a gateway to the huge markets of Southeast and Northeast Asia . 
An economic bonus of such an effort for the entire region would come from the opening of direct flights and sea transport across the Taiwan Strait . 
CEAGPOL could even become a building block for a Northeast Asian version of ASEAN - an &quot; Association of Northeast Asian Nations . &quot; 
As a result of historical suspicion between China , Japan , and Korea , Northeast Asia &apos;s economic heavyweights are the world &apos;s last remaining regional bloc that still lacks an inter-governmental organization of the likes of ASEAN . 
The European Union is even more instructive , because centuries of war , culminating in the two World Wars of the twentieth century , inspired , rather than deterred , European economic , political and security integration . 
At this time of worldwide uncertainty , Asia-Pacific leaders must redouble their efforts to exploit their partnerships and strategic combinations in order to foster stability and growth . 
The easing of tensions between China and Taiwan can , perhaps , set a tone for all of Northeast Asia . 
At the 30th anniversary of the &quot; Message to Compatriots in Taiwan &quot; last January , President Hu offered six proposals to improve relations : 
1 . 
Abandon the Taiwan independence movement ; 
2 . 
Stop confrontation and reach peaceful agreements ; 
3 . 
Increase military contacts / exchanges ; 
4 . 
Discuss Taiwan &apos;s participation in international organizations under the &quot; One China &quot; umbrella ; 
5 . 
Establish a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement ( CECA ) ; and 
6 . 
Promote China &apos;s traditional civilization with strengthened spiritual ties . 
There is now real hope that talks along these lines can succeed . 
China-US talks on defense cooperation had earlier stalled because of such arms negotiations . 
They have since been restarted , an olive branch sent to the Obama administration by China &apos;s government . 
All three parties involved will need to tread with care to make certain that the thaw in China-Taiwan relations is not set back by this proposed arms deal .
