Blood Politics 
LONDON - The race for the leadership of the British Labour Party isn &apos;t normally a world-shaking event . 
Politics , or at least the exercise of power , was traditionally a family affair . 
Kings typically hankered after male heirs , because power was vested through filial lineage , and distributed through tribal affiliations . 
Hereditary power did not necessarily make for warm and open family relations . 
Henry VIII was willing to execute two wives and overturn Christendom in pursuit of a son . 
There are examples , in polygamous societies , of royal concubines murdering each other &apos;s children in order to assure the predominance of their genetic line . 
The Ottomans introduced the practice of &quot; judicial royal fratricide , &quot; supposedly to prevent civil war . 
Whether it involved absolute loyalty or murderous rivalry , traditional politics was rarely divorced from personal passion . 
Not so in modern Western democracies , where personal passions are , at least in theory , supposed to be completely separate from the impersonal representation of group interests . 
Democracy , in its Greek origins , began with the creation of a public sphere distinct from the family and its intense emotions . 
The division is in a sense inscribed in the democratic spectacle . 
After presidential debates in the United States or Britain , the contenders , who may have been accusing each other of the most unforgivable of sins , shake hands vigorously and give each other genial and encouraging smiles . 
No matter how much Barack Obama may have loathed the views of George W. Bush , he had to be initiated into state secrets by the former president , in a confidential - and undoubtedly genial - meeting . 
In parliamentary debates , fierce ideological battles may be the order of the day , but ad hominem attacks are off limits . 
This is undoubtedly to the good , and necessary to the conduct of orderly democratic life ; but to those not used to it , the ability to combine enmity with bonhomie can seem counterintuitive . 
Indeed , it may be that the transition from passionate to impersonal politics is one of the most difficult challenges facing democratizers everywhere . 
In pre-1989 Eastern Europe , for example , politicians &quot; ideological positions were seen as inseparable from their moral , or human , self . 
Those who were on the wrong side of the political divide were not only guilty of erroneous views ; they were seen as wrong in their essence , and therefore to be condemned and hated . 
The idea that you could treat political enemies jovially , and perhaps have a drink with them after hours - or enter into a coalition government with them - can seem not only unnatural , but even a bit indecent , in such circumstances . 
Indeed , in some young democracies , or more volatile cultures , the suspension of personal feeling is not always successfully maintained . 
Just last year , one could witness fistfights in parliaments ranging from Iraq to Taiwan , Turkey , and , most spectacularly , Ukraine . 
To us , such behavior looks untoward , or even uncivilized ; to the participants , it is probably experienced as a natural overflow of righteous feeling . 
Clearly , parliamentary brawls are not a desirable modus operandi . 
The Miliband race was an extreme example of what might be called counter-nepotism - the attempt to abstract the politician from all private attachments . 
As the two brothers sat on platforms together , challenging each other &apos;s views , they tried to maintain the double fiction that , on the one hand , there was no special bond between them , and , on the other , that their sometimes fierce disagreements did not taint their fraternal affections . 
For a while , everybody played politely along ; but the tricky double-think involved in this was exposed when the younger brother , Ed , won the leadership , by a razor-thin margin , in a last-minute upset . 
Suddenly , this didn &apos;t seem quite right . 
In the media , comparisons to Esau &apos;s theft of Jacob &apos;s birthright and to various Shakespearean tragedies began to abound . 
David Miliband &apos;s decision to retreat from front-line politics made it evident that a symbolic beheading had taken place - and one wonders if Ed Miliband won &apos;t be haunted , and therefore hampered , Ã  la Macbeth , by the psychological violence he committed . 
In judging candidates for high office , we are encouraged to eschew &quot; personality politics , &quot; and to disregard such aspects of politicians &quot; identities as their spiritual lives , their private behavior ( unless obvious transgressions are committed ) , and their appearance and aesthetic tastes . 
In practice , few of us can manage to compartmentalize our perceptions - and , perhaps , doing so would not be desirable . 
We may not want politicians to be driven by self-interest , but we need to acknowledge that they have selves , which are formed by a multitude of factors - and passions . 
In other words , if we do not want to reduce our vision of politics to policy processing , we need to remember - if only for the sake of fuller and more realistic judgment - that politicians are human , too .
