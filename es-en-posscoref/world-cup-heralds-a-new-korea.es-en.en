World Cup Heralds a New Korea 
The euphoria of fans whose team wins a major sporting event is ephemeral . 
But , prominent professors at Korean universities tell me that the unprecedented success of the Korean team in the current World Cup competition is causing a turning point in Korean attitudes towards their own society and economy . 
Why ? 
Many Koreans , especially those who studied or lived in the West , complain about the &quot; cronyism , &quot; and the resulting importance of &quot; connections &quot; in all walks of Korean life , which they see as pervasive features of Korean society . 
They claim that such rampant cronyism is preventing Korea from catching up economically with the West , despite the fact that Korea soon will have as much human capital as western countries . 
To understand Korean cronyism we have to see it as one aspect of a set of related social conventions . 
Koreans accept a sense of knowing one &apos;s place in society that seems extreme to Americans . 
In social interactions , and also in business dealings , Koreans maintain a hierarchy that seems to weigh age more highly than performance . 
Also , although admission to elite universities is as meritocratic in Korea as in the West , the outcome of the university entrance competition has a more important and more permanent effect on one &apos;s place in Korean society . 
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that in America people have to prove themselves continually , whereas in traditional Korean society people have only to prove themselves once , then they can be set for life due in large measure to the network of crony contacts that initial success will have provided . 
What do Korean cronyism and related social conventions have to do with the World Cup ? 
In the past cronyism apparently has been as pervasive in the selection of Korean teams for international sports competitions as in other areas of Korean society . 
But , two years ago when the Korean soccer football association hired the Dutchman , Guus Hiddink , to coach the Korean national soccer team , Hiddink made it clear that he would select his players based on merit alone . 
The performance of the Korean team in the 2002 World Cup competition is demonstrating to every Korean in a way that is easily seen that meritocracy yields better results than cronyism . 
It also helps that Hiddink has been able to use his coaching skills to bring out in his team the strengths of the Korean national character : intelligence , discipline , tenacity , and perseverance . 
Of course , Korean traditionalists reject criticism of what westernized Koreans call cronyism . 
Traditionalists argue that criticism of cronyism is really criticism of social solidarity and responsibility , which they see as positive features of Korean society . 
Traditionalists also argue that meritocracy implies individualism , and that too much individualism and too little social solidarity and responsibility are negative features of western society . 
Some traditionalists even might claim that they do not want Koreans to be as rich as westerners if that requires Koreans to be as individualistic as westerners . 
The Hiddink phenomenon did not emerge suddenly out of thin air . 
The accumulation of gradual changes that have already occurred in Korean society made it acceptable to import a westerner to coach the Korean national soccer team and to allow him to establish a meritocratic regime . 
But Hiddink has expedited the process of change within Korean society , and his success has made it look revolutionary . 
It remains to be seen how fast , in what ways , and with what effects , Korean society will continue to change . 
Koreans are talking about learning the lessons of Hiddink . 
But the western model of a meritocratic society is not easy to emulate . 
A soccer team is a relatively simple organization . 
Implementing the lessons of Hiddink throughout Korean society will present more difficult challenges . 
Whatever the outcome , it seems that in the case of the 2002 World Cup the effects of success in a major sporting event will not be ephemeral .
