And Free Flows the Nile 
NEW DELHI - For 18 days , during the ebb and flow of protest , it did not seem possible that the end of the Egyptian Revolution would come so suddenly , in a terse announcement that lasted no more than a half-minute : &quot; President Hosni Mubarak has relinquished office .... &quot; 
In the days and weeks ahead , there could arise occasions when the news from Cairo is not uplifting , but let us never forget that Egypt has taken a giant step , which in reality is a giant step for all Arabs . 
After all , Egypt is the heart , brain , and nerve center of the Arab world . 
True , it once spawned the radical Muslim Brotherhood , but it also gave birth to Islamic socialism and anti-colonialism , Arab unity , and now a democratic affirmation of the people &apos;s will . 
Pernicious talk that Arabs do not want democracy has been exposed as the big lie it is . 
Egypt , in the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore &apos;s memorable words , is the land &quot; where the head is ( now ) held high and the mind is ( now ) without fear ... &quot; The consequences will be vast . 
Ancient Arab lands are bestirred . 
Decades-old , apparently immovable autocracies are finding their hold on power unhinged ; change is invading their static environs . 
Yesterday &apos;s treaties , particularly those with the United States and Israel , will no longer inspire the same type of confidence they have long had as instruments of state policy . 
Memory of these 18 days is so crowded that it is difficult to separate one event from another , one phase from the next : the dramatic , the moving , the bizarre , and the unreal from the bathetic . 
But the thread that united all , the theme that remained unerringly constant , was the yearning for &quot; change &quot; - immediate , real , and tangible , not a promise or a tantalizing , unreachable mirage . 
Will this yearning travel beyond the Nile , as it did from Tunis to Cairo ? 
This question haunts other Arab portals of power . 
And not just Arab ; globally , foreign policies are being hurriedly - and somewhat confusedly - revised and rewritten . 
This is why US policy oscillated so disconcertingly from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s &quot; Do not rush the pace or else the pro-democracy movement could well be hijacked &quot; to President Barack Obama &apos;s emphatic call for &quot; change now . &quot; 
Of course , a grave question arises about the now-ruling Supreme Council of the Military High Command in Egypt : How can the enforcers of the status quo become the agents of change ? 
But , then , military rule is only a temporary measure , or so we reason . 
The great Tunisian poet Abul-Qasim Al Shabi has captured poignantly the spirit of Egypt &apos;s saga : &quot; If one day the people want life , then fate will arise ... night fade away , chains broken ... &quot; That , in essence , is what the young in Egypt have done . 
Their idiom is current ; their instruments of change are today &apos;s electronic media . 
They - and we - are very far from the world that Mubarak , or the great Gamal Abdel Nasser , knew and understood . 
The Egyptian revolution now faces the exacting task that confronts all successful revolutions : how to define the future . 
Like the Ottoman Empire &apos;s fragmentation in 1922 or Nasser &apos;s overthrow of King Farouk &apos;s regime in 1952 , the current transformation , too , must be shaped . 
And how that future is shaped will determine whether or not Mubarak &apos;s end marks the beginning of political transformation throughout the Middle East . 
That is the possibility that is shaking governments from Washington to Beijing . 
It is not just the reliability of the Suez Canal and oil exports that are now in doubt ; decades of fixed strategic certainties must now be reexamined . 
Consider Israel , which has watched the events in Cairo with a degree of worry unfelt since January 1979 , when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini unseated the Shah of Iran . 
That strategic nightmare cost Israel and the US their closest ally in the region , one that was soon transformed into an implacable enemy . 
Israel &apos;s two most recent wars - against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 , and against Hamas in Gaza in 2009 - were fought against groups sponsored , supplied , and trained by Iran . 
Clearly , Israeli-Palestinian negotiations will also now lie unattended as Israel concentrates on developments in Egypt . 
Above all , Israel must wonder if the peace treaty with Egypt will hold , and , if not , how to carry out the massive restructuring of its defense posture that will be required . 
But it is not only the fate of Israel that has now shocked US policy , in particular , to its core . 
Egypt , after all , has been the cornerstone of America &apos;s balancing act in the Middle East - and the Islamic world - for three decades . 
The Egypt-Israel peace treaty has kept Egypt comfortably neutralized , freeing the US to commit its strategic resources elsewhere . 
In turn , Egypt , propped up by massive US aid , has secured the region from a larger conflagration , even though the Israel-Palestine conflict has continued to smolder . 
Herein lies the core of the dilemma for the US : it wants Egypt &apos;s basic state apparatus to survive , so that the levers of power do not fall into the wrong hands . 
This requires the US to be seen as siding with the public &apos;s demand for change , yet to avoid being identified with political immobility . 
There is reason to feel reassured by Obama &apos;s reactions . 
He termed Mubarak &apos;s departure a display of &quot; the power of human dignity , &quot; adding that &quot; the people of Egypt have spoken , their voices have been heard , and Egypt will never be the same . &quot; 
But nothing that Obama , or anyone else , says can answer the question now occupying the attention of senior US officials : Will the coming of popular sovereignty to Egypt inevitably lead to anti-Americanism ?
