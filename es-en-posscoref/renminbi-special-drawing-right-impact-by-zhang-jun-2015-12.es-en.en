Great Expectations for the Renminbi 
SHANGHAI - The International Monetary Fund &apos;s recent decision to add the Chinese renminbi to the basket of currencies that determine the value of its reserve asset , the Special Drawing Right , has captured headlines around the world . 
But the SDR itself has not exactly dominated discussions - much less transactions - since its creation in 1969 . 
So does the decision really matter ? 
In fact , given the SDR &apos;s very limited role in the global economy , the move will have few concrete effects in the short term . 
In the longer term , however , the attention the decision has attracted could spur wider use of the SDR . 
More important , at least for now , the decision amounts to an endorsement by the IMF of the progress China has made toward renminbi internationalization , while reflecting - and reinforcing - China &apos;s growing economic clout . 
Since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 , its GDP has surged from about CN ¥ 20 trillion ( $ 3.1 trillion ) to CN ¥ 60 trillion . 
In 2009 China became the world &apos;s largest exporter . 
And last year , according to the IMF , China overtook the United States to become the world &apos;s largest economy ( in purchasing power parity terms ) . 
The acknowledgement by the IMF board , which represents all 188 of the Fund &apos;s member countries , that the renminbi meets &quot; all existing criteria &quot; for inclusion in the SDR basket is another step forward along this path of progress . 
It is important to note , however , that meeting &quot; all existing criteria &quot; does not place the renminbi on par with , say , the US dollar - or , indeed , with any of the other SDR currencies ( the euro , the British pound , or the Japanese yen ) - in terms of international usage . 
On the contrary , despite China &apos;s massive GDP and trade volume , the renminbi &apos;s share in the global foreign-exchange market remains negligible . 
And the process of internationalizing the renminbi is far from complete . 
Given this , the IMF could easily have rejected the renminbi &apos;s bid for inclusion in the SDR basket , as it did five years ago . 
But the IMF seemed eager ( especially in the last few months ) to bring China on board this time around . 
What brought about the Fund &apos;s change of heart ? 
The explanation , I believe , lies largely in the August 11 devaluation of the renminbi , after a decade of appreciation . 
By moving away from the renminbi peg to the US dollar - an undoubtedly risky move - China demonstrated its willingness to allow market forces to establish the exchange rate in the long term . 
Of course , now that the renminbi has been accepted into the SDR basket , China must prove that it can manage dramatic currency depreciation effectively and continue to make progress toward internationalization . 
This will be no easy feat , especially at a time of slowing economic growth . 
A gradual depreciation would create expectations of further exchange-rate weakening , thereby fueling capital outflows and undermining companies &quot; willingness to use renminbi in exports and imports . 
The renminbi offshore market , which has strengthened considerably over the last few years , would lose value , forcing the People &apos;s Bank of China to channel foreign-exchange reserves toward that market to offset the decline . 
Already , China &apos;s reserves have declined considerably - by $ 87.2 billion last month alone . 
Despite these challenges , China &apos;s leaders anticipate that , in the longer term , the renminbi &apos;s inclusion in the SDR basket will help to bring about the currency &apos;s steady appreciation and , by serving as a kind of certification of credibility , support its continued internationalization . 
They are probably right . 
Nonetheless , what will really drive the renminbi &apos;s continued rise will not be the SDR ( though it will help ) , but China &apos;s own long-term economic performance . 
Indeed , as Arvind Subramanian has argued , China &apos;s share of global GDP and trade is what makes the renminbi likely to become a global reserve currency . 
The question is when . 
According to Subramanian , it could occur as early as 2020 . 
Chinese researchers are somewhat less optimistic . 
Five years ago , Pan Yingli of Shanghai Jiao Tong University projected that , without accounting for other currencies &quot; incumbency advantage , the renminbi &apos;s share of foreign-exchange reserves worldwide could reach 26 % by 2025 ( about the current level of the euro ) . 
Accounting for the incumbency advantage , the share falls to 10 % . 
But even at that level , the renminbi could be the world &apos;s third reserve currency , after the dollar and the euro , by 2030 . 
In short , the inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR basket does matter , and not just symbolically . 
By demonstrating its confidence in the renminbi &apos;s continued rise , the IMF has reinforced global expectations of - and lent implicit support to - the renminbi &apos;s progress toward internationalization . 
Whatever challenges China faces , its steady march to the forefront of the global economy is set to continue .
