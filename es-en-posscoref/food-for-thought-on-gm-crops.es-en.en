Food for Thought on GM Crops 
COPENHAGEN - As the world continues to debate the impact of climate-change while seeking a new global treaty to prevent it , Kenya has endured a prolonged drought followed by heavy flooding . 
Maize plants have withered , hitting poor rural families hard . 
People are starving , and many of those who survive are grossly malnourished . 
There is hope : next year , the Kenyan authorities will begin testing maize varieties that they hope will provide high yields and prove more resistant to drought . 
One reason is that such crops rely on research tools used in molecular biology , including genetic engineering . 
African governments have been told that genetic engineering is dangerous , with many Europeans and their national governments - as well as transnational NGOs such as Greenpeace - determined to stay away from it . 
Unfortunately , Kenya &apos;s government listened and did not permit their farmers to grow genetically modified ( GM ) maize , even though it has been approved , sown , harvested , and eaten by both humans and animals in South Africa , Argentina , Brazil , the United States , and other countries for many years . 
Although Kenya has a well-functioning and well-funded agricultural research system , the government has not even permitted field tests of GM crop varieties . 
Molecular biology has provided excellent tools to address health , environmental , and food problems such as those seen in Kenya . 
The question is whether decision-makers are prepared to use them . 
Obviously , most EU countries &quot; governments are not . 
Are the risks so high that they justify the suffering that could have been avoided ? 
GM foods have now been on the market in the US for more than 12 years . 
Most of the food consumed by Americans is either genetically modified or exposed to genetic modification somewhere in the production process . 
There is no evidence of even a single case of illness or death as a result - in the US or anywhere else where GM foods are consumed . 
Similarly , GM feed has not resulted in any illness or death in animals . 
It is unusual that a new technology has no negative side effects . 
Just think of all the deaths that the wheel has caused , not to mention the side effects of much of the medicine we take . 
What , then , is the danger of GM foods ? 
Opponents of genetic engineering in food and agriculture have several arguments , none of which appears to be valid . 
First , &quot; genetic engineering cannot solve the hunger and food insecurity problem . &quot; 
This is correct : GM foods cannot singlehandedly solve the problem , but they can be an important part of the solution . 
A second argument is that &quot; we do not know enough about the effects and side effects . &quot; 
Since some of the groups opposing GM organisms destroy the field trials that could give us more knowledge , a more pertinent argument might be that many opponents do not want us to know more . 
Third , &quot; we should not play God . &quot; 
Fourth , pollen from GM crops may &quot; contaminate &quot; organically produced food . 
This , of course , would be an issue only with open pollinating plants , and only if the definition of &quot; organically produced &quot; excludes GM , something that is difficult to justify , since genes are as organic as anything . 
Lastly , some argue that if farmers are permitted to sow GM varieties , they become dependent on large seed producers such as Monsanto , which have patent protection - and thus a monopoly - on the seed . 
But private corporations undertake only about half of all agricultural research , whether or not it involves genetic engineering . 
The other half is done by public research systems using public funds . 
The fact that virtually all US maize and soybean farmers , and all papaya farmers , use GM seed indicates that it is good business for them . 
Similarly , a large share of farmers - most of them smallholders - in Argentina , Brazil , South Africa , China , India , and other countries , prefer GM seed because they make more money from the resulting crops . 
Large reductions in the use of insecticides cut costs for growers of GM varieties , while providing an important health and ecological benefit . 
But maybe those who oppose private seed corporations are really against capitalism and the market economy rather than GM seed . 
If so , they should choose an issue for their campaign that would be less damaging to the poor and hungry in developing countries . 
The global food crisis of 2007-2008 was a warning of what the future may hold in store if we continue with business as usual , including misplaced opposition to the use of modern science in food and agriculture . 
European and developing-country governments urgently need to reverse their current adverse position on GM organisms in order to help ensure sustainable food security for all . 
Such a reversal would reduce hunger , poverty , and malnutrition ; help protect our planet &apos;s natural resources ; and slow the emission of greenhouse gases from agriculture . 
All that is needed is political will .
