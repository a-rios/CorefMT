Lessons from Tiananmen 
NEW YORK - It is a chilling thought that exactly twenty years after the &quot; Tiananmen Massacre &quot; few young citizens of the People &apos;s Republic of China have much idea of what happened on that occasion . 
Many unarmed Chinese citizens were killed by People &apos;s Liberation Army troops on June 4 , 1989 , not only in the vicinity of Tiananmen Square , but in cities all over China . 
Most were not students , who started the peaceful demonstrations against corruption and autocracy , but ordinary workers , the sort of people a Communist Party ought to be standing up for . 
Young people don &apos;t know , because most parents have shut up about it , lest they get themselves and their children in trouble , and because the subject is never mentioned in the official Chinese media ; it is a taboo . 
Websites mentioning the events of 1989 are closed down . 
Emails are intercepted . 
People who still insist on talking about it in public are frequently arrested . 
Zhao Ziyang was General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1989 . 
Although no democrat himself , his sympathies were with the student demonstrators . 
Because he opposed the hard-liners in his own government , he was put under house arrest until his death in 2005 , and his memoirs had to be smuggled out of the country on cassettes , disguised as Peking Opera recordings . 
They have just been published in English and Chinese , but cannot be legally distributed in China . 
Zhao &apos;s book will doubtlessly inspire more debates on what lessons we should draw from &quot; June Fourth . &quot; 
These are necessary debates . 
If only they could take place in China . 
One strong school of thought that emerged almost as soon as the killing began in 1989 , is that the more radical student leaders had been reckless . 
It should have been clear to them that a violent crackdown was inevitable . 
By provoking the regime , the students derailed any chance of slow political reform , which their more moderate elders had carefully set in train . 
Indeed , so proponents of this school often add , China was not yet ready for democracy . 
Indeed , the radical student leaders had no more understanding of democracy than the Communist leaders they opposed . 
Life in the capital , and many Chinese cities , had been severely disrupted . 
The Chinese government was heavy-handed , to be sure , but had a perfect right to restore order in the streets . 
If the student leaders had really wanted to take over the government , and use violence to do so , this theory would be convincing . 
Violent revolutions are rarely followed by liberal regimes . 
There is , however , no evidence that even the most radical students ever had such ambitions , and the demonstrations had been entirely peaceful . 
All the demonstrators had asked for was free speech , dialogue with the government , independent unions , and an end to official corruption . 
As to whether the demonstrations were doomed to end in failure and bloodshed , this too is easy to say in hindsight . 
History may never repeat itself precisely , but certain patterns can be discerned . 
Demonstrations alone almost never topple a regime , but they can do so in combination with other political shifts , which can happen suddenly . 
When East Germans protested against their Communist autocrats in 1989 , they were not assured of success either . 
Indeed , some Party bosses wanted to bring out the tanks , just like their comrades in Beijing . 
South Korean students filling the streets of Seoul in 1986 could not have ended the authoritarian military government either . 
Again , it was a combination of events - pressure from the United States , the impending Olympic Games , and the presence of plausible opposition politicians - that did it . 
The students on Tiananmen Square could not have known what was going on inside the closed Communist regime . 
There were serious splits , but no one could have known exactly what the end results would be . 
In the event , Zhao Ziyang &apos;s conciliatory approach , which might have led to concessions , which in turn might have opened possibilities for a more open political system , lost out . 
Hardliners , who refused to give up their monopoly on power , won . 
Would Zhao have prevailed , had the students retreated ? 
Unlikely . 
In any case , it was not the place of the students , or the workers who supported them , to back any particular faction in the government . 
They lacked the authority . 
They were not politicians . 
All they asked for was more freedom . 
On June 4 , 1989 , thousands of Chinese were killed for demanding less than that . 
The best way to remember them is to reaffirm their right to liberties that millions of people , in the West , and in many parts of Asia , take for granted . 
The worst way is to blame a few students who insisted on that right until it was too late .
