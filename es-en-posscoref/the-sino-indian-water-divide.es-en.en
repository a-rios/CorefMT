The Sino-Indian Water Divide 
NEW DELHI - As China and India gain economic heft , they are drawing ever more international attention at the time of an ongoing global shift of power to Asia . 
Their underlying strategic dissonance and rivalry , however , usually attracts less notice . 
As its power grows , China seems determined to choke off Asian competitors , a tendency reflected in its hardening stance toward India . 
This includes aggressive patrolling of the disputed Himalayan frontier by the People &apos;s Liberation Army , many violations of the line of control separating the two giants , new assertiveness concerning India &apos;s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state - which China claims as its own - and vituperative attacks on India in the state-controlled Chinese media . 
The issues that divide India and China , however , extend beyond territorial disputes . 
Water is becoming a key security issue in Sino-Indian relations and a potential source of enduring discord . 
China and India already are water-stressed economies . 
The spread of irrigated farming and water-intensive industries , together with the demands of a rising middle class , have led to a severe struggle for more water . 
Indeed , both countries have entered an era of perennial water scarcity , which before long is likely to equal , in terms of per capita availability , the water shortages found in the Middle East . 
Rapid economic growth could slow in the face of acute scarcity if demand for water continues to grow at its current frantic pace , turning China and India - both food-exporting countries - into major importers , a development that would accentuate the global food crisis . 
Even though India has more arable land than China - 160.5 million hectares compared to 137.1 million hectares - Tibet is the source of most major Indian rivers . 
The Tibetan plateau &apos;s vast glaciers , huge underground springs and high altitude make Tibet the world &apos;s largest freshwater repository after the polar icecaps . 
Indeed , all of Asia &apos;s major rivers , except the Ganges , originate in the Tibetan plateau . 
Even the Ganges &quot; two main tributaries flow in from Tibet . 
But China is now pursuing major inter-basin and inter-river water transfer projects on the Tibetan plateau , which threatens to diminish international-river flows into India and other co-riparian states . 
Before such hydro-engineering projects sow the seeds of water conflict , China ought to build institutionalized , cooperative river-basin arrangements with downstream states . 
Upstream dams , barrages , canals , and irrigation systems can help fashion water into a political weapon that can be wielded overtly in a war , or subtly in peacetime to signal dissatisfaction with a co-riparian state . 
Even denial of hydrological data in a critically important season can amount to the use of water as a political tool . 
Flash floods in recent years in two Indian frontier states - Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh - served as an ugly reminder of China &apos;s lack of information-sharing on its upstream projects . 
Such leverage could in turn prompt a downstream state to build up its military capacity to help counterbalance this disadvantage . 
In fact , China has been damming most international rivers flowing out of Tibet , whose fragile ecosystem is already threatened by global warming . 
The only rivers on which no hydro-engineering works have been undertaken so far are the Indus , whose basin falls mostly in India and Pakistan , and the Salween , which flows into Burma and Thailand . 
Local authorities in Yunnan province , however , are considering damming the Salween in the quake-prone upstream region . 
India &apos;s government has been pressing China for transparency , greater hydrological data-sharing , and a commitment not to redirect the natural flow of any river or diminish cross-border water flows . 
But even a joint expert-level mechanism - set up in 2007 merely for &quot; interaction and cooperation &quot; on hydrological data - has proven of little value . 
The most dangerous idea China is contemplating is the northward rerouting of the Brahmaputra river , known as Yarlung Tsangpo to Tibetans , but which China has renamed Yaluzangbu . 
It is the world &apos;s highest river , and also one of the fastest-flowing . 
Diversion of the Brahmaputra &apos;s water to the parched Yellow river is an idea that China does not discuss in public , because the project implies environmental devastation of India &apos;s northeastern plains and eastern Bangladesh , and would thus be akin to a declaration of water war on India and Bangladesh . 
Nevertheless , an officially blessed book published in 2005 , Tibet &apos;s Waters Will Save China , openly championed the northward rerouting of the Brahmaputra . 
Moreover , the Chinese desire to divert the Brahmaputra by employing &quot; peaceful nuclear explosions &quot; to build an underground tunnel through the Himalayas found expression in the international negotiations in Geneva in the mid-1990s on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) . 
China sought unsuccessfully to exempt PNEs from the CTBT , a pact still not in force . 
The issue now is not whether China will reroute the Brahmaputra , but when . 
Once authorities complete their feasibility studies and the diversion scheme begins , the project will be presented as a fait accompli . 
China already has identified the bend where the Brahmaputra forms the world &apos;s longest and deepest canyon - just before entering India - as the diversion point . 
China &apos;s ambitions to channel Tibetan waters northward have been whetted by two factors : the completion of the Three Gorges Dam , which , despite the project &apos;s glaring environmental pitfalls , China trumpets as the greatest engineering feat since the construction of the Great Wall ; and the power of President Hu Jintao , whose background fuses two key elements - water and Tibet . 
Hu , a hydrologist by training , owes his swift rise in the Communist Party hierarchy to the brutal martial-law crackdown he carried out in Tibet in 1989 . 
China &apos;s hydro-engineering projects and plans are a reminder that Tibet is at the heart of the India-China divide . 
Tibet ceased to be a political buffer when China annexed it nearly six decades ago . 
But Tibet can still become a political bridge between China and India . 
For that to happen , water has to become a source of cooperation , not conflict .
