Career Counseling for the Twenty-First Century 
As a college professor , I hear a lot of career concerns . 
As my students prepare to enter working lives that will last 50 years or more , practically all of them try to be futurists in choosing the skills in which to invest . 
If they pick an occupation that declines in the next half-century , they may deeply regret it . 
They know that a mid-life career change is difficult , so they want to make the right choice while they are very young . 
From what my students tell me , there is a widespread fear of &quot; commoditization &quot; of jobs in the modern , information technology-driven global economy . 
They worry that in coming years even highly skilled people might be hired and fired indiscriminately , bought and sold like so many tons of copper or cases of frozen turkeys . 
Job satisfaction would suffer accordingly . 
After all , if the job requires nothing more than knowledge of existing technology , then it can be done by anyone anywhere in the world who has learned this technology , or , worse by some computer . 
Indeed , while it is often thought that computers will replace only low-skilled jobs , my students remind me otherwise . 
Medical expertise is in some ways being replaced by computer-based diagnostic systems ( expert systems ) , and much of the work that engineers once did has been replaced by computer-assisted design ( CAD ) systems . 
My students worry that such trends may continue , reducing job security , lowering rates of pay , and even eliminating some of the jobs altogether . 
Some students , reckoning that it is better to buy and sell than to be bought and sold , conclude that they should be trained for careers in business , finance , or possibly law . 
They want the kinds of skills that will keep them among the managers , rather than the managed , and some intuit greater job security and better career prospects at the international level of these fields . 
By contrast , my students often regard occupations like medicine or engineering - involving highly specialized technical knowledge that does not prepare them to navigate the international economy - as particularly vulnerable to commoditization . 
Should students really be worried about commoditization ? 
Labor economists have discerned some trends that may reinforce their fears , but that don &apos;t support the conclusions that students tend to draw . 
In their recent book The New Division of Labor : How Computers Are Creating the Next Job Market , economists Frank Levy and Richard Murnane , using job descriptions that go back to 1960 , carefully classify jobs according to the kinds of cognitive skills that they require . 
They were particularly interested in identifying jobs that were routine , even if complex and difficult , which could in principle be replaced by a sufficiently well-programmed computer . 
They then show evidence from the United States that jobs involving both routine manual work and routine cognitive work have become much less plentiful in recent decades , and that these jobs have indeed tended to be replaced by computers . 
In an important sense , their research confirms that my students are right to be worried . 
But these trends tended to persist within occupations , industries , and educational attainment levels , thus providing little guidance concerning what occupation to choose or how much education to pursue . 
The important issue , according to Levy and Murnane , is that the most promising future careers will be those grounded in either expert thinking or complex communication skills . 
Expert thinking means understanding how to deal with new and different problems that do not fit the mold of past problems . 
Complex communications skills entail understanding ideas , how to evaluate their social significance , and how to persuade - tasks that no computer can accomplish . 
As long as young people direct their efforts accordingly , they can acquire these skills in virtually any of the major courses of university study . 
Moreover , those who would like to devote their college years to acquiring technical skills in a narrow field that they love would be wrong to conclude that they must give up their dream . 
Specializing in business , finance , or law does not really protect one from commoditization . 
People in these fields are ultimately bought and sold by corporate managers as much as people in technical fields . 
Hardly anyone makes it all the way to the top in the business world . 
The important point for students to bear in mind is that they should motivate themselves to attain deep understanding , not rote memorization , of the subjects that they study , in order to fulfill the role of a true expert in whatever field they ultimately choose to pursue . 
At the same time , they should invest in acquiring the communications skills that will be similarly crucial to a successful career . 
Achieving this kind of education probably means pursuing what one naturally finds interesting and engaging , whether that is finance or physiology . 
Students should stop worrying so much , immerse themselves in the field they love , and learn to appreciate the people who populate it . 
What may appear to them to be an unaffordable luxury is really a necessity that they can &apos;t afford to reject .
