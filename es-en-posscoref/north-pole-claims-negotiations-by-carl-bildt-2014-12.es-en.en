The Battle for Santa Claus &apos;s Home 
STOCKHOLM - A couple of years ago , a Canadian minister proudly declared that Santa Claus was a citizen of Canada . 
After all , his home and toy factory are at the North Pole , which , according to the minister &apos;s interpretation , belongs to Canada . 
Though Santa Claus has not commented on the matter , it is now clear that he could choose several passports when he travels the world on December 24th . 
In 2007 , a privately funded mini-submarine planted a Russian flag directly beneath his alleged home . 
By filing its claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf , Denmark has joined our era &apos;s &quot; great game &quot; : the contest for economic control over a large part of the Arctic . 
And Denmark &apos;s claim is massive . 
Not only does it seek sovereignty over everything between Greenland and the North Pole ; it is also extending its claim to nearly 900,000 square kilometers , all the way to the existing limits of the Russian economic zone on the other side of the Pole - an area 20 times Denmark &apos;s size . 
How to assess countries &quot; claims to Arctic territory hinges on the status of the Lomonosov Ridge , a vast formation that rises from the sea floor and stretches 1,800 kilometers from Greenland to the East Siberian continental shelf . 
Everyone agrees that it is a ridge . 
The key question is whether it is an extension of the Greenland shelf or an extension of the East Siberia shelf . 
Denmark , together with the government of Greenland , now claims that it is the former , giving it the right to extend its economic zone across a huge area at the top of the world . 
Though nothing is yet known about the claim that Russia says it will present in the spring , there is no doubt that it will argue the opposite . 
And what about the Canadians and their claim ? 
That remains to be seen , but there have been reports that Prime Minister Stephen Harper is dissatisfied that Canadian scientists are not being sufficiently aggressive in pressing the country &apos;s case . 
Nonetheless , for all the hype about a &quot; race for the Arctic , &quot; and despite the rather icy atmosphere among the claimants , there is little reason to fear conflict . 
Under the terms of the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration , all of the countries bordering the Arctic Ocean agree to resolve their claims peacefully and based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea . 
According to settled procedure , a UN commission will first judge whether the claims have merit . 
If they are overlapping , which is highly probable , bilateral negotiations will be held . 
Such talks , to put it mildly , could take time . 
Norway and Russia negotiated over a far smaller territorial delimitation for four decades . 
Both Denmark and Russia have been devoting significant resources to exploring the Lomonosov Ridge . 
Denmark has hired Swedish icebreakers for repeated expeditions , and Russia has been deploying special submarines to obtain samples from the ridge and the ocean floor . 
The Arctic region has always been strategically vital for Russia , accounting for roughly 85 % of Russia &apos;s natural-gas production , which is based primarily in Western Siberia . 
The Kremlin has activated a new military command for the Arctic , and is busy reopening air bases and radar stations along its Arctic shoreline . 
But it is a very long way from these new Russian bases to virtually everywhere . 
A Canadian military commander , asked what he would do if foreign soldiers attacked his country &apos;s Far North , calmly replied that he would dispatch an expedition to rescue them . 
Though Russia had hoped for a rapid increase in shipping along the Northern Sea Route , commercial traffic this year fell by 77 % . 
Of course , the stakes are too high for Canada , Denmark , and Russia to allow the region &apos;s remoteness and its hostile environment to influence how resolutely they press their claims . 
Boundaries like these are fixed once and forever , and no one knows what discoveries , technologies , and opportunities the future might bring . 
But for the time being , neither Santa Claus , nor anyone else , has reason to be worried . 
The nature of the Lomonosov Ridge will be debated for years to come , while his thoughts - and ours - are likely to be focused on more immediate issues .
