Fiscal Discipline and Educational Quality 
ANKARA - The world is moving into a post-industrial age in which manufacturing is becoming ever more complex and competition has become global . 
To succeed , countries increasingly need a highly skilled and educated workforce . 
Therefore , raising the level of skills conferred by secondary schools has become an urgent priority for developing and developed countries alike . 
For me , the issue of education is no mere academic matter . 
I was born into a family of nine children . 
My parents were illiterate , and none of my sisters attended school beyond the primary level . 
However , in my family &apos;s next generation , all of my nieces and nephews have a high-school diploma and most have attended university . 
Improving the education system of a country with more than 16 million primary and secondary school students - more than the combined population of 20 European Union member states - poses considerable fiscal challenges . 
For many years , high public debt and macroeconomic mismanagement forced Turkey to pay a huge interest-rate premium in international financial markets - money that might have otherwise been invested in schools . 
However , since assuming office in 2003 , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s government has reduced the fiscal deficit as a share of GDP by nearly ten percentage points , from 10.8 % in 2002 to 1 % in 2013 , and cut the public debt / GDP ratio from 74 % in 2002 to 36.3 % in 2013 . 
As a result , government interest payments as a share of tax revenues fell from 85.7 % to 15.3 % during this period . 
These fiscal improvements have freed up funds for sizable investments in education , without adding to public debt . 
From 2002 to 2014 , Turkey doubled the proportion of education spending in the total budget to 18 % without hurting the country &apos;s fiscal position . 
Since 2003 , this extra money has allowed the government to hire some 410,000 more teachers , add 205,000 classrooms , and distribute 1.8 billion free textbooks . 
But to compete with the world &apos;s economic powerhouses , like China , we also needed to improve the overall quality of our labor stock . 
From the 2002-03 academic year to 2012-13 , gross schooling rates ( which includes students whose age exceeds or falls short of the official age group ) increased from 96.5 % to 107.6 % in primary education ; 80.8 % to 96.8 % in secondary education ; and 35.8 % to 92.1 % in higher education . 
Pupil-teacher ratios have also fallen . 
In the 2002-03 school year , there were 28 students per teacher in primary education and 18 in secondary schools ; by 2012-13 , this had fallen to 20 and 16 , respectively . 
This is an important reform , given that the average schooling of people over 25 is only 6.5 years in Turkey , compared to an OECD average of more than 11 . 
Moreover , the government has improved educational opportunities . 
As part of the FATIH project to help underprivileged students , Turkey has allocated 1.4 billion lira ( $ 665 million ) in 2014 to equip its schools with broadband Internet and the latest information technology . 
Other initiatives , such as &quot; Baba Beni Okula Gönder &quot; ( Daddy , Please Send Me to School ) and &quot; Haydi Kızlar Okula &quot; ( Girls , Let &apos;s Go to School ) , have improved enrollment gender ratios , from 91.1 girls for every 100 boys in 2002 , to 101.8 girls for every 100 boys in 2012 . 
Given Turkey &apos;s geographic size ( twice that of Germany but with a similar-size population ) , it has been a challenge to ensure that all pupils , regardless of their location or socioeconomic background , receive a good education . 
Consider that in 2003 , the test scores of 28 % of Turkish students could be explained by their socioeconomic standing - in other words , the poorer the pupil , the lower his or her PISA scores . 
But the OECD &apos;s 2012 report found that only 15 % of lower test scores among Turkish students could be explained by their socioeconomic standing , a better outcome than the OECD average . 
Turkey is also narrowing the gap with OECD countries in terms of educational quality . 
In 2006 , Turkey scored 76 points lower than the OECD average in science exams and 74 points lower in math . 
By 2012 , the gap had fallen to 38 points in sciences and 46 points in math . 
Given these achievements , it may be no coincidence that Turkey &apos;s youth unemployment rate has also declined , from 25.3 % in 2009 to 17.3 % in January 2014 , below the EU average of 22.8 % . 
What is clear is that improving education and bolstering economic growth go hand in hand . 
Of course , more needs to be done to realize Turkey &apos;s human-development potential ; but the past decade of educational reforms and their beneficial economic effects demonstrate that the foundations are being laid for rapid , sustainable , and inclusive growth .
