Bracing for Stagnation 
MUMBAI - As 2015 begins , the global economy remains weak . 
The United States may be seeing signs of a strengthening recovery , but the eurozone risks following Japan into recession , and emerging markets worry that their export-led growth strategies have left them vulnerable to stagnation abroad . 
With few signs that this year will bring any improvement , policymakers would be wise to understand the factors underlying the global economy &apos;s anemic performance - and the implications of continued feebleness . 
In the words of Christine Lagarde , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s managing director , we are experiencing the &quot; new mediocre . &quot; 
The implication is that growth is unacceptably low relative to potential and that more can be done to lift it , especially given that some major economies are flirting with deflation . 
Conventional policy advice urges innovative monetary interventions bearing an ever expanding array of acronyms , even as governments are admonished to spend on &quot; obvious &quot; needs such as infrastructure . 
The need for structural reforms is acknowledged , but they are typically deemed painful , and possibly growth-reducing in the short run . 
So the focus remains on monetary and fiscal stimulus - and as much of it as possible , given the deadening effects of debt overhang . 
And yet , the efficacy of such policy advice remains to be seen . 
It is worth noting that the Japanese checked each of these boxes over the last two decades : They held interest rates low , introduced quantitative easing , and launched massive debt-financed spending on infrastructure . 
Few would argue that Japan has recovered fully from its malaise . 
An emerging narrative might better explain why stimulus efforts have been unsuccessful : As former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has argued , the world economy may be going through a sustained period of &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
The causes of the stagnation very much depend on which economist one asks . 
The reasons for weak aggregate demand include aging populations that consume less and the growing concentration of wealth among the very rich , whose marginal propensity to consume is small . 
The economists Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon , on the other hand , argue that the problem is on the supply side . 
In their view , the years following World War II were an aberration , with industrial countries &quot; growth helped by post-war reconstruction , rising education levels , higher workforce participation rates ( owing to the entry of women ) , restored global trade , increasing investment , and the diffusion of technologies such as electricity , telephones , and automobiles . 
Whatever the causes , growth started to slow in the 1970s , and adverse consequences like high unemployment rates among immigrants and the young were compounded by the growing realization that governments would struggle to deliver on their promises of social security . 
These promises , notes the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck , had been made in the 1960s , when economies were surging and visions of a &quot; Great Society &quot; seemed affordable . 
Promises have since been augmented with pension hikes and old-age health-care commitments for public-sector workers . 
To meet their obligations , governments needed growth . 
So , from the 1970s on , they began to spend to stimulate the economy . 
Because of the supply-side problems , however , the spending translated into spiraling inflation . 
Price stability needed to be restored , but the spending had to be maintained . 
The ultimate solution was to finance spending not with the inflation tax , but with debt : first public debt , and then , as governments cut their deficits , private-sector debt . 
In 2008 , these elevated debt levels - in banks , businesses , households , and governments - sparked the financial crisis . 
Today , debt is making it difficult for developed countries to resume pre-2008 growth rates , let alone restore the levels of GDP that would have been attained if the subsequent Great Recession had not happened . 
Meanwhile , industrial countries &quot; overall debt / GDP ratios are continuing to grow . 
In emerging markets , slow growth in the advanced economies has shut down a traditional development path : export-led growth . 
As a result , emerging markets have had to rely once again on domestic demand . 
This is always a difficult task , given the temptation to over-stimulate . 
The abundance of liquidity sloshing around the world - the result of developed countries &quot; ultra-accommodative monetary policies - has made the task more difficult still , as the smallest sign of growth in an emerging economy can attract foreign capital . 
If not properly managed , these flows can precipitate a credit and asset-price boom and drive up exchange rates . 
When developed-country monetary policies are eventually tightened , some of the capital is likely to depart . 
Emerging markets will have to ensure that they are not vulnerable . 
To be sure , the world &apos;s economic outlook could still take a turn for the better . 
The US may become the world &apos;s engine of growth . 
But , overall , there is a palpable sense of gloom in the developed world , a feeling that growth is unlikely to take off in the foreseeable future . 
If secular stagnation persists , these countries will have to undertake painful structural reforms , figure out how to restructure their promises ( debts , social-security commitments , and pledges to keep taxes low ) , and distribute the resulting burden . 
After the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013 , it had to make tough choices between servicing its pensioners or its debt , keeping its museums open or its police force intact . 
As 2015 begins , similar difficult decisions may become increasingly common .
