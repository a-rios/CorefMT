Bibi Goes to Washington 
NEW YORK - Why did he do it ? 
What possessed Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin &quot; Bibi &quot; Netanyahu to accept an invitation from the Republicans in the US Congress to come and attack President Barack Obama &apos;s policy on Iran without letting the White House know ? 
Netanyahu claims that his was &quot; a fateful , even historic mission &quot; to voice his concern for the fate of Israel and all Jews . 
Did Netanyahu crave the applause of his Republican supporters ? 
Is he gambling on the chance of a Republican presidency in 2016 ? 
If so , he got the applause ; but , given the current polls , the latter motive would be quite a gamble . 
Or was Netanyahu simply using the US Congress as a venue for his own campaign to keep his job ? 
Did he wish to impress voters back home with a starring role on a world stage ? 
This , too , would seem to be a gamble : many Israelis , however worried they might be about an Iranian nuclear bomb , have been highly critical of Netanyahu &apos;s provocation of Obama , and of many Jewish Democrats . 
Two former Mossad directors joined a chorus of Israelis in arguing that he should no longer be prime minister . 
Meir Dagan , who resigned as the Israeli intelligence chief in 2011 , called Bibi &apos;s grandstanding in Washington &quot; destructive to the future and security of Israel . &quot; 
Whatever his motives , Netanyahu has achieved what no Israeli leader ever has : not only infuriating the US president ( who was already quite angry with him ) , but also earning the public rebuke of people who would normally have supported any Israeli leader , whatever they might have thought in private . 
If an Israeli prime minister cannot even count on the backing of a man like Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , he is in trouble . 
By forcing Americans - and not just Jews or Democrats - to choose between their loyalty to Israel and the president of their own country , Netanyahu has punched a large hole in Americans &apos; normally bipartisan support for Israel . 
This is not to say that US politicians have always agreed with Israeli policies . 
The benefits of doing so rarely outweigh the costs : lost campaign contributions , accusations of anti-Semitism , charges of betraying a close ally ( &quot; the only democracy in the Middle East &quot; ) , and so on . 
The fact that Israel could always count on US backing , especially on such public occasions as congressional speeches by an Israeli leader , only confirmed the assumption of many people around the world that Israel and the US are joined like Siamese twins . 
Some think that Israel is the cat &apos;s paw of the US ; others believe it is the other way around . 
In the spirit of that notorious nineteenth-century czarist forgery , The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , anti-Semites think &quot; the Jews &quot; run the US government , Wall Street , and the media . 
Such beliefs , of course , have been around for much longer than the modern state of Israel . 
Nineteenth- and twentieth-century European nationalists often regarded the US as the natural home for capitalists and &quot; rootless cosmopolitans &quot; without any loyalty to their native soil . 
Only money ruled in America , it was thought , so that meant that the Jews ruled . 
Though it was Stalin who used the phrase &quot; rootless cosmopolitans &quot; to describe unwanted Jews , anti-Semites believed that Jews were natural Bolsheviks and probably pulled the strings in the Soviet Union , too . 
It was widely assumed than Jews , whether capitalist or communist , knew no allegiance except to their own people ; after 1948 , that increasingly came to mean the state of Israel . 
By claiming to be the leader of all Jewish people , wherever they live , Netanyahu has only strengthened that notion . 
In fact , the US was not always as pro-Israel as it is today . 
The French were Israel &apos;s greatest supporters until President Charles de Gaulle turned away from the Jewish state after the Six-Day War in 1967 . 
America &apos;s subsequent patronage of Israel had less to do with evangelical passion for the Holy Land , or a spontaneous love for the Jewish people , than with the Cold War . 
There is some truth to this view . 
The old anti-Semitic myth about America being run by Jews has not completely disappeared - especially ( but by no means only ) in the Middle East . 
Now , by openly seeking to undermine the US president , Netanyahu is breaking that link . 
He has made it easier for American Jews , even those who feel a deep devotion to Israel , to be critical of its leaders . 
Some might see this as a defeat for Israel . 
In fact , the opposite may be true . 
Bibi &apos;s ill-considered trip to Washington might be the best thing that could have happen to Israel . 
It is in neither country &apos;s interest to be seen as the other &apos;s pawn . 
This is not what Netanyahu intended .
