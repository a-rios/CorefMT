Rank Mysteries 
PARIS - Gibraltar received exciting news last month . 
The latest Global Financial Centres Index ( GFCI ) , published by the consultancy Z / Yen in London , revealed that the Rock had risen further and faster up the ranks than any other center - 17 places , from 70th to 53rd position , since the previous report in September 2013 . 
I can imagine the celebrations in Gibraltar Town , where , now that the British naval base has closed and Spain is being difficult at the border , financial services are crucial for employment . 
And I can also imagine that many in Hamilton , Bermuda , which plummeted almost as far as Gibraltar climbed - 16 places , to 56th - must be crying into their rum punch . 
Of course , it is also possible that Gibraltar and Bermuda have chosen to ignore the results , or dispute their significance . 
Either way , there is no doubting the global obsession with league tables nowadays . 
One can find a ranking for almost every form of human activity . 
In the United Kingdom , you can find a table showing where it is best to live if you wish to win Britain &apos;s National Lottery . 
( Your chances are almost twice as good in the northeast as in Northern Ireland . ) 
When one looks closely , most of these tables are , as Henry Kissinger famously put it , &quot; content-free . &quot; 
For one brief shining moment , the Royal Bank of Scotland was global top dog in rankings of commercial banks , and we know how that story ended . 
Is this true of the GFCI , or does it contain valuable insights into how the global financial system is evolving ? 
The press headlines accompanying the release of the latest GFCI focused on the change at the top of the league : New York leapfrogged ahead of London , while Hong Kong and Singapore held on in third and fourth place , respectively . 
Is this a significant switch ? 
Much speculation has centered on the recent damage to London &apos;s reputation stemming from the scandal surrounding banks &quot; manipulation of the Libor interest rate . 
Even if some of the machinations were carried out in other cities , there is no escaping the fact that Libor is the London Interbank Offered Rate . 
Moreover , London is the biggest center for foreign-exchange trading , the new focus of regulatory attention . 
But GFCI &apos;s detailed results do not bear out that explanation . 
London &apos;s reputational factors &quot; are firmly above average and have not seen much change over the past five editions . &quot; 
Indeed , it seems that London &apos;s small decline is attributable to negative scores on general factors such as the &quot; business environment &quot; and &quot; infrastructure . &quot; 
Overcrowded Underground trains and Heathrow &apos;s congestion are having an impact , though it is hard to understand why New York wins on these measures . 
Riding the Subway often brings unpleasant surprises , while JFK Airport is hardly a favorite among travelers ( and there remains no fast rail link to it ) . 
And yet these subtle switches at the top of the table are not the real story . 
From a ten-year perspective , the big gainers have been Hong Kong and Singapore . 
It was once fashionable to argue that when China opened up to the world , Hong Kong and Singapore would suffer . 
Once the Chinese got their act together , these cities &quot; role in intermediating the region &apos;s finances would be marginalized by Shanghai , Shenzhen , and other new centers . 
That still may happen one day , but it has not happened yet . 
Hong Kong and Singapore have played their cards astutely . 
The combination of an Asian market with strong Chinese connections and a system of English law and property rights continues to provide a powerful competitive advantage . 
That is especially true in fund management . 
Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in Shanghai , but wealthy Chinese with money to invest like to hold it in financial centers that are perceived as safe and non-political . 
In Europe , we see a different pattern . 
Over 15 consecutive surveys , London &apos;s ranking and ratings have remained broadly constant , while Zurich , Geneva , Frankfurt , and Luxembourg have gradually narrowed the gap with it - though that gap remains wide . 
There is little doubt that Frankfurt has won the contest with Paris to be the eurozone &apos;s most important financial center . 
The Germans were smart to insist on putting the European Central Bank there . 
Given the ECB &apos;s new function as the eurozone &apos;s banking supervisor , Frankfurt can consolidate its victory . 
Every European Union bank will need to bend the knee to its supervisor on the Main River , even if she does happen to be a Frenchwoman , Dani√®le Nouy . 
In the United States , Boston , San Francisco , and Washington , DC , continue to consolidate their positions as important centers for asset management and , in the last case , for regulation . 
The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation has given the Federal Reserve Board a much larger regulatory role than it had before the crisis . 
All of the best award shows include a surprise . 
This year &apos;s wild card , billed as the financial center most &quot; likely to become more significant &quot; in the near future , is Casablanca . 
I have no idea why Casablanca is an up-and-coming center , and the GFCI &apos;s compilers do not explain . 
Sometimes , in rankings as in life , a kiss is just a kiss .
