The UK &apos;s Immigration Distraction 
LONDON - Do British voters hate foreigners , or merely freeloaders ? 
That is essentially the question British Prime Minister David Cameron posed in his long-awaited speech on immigration from other European Union countries , delivered last month at the headquarters of the construction-equipment manufacturer JCB . 
Cameron &apos;s gamble is that voters do not mind Poles or Lithuanians operating JCB &apos;s machines on construction sites all over the United Kingdom . 
What they mind is people immigrating to the UK to take advantage of its welfare benefits . 
The speech was Cameron &apos;s answer to the recent defections of two of his Conservative Party MPs to the anti-EU , anti-immigration UK Independence Party , which he fears could steal Conservative votes in the general election next May . 
But , as clever as the speech was , it is unlikely to succeed in beating back UKIP - and it leaves the British debate about EU membership focused on the wrong issue . 
To be sure , Cameron &apos;s speech was a more statesmanlike gamble than many - even within his own government - had anticipated . 
Some of his remarks in recent weeks had suggested that he might reject outright the free movement of EU citizens - one of the union &apos;s founding principles - and dare other European governments to oppose him . 
Instead , Cameron emphasized the UK &apos;s enduring desire to be open to the world while restricting EU migrants &quot; welfare rights . 
Specifically , he proposed requiring EU migrants to spend four years working in the UK before becoming eligible for the top-up welfare payments that low-paid British workers receive , and to end benefit payments for migrant workers &quot; children living in their home country . 
Though such moves could be challenged in the European Court of Justice on grounds of discrimination , any cases are unlikely to arise until well after the upcoming election . 
The political danger for the Conservatives is that they are misjudging public sentiment . 
Perhaps voters have just as much of a problem with foreigners as they do with freeloaders . 
If that is the case , reducing immigrants &quot; welfare benefits will be inadequate . 
This is not to say that Cameron should target foreigners . 
On the contrary , he must change the conversation to reassure voters that their economic future is bright . 
As it stands , the British , like their counterparts elsewhere in Europe , feel overtaxed for spotty public services that are constantly being cut , and are angry that their incomes have been falling for the last five years . 
As a result , many resent welfare recipients and fear competition for jobs - a sentiment that is fueling the rise of populist , anti-EU , and anti-immigrant parties across Europe . 
The key difference in the UK is that UKIP is gaining ground with voters despite rapid economic growth ( more than 3 % annually , the highest rate in the EU ) . 
Between now and May , Cameron must persuade voters that the British economy will continue to perform strongly , fueling an increase in real incomes . 
A change of subject would also be in the national interest . 
By banging on about immigration , Cameron risks making it central to the question of whether Britain should remain in the EU . 
He is , after all , the politician who has promised to hold a referendum in 2017 , if he is still Prime Minister , on whether to stay or leave , following a period variously described as a &quot; renegotiation &quot; of the UK &apos;s membership and &quot; reform &quot; of the EU &apos;s structure . 
He is now making it seem as if immigration will be the key test of that effort . 
That is a big problem . 
For starters , there is little or nothing that other EU governments can concede on the free movement of people , which is enshrined in the founding document of European integration , the 1957 Treaty of Rome . 
In any case , Britain receives more migrants from outside the EU than from other EU countries . 
And migrants from Poland , Italy , or France are much more likely than those from Somalia , Syria , or India to return home eventually . 
If the British public truly opposes immigration , they are probably referring to non-EU immigration , not the arrival of , say , Italian university graduates . 
In fact , there is a far more important issue that should serve as the main focus of the British debate on the EU : the UK &apos;s future status inside the EU as a non-member of the eurozone . 
This is what Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne were focusing on until UKIP surged in the opinion polls . 
It is time to renew that focus . 
Cameron &apos;s government must recognize that there is only one good reason to wonder whether the UK might be better off leaving the EU : the risk that remaining outside of the eurozone would leave Britain at a serious disadvantage in EU decision-making , even about rules affecting the single market . 
It sounds a bit technical , and it is . 
But sorting out the relationship between EU members within and outside the eurozone can be done in a fairly short time without new treaties ; indeed , progress has already been made on this front . 
Cameron and Osborne would then be able to boast that they have procured for the British public the best of both worlds : much faster economic growth than the stagnant eurozone members , together with all of the advantages of EU membership , including access to the single market and enhanced global influence . 
That narrative would be far more powerful than a few tweaks to welfare rights for immigrants .
