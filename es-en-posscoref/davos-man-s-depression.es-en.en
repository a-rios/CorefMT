Davos Man &apos;s Depression 
NEW YORK - For 15 years , I have attended the World Economic Forum in Davos . 
Typically , the leaders gathered there share their optimism about how globalization , technology , and markets are transforming the world for the better . 
Even during the recession of 2001 , those assembled in Davos believed that the downturn would be short-lived . 
But this time , as business leaders shared their experiences , one could almost feel the clouds darkening . 
The spirit was captured by one participant who suggested that we had gone from &quot; boom and bust &quot; to &quot; boom and Armageddon . &quot; 
The emerging consensus was that the IMF forecast for 2009 , issued as the meeting convened , of global stagnation - the lowest growth in the post-war period - was optimistic . 
The only upbeat note was struck by someone who remarked that Davos consensus forecasts are almost always wrong , so perhaps this time it would prove excessively pessimistic . 
Equally striking was the loss of faith in markets . 
In a widely attended brainstorming session at which participants were asked what single failure accounted for the crisis , there was a resounding answer : the belief that markets were self-correcting . 
The so-called &quot; efficient markets &quot; model , which holds that prices fully and efficiently reflect all available information , also came in for a trashing . 
Central bankers &quot; belief that controlling inflation was necessary and almost sufficient for growth and prosperity had never been based on sound economic theory ; now , the crisis provided further skepticism . 
While no one from either the Bush or Obama administrations attempted to defend American-style free-wheeling capitalism , European leaders argued for their &quot; social market economy , &quot; their gentler form of capitalism with its social protections , as the model for the future . 
And its automatic stabilizers , with spending automatically increasing as economic woes increased , held out the promise of moderating the downturn . 
Most American financial leaders seemed too embarrassed to make an appearance . 
Perhaps their absence made it easier for those who did attend to vent their anger . 
But business leaders from the &quot; real &quot; sector and the few labor leaders who work hard at Davos each year to advance a better understanding of the concerns of working men and women among the business community were particularly angry at the financial community &apos;s lack of remorse . 
A call for the repayment of past bonuses was received with applause . 
Indeed , some American financiers were especially harshly criticized for seeming to take the position that they , too , were victims . 
The reality is that they were the perpetrators , not the victims , and it seemed particularly galling that they were continuing to hold a gun to the heads of governments , demanding massive bailouts and threatening economic collapse otherwise . 
Money was flowing to those who had caused the problem , rather than to the victims . Worse still , much of the money flowing into the banks to recapitalize them so that they could resume lending has been flowing out in the form of bonus payments and dividends . 
The fact that businesses around the world were not getting the credit they need compounded the grievances expressed at Davos . 
This crisis raises fundamental questions about globalization , which was supposed to help diffuse risk . 
Instead , it has enabled America &apos;s failures to spread around the world , like a contagious disease . 
Still , the worry at Davos was that there would be a retreat from even our flawed globalization , and that poor countries would suffer the most . 
But the playing field has always been unlevel . 
How could developing countries compete with America &apos;s subsidies and guarantees ? 
So how could any developing country defend to its citizens the idea of opening itself even more to America &apos;s highly subsidized banks ? 
At least for the moment , financial market liberalization seems to be dead . 
The inequities are obvious . 
Even if poor countries were willing to guarantee their deposits , the guarantee would mean less than that from the United States . 
This partly explains the curious flow of funds from developing countries to the US - from whence the world &apos;s problems originated . 
Moreover , developing countries lack the resources to engage in the massive stimulus policies of the advanced countries . Making matters worse , the IMF still forces most countries that turn to it for help to raise interest rates and lower spending , worsening the downturns . 
And , to add insult to injury , banks in advanced countries , especially those receiving aid from their governments , seem to be pulling back from lending in developing countries , including through branches and subsidiaries . 
So the prospects for most developing countries - including those that had done everything &quot; right &quot; - are bleak . 
As if all this were not enough , as the Davos meeting opened , America &apos;s House of Representatives passed a bill requiring American steel to be used in stimulus spending , despite the G-20 &quot; s call to avoid protectionism in response to the crisis . 
To this litany of concerns we can add the fear of borrowers that the massive American deficits would drain the supply of global savings , and worries of holders of US dollar reserves , that America may be tempted to inflate away its debt . At Davos , those who trusted the US not to inflate away its debt intentionally worried that it might happen unintentionally . 
There was little confidence in the none-too-deft hand of the US Federal Reserve - its reputation marred by massive monetary-policy failures in recent years - to manage the massive buildup of debt and liquidity . 
President Barack Obama seems to be offering a needed boost to American leadership after the dark days of George W. Bush ; but the mood in Davos suggests that optimism and confidence may be short-lived . 
America led the world in globalization . 
With American-style capitalism and America &apos;s financial markets in disrepute , will America now lead the world into a new era of protectionism , as it did once before , during the Great Depression ?
