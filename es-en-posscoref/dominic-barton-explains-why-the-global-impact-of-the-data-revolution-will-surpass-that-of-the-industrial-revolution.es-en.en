Age of Disruption 
LONDON - The year 2013 moved the world further into the Digital Age - a global epoch of changes whose likely impact on the world economy will be 2-3 times greater than that of the Industrial Revolution . 
Some 90 % of the world &apos;s total data were created in the past two years . 
Many pundits regard this massive explosion of data as the new oil , even a new asset class . 
This profusion of data is being fueled by the near ubiquity of the Internet . 
Smart phones are set to connect an additional 2-3 billion of the world &apos;s citizens by 2020 , with billions of machine sensors monitoring everything from tractors to jet engines , and further breakthroughs in computing power enabling massive increases in data storage and analysis . 
In this environment , fluency in data management and analytics will be vital for successful organizations . 
A study published in 2011 by MIT &apos;s Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleagues found that companies using data-driven decision-making had a 5-6 % higher productivity rate than those that did not . 
The ability to capture , organize , extract insights from , and transact with data has now become a core competency for every industry and across every sector . 
The disruptions resulting from the new crucible of data and analytics are spreading across both the public and private sectors . 
Netflix , the popular video-streaming website , used its vast database of user searches , views , pauses , and reviews to design the made-for-the-Internet series &quot; House of Cards . &quot; 
In other industries , too , data-driven decision-making in product development , marketing , and customer interactions is fast becoming the standard , supplementing ( and in some cases replacing ) intuition and experience . 
It is also streamlining supply chains , refining workforce schedules , and optimizing manufacturing processes . 
More significant disruption is likely to occur across industries , as privileged access to proprietary data redraws competitive battle lines . 
Companies with deep data sets will increasingly have the ability to play in markets outside their traditional domains - and leaders already are seizing the opportunities . 
At Alibaba , the Chinese e-commerce company , small and midsize vendors in its network can also apply for credit . 
Alibaba has financed the working capital of 320,000 companies ( more than $ 16 billion ) using transaction data to underwrite the lending - and has done so far more efficiently than the average bank . 
Governments , too , are sensing that data analytics can change their global standing . 
Singapore , for example , has a ten-year master plan that focuses on the development of a robust information and communications industry , including data analytics . 
More recently , the authorities launched an open-data initiative , making vast amounts of government data easily accessible . 
And yet , though many organizations recognize the importance of data analytics , there is wide variation in how aggressively they have moved to embrace it . 
Early adopters , such as Amazon and Tesco , which quickly built up the requisite talent bases and experience , are now shifting gears to maximize the impact of analytics on their organizations ( that is , exploring disruptive opportunities ) . 
Many more organizations , however , are still only conducting small-scale experiments and hiring their first data scientists . 
The good news is that many companies will be able to accelerate the pace of change . 
Talent is one promising area . 
Tapping the potential of data analytics requires deep pools of advanced technical expertise . 
To be sure , workers skilled in data management and advanced analytics are in short supply , as are members of an emerging class of &quot; translators &quot; - those whose talents bridge IT and data , analytics , and business decision-making . 
Translators are essential to complex transformation efforts that cross many business functions . 
Universities are quickly adapting to meet the swelling demand , and many have launched interdisciplinary programs that combine analytics and business expertise . 
Rapid advances in technology are also making it easier to realize the impact of analytics . 
One of the biggest challenges for many companies has been to convert insights from statistical models into real changes in day-to-day operations . 
Individuals on the front lines have lacked intuitive tools that link insights to action . 
But advances in data visualization , faster development cycles for applications , and the steady consumerization of technology are changing that , putting customized , easy-to-understand solutions in managers &quot; hands . 
For example , the Climate Corporation , recently acquired by Monsanto , combines more than 30 years of weather data , 60 years of crop-yield data , and multiple terabytes of information on soil types . 
With that reservoir of historical information and sophisticated algorithms , the company offers fee-based advice to farmers through an intuitive online portal . 
As organizations pursue these opportunities to innovate , boost revenues , or increase productivity , leadership teams will also need to adjust . 
Defining new data-driven strategies , managing massive new stores of information , reaching out to new partners , managing across functions , and energizing the organization around a new mission will likely require new management capacity . 
Firms innovate organizationally all the time . 
In 1961 , Ampex , a California electronics manufacturer , became the first company formally to use the term &quot; Chief Financial Officer . &quot; 
Leading in the Digital Age may require creating new roles such as Chief Digital Officer , Chief Analytics Officer , or Chief Data Officer , though relatively few companies so far have taken such steps . 
In the future , an organization &apos;s overall success will require that the leader responsible for such capabilities be a trusted member of the top management team . 
Few leaders have ever developed management muscle in completely new fields while assembling teams combining previously unknown types of talent . 
The strategic options confront equally fresh terrain , perhaps similar to when mass media opened a new era of marketing , or globalization required radical reshaping of organizational footprints . 
In 2014 and beyond , CEOs and their boards will need to establish new priorities , invest wisely , and be willing to support experimentation . 
In times when major disruption is certain , the enormous potential rewards accrue to those who , while vigilant against risk , are prepared to act boldly and swiftly .
