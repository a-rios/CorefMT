A New Velvet Revolution 
PRAGUE : Rebellion by Czech TV journalists against a new director of the publicly-owned Czech TV marks the climax of a ten year battle between two concepts of democracy . 
The first concept is represented by former prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , the second by President Vaclav Havel . 
Klaus sees political parties as the backbone of any democratic system and sees little place for civil society in politics . 
He deems the proponents of civil society &quot; elitists &quot; who refuse to be tested at the ballot box and who try to influence politics through informal mechanisms . 
President Havel argues that a democracy based only on political parties and basic democratic mechanisms is deformed . 
In his view , political parties , although necessary , must be checked by a robust civil society . 
If civil society is too weak , parties will seek to dominate institutions that should remain independent . 
Over the past ten years President Havel has repeatedly asked the Czechs to be more active and to not let politicians control their lives . 
Klaus &apos;s vision of democracy had the upper hand for most of the past decade . 
Easily understood , it conformed to patterns of behavior most Czechs acquired during the communist era , when public and private spheres of life were rigidly separated . 
True , communism &apos;s fall was brought about by a strong civic movement called &quot; Civic Forum , &quot; but that movement disintegrated once it achieved its goal . 
With its passing , people became passive once more . 
Klaus and his followers spearheaded the creation of well-functioning , standard political parties . 
But in the absence of a strong civil society , those parties monopolized public space , pushing civic activists to the sidelines . 
Havel was the first important Czech politician to criticize this trend , warning against excessive partisanship and arguing that political parties would become internally weak but outwardly authoritarian if they did not draw inspiration from a vibrant civil society . 
Unfortunately , Havel &apos;s vision of democracy appears complicated when compared to that of Klaus . 
In the past , calls for active civic engagement and Havel &apos;s moralistic views left average Czechs cold and alienated political opponents , who accused him of promoting a nonpolitical form of politics . 
Prompted by civic passivity , political parties not only came to dominate every aspect of Czech life but engaged in dubious practices that increased cynicism and public passivity . 
At the end of 1997 , the second Klaus government collapsed under the weight of financial scandals . 
Rather than learn from this fiasco , Klaus went on the offensive , claiming that he was a victim of a conspiracy hatched by Havel . 
But his party , the Civic Democrats ( ODS ) , lost the June 1998 elections to the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , whom Klaus vilified before the elections as a threat to democracy . 
Soon afterwards , however , the Civic Democrats and the Social Democrats signed the so-called &quot; opposition agreement , &quot; under which Klaus &apos;s party gained important posts and other advantages in exchange for allowing the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Zeman to form a minority government . 
Klaus , Zeman and their parties also agreed to work together to limit presidential power and the independence of the Central Bank by changing the Constitution , as well as to change the electoral law in their favor . 
Four smaller parties , who allied themselves in a four-party coalition called &quot; 4K &quot; objected . 
Protests against these political arrangements were criticized by the ODS and CSSD as attempts to undermine their efforts to ensure political stability . 
Despite the fact that the opposition agreement boosted the popularity of the unreformed Czech Communists , the determination of the Civic Democrats and Social Democrats to continue dividing the spoils of power remained undiminished . 
In the fall of 2000 , Czech voters rebuked both parties during regional and Senate elections , with the Social Democrats losing their joint majority in the Senate . 
Because the Czech Parliament &apos;s upper house has an absolute veto over constitutional amendments , the opportunity to amend the Constitution was lost . 
Loss of control of the Senate also meant that Klaus &apos;s hope to replace Havel as president diminished . 
Defeat prompted Klaus and Zeman to try to and gain control over Czech TV by packing its council of overseers with their sympathizers . 
Shortly before Christmas , Czech TV &apos;s director , who was resisting political pressure , was replaced by Jiri Hodac , a man with close ties to ODS . 
TV journalists rebelled , occupying the station &apos;s newsroom . 
The protests by artists , intellectuals and opposition politicians that followed were the biggest political upheavals since 1989 . 
Realizing that the game was lost , the Social Democrats joined with Klaus &apos;s opponents in parliament on January 5th to demand Hodac &apos;s resignation . 
Parliament is also working on a new TV law to prevent political parties from politicizing the TV Council . 
But political realignment is not the most important news arising from this turmoil . 
Of far greater importance is the reawakening of civil society which has , for the first time since 1989 , stood up to the political parties to reclaim the public space it relinquished ten years ago . 
Equally important is the fact that for the first time since 1989 , civil society has found a voice independent of President Havel .
