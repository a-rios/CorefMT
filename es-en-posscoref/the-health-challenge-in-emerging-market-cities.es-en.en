The Health Challenge in Emerging-Market Cities 
OXFORD - Emerging markets - Brazil , China , India , Indonesia , Mexico , Russia , Turkey , and some 15 other countries in Africa , Asia , Europe , and Latin America - account for a rapidly growing share of the world &apos;s population and economy . 
But their governments now face one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century : creating public-health solutions that match the speed and scale of urbanization . 
The four largest emerging markets account for more than 40 % of the world &apos;s population and have a collective GDP of nearly $ 9 trillion . 
It is expected that their economies will overtake those of the G-7 by 2030 , and that , by 2050 , Brazil , China , India , Mexico , and Russia will , with the US , be the worlds &quot; dominant economies . 
Today , however , these countries &quot; cities must contend with economic and social issues that are more acute , more urgent , and of a vastly larger scale than those that confronted European and American cities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
A principal challenge is managing the consequences of the explosive growth of urban populations . 
More than half of the world &apos;s population now lives in cities . 
In my own country , Pakistan , Karachi is growing at a rate of 1,000 people per day . 
Massive migration to urban areas , high unemployment , low incomes , poor housing and sanitation , inadequate infrastructure , and social deprivation are shared symptoms of economic hubs where population growth has not been reconciled with cohesive approaches to public-health policy . 
As government , business , and academic leaders agreed at a recent meeting held under the auspices of the Emerging Markets Symposium , the promise of emerging-market countries will not be realized if their cities , and consequently their economies , are sick . 
A seminal 1995 report on human development by my compatriot , Mahbub ul Haq , stressed the differences between human security viewed as personal security and viewed as national security . 
He used human-development indicators rather than aggregate national indicators to measure economic and social progress . 
His fundamental proposition was that development is about people . 
Nothing is more fundamental to human security than health , which permits human choice , enables human freedom , and underpins human development . 
We often focus on health care and emphasize the roles of medicine and physicians . 
But health is also about wellness , the security of life , and the capacity to work and learn . 
As the economist and philosopher Amartya Sen has put it , &quot; health is a precondition for functional effectiveness across a whole range of human activities . &quot; 
Even as the disease burden in emerging-market cities shifts from infectious to chronic illnesses , urban populations remain vulnerable to epidemic disease , childhood diseases born of malnutrition , HIV / AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis , and mental disorders rooted in unemployment and poverty . 
They are also vulnerable to death and injury from natural disasters and traffic accidents - and to the health consequences of social disorder and breakdown . 
The speed of urban growth and the resulting concentration of poverty have overwhelmed the capacity of some national and municipal governments to provide services - sustainable and affordable housing , clean water and sanitation , and education - essential to urban public health . 
But the concentration of people and economic activity in emerging-market cities and megacities does offer invaluable opportunities of scale for building health-related infrastructure and delivering health-care services . 
Several steps should be taken . 
Emerging-market governments must address critical issues arising from weak coordination within , and between , national and municipal governments on health and health-care policies and programs . 
They should consider reforms that include giving city governments the authority , resources , and responsibility that they need to address health and health-care outcomes . 
Anticipatory city planning , based on realistic demographic forecasts , patient registers , and health-information systems , as well as participation in urban health-knowledge networks , needs to be implemented . 
Proven systems and reforms should be shared between emerging-market cities , and successful new innovations and ideas should be adapted to local conditions . 
This includes new and affordable technologies , such as low-cost mobile telephony for use by community-health workers . 
In Pakistan , for example , there are 60 million mobile phone subscribers in a population of 160 million . 
Mobile telephones can help deliver affordable urban health care by serving as diagnostic tools for taking pictures , and by their usefulness for writing prescriptions and monitoring the condition of patients in low-income areas . 
In short , urban public health needs to be reinvented . 
The health of emerging-market cities - and countries - demands no less .
