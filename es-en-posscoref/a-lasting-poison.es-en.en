A Lasting Poison 
NEW YORK - Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe . 
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past , the young people of Eastern Europe &apos;s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured . 
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera &apos;s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past . 
Other examples come to mind : the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa , Romania &apos;s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade &apos;s fascist past , and the attacks on the alleged &quot; Jewish monopoly of suffering &quot; which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag . 
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long , you risk becoming a devil yourself . 
A Bolshevik anticommunism , similar in its dogmatism to communism itself , has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe . 
In country after country , that Manichean mindset , with its oversimplifications and manipulations , was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power . 
Opportunism has had its share in this , of course . 
In 1945 , when the Red Army occupied Romania , the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members ; in 1989 , it had almost four million . 
One day after Nicolae Ceausescu &apos;s execution , most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades . 
Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel , both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge , as the totalitarian state did , but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society . 
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communist 
But the case of Kundera appears different - though no less disturbing . 
In 1950 , Kundera , then a 20-year-old Communist , reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met - a friend of his friend &apos;s girlfriend . 
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison . 
Kundera &apos;s name was contained in the investigating officer &apos;s report , which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive . 
The reclusive Kundera , who immigrated to Paris in 1975 , has declared that &quot; it never happened . &quot; 
Moreover , Czechoslovakia &apos;s fearsome secret police , who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer , never used the incident to blackmail or expose him . 
Until more information is forthcoming , both from Kundera and from the authorities , the case will not be solved &quot; beyond reasonable doubt . &quot; 
But 
Indeed , his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950 &quot; s was the most brutal period of &quot; proletarian dictatorship &quot; in Eastern Europe - a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers , fierce opponents , and apathetic bystanders alike . 
Moreover , Kundera &apos;s case is hardly unique . 
In 2006 , the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass &apos;s disclosed that , 60 years earlier , he was , as a teenager , a member of the Waffen-SS . 
Similarly , a few years ago , the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had , in his youth , collaborated with the fascist police . 
Daily life under totalitarianism , be it communist or fascist , was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding . 
I don &apos;t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer . 
Why not ? 
We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes , but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody , demagogical , and tyrannical Utopia - and of human weakness and vulnerability . We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist &apos;s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work . 
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work &apos;s merit , yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses ? 
An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists , while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police . 
Shouldn &apos;t that cleaner &apos;s drudgery to support her family , children , and her own survival be taken equally into account ? 
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special , nuanced rules to 
In Eastern Europe today , old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson . 
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years , until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality .
