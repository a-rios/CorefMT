Hezbollah in a Corner 
BEIRUT - The future of Hezbollah , Lebanon &apos;s powerful Shia political and paramilitary organization , has never looked more uncertain . 
Indeed , given rising tension with Israel and possible indictments of its operatives by the international tribunal investigating the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic al-Hariri , Hezbollah appears to be hemmed in on all sides . 
The most immediate question concerns the possibility of another Israel-Hezbollah war , fears of which have mounted throughout this year , fueled by reports of new missile transfers to Hezbollah and intermittent threats from Israel . 
Those who foresee war argue that Israel is unwilling to tolerate a heavily armed Iranian proxy on its border while tensions with Iran over the nuclear issue remain unresolved . 
Although war is unlikely in the coming months , if sanctions on Iran don &apos;t bear fruit by early 2011 , Israel might feel the need to act . 
If it launched military strikes on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations , Hezbollah would likely join the fray and Israel would have to engage Hezbollah at the same time . 
Alternatively , Israel might launch a pre-emptive war against Hezbollah in order to rob Iran of a nearby retaliatory capacity . 
Hezbollah is preparing intensively for such scenarios , building defenses , digging tunnels , and assembling a powerful missile arsenal . 
But , although Hezbollah &apos;s preparations are likely to ensure its survival , it would be hard-pressed to justify to the Lebanese public a strategy that led to two ruinous wars in the span of five years . 
In the end game of such a war , Syria might be asked by the Arab countries and the international community to take greater responsibility in Lebanon , in order to contain Hezbollah and its military profile . 
Moreover , if peace prevents a slide into war , Hezbollah has another problem . 
Although a real breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli peace process appears unlikely , United States envoy George Mitchell is still talking of Arab-Israeli peace as a distinct possibility in 2011 . 
Sources within the US administration hint that President Barack Obama might announce the outlines of an Arab-Israeli settlement sometime later this year . 
An accord between Syria and Israel is a key element of all proposed scenarios for Arab-Israeli peace . 
In exchange for giving back the occupied Golan Heights , Israel and the US will insist on the disarmament of Hezbollah . 
Indeed , within the context of the Arab Peace Plan , announced in Beirut in 2002 , the Arab states take it upon themselves to ensure the security of &quot; all states in the region &quot; - code words for dealing with the threats from Hezbollah and Hamas - since the region includes Israel . 
Although both Hezbollah and Iran still argue , perhaps correctly , that Israel will not give back the Golan Heights or allow the emergence of a Palestinian state , the possibility of peace cannot be ruled out . 
If it does occur , Syria will push Lebanon into a peace treaty with Israel and lean on Hezbollah heavily to adjust to the new realities . 
Given its popularity among Lebanese Shia , Hezbollah could continue as an influential political party , but it would have to abandon its role as a major proxy force for Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Guards . 
Nevertheless , Hezbollah faces severe political trouble , too . 
Although no official announcement has been made , there are reports that Daniel Bellemare , the prosecutor for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon , might conclude his investigation and issue indictments in the fall . 
In a speech on July 16 , Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged rumors that the Tribunal might indict members of his party , but charged that the Tribunal was part of an Israeli plot to undermine the Islamic resistance in Lebanon and has no credibility . 
He argued that the indictments would probably be based on cell-phone records , and that Israeli agents had penetrated the Lebanese cell-phone network . 
Indeed , the Lebanese authorities recently arrested a high-level official at one of the country &apos;s two cell-phone companies , alleging that he was an Israeli agent . 
In describing the tribunal as part of an Israeli plot , Nasrallah warned the government and other parties in Lebanon against cooperating with it , or accepting its verdicts . 
He reminded his audience of the street fighting in Beirut in May 2008 , and made clear that Hezbollah would not shy away from another fight if necessary . 
While Hezbollah has tried to convince other Lebanese that its presence helps maintain the country &apos;s security and stability , regional and international developments suggest that it faces mounting challenges . 
And , although the future does not look bright for Hezbollah , it is not likely to relinquish its power without a fight .
