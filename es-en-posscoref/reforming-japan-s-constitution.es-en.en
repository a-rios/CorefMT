Reforming Japan &apos;s Constitution 
&quot; Reform with no sacred cows &quot; was Junichiro Koizumi &apos;s slogan when he became prime minister five years ago , and no cow here is more sacred than our &quot; peace &quot; constitution . 
So it should be no surprise that , as Koizumi moves toward the end of his second and final term in office , his efforts to reform the constitution to allow Japan more effectively to defend world peace are gathering pace . 
In mid-April , the Constitution Review committee of Japan &apos;s House of Representatives issued a final report on the fundamental problems facing Japan &apos;s Constitution and submitted it to the Chair of House of the Diet . 
Soon the House of Councillors will submit its final report . 
Moreover , concrete discussions on constitutional reform are underway within both the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( with Koizumi himself in charge ) and the opposition Democratic Party . 
The private sector and media outlets like the influential Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper have also joined in . 
The Liberal Democrats aim to have their draft constitutional amendments ready for the 50th anniversary of the party &apos;s founding this November . 
Although almost everyone concedes that some amendments to the constitution are necessary , agreement on what needs to be done has been difficult to reach . 
Indeed , the Liberal Democrats are as divided as everyone else . 
In addition to these divisions , there are problems concerning how to amend the constitution . 
New legislation will be needed to enable amendments to the constitution , and this will take time and even more debate . 
Yet the pressure for fundamental change - particularly of Article 9 , which putatively pledges that Japan will never maintain armed forces - is such that there is a real chance that these obstacles can and will be overcome . 
Fundamental change , indeed , is needed as soon as possible , because current interpretations of the constitution have consistently distorted Japan &apos;s security and defense policies . 
Across Japan , there is a growing view that some of these policies cannot wait for constitutional amendment . 
Up to now , issues related to national defense have been regulated by the administrative judgments of the time or by Diet resolutions based on the prevailing interpretation of Article 9 . 
But this ad-hoc approach has been , and remains , a recipe for paralysis . 
The myriad rulings that have resulted from this process have left the exercise of national defense without any clear position under the Constitution and impede Japan from exercising its &quot; collective self-defense &quot; rights and treaty obligations with its allies ( principally the United States ) . 
Tortured reasoning about phrases like &quot; use of force &quot; or &quot; exclusively defense-oriented policy &quot; amounts to an open invitation to confusion , both in the military and to countries in the region . 
And the so-called &quot; three principles on arms exports &quot; have placed absurd limits on what may be sold or supplied abroad , as even flying boats used for sea rescue have been viewed as banned from export . 
Given the current regional security environment- international terrorism tied to local , Asian-based terrorists , various challenges to the security of vital sea lanes , North Korea &apos;s search for nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , and China &apos;s rapid enhancement of its naval power- , Asia today is far less stable and more complex than it was when Japan &apos;s constitution was written . 
By revising the country &apos;s National Defense Program Guideline ( conventionally called an Outline ) last December , Koizumi &apos;s government began the process of clarifying some of these debilitating ambiguities . 
The Guideline lifted some of the more foolish limits on arms exports by ending the &quot; all-out prohibition policy &quot; maintained since the Miki Administration of 1976 . 
For example , it clearly determined that the ongoing Japanese-US joint technical research to develop and produce the SM-3 sea-based ballistic missile defense system is an exception . 
More generally , the government may now review requests for weaponry from friendly governments on a case-by-case basis , according to whether the sale risks instigating or fueling international conflicts . 
As a result , the sale or supply of used or new surface combat vessels by the Japan Coast Guard or even Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ( JMSDF ) to ASEAN countries , say , Malaysia , Indonesia or Singapore , to help them fight maritime terrorism and piracy more effectively will now likely be permitted . 
Supplying European countries as well ASEAN countries with JMSDF flying boats for sea rescue , patrol , and fire fighting will also now likely be approved . 
These favorable and appropriate actions will allow Japan , for the first time in its postwar history , to meet the international community &apos;s requests in a timely way . 
Yet , without fundamental constitutional reform , Japan &apos;s position in Asia and the world will remain anomalous . 
It should be remembered that , after the US , Japan is the largest contributor to the United Nations , and to its peacekeeping budget . 
Yet its constitution severely constrains its ability to send combat units for the Security Council &apos;s peacekeeping operations . 
Japan needs to be able to back up the Security Council with men , and hence share the political risk , as well as the cost , of the UN &apos;s efforts to maintain world peace .
