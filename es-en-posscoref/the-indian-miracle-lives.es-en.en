The Indian Miracle Lives 
NEW DELHI - To hear some people tell it , the bloom is off the Indian economic rose . 
Hailed until recently as the next big success story , the country has lately been assailed by bad news . 
Tales abound of investor flight ( mainly owing to a retrospective tax law enacted this year to collect taxes from Indian companies &quot; foreign transactions ) ; mounting inflation , as food and fuel prices rise ; and political infighting , which has delayed a new policy to permit foreign direct investment in India &apos;s retail-trade sector . 
Some have even declared that the &quot; India story &quot; is over . 
But today &apos;s pessimism is as exaggerated as yesterday &apos;s optimism was overblown . 
Even as the world has faced an unprecedented global economic crisis and recession , with most countries suffering negative growth rates in at least one quarter in the last four years , India remains the world &apos;s second-fastest-growing major economy , after China . 
Many reasons have been cited for this success . 
India &apos;s banks and financial institutions were not tempted to buy mortgage-backed securities and engage in the fancy derivatives trading that ruined several Western financial institutions . 
Moreover , remittances from overseas Indians remain robust , rising from $ 46.4 billion in 2008-2009 to $ 57.8 billion in 2010-2011 , with the bulk coming from the blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf . 
Finally , the external sector accounts for only about 20 % of India &apos;s GDP . 
Most of the economy is a domestic affair : Indians producing goods and services for other Indians to consume in India . 
The Indian private sector is efficient and entrepreneurial , and is compensating for the state &apos;s inadequacies . 
( An old joke suggests that the Indian economy grows at night , when the government is asleep . ) 
India is good at channeling domestic savings into productive investments , which is why it has relied so much less on foreign direct investment , and is even exporting capital to OECD countries , where it is well able to control and manage assets in sophisticated financial markets . 
Indeed , India , home of Asia &apos;s oldest stock market and a thriving democracy , has the basic systems that it needs to operate a twenty-first-century economy in an open and globalizing world . 
There are other reasons for confidence that India will weather the storm . 
Not only does India have considerable resources of its own to put towards investment ; as the persistence of global recession drives down returns in the West , foreign investors will look anew at India . 
Still , many are inclined to compare India unfavorably with China , so a few macroeconomic numbers are worth considering . 
Half of India &apos;s growth has come from private consumption , and less than 10 % from external demand ; by contrast , 65 % of China &apos;s real GDP growth comes from exports , and only 25 % from private consumption . 
China is thus far more vulnerable to external shocks . 
Moreover , India has the highest household savings rate in Asia , at 32 % of disposable income . 
In fact , households account for 65 % of India &apos;s national annual savings , compared to under 40 % in China . 
Bad loans account for only 2 % of Indian banks &quot; credit portfolios , versus 20 % in China . 
And India &apos;s workforce has been growing at nearly 2 % annually in the last decade , while China &apos;s grew at less than 1 % . 
Putting China aside , India &apos;s economy grew by 6.5 % in 2011-2012 , with services up by 9 % and accounting for 58 % of India &apos;s GDP growth - a stabilizing factor when a world in recession cannot afford to buy more manufactured goods . 
McKinsey 
Company estimates that the Indian middle class will grow to 525 million by 2025 , 1.5 times the projected size of the US middle class . 
According to last year &apos;s census , the country &apos;s 247 million households , two-thirds of them rural , reported a rise in the literacy rate to 74 % , from 65 % in 2001 . 
In just the last two years , 51,000 schools were opened and 680,000 teachers appointed . 
An impressive 63 % of Indians now have phones , up from just 9 % a decade ago ; 100 million new phone connections were established last year , including 40 million in rural areas ; and India now has 943.5 million telephone connections . 
Nearly 60 % of Indians have a bank account ( indeed , more than 50 million new bank accounts have been opened in the last three years , mainly in rural India ) . 
Some 20,000 MW in additional power-generation capacity was added last year , with 3.5 million new electricity connections in rural India . 
As a result , 8,000 villages got power for the first time last year , and 93 % of Indians in towns and cities now have at least some access to electricity . 
These trends all augur well for India &apos;s economic future . 
The real picture of dogged progress is far removed from the perception of a government beset by inaction and policy paralysis . 
As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh modestly put it : &quot; I will be the first to say we need to do better .
