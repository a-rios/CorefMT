America &apos;s Health-Care Divide 
BERKELEY - In 1883 , the authoritarian imperial government of Prince Otto von Bismarck - who famously declared , &quot; It is not by speeches and majority votes that the great issues of our time will be decided ... but by blood and iron &quot; - established national health insurance for Germany . 
The rationale for national health insurance is as clear now as it was to Bismarck 130 years ago . 
A country &apos;s success - whether measured by the glory of its Kaiser , the expansion of its territory , the security of its borders , or the well-being of its population - rests on the health of its people . 
Serious illness can strike anyone , and seriously ill people , as a rule , do not earn much money . 
The longer the seriously ill are untreated , the more costly their eventual treatment and maintenance become . 
Private savings , as a rule , can pay the costs of treatment only for the thrifty and the well-off . 
So , unless we adopt the view that those without ample savings who fall seriously ill should quickly die ( and so decrease the surplus population ) , a country with national health insurance will be a wealthier and more successful country . 
These arguments were entirely convincing to Bismarck . 
They are equally convincing today . 
On January 1 , 2014 , the United States will partly implement a law - the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) - that will not establish national health insurance , but that will , according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office , reduce by almost one-half the number of people in the US without health insurance . 
Back in 2009 , President Barack Obama could have proposed a program as comprehensive as the one initiated by Bismarck . 
Such a program could have allowed , encouraged , and made it affordable for uninsured Americans to obtain health insurance similar to what members of Congress have ; or it simply could have expanded the existing Medicare system for those over 65 to cover all Americans . 
Instead , Obama put his weight behind the complicated ACA . 
The reason , as it was explained to me back in 2009 , was that the core of the ACA was identical to the plan that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had proposed and signed into law in that state in 2006 : &quot; ObamaCare &quot; would be &quot; RomneyCare &quot; with a new coat of paint . 
With Romney the Republican Party &apos;s presumptive nominee for the 2012 presidential election , few Republicans would be able to vote against what was their candidate &apos;s signature legislative initiative as governor . 
Thus , the US Congress , it was supposed , would enact the ACA with healthy and bipartisan majorities , and Obama would demonstrate that he could transcend Washington &apos;s partisan gridlock . 
We know how that worked out . 
Not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act in the House of Representatives . 
One Republican senator - Olympia Snowe of Maine - voted for it in committee , but then switched sides , threatened to kill it via filibuster , and voted against its final passage . 
As for Romney , he refused to recognize any kinship between his bill and the ACA - sort of like when he refused to recognize details surrounding the participation in the 2012 Olympics of a Dressage horse that he owned , 
But now January 1 , 2014 is looming , and the Affordable Care Act is about to be implemented - but perhaps not everywhere . 
In the south and other Republican-controlled regions , legislators have refused to answer constituents &quot; questions about how to negotiate the new , changed bureaucracy . 
They have also refused the federal dollars earmarked to expand their state-level Medicaid programs . 
In the Democratic-controlled &quot; blue &quot; states , where 60 % of the US population lives - and which account for 70 % of national income and 80 % of its wealth - implementation of the ACA is likely to be like that of RomneyCare in Massachusetts : a somewhat bumpy ride , but a clear success that nobody will wish to repeal after the fact . 
What will doctors and hospital administrators in Phoenix , Kansas City , Houston , and Atlanta do after they talk to their colleagues in Los Angeles , Seattle , Minneapolis , Chicago , Baltimore , and New York , where state governments and political structures are trying to make ACA implementation a success ? 
Will they compare and contrast the conditions under which they are working ? 
Which candidates will they support with donations and votes in the 2014 and 2016 elections ? 
What will nurses and patients denied the benefits of the ACA do ? 
America &apos;s partisan heat is about to be turned up over the next several election cycles , as the blame game begins . 
Bismarck would know who is at fault .
