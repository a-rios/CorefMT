Thatcher and the Big Bang 
LONDON - In the United States , for people of a certain age , Margaret Thatcher was a superstar , and Americans have been surprised at the sharply divided views on display in the Britain that she governed for 11 years . 
But Britons were not astonished . 
Like Tony Blair , Thatcher has long been a British product with more appeal in export markets than at home . 
All aspects of her legacy are earnestly disputed . 
Was she prescient about the problems of European monetary union , or did she leave Britain isolated on the fringes of the continent ? 
Did she create a new economic dynamism , or did she leave the United Kingdom bitterly divided , more unequal , and less cohesive than before ? 
Did she destroy the power of vested interests and create a genuine meritocracy , or did she entrench bankers and financiers as the new elite , with disastrous consequences ? 
Indeed , one issue that has come under the microscope is Thatcher &apos;s reforms of the City of London in the late 1980 &quot; s . 
In 1986 , her government was instrumental in what is known colloquially as the &quot; Big Bang . &quot; 
Technically , the main change was to end &quot; single capacity , &quot; whereby a stock trader could be a principal or an agent , but not both . 
Before 1986 , there were brokers , acting for clients , and jobbers , making a market , and never the twain could meet . 
This system had been abandoned elsewhere , and the reform opened London to new types of institutions , especially the major US investment banks . 
The first and most visible consequence was the demise of the long lunch . 
Beginning with a gin and tonic just after noon , and ending with a Napoleon brandy at three o &apos;clock , lunch prior to the Big Bang was often the most arduous part of a stockbroker &apos;s day . 
That cozy culture ended soon after the thrusting , brash Americans , who worked even over breakfast , hit town . 
But some believe that there were downsides , too . 
Philip Augar , the author of The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism , argues that &quot; Good characteristics of the City were thrown out along with the bad , &quot; and that Thatcher &apos;s reforms &quot; put us on a helter-skelter course towards the financial crisis . &quot; 
How justified is this charge ? 
Can we really trace the roots of today &apos;s malaise back to the 1980 &quot; s ? 
Was the Iron Lady an author of the world &apos;s current misfortunes ? 
Nigel Lawson , Thatcher &apos;s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time , denies it . 
( Full disclosure : I was an adviser to Lawson in the 1980 &quot; s ) . 
He points out that the reforms were accompanied by new regulation . 
The Financial Services Act of 1986 put an end to the pure self-regulation regime . 
Financial interests opposed it vigorously at the time , viewing it as the thin end of a dangerous wedge , though they could not have guessed just how thick that wedge would eventually become . 
It is also difficult to trace back to the 1980 &quot; s the origins of the credit explosion and the proliferation of exotic and poorly understood financial instruments that lay at the heart of the 2007-2008 crisis . 
The most dangerous trends , including the upsurge of global imbalances and the dramatic financialization of the economy , accelerated dangerously from about 2004 onwards . 
Thatcher herself was not an enthusiast for credit , once famously saying , &quot; I don &apos;t believe in credit cards . &quot; 
Indeed , she espoused a rigorous philosophy about borrowing : &quot; The secret of happiness is to live within your income and pay your bills on time . &quot; 
But perhaps there is a deeper level on which we can see some connections between Thatcherism and the crisis . 
Her mantra , &quot; You can &apos;t buck the market , &quot; did contribute to a mindset that led governments and central banks to be reluctant to question unsustainable market trends . 
Thatcher was referring specifically to the dangers of fixed exchange rates , and can certainly not be counted as one of the principal architects of the so-called &quot; efficient markets hypothesis . &quot; 
But she was a strong believer in the expansion of private markets , and was instinctively suspicious of government intervention . 
As the late economist and European central banker Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa once put it , Thatcher &quot; shifted the line dividing markets from government , enlarging the territory of the former at the expense of the latter . &quot; 
Padoa-Schioppa regarded this as a factor contributing to the US and UK authorities &quot; reluctance to step in at the right time before the 2007-2008 crisis . 
Thatcher was certainly no friend of central bankers . 
She remained , to the end , hostile to central-bank independence , regularly rejecting the advice of her chancellors to allow the Bank of England to control interest rates . 
She feared that independent central banks would serve the interests of their banking &quot; clients , &quot; rather than those of the economy as a whole . 
She was especially hostile to what she saw as the excessive independence of the European Central Bank . 
In her last speech in Parliament as Prime Minister , she attacked the ECB as an institution &quot; accountable to no one , &quot; and drew attention to the political implications of centralizing monetary policy , accurately forecasting the dangers of a &quot; democratic deficit , &quot; which now worries many in Europe , and not just in Cyprus or Portugal . 
So , in the financial arena , as elsewhere , there is light and shade in the Thatcher inheritance . 
Her Alan Greenspan-like belief in the self-correcting features of financial markets , and her reverence for the integrity of the price mechanism , do not look as well-founded today as they did in the 1980 &quot; s . 
So , in that sense , she can be seen as an enabler of the market hubris that prevailed until 2007 . 
On the other hand , it is difficult to imagine that a Thatcher government would have run a loose fiscal policy in the 2000 &quot; s . 
And it is equally unlikely that , had she had her way , the eurozone would be the camel - a horse designed by committee - that it is today .
