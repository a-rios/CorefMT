The Trouble with Poland 
&quot; We are only demanding one thing , that we get back what was taken from us .... If Poland had not had to live through the years 1939-1945 , it would be a country of 66 million . &quot; 
Thus spoke Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski on the eve of the last European Union summit , when he sought to gain greater voting weight for his country within the EU by invoking the memory of Hitler &apos;s war against Poland . 
Kaczynski &apos;s words , however , stand in contradiction with what happened in Paris this July 14th . 
For on Bastille Day , a small Polish contingent marched down the Champs de Elys√©e alongside the forces of 26 other EU national contingents , including the Germans , in a display of European unity . 
This contrast perfectly summarizes today &apos;s confused Poland - a country that boasts one of the highest levels of popular acceptance of the EU among all member countries , yet is the place where defense of the &quot; national &quot; interests is practiced most fiercely . 
Poland today is no longer &quot; God &apos;s Playground , &quot; to use Norman Davies &apos;s famous phrase . 
Instead , it seems more like a child &apos;s playground : a strange mixture of inferiority and superiority complexes . 
The problem is that Poland &apos;s unjustified lack of confidence is leading to an extremely unpleasant form of intolerance toward others . 
To understand what went wrong with Poland , a comparison with Spain might be useful . 
In the nineteenth century , Europe &apos;s southern and eastern extremities were united by common decay . 
Poland had disappeared as an independent nation , the victim of its powerful neighbors &quot; greed ; 
Spain was a country that no longer mattered . 
This dual decline was a subject frequently discussed by historians across the continent . 
They generally emphasized the failure of both countries to adjust their political systems to the requirements of the times . 
Today , Spain and Poland both appear to be experiencing a renaissance , thanks to the framework of European unity . 
Their economies are booming . 
Democracy has been restored after half-century of dictatorial disruption . 
Yet the buoyant self-confidence of today &apos;s Spain is completely absent from Poland . 
Is this because Poland &apos;s sufferings were even more terrible than Spain &apos;s ? 
Is it because it is more difficult to emerge from a totalitarian regime than from an authoritarian one ? 
Is it because Spain has had 20 more years to be vaccinated by the EU against the temptations of nationalism ? 
All these explanations probably contain an element of truth . 
And perhaps there is another factor : there is more pride and less self-doubt in Spanish culture than in the Polish one . 
What seems clear is that Poland today can choose among two paths . 
It can continue to play a &quot; nuisance value &quot; role in the Union . 
But in that case , it must at least play well . 
Poland &apos;s government cannot simultaneously pretend to resist Russia &apos;s energy pressures and yet reject Germany &apos;s offers of help . 
When all things are considered , Germany is a more reliable ally and partner than Ukraine , which some in Warsaw see as a potential counterweight to Russia . 
The realities of the present must not be obscured by the burdens of the past . 
Entering the EU means integrating into a country &apos;s politics a logic dominated by the concept of reconciliation . 
In this sense , Germany , having stifled the evils of aggressive nationalism , remains the most &quot; European &quot; country in Europe . 
To deny this , to threaten to undo Polish-German reconciliation , is to harm Poland &apos;s fundamental national interests . 
By antagonizing Germany , indeed all of the EU , Poland is merely encouraging a revisionist Russia . 
If Poland &apos;s current leaders want to re-play nineteenth-century balance-of-power games , they should understand where the real weight of power in Europe lies . 
The other path Poland can take is that of Spain . 
Javier Solana , the EU &apos;s high representative for foreign policy , symbolizes the role that Spaniards are playing in building Europe &apos;s international identity . 
Spain &apos;s influence is , to a large extent , a result of its national self-confidence . 
Demographically and strategically , Poland is by far the most important of the EU &apos;s new members . 
Former French President Jacques Chirac , with his seeming contempt for these new members , is gone . 
Nobody is out to insult the Polish people gratuitously . 
Only the Poles can harm Poland &apos;s reputation and influence , and one must say that they have excelled at it of late . 
In the course of the last five years , while teaching at the College of Europe in Natolin , near Warsaw , I have witnessed at first hand Poland &apos;s remarkable progress . 
Sadly , there is a &quot; disconnect &quot; between Poland &apos;s economic progress and the discourse and behavior of its politicians . 
Warsaw exudes positive energy . 
The famous Polish plumber is a guarantee of high-quality work across Europe . 
Everywhere from London to Rome to Paris , Polish artisans are contributing decisively to the beautification of Europe , using the skills they used in the past to build cities like Krakow and St. Petersburg . 
The problem is in the eyes of the beholder . 
If Poland were less unjustifiably afraid of its future , it would be less obsessed with a past that will not pass away . 
One hopes that this is just a temporary phase , and that comprehension of Poland &apos;s real achievements will prevail over the hyper-sensitivity of its current leaders .
