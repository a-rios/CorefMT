China &apos;s Asia ? 
CLAREMONT - Distinguishing diplomatic rhetoric from official policy is never easy . 
But it is especially difficult in China , where the government &apos;s actions so often fail to match its statements . 
Given this , it is worth asking whether the latest slogan adopted by Chinese officials - &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; - is merely nationalist posturing for domestic consumption or a signal of a genuine policy shift . 
The most authoritative reference to an &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; occurred in May , during Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s keynote speech at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia . 
In a carefully crafted statement , Xi laid out China &apos;s vision for a new regional security order - one in which , as the slogan suggests , Asians are in charge . 
According to Xi , at the fundamental level , &quot; it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia , solve the problems of Asia , and uphold the security of Asia . &quot; 
Fortunately , he declared , they have the &quot; capability and wisdom &quot; to build peace and security in the region through cooperation . 
This vision , of course , entails an overhaul of the Asian security structure , with a drastically reduced role for the United States . 
Indeed , Xi implicitly criticized the existing US-dominated security architecture in Asia as stuck in the Cold War , and characterized &quot; military alliance targeted at a third party &quot; as &quot; not conducive to maintaining common security . &quot; 
Since the speech , lower-level officials and the Chinese media have reiterated similar lines . 
At first glance , this vision seems entirely reasonable ; after all , most countries prefer to manage domestic and regional affairs without the meddling of outside powers . 
But Xi &apos;s statement marked a significant departure from China &apos;s long-standing position on America &apos;s presence in the Asia-Pacific region . 
Since the US-China rapprochement four decades ago , China has maintained a studied ambiguity regarding America &apos;s role as the guarantor of Asia &apos;s security . 
China &apos;s pragmatic leaders knew that the US presence helped to contain the Soviet Union ( and subsequently Russia ) , prevented Japan from re-arming , and kept sea-lanes open . 
They also recognized that they lacked the power to challenge the US-led security order or offer a feasible alternative . 
This may be changing . 
Though some analysts remain convinced that Xi &apos;s &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; line is an empty attempt to bolster his nationalist credentials , an equally strong case can be made that it signifies a genuine policy shift . 
While the argument is not overwhelming , it should not be dismissed out of hand . 
The most conclusive evidence of Xi &apos;s readiness to challenge the established order lies in the economic sphere . 
Most notably , China has established new development institutions , the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the new Silk Road Fund , to which it will channel tens of billions of dollars - clear challenges to the established Western-dominated multilateral institutions . 
On the security front , however , China has made much less headway in turning its &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; vision into reality . 
To be sure , it has acquired some military capabilities to deter the US from intervening in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea , and it has improved its security cooperation with Russia and Central Asian countries through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization . 
But such modest gains are more than offset by the security setbacks that China has suffered as a result of its assertiveness in regional territorial disputes . 
Indeed , after many months of increasingly forceful military moves - most notably , the unilateral declaration of an air-defense identification zone covering a large swath of the South China Sea , including disputed territories - China &apos;s ties with Japan reached an all-time low . 
And concerned Southeast Asian countries have been entreating the US to remain in the region as a counterweight to China . 
Underlying the &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; trope may be China &apos;s belief that the US , not its own behavior , is to blame for its neighbors &quot; defiance . 
Some Chinese strategists believe that the US is using Asian states , particularly Japan , Vietnam , and the Philippines , as pawns to contain China . 
If this perspective has prevailed in the internal policy debate , Chinese leaders , including Xi , could have reached the fateful conclusion that , on balance , America &apos;s security presence in Asia directly threatens Chinese interests and must be eliminated . 
That would be a grave strategic error , based on a fundamental misreading of Asian security dynamics . 
Most of China &apos;s neighbors , even North Korea , fear an unconstrained Chinese hegemon - and , if the US security presence were eliminated , that is precisely what they would face . 
&quot; Asia for Asians &quot; would be &quot; Asia for the Chinese . &quot; 
It is difficult to imagine that Chinese policymakers , known for their sophistication and realism , could be pursuing a strategy that is not only unlikely to gain support from fellow Asians , but also is guaranteed to spark conflict with the US . 
Given this , it is likely - indeed , desirable - that &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; will remain a mere slogan . 
In fact , Xi has lately toned down his description of China &apos;s aims , recently telling Communist Party leaders that , &quot; We should increase China &apos;s soft power , give a good Chinese narrative , and better communicate China &apos;s message to the world . &quot; 
But , even as rhetoric , the phrase &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; is problematic for historical reasons . 
In the 1930s , Japanese militarists used the idea of an &quot; East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere &quot; as a cover for their imperial ambitions and conquests . 
The slogan was widely ridiculed , particularly in China , for its transparent absurdity . 
This may help to explain the lukewarm reception that the concept of &quot; Asia for Asians &quot; has received this time around . 
The smartest thing for Chinese leaders to do would be to drop it , once and for all .
