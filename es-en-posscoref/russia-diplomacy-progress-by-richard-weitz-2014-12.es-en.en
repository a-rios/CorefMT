Putin &apos;s Winning Streak 
CHENGDU - Since Russia invaded Crimea last summer , the West has relied on a strategy of economic sanctions and international isolation to compel the Kremlin to withdraw its support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine . 
To be sure , Putin was shunned at last month &apos;s G-20 summit in Brisbane , with the Australian hosts and Western leaders berating him in bilateral meetings for violating Ukraine &apos;s sovereignty and creating a rift with its Western economic partners . 
Putin left early , proclaiming that Western sanctions were harming European economies more than Russia anyway . 
But Putin was not deterred , proceeding to launch major initiatives with countries of vital security concern to the West , boosting Russia &apos;s diplomatic leverage and enhancing its value to its most important , albeit still coy , partner : China . 
As Putin declared in a recent interview , his government is committed to ensuring that Russia does not become internationally isolated behind a new Iron Curtain . 
With Iran , the Kremlin has launched a joint bank that will enable Russian companies to expand bilateral trade without using Western currencies or worrying about Western financial sanctions . 
Bilateral security cooperation also progressed , with the Russian Navy holding a three-day maritime exercise with Iran &apos;s Caspian fleet . 
So far , efforts to weaken Russia &apos;s relationship with Iran - not to mention its other major Middle Eastern ally , Syria - have repeatedly failed . 
In October , Russia &apos;s United Nations ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , faulted the US-led initiative against the Islamic State for its failure to involve Iran and Syria , which he called &quot; logical allies in the fight against terrorism in the region . &quot; 
Moreover , Russia has signed an agreement that will ensure that its own firms remain the dominant foreign players in Iran &apos;s civil nuclear-energy sector , even if a nuclear deal leads Western powers to ease sanctions on Iran . 
Under the terms of the deal , Russia will help Iran construct at least two more nuclear reactors - and as many as eight . 
The new plants , like Iran &apos;s first Russian-built reactor at Bushehr , would be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring and use only Russian-made nuclear fuel , which would be returned to Russia for storage to prevent Iran from developing dangerous nuclear technologies . 
Still , Russia has agreed to train more Iranian nuclear experts , and may allow Iran to manufacture some of the components of the uranium fuel rods itself . 
In North Korea , Russian diplomacy has made even more progress . 
Last summer , Putin forgave 90 % of North Korea &apos;s $ 11 billion Soviet-era debt , and announced that the remaining $ 1 billion could be used as part of a &quot; debt-for-aid &quot; program , funding health , energy , and educational projects in the country . 
This opened the way for new development projects and increased bilateral and regional investment . 
For example , Russian firms are planning to help rebuild North Korea &apos;s railway network in exchange for access to the country &apos;s undeveloped mineral resources . 
Russia has hosted more senior North Korean leaders than any other country this year , including the reclusive leader Kim Jong-un &apos;s special envoy , Choe Ryong-hae , a senior official in the ruling Workers &quot; Party , who spent an entire week meeting with Russian political and economic leaders . 
In fact , Russian officials have indicated that Putin is prepared to become the first head of state to meet with Kim , who is eager to deepen ties with Russia to compensate for his faltering relationship with China . 
November was also a good month for Russian diplomacy in Pakistan , with Sergei Shoigu becoming the first Russian defense minister to visit the country since 1969 . 
During his stay in Islamabad , Shoigu and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif signed an unprecedented agreement that could establish a framework for joint military exercises , reciprocal port visits , and a wide-ranging dialogue on regional security issues . 
Moreover , the Kremlin has relaxed its opposition to Pakistan &apos;s full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , along with China , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan . 
And the Russian government has agreed to sell Pakistan as many as 20 Mil Mi-35 &quot; Hind E &quot; heavy attack helicopters to aid in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking . 
Until now , Russia has refrained from selling advanced military equipment to Pakistan , in order to avoid damaging its relationship with India . 
The announcement of several more bilateral deals during Putin &apos;s recent visit to India suggests that his confidence was merited . 
All of this could augment Russia &apos;s leverage with China , which has an interest in increasing its influence over Iran , North Korea , and Pakistan , but has subtly sought to exploit Russia &apos;s isolation . 
Russia &apos;s vast natural-gas wealth also appeals to China , which drove a hard bargain in the two countries &quot; recently concluded 30-year , $ 400 billion gas-supply deal . 
By giving key regional actors alternatives to bowing to US pressure on issues like nuclear non-proliferation and the fight against terrorism , Russia &apos;s recent maneuvers have complicated American diplomatic efforts considerably .
