The Straits of America 
NEW YORK - Macroeconomic indicators for the United States have been better than expected for the last few months . 
Job creation has picked up . 
Indicators for manufacturing and services have improved moderately . 
Even the housing industry has shown some signs of life . 
And consumption growth has been relatively resilient . 
But , despite the favorable data , US economic growth will remain weak and below trend throughout 2012 . 
Why is all the recent economic good news not to be believed ? 
First , US consumers remain income-challenged , wealth-challenged , and debt-constrained . 
Disposable income has been growing modestly - despite real-wage stagnation - mostly as a result of tax cuts and transfer payments . 
This is not sustainable : eventually , transfer payments will have to be reduced and taxes raised to reduce the fiscal deficit . 
Recent consumption data are already weakening relative to a couple of months ago , marked by holiday retail sales that were merely passable . 
At the same time , US job growth is still too mediocre to make a dent in the overall unemployment rate and on labor income . 
The US needs to create at least 150,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis just to stabilize the unemployment rate . 
More than 40 % of the unemployed are now long-term unemployed , which reduces their chances of ever regaining a decent job . 
Indeed , firms are still trying to find ways to slash labor costs . 
Rising income inequality will also constrain consumption growth , as income shares shift from those with a higher marginal propensity to spend ( workers and the less wealthy ) to those with a higher marginal propensity to save ( corporate firms and wealthy households ) . 
Moreover , the recent bounce in investment spending ( and housing ) will end , with bleak prospects for 2012 , as tax benefits expire , firms wait out so-called &quot; tail risks &quot; ( low-probability , high-impact events ) , and insufficient final demand holds down capacity-utilization rates . 
And most capital spending will continue to be devoted to labor-saving technologies , again implying limited job creation . 
At the same time , even after six years of a housing recession , the sector is comatose . 
With demand for new homes having fallen by 80 % relative to the peak , the downward price adjustment is likely to continue in 2012 as the supply of new and existing homes continues to exceed demand . 
Up to 40 % of households with a mortgage - 20 million - could end up with negative equity in their homes . 
Thus , the vicious cycle of foreclosures and lower prices is likely to continue - and , with so many households severely credit-constrained , consumer confidence , while improving , will remain weak . 
Given anemic growth in domestic demand , America &apos;s only chance to move closer to its potential growth rate would be to reduce its large trade deficit . 
But net exports will be a drag on growth in 2012 , for several reasons : 
· 
The dollar would have to weaken further , which is unlikely , because many other central banks have followed the Federal Reserve in additional &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; with the euro likely to remain under downward pressure and China and other emerging-market countries still aggressively intervening to prevent their currencies from rising too fast . 
· 
Slower growth in many advanced economies , China , and other emerging markets will mean lower demand for US exports . 
· 
Oil prices are likely to remain elevated , given geopolitical risks in the Middle East , keeping the US energy-import bill high . 
It is unlikely that US policy will come to the rescue . 
On the contrary , there will be a significant fiscal drag in 2012 , and political gridlock in the run-up to the presidential election in November will prevent the authorities from addressing long-term fiscal issues . 
Given the bearish outlook for US economic growth , the Fed can be expected to engage in another round of quantitative easing . 
But the Fed also faces political constraints , and will do too little , and move too late , to help the economy significantly . 
Moreover , a vocal minority on the Fed &apos;s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is against further easing . 
In any case , monetary policy can address only liquidity problems - and banks are flush with excess reserves . 
Most importantly , the US - and many other advanced economies - remains in the early stages of a deleveraging cycle . 
A recession caused by too much debt and leverage ( first in the private sector , and then on public balance sheets ) will require a long period of spending less and saving more . 
This year will be no different , as public-sector deleveraging has barely started . 
Finally , there are those tail risks that make investors , corporations , and consumers hyper-cautious : the eurozone , where debt restructurings - or worse , breakup - are risks of systemic consequence ; the outcome of the US presidential election ; geo-political risks such as the Arab Spring , military confrontation with Iran , instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan , North Korea &apos;s succession , and the leadership transition in China ; and the consequences of a global economic slowdown . 
Given all of these large and small risks , businesses , consumers , and investors have a strong incentive to wait and do little . 
The problem , of course , is that when enough people wait and don &apos;t act , they heighten the very risks that they are trying to avoid .
