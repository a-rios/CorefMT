America &apos;s Education Bubble 
SAN FRANCISCO - One of the fundamental purposes of government is to advance important public goods . 
This happened a decade ago in the United States , with the effort to expand home ownership . 
It has been playing out more recently in China , following an initiative to broaden stock-market participation . 
In the first case , the US government eagerly supported efforts to make mortgages more affordable and accessible , including the creation of all sorts of &quot; exotic &quot; lending vehicles . 
The approach worked , but a little too well . 
The surge in debt-enabled demand drove up real-estate prices , while banks &quot; greater willingness to lend led many people to purchase homes they couldn &apos;t afford . 
The collapse of the subsequent bubble - a major contributor to the 2008 global financial crisis - nearly tipped the world economy into a multi-year depression . 
In China &apos;s case , the government hoped that broader stock-market participation - achieved through efforts to bolster equity prices and promote lending for investment - would make citizens more open to pro-market reforms . 
Again , the approach proved too effective , and a bubble formed . 
Now , the government is trying to counter the risk of a disorderly deleveraging that would damage the Chinese economy and produce significant knock-on effects for the rest of the world . 
America &apos;s effort to expand access to student loans - a fundamentally good initiative , aimed at enabling more people to pursue higher education - carries similar risks . 
Fortunately , there is still time to do something about it . 
No one doubts that investment in education is vital . 
Numerous studies have shown major returns for individuals and societies alike . 
Higher levels of educational attainment improve overall economic wellbeing and prosperity , lower retirement burdens , and enhance social mobility and satisfaction . 
The unemployment rate for college graduates in the US , at 2.5 % , is roughly one-third the rate for those without a high school diploma . 
What policymakers must determine is how to invest in education in ways that maximize these benefits , without creating new risks . 
This is where the US risks falling short . 
Over the last ten years , the combination of higher tuition fees , more student enrollment , and greater reliance on loans has caused the stock of outstanding student debt nearly to triple . 
It now stands at well over $ 1.2 trillion , more than 60 % of which is held by the bottom quartile of households ( those with a net worth of less than $ 8,500 ) . 
Today , seven out of ten post-secondary students graduate with debt , with the total volume exceeding debt from credit cards and auto loans combined . 
Moreover , student loans constitute 45 % of federally owned financial assets . 
Making matters worse , the return on investment in education is falling , because the economy is growing slowly and changing rapidly , making it difficult for some graduates to secure employment that takes advantage of their knowledge and skills . 
Universities are often slow to adapt their curricula to the economy &apos;s needs , while new technologies and business models are exacerbating the winner-take-all phenomenon . 
If the return on investment in education continues to decline , the servicing of student loans will tend to crowd out other consumption and investment outlays , especially given that student debt has considerable seniority in the capital structure . 
In this scenario , the risks of default and delinquency would rise , along with financial insecurity and general instability , all of which would exacerbate the inequality trifecta ( income , wealth , and opportunity ) . 
The good news is that , though some 10 % of borrowers already face repayment problems , the macroeconomic and financial tipping points remain some way off . 
First and foremost , US politicians need to take full responsibility for economic governance , seeking not only to boost growth , but also to avert a reduction in long-term growth potential . 
After depending on unconventional monetary policy for far too long , the US Congress needs to adopt a more comprehensive approach , with measures aimed at improving worker training and retooling , modernizing education curricula , and incorporating transformational technologies more effectively into the economy . 
Increased infrastructure investment , better corporate-tax policies , and an updated budgetary approach are also needed . 
For their part , universities - which have benefited considerably from the wide availability of student loans - should rein in their costs , while offering more direct financial aid funded through philanthropy . 
Some universities have already adopted &quot; no loan &quot; policies ; students &quot; demonstrated financial need is met entirely with grants financed by the university and other donors . 
Not all universities need to go this far - and most can &apos;t , because they lack large enough endowments to cover the costs . 
Efforts could also be made to encourage households to save more , starting earlier , for education . 
Student loan disclosures should be made more transparent , thereby enabling applicants to make responsible decisions , with lower-cost two-year community colleges serving as a useful stepping stone to a traditional college education . 
And more could be done to expand income-based repayment schemes . 
None of these measures will be easy . 
As borrowers &quot; growing debt burdens limit their financial flexibility and productive contribution to the economy , the policy emphasis will shift from mitigating future risks to reducing indebtedness directly through loan forgiveness and bailouts . 
That would raise thorny issues of fairness and misaligned incentives , and could ultimately have the perverse effect of reducing educational access .
