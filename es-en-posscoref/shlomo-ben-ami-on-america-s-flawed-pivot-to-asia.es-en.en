Asia &apos;s Middle Eastern Shadow 
TEL AVIV - In 2010 , then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced America &apos;s eastward shift in global strategy . 
The United States &quot; &quot; pivot &quot; to the Asia-Pacific region was required not only because of the security threats posed by the rise of China , but also as a consequence of America &apos;s long and costly obsession with the Middle East . 
The Middle East has long confronted the US with formidable challenges , which ultimately exceeded America &apos;s imperial capacities and sapped public support . 
But the real question now is whether America is still able and willing to uphold its global pretensions . 
After all , Asia is no less a demanding theater than the Middle East . 
Indeed , dealing with it might require reconciling the pivot to Asia with an ongoing presence in the Middle East , if only because the two regions have much in common . 
For starters , in a region replete with territorial disputes and old rivalries that are as bitter as the Arab-Israeli conflict , America faces a geopolitical environment with no security architecture and no agreed conflict-resolution mechanism . 
The division of the Korean Peninsula , the India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir , and the question of Taiwan ( which by 2020 the US will no longer be able to defend from a Chinese attack , according to a 2009 study by the RAND Corporation ) appear as intractable as the Israeli-Palestinian dispute . 
Moreover , like the Middle East , Asia is home to an uncontrolled arms race that includes both conventional capabilities and weapons of mass destruction . 
Four of the world &apos;s ten largest militaries are in Asia , and five Asian countries are full-fledged nuclear powers . 
Nor does the Middle East have a monopoly on Islamist extremism , ethnic tension , or terrorism . 
China &apos;s restive Muslim Uighurs , the Hindu-Muslim conflict in India , the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar , the secessionist Muslim insurgency in the Philippines , and the ethnic separatist insurgency in southern Thailand all highlight Asia &apos;s complex tapestry of unresolved religious and ethnic trouble spots . 
Moreover , America &apos;s Asian pivot is occurring at a time when its international credibility has been badly eroded by domestic political dysfunction and disappointing performance in the Middle East . 
This , for example , explains Japan &apos;s fear that the US might eventually reach an accommodation with China over the disputed Senkaku Islands ( Diaoyu Islands in Chinese ) . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s quest to re-establish its own military capability is a vote of limited confidence in its US ally . 
Obama &apos;s recent wavering on the use of force in Syria has left many in Asia doubting whether they can rely on America not only if China forcibly asserts its maritime claims , but also if North Korea carries out its threats to attack the South . 
Conspicuously , South Korean President Park Geun-hye &apos;s &quot; Trustpolitik &quot; - a soft-power approach to North Korea that calls for deeper cooperation with China , the North &apos;s most important ally - is particularly popular . 
As in the Middle East , America &apos;s bilateral military relationships in Asia are often with &quot; frenemies , &quot; countries that share an alliance with the US while deeply mistrusting one another . 
US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel &apos;s agreement in early October with his South Korean counterpart on a Tailored Deterrence strategy became untenable a few days later , when the US promised Japan a massive upgrading of its military capabilities . 
South Korea views this as tantamount to outsourcing China &apos;s containment to an unrepentant imperial power . 
In any case , an American withdrawal from the Middle East is hardly a recipe for countering China &apos;s rise in East Asia , given that the two regions are increasingly intertwined . 
While the US is pivoting to the East , leaving old allies like Saudi Arabia and Egypt deeply resentful , China is pivoting westward . 
China &apos;s exports to the Middle East are already more than twice those of the US . 
Its annual exports to Turkey total $ 23 billion , and now include military supplies , such as a missile-defense system that is not compatible with those of Turkey &apos;s NATO allies . 
If China &apos;s penetration into the Middle East persists at the current pace , it might even be able to obstruct the flow of energy resources to America &apos;s Asian allies . 
In a global competition , a superpower &apos;s competitors are bound to exploit its weaknesses . 
The 2008 financial crisis , which destroyed the mystique of Western economic prowess , led to a marked a shift in China &apos;s global strategy . 
The Chinese began toying with the idea of abandoning their &quot; peaceful rise &quot; in favor of what then-President Hu Jintao defined at a July 2009 conference of Chinese diplomats as &quot; the democratization of international relations &quot; and &quot; global multipolarity . &quot; 
The US , as hegemon in the Middle East for many years , could not solve any of the region &apos;s major problems single-handedly . 
If its pivot to Asia is to be credible , the US will eventually have to agree to be one among a number of great powers in Asia , a co-equal partner with China , Japan , and India in shaping the region &apos;s strategic environment .
