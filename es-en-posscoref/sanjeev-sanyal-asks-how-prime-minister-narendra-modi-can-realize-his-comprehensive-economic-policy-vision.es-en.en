India &apos;s East Asian Dream 
SINGAPORE - On August 15 , Narendra Modi delivered his first Independence Day speech as Prime Minister . 
Though he continued the tradition of addressing the country from the ramparts of Delhi &apos;s historic Red Fort , the speech broke with convention . 
Shunning a written text , Modi extemporized for an hour , mapping out an explicit vision for India , including an economic model that constitutes a clean break from India &apos;s past . 
Since 1991 , India has been slowly changing its policy framework away from the socialist vision of its first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru . 
However , for political reasons , the changes were always justified in an almost apologetic way . 
Indeed , many Nehru-era institutions continue to exist - and even thrive . 
In one fell swoop , Modi announced the abolition of one of the most important of these institutions : the powerful Planning Commission , which had continued to churn out Soviet-style &quot; Five-Year Plans &quot; and remained at the heart of a centralized resource-allocation process . 
Its successor , the National Development and Reform Commission , will probably function more as a think tank - providing ideas and ensuring policy coherence , but with no power to allocate . 
Modi also argued for a new economic-growth model based on export-oriented manufacturing . 
This means encouraging domestic entrepreneurs to manufacture goods for export and inviting the world &apos;s top companies to relocate production to India . 
This effort is important , because India &apos;s economy and exports are dominated by services , which have grown steadily relative to overall output , now accounting for almost 60 % of GDP . 
By contrast , the industrial sector &apos;s share of GDP has remain unchanged , at around 26 % , for the last three decades ( the manufacturing segment is even smaller , at 14.9 % of GDP ) . 
When Modi &apos;s emphasis on export-led manufacturing is viewed in the context of his government &apos;s focus on heavy infrastructure projects - ranging from power generation to railways - it becomes clear that his growth model , with its mass deployment of labor and capital in industry , looks similar to East Asian countries &quot; strategy . 
It is also consistent with his frequent references to the need to create new cities , because urbanization is the spatial manifestation of industrialization . 
The shift to an &quot; East Asian &quot; growth model should not be surprising , given India &apos;s demographic pipeline . 
India needs to create jobs for the ten million people per year who join the working-age population . 
It also needs to accommodate the millions who wish to shift away from agriculture , which still employs half of the workforce . 
Although the service sector was able to generate growth in the past , it has proved to be a poor job creator and only employs 27 % of workers , far lower than its share of the economy . 
By contrast , construction and manufacturing are rightly seen to be more promising outlets for the mass deployment of semi-skilled workers . 
There are , of course , many obstacles in Modi &apos;s path . 
India &apos;s tax and regulatory regime is widely regarded as unfriendly to business ; but Modi &apos;s track record in government suggests that he is sensitive to this problem and will be able to make significant improvements . 
The greater challenge for Modi will be financing his growth model . 
The success of the East Asian model was predicated on a sharp increase in the investment rate . 
Beginning with Japan , every rapidly growing East Asian economy sustained investment rates in the range of 38-40 % of GDP over its rapid-growth phase . 
China is currently investing almost half of its GDP . 
India &apos;s fixed-investment ratio , by contrast , has declined in recent years to around 30 % of GDP . 
Foreign capital can play a role in supporting rapid growth , but international experience shows that domestic savings is key to sustaining high investment rates . 
Mobilizing these savings will require careful thinking about how the domestic financial system can be expanded by an order of magnitude without risking a future crisis . 
Another major problem will be the migration of tens of millions of people as they are sucked into the expanding industrial economy . 
India does not have China &apos;s sociopolitical controls , such as the hukou residential-permit system , to manage such a large-scale movement of people . 
Japan and South Korea are perhaps too small to serve as useful precedents . 
Modi may be hoping to preempt the problem through his project to create 100 &quot; smart cities , &quot; though how the program will be implemented remains unknown . 
Despite all of the obstacles and risks , Modi has articulated an explicit economic vision for the first time since Nehru . 
Unlike the apologetic reforms of the past two decades , Indians have been promised a confident new beginning . 
It is now a matter of implementation .
