The Evolution of Work 
CAMBRIDGE - In mid-December , the United Nations will launch the latest of its annual landmark Human Development Reports . 
This year &apos;s report focuses on the nature of work : how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization , new technologies , and innovations in social organization . 
The outlook for developing countries , in particular , is decidedly mixed . 
For most people most of the time , work is mostly unpleasant . 
Historically , doing lots of backbreaking work is how countries have become rich . 
And being rich is how some people get the chance to do more pleasant work . 
Thanks to the Industrial Revolution , new technologies in cotton textiles , iron and steel , and transportation delivered steadily rising levels of labor productivity for the first time in history . 
First in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century , and then in Western Europe and North America , men and women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy factories &quot; growing demand for labor . 
But , for decades , workers gained few of the benefits of rising productivity . 
They worked long hours in stifling conditions , lived in overcrowded and unsanitary housing , and experienced little growth in earnings . 
Some indicators , such as workers &quot; average height , suggest that standards of living may have even declined for a while . 
Eventually , capitalism transformed itself and its gains began to be shared more widely . 
This was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up . 
But , equally important , workers organized themselves to defend their interests . 
Fearing revolution , the industrialists compromised . 
Civil and political rights were extended to the working class . Democracy , in turn , tamed capitalism further . 
Employment conditions improved as state-mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours , greater safety , and family , health , and other benefits . 
Public investment in education and training made workers both more productive and freer to exercise choice . 
As a result , labor &apos;s share of the enterprise surplus rose . 
While factory jobs never became pleasant , blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living , with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities . 
Eventually , technological progress undermined industrial capitalism . 
Labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy : The same or higher quantity of steel , cars , and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers . 
So the &quot; excess &quot; workers moved to service industries - education , health , finance , entertainment , and public administration , for example . 
Thus was born the post-industrial economy . 
Work became more pleasant for some , but not for all . 
For those with the skills , capital , and savvy to prosper in the post-industrial age , services offered inordinate opportunities . 
Bankers , consultants , and engineers earned much higher wages than their industrial-age forebears . 
Equally important , office work allowed a degree of freedom and personal autonomy that factory work never provided . 
Notwithstanding long hours ( perhaps longer than in factory jobs ) , service professionals enjoyed much greater control over their daily lives and workplace decisions . 
Teachers , nurses , and waiters were not paid nearly as well , but they , too , were released from the humdrum mechanical drudgery of the shop floor . 
For less skilled workers , however , service-sector jobs meant giving up the negotiated benefits of industrial capitalism . 
The transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions , employment protections , and norms of pay equity , greatly weakening workers &quot; bargaining power and job security . 
So the post-industrial economy opened up a new chasm in the labor market , between those with stable , high-paid , and fulfilling services jobs and those with fleeting , low-paid , and unsatisfying jobs . 
Two factors determined the share of each type of job - and thus the extent of inequality produced by the post-industrial transition : the education and skill level of the workforce , and the degree of institutionalization of labor markets in services ( in addition to manufacturing ) . 
Inequality , exclusion , and duality became more marked in countries where skills were poorly distributed and many services approximated the textbook &quot; ideal &quot; of spot markets . 
The United States , where many workers are forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make an adequate living , remains the canonical example of this model . 
The vast majority of workers still live in low- and middle-income countries and have yet to go through these transformations . 
There are two reasons to believe that their future path will ( or need ) not unfold in quite the same way . 
First , there is no reason that safe working conditions , freedom of association , and collective bargaining cannot be introduced at earlier stages of development than has occurred historically . 
Just as political democracy need not wait for incomes to rise , strong labor standards need not lag behind economic development . 
Workers in low-income countries should not be deprived of fundamental rights for the sake of industrial development and export performance . 
Second , the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult , if not impossible , for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers , or the European and North American economies before them . 
Many ( if not most ) developing countries are becoming service economies without having developed a large manufacturing sector - a process I have called &quot; premature de-industrialization . &quot; 
Could premature de-industrialization be a blessing in disguise , enabling workers in the developing world to bypass the drudgery of manufacturing ? 
If so , how such a future could be constructed is not at all clear . 
A society in which most workers are self-proprietors - shopkeepers , independent professionals , or artists - and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high . 
High-productivity services - such as IT or finance - require well-trained workers , not the unskilled kind that poor countries have in abundance . 
So there is both good and bad news for the future of work in developing countries . 
Thanks to social policy and labor rights , workers can become full stakeholders in the economy much earlier in the process of development . 
At the same time , the traditional engine of economic development - industrialization - is likely to operate at much lower capacity . 
The resulting combination of high public expectations and low income-producing capacity will be a major challenge for developing economies everywhere .
