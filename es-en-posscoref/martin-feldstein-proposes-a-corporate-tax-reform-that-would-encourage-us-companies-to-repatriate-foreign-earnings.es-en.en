Bringing It Back Home 
CAMBRIDGE - An increasing number of American companies are making plans to shift their headquarters to Europe . 
These so-called &quot; inversions &quot; would reduce these companies &quot; total tax bill by allowing them to escape from the United States &quot; uniquely unfavorable corporate tax rules . 
So what should US policymakers do ? 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration is seeking to block corporate inversion through administrative measures that may not hold up in US courts . 
It would be far better to develop a bipartisan legislative plan aimed at removing the temptation to shift corporate headquarters in the first place . 
Such a plan , if attractive to US multinational corporations , could result in a shift in employment and production to the US and higher tax revenue . 
Under current law , US corporate profits are taxed at a rate of 35 % - the highest rate among OECD countries , where the average is 25 % . 
That tax is paid on profits earned in the US and on repatriated profits earned by US companies &quot; foreign subsidiaries . 
For example , the subsidiary of a US firm that operates in Ireland pays the Irish corporate tax of 12.5 % on the profits earned in that country . 
If it repatriates the after-tax profits , it pays a 22.5 % tax ( the difference between the 35 % US rate and the 12.5 % tax that it already paid to the Irish government ) . 
But if it reinvests the profits in Ireland - or in any other country - no further tax must be paid . 
Not surprisingly , American firms prefer to leave those profits abroad , either in financial instruments or by investing in new or existing subsidiaries . 
As a result , American companies now hold abroad roughly $ 2 trillion in profits that have never been subject to US tax . 
All other OECD countries treat the profits of their companies &quot; foreign subsidiaries very differently , relying on the so-called &quot; territorial &quot; method of taxing foreign earnings . 
For example , a French firm that invests in Ireland pays the 12.5 % Irish corporate tax but is then free to repatriate the after-tax profits with a tax of less than 5 % . 
America &apos;s current tax system adversely affects the US economy in several ways . 
The extra tax that US firms pay if they repatriate profits raises their cost of capital , thus reducing their ability to compete in international markets . 
Foreign firms can also outbid their US counterparts in acquiring new high-tech firms in other countries . 
And when a foreign firm acquires a US company , it pays US tax on the profits earned in the US but not on the profits earned by that firm &apos;s other foreign subsidiaries , thus lowering its total tax bill . 
A shift to a territorial system of taxation would remove the disadvantages faced by American multinational corporations and encourage them to reinvest their overseas profits at home , increasing US employment and profits . 
Because only a small share of overseas profits is now repatriated , the US government would lose very little tax revenue by shifting to a territorial system . 
A few years ago , the US Treasury Department estimated that shifting to a territorial system would reduce corporate tax revenue by only $ 130 billion over ten years . 
It would also be desirable to reduce the US corporate tax rate gradually , bringing it closer to the 25 % OECD average . 
That , too , would encourage more repatriation of overseas earnings . 
Given that American companies have large amounts of profits abroad that have never been subject to US tax , the transition could even be carried out in a way that raises net revenue . 
In exchange for shifting to a territorial system and reducing the tax rate , the federal government could tax all of these untaxed past earnings at a low rate to be paid over a ten-year period . 
Companies would then be free to repatriate their pre-existing earnings without paying any additional tax , while future foreign earnings could , as in other countries , be repatriated by paying a low 5 % tax . 
A 10 % tax on those existing accumulated foreign earnings would raise about $ 200 billion over the ten years . 
A 15 % tax would raise $ 300 billion . 
The choice of tax rate would be part of the negotiation over how far to reduce the overall US corporate tax rate . 
For example , with a 10 % tax , a company with $ 500 million of accumulated overseas earnings would incur a tax liability of $ 50 million , to be paid over ten years . 
It could repatriate $ 500 million at any time with no additional tax liability . 
Repatriation of any earnings in excess of $ 500 million would be subject to a 5 % tax . 
The shift to a territorial system and a lower corporate tax rate would appeal to American multinational corporations even if they had to pay a 10-15 % tax on accumulated past earnings . 
If Obama is looking for an opportunity to negotiate a bipartisan deal that would strengthen the US economy and increase employment , he should seriously consider such a package of reforms .
