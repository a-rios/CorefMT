When will we win the war against cancer ? 
Thirty years ago America &apos;s president declared &quot; war on cancer &quot; . 
This year , in the US alone , 1,500 men , women and children lose their personal battle with cancer every day . 
When will the war end ? 
I believe that for many cancers the war will end soon . 
Thanks to knowledge from basic research , we have new tools with which to attack cancer . 
These new tools are providing more rapid diagnosis and more effective treatments . 
They are producing new drugs that target molecular changes unique to cancer cells , making it possible to predict who may be at risk for developing cancer because of genetic or environmental factors . 
These advances will save many lives . 
Cancer affects many different organs and tissues in the body . 
Although cancers differ greatly in their appearance and behavior , they have a common cause : damage to genes . 
Genes are chemical coding units that specify the structure and function of our bodies . 
All the cells in our bodies have the same complement of genes , half from each of our parents . 
What makes one kind of cell different from another is the combination of genes that are active in each cell . 
Genes can be damaged by environmental factors , such as radiation or chemicals . 
They can also be damaged by the products of normal metabolism . 
Our bodies have elaborate repair systems that maintain the integrity of our genes , even in the presence of damaging agents . 
Occasionally , however , damage is not repaired . 
If the damage occurs in key genes that regulate cell growth , cancer can develop . 
The repair systems themselves help protect us from cancer . 
For example , one kind of colon cancer develops more frequently in individuals who have a defect in a system that repairs damaged genes . 
Cell growth is regulated by a balance between genes that stimulate growth , and those that inhibit it . 
Genes that stimulate cell growth are called oncogenes ; those that inhibit it are called tumor suppressor genes . 
When oncogenes are activated , or tumor suppressor genes disabled , cells can multiply out of control . 
Oncogenes can be activated by mutation ( changes in gene structure ) or by gene amplification ( production of many copies of a gene ) . 
Tumor suppressor genes can be disabled by mutation , or by spontaneous loss during cell division . 
Cancer cells are genetically unstable , that is , they have abnormal numbers of chromosomes , the cellular elements that carry genes . 
Genetic instability contributes to loss of growth control by producing imbalances in gene activity . 
Traditionally cancer has been diagnosed by the characteristic appearance of cancer cells observed through a microscope . 
Increasingly , cancers are identified by their characteristic patterns of gene activity ( their &quot; molecular signature &quot; ) . 
New techniques , including &quot; gene chips &quot; , have made it possible to measure the activity of thousands of genes simultaneously . 
The molecular signatures can be used to classify cancers more precisely , making them easier to treat . 
For example , these techniques have been used to identify some kinds of lymphomas ( cancers of the blood ) that respond well to chemotherapy . 
Similar techniques have been used to identify genes involved in tumor metastasis . 
Some genetic changes are common to many types of cancer , whereas other changes are specific to particular cancers . 
Dozens of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been identified , providing targets for the development of new anti-cancer drugs . 
A striking recent example is a drug that targets a molecular change characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells . 
The drug is providing an alternative to bone marrow transplantation , the only treatment that was effective previously . 
Mutations in certain genes have been found to cause hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer . 
This has made it possible to identify women who may be at high risk because they inherit these susceptibility genes . 
( Inherited forms of breast and ovarian cancer are only a small fraction of the total . ) 
Close observation and rapid treatment , or prophylactic surgery , can reduce the risk of these inherited forms of cancer . 
Advances in imaging techniques are making it possible to detect cancer earlier , which can help eliminate tumors before they become life-threatening . 
New imaging techniques are also helping to guide surgery , so that tumors can be removed more precisely . 
Other leads are emerging from a better understanding of how tumors grow . 
Tumors need a plentiful blood supply , so they produce factors that induce the formation of blood vessels ( a process called angiogenesis ) . 
New drugs , which have been designed to inhibit tumor angiogenesis , are showing promise in clinical trials . 
It is estimated that 10-15 % of cancer worldwide is associated with viral infection . 
Liver cancer , which is associated with hepatitis , and cervical cancer , associated with human papilloma virus infection , are prominent examples . 
A vaccine against hepatitis B virus is proving to be effective in reducing the incidence of liver cancer . 
Rapid and specific diagnostic tests for the human papilloma virus are supplementing traditional Pap tests , helping to identify women at risk for cervical cancer . 
One of the most intriguing discoveries of modern biology is that cell death is intimately involved with growth and development . 
For example , nerve cells are produced in excess , and some die in order for proper connections to be established in the nervous system . 
Cells contain a &quot; suicide program &quot; that is activated when the cells are damaged beyond repair . 
Intriguingly , cancer cells respond abnormally to death signals . 
Some of the genes involved in the suicide program are the same genes that are altered in cancer cells . 
A promising approach now being explored for treating cancer is to activate the suicide program of cancer cells without disturbing normal cells . 
Although the future cannot be predicted with assurance , it seems reasonable to expect that the burden of cancer will be reduced substantially in the next ten years by new treatments . 
For some cancers , like liver cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia mentioned , this is already happening . 
For other cancers , the means for prevention are at hand , but the application is problematical , as in the case of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking . 
It is unlikely that most cancers will disappear in the near future ; rather they will be diagnosed more precisely and treated more effectively , thereby increasing the number of people who can be cured .
