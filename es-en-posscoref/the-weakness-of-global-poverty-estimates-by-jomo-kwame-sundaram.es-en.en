The Mismeasure of Poverty 
ROME - In early 2012 , outgoing World Bank President Robert Zoellick announced that the Millennium Development Goal of halving the global poverty rate relative to its 1990 level had been achieved in 2010 - five years ahead of schedule . 
But many analysts have challenged estimates that rely on the World Bank &apos;s current poverty line , raised in 2008 from $ 1 to $ 1.25 per day , in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) terms . 
Critics argue that , for methodological reasons , the PPP-based poverty line misrepresents the prevalence of poverty worldwide . 
For example , the three rounds of the World Bank &apos;s International Comparison Program that have been conducted so far have each defined the poverty line differently , underscoring the weakness of the current measure . 
In fact , taking into account inflation in the United States , the poverty line should have been raised to $ 1.45 per day in 2005 . 
Improving global poverty estimates - the World Bank &apos;s extend over three decades , beginning in 1981 - requires overcoming three major problems : insufficient survey data , flawed survey execution , and faulty PPP conversions . 
Unfortunately , the World Bank &apos;s approach has evaded these issues or addressed them inadequately . 
First , many countries lack survey data showing how income and consumption are distributed among their citizens . 
The World Bank avoids this problem by assuming that the poverty rate of any country without such data matches the region &apos;s average . 
But this approach has led to North Korea being assigned essentially the same poverty rate as China , even though the former regularly receives food aid from the latter . 
Second , the World Bank accepts survey data uncritically - even when it conflicts with data from other sources . 
For example , World Bank survey data suggest that India &apos;s per capita household expenditure has grown by only 1.5 % annually since the early 1990 &quot; s , implying that the average Indian spent $ 720 in 2010 . 
But national-income-accounts data show a 4.5 % annual rise , on average , over the last two decades , translating into per capita expenditure of $ 1,673 in 2010 - roughly 2.5 times higher than the Bank &apos;s estimate . 
Likewise , World Bank survey data estimate that the Indian middle class comprises roughly 90 million people , despite more than 900 million cell-phone subscribers and 40 million cars . 
Such contradictions reflect significant measurement discrepancies , which , in India &apos;s case , could be on the order of hundreds of millions of people . 
The third major challenge is using PPP estimates , measured in national currencies , to convert survey data into global poverty estimates that account for cost-of-living differences between countries . 
Given that the conversions that the World Bank currently uses are based on an international exercise that was conducted for 2005 , they fail to account for recent factors that are significantly affecting the poor and vulnerable , such as much higher prices for staple foods . 
Furthermore , PPP conversions have little significance for some countries , most notably China . 
Rather than permit price surveys in a random sample of locations ( required for accuracy ) , China restricted data collection to a few urban areas . 
The resulting data showed Chinese prices to be 40 % higher than previously thought ; 
If taken at face value , the survey data on prices , together with China &apos;s growth rates , would suggest that China was almost as poor in 1981 as the world &apos;s poorest country today , with average personal consumption below the current level of Liberia - another country to which China provides significant aid . 
While the Bank &apos;s latest PPP-conversion rate puts the number of poor Chinese at 173 million , the previous rate would suggest that only 69 million Chinese were living below the poverty line . 
With such a flawed system shaping the world &apos;s understanding of poverty , declarations of success or failure carry little meaning . 
An improved poverty indicator - one that addresses , rather than avoids , the three major problems plaguing global estimates - is urgently needed .
