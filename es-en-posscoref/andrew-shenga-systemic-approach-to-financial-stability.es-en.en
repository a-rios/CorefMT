A Systemic Approach to Financial Stability 
HONG KONG - Next month , policymakers , business leaders , academics , and civil-society representatives will meet in Kiel , Germany , for the Global Economic Symposium ( GES ) , where they will attempt to develop concrete solutions to today &apos;s most pressing economic issues . 
Whether they produce effective proposals will depend on a comprehensive understanding of the factors underpinning - and undermining - financial stability worldwide . 
At last year &apos;s summit , dialogues on central banking &apos;s future , which pitted inflation targeting against financial stability , produced three solutions : central banks should adopt a counter-cyclical policy approach ; a world monetary authority should be created to promote multilateral cooperation among central banks ; and price stability must remain central banks &quot; primary goal . 
Although these solutions have some merit , they are inadequate to address effectively the complex and far-reaching failings that led to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis . 
The crisis represented a comprehensive systemic failure , involving breakdowns at almost all levels , from macroeconomic theory to micro-level incentives to institutions . 
The economics profession ( and institutions within the existing financial architecture , including regulators ) had become excessively specialized , rigid , and self-interested . 
As a result , it could no longer account for the evolution of economic systems , with their constant adaptation of rules , tools , and behaviors . 
In order to develop effective policies , central bankers must adopt an entirely new approach - one that is comprehensive , systems-oriented , flexible , and socially conscious . 
They must recognize that , despite the cyclical nature of economic activity , not all cycles are the same ; counter-cyclical measures must account for the factors that gave rise to the cycle . 
Moreover , any solution to the crisis must incorporate a wide array of instruments and reforms . 
Monetary policy , together with other financial stability-enhancing tools like regulatory policy , aims to protect the real value of money and its effectiveness as a medium of exchange and store of value . 
Whereas monetary stability presupposes price stability , financial stability ensures that the value of money is not eroded through credit , operational , or other risks . 
Fortunately , the premise of this year &apos;s dialogue on central banking and financial stability suggests a more complete understanding of the problem . 
Indeed , the theme , &quot; The Future of Monetary Policy and Financial-Market Reform , &quot; implies recognition that monetary policy must change over time , while highlighting that institutional reform should be aimed at enhancing monetary policy &apos;s effectiveness . 
Potential solutions must account for the unintended consequences of efforts to ensure financial stability . 
For example , stability can be achieved by allowing the largest banks to dominate , while requiring that they hold large amounts of high-quality capital to cushion against shocks . 
But , in the long run , the real sector would probably suffer from monopolistic rents , inadequate competition , and a lack of innovation . 
A more comprehensive solution would focus on securing systemic stability in the real and financial sectors through the use of long-term tools and targets , based on the priniciple that finance should serve the real sector . 
In other words , monetary policy and financial-market reform should act in tandem to deliver the real-sector objectives of economic efficiency , social inclusivity , and environmental sustainability . 
The unspoken allegation against current monetary policy is that , in rescuing the financial sector from its follies ( paid for by the real sector ) , it has enabled policymakers to defer financial-sector reforms that would close regulatory and supervisory gaps and eliminate incentives to game the system . 
But monetary policy and financial-sector reform are subject to severe constraints , rooted in the mismatch between the scope of financial activities and that of monetary and regulatory policy . 
Money and finance have gone global , through technology , innovation , and financial liberalization . 
But regulatory and monetary instruments remain national and , thus , incomplete . 
With capital flowing freely across borders , national authorities have lost the ability to protect their currency &apos;s value and safeguard financial stability . 
This model is based on the assumption of a frictionless global financial market , in which actors are free to speed up transactions and increase their leverage through off-balance-sheet and off-shore transactions , in order to escape regulation . 
If they fail , the system rescues the key players through expansionary monetary policy , spreading the costs globally . 
While a centralized global monetary or financial authority would offer a more complete solution , the requirement that countries yield some sovereignty over fiscal , monetary , and regulatory matters raises issues of legitimacy , making it an unlikely option . 
Indeed , the world &apos;s current monetary and financial architecture would have to collapse before such a global scheme could become feasible . 
In the absence of such an authority , a modular approach to systemic reform is needed - resembling , for example , America &apos;s repealed Glass-Steagall rules , which barred commercial banks from engaging in investment banking . 
Macro-prudential regulations , which are essentially capital controls , could be used to minimize the negative spillover effects of unrestricted , leveraged capital flows . 
Financial-transaction taxes and higher margin requirements would slow down transactions , while higher capital and lower leverage ratios would reduce the debt load in the system . 
In a systemic reality , everything is relative , because all players act in response to one another . 
Diverse , flexible arrangements - with the interaction among various standards , rules , and behaviors fostering competition , innovation , and experimentation - are thus more stable than rigid , compartmentalized systems . 
Given this , at next month &apos;s GES , global leaders must emphasize adaptable , forward-looking solutions that account for the shifting forces affecting monetary and financial stability . 
After all , when it comes to monetary policy and financial-sector reform , there are no permanent tools or targets , only permanent interests .
