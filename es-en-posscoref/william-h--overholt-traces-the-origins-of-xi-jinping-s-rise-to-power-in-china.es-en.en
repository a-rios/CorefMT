China &apos;s Xi Factor 
HONG KONG - Before China &apos;s leadership transition earlier this year , experts said that the Chinese Communist Party was intent on preventing a larger-than-life personality from assuming power . 
Yet the new president and CCP leader , Xi Jinping , is hardly dull . 
He began his term by paying homage to Deng Xiaoping at his statue in Shenzhen , where , more than three decades ago , the former Communist Party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant Party to free-market reforms . 
In a top-level November meeting , Xi set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction , overshadowing his colleagues . 
Xi now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on fractious colleagues . 
And , unlike Hu , he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council . 
At first glance , a new &quot; paramount leader &quot; appears to be emerging . 
Recent history explains this re-concentration of power . 
In 1993 , central-government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers : they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provincial governors or relocating top generals . 
Central government revenue was low ; indeed , proportionately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy . 
This changed when then-Party leader Jiang Zemin and his prime minister , Zhu Rongji , centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to China &apos;s banks . 
In the process , the labor force of China &apos;s state enterprises declined by 50 million , China lost 25 million manufacturing jobs , and central-government employment was slashed . 
These measures saved China &apos;s economy , but at the price of widespread social stress , which made Zhu widely disliked when he left office . 
Popular reaction against the cosmopolitan , coastal , and market-oriented reforms of Zhu and Jiang brought to power leaders whose formative experiences were in the inland provinces of Gansu and Tibet . 
Riding a wave of resentment against inequality and social tensions , Hu and his prime minister , Wen Jiabao , promised a &quot; harmonious society , &quot; without the stresses of Zhu &apos;s agenda . 
They slowed economic reform and ceased political reforms . 
The bureaucracy expanded from 40 million to 70 million , and power devolved to provinces , bureaucracies , and state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . 
The somnolent Hu / Wen era , fortunately , did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by Jiang and Zhu . 
Low-cost exports were struggling as labor costs rose . 
Investment in infrastructure was shifting from growth-enhancing projects , such as inter-city highways , to less productive shopping malls in second- and third-tier cities . 
Productivity plummeted in SOEs , whose privileged access to financing crowded out private-sector investment . 
Local-government funding , through the seizure and resale of property , was reaching its limits . 
Thus , it became essential to launch a new wave of far-reaching reforms , including liberalization of interest rates , securities markets , and foreign-exchange controls , in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in SOEs . 
In particular , the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet . 
The government planned to liberalize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern , high-value industries , rather than continue to subsidize low-value exports . 
It started to shift the economy &apos;s base from export-oriented industries to domestic growth , and from manufacturing to services . 
And it announced its intention to slow local governments &quot; seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises . 
Unsurprisingly , opposition to reform was implacable . 
SOEs were determined to defend their privileges . 
Highly leveraged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreciating currency , and they were adamant about continuing land sales and opposing property taxes . 
They feared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migrants . 
As a result , a new , lean leadership team had to be mobilized . 
The number of top leaders was cut from nine to seven . 
The new lineup eliminated the most powerful voice on the left ( Bo ) and relegated the &quot; extreme reformers &quot; on the right ( Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang ) to the second tier . 
To reduce elders &quot; interference , Hu stepped down as head of the military and Jiang Zemin promised to step back . 
Moreover , a leading economic group was established to enforce bureaucratic compliance , as was a national security council ( similar to that in the United States ) to coordinate foreign policy . 
Previously , the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark ; and the party &apos;s foreign-affairs office , which handled North Korea , often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry , which handled South Korea . 
An anti-corruption campaign weakened opposition , and Zhu re-emerged as a hero . 
This set the stage for Xi &apos;s arrival . 
In short , the new-style leadership , a form of managed charisma , was collectively designed to serve national needs . 
And it implies that Xi is unlikely to emerge as paramount leader . 
The Chinese presidency &apos;s authority has certainly increased ; but Xi is powerful only when he has the votes . 
On contentious issues , he has but one of seven .
