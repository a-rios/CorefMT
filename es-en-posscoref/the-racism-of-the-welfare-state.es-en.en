The Racism of the Welfare State 
Two demographic acids are corroding Continental Europe &apos;s welfare states . 
One is Europe &apos;s aging population . 
The other is the flow of immigrants from soon-to-be new member countries in the European Union and from outside the union . 
In our recent book Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe : A World of Difference , Edward Glaeser and I discuss why the welfare state is so much more generous in Europe than in the US . 
One important explanation is the much larger racial heterogeneity to be found in the US relative to the more homogeneous Continental Western Europe . 
Consider this : according to the World Value Survey , whereas 60 % of Americans believe that the poor are &quot; lazy , &quot; only 26 % of Europeans hold this belief . 
Not surprisingly , those who adhere to such beliefs are more averse to redistribution and welfare , and evidence shows that in the US , those who express more &quot; anti-minority &quot; points of view are also more averse to redistribution and more likely to have less sympathy for the poor . 
It seems easier for white middle class Americans to consider the poor less worthy of government support if they think of them as different . 
To put it crudely , but candidly , indifference comes easy if the poor are assumed to be mostly &quot; black . &quot; 
This is more difficult in Norway , where rich and poor are white , often blond and tall . 
Much experimental and statistical evidence shows that individuals trust and associate more with others of the same race . 
Precisely for this reason , political opportunists in the US have long used the race card to discredit welfare and redistribution , from the Jim Crow system that segregated blacks in the South before 1964 to the infamous Reagan-era charge about black &quot; welfare queens &quot; who drive Cadillacs . 
Right wing white politicians , predisposed against taxes and redistribution , use the race issue to secure the votes of poor whites , who otherwise might vote differently on purely economic grounds . 
Even more fundamentally , racial considerations also influence the nature of America &apos;s political institutions . 
Proportional representation , widely adopted in Europe in the first decades of the 20th century , was never embraced by the US because it is a system that would allow black representatives to be elected regularly . 
In Europe , however , socialist and communist parties imposed electoral systems based on proportional representation precisely because they open the door to representatives of minorities ( the communists and socialists themselves ) . 
The few American cities that introduced this system in the Progressive era , between 1910 and 1930 , soon abandoned it - or were forced to - in order to stop the election of black representatives . 
Today the only US city that uses proportional representation is the leftist bastion of Cambridge Massachusetts . 
Proportional representation is widely viewed as one factor that promotes the implementation of redistributive policies by providing a political voice to minorities . 
Cross-country evidence shows that the size of public redistributive spending increases with the degree of proportionality in the electoral system . 
There is more . 
Many redistributive programs in the US are run by the 50 states . 
States that are more racially heterogeneous have smaller redistributive programs , even controlling for their level of income . 
Welfare is relatively plentiful in the overwhelmingly white states of the North and Northwest ( Oregon and Minnesota , to cite two examples ) and in some states in New England ( such as Vermont ) . 
It is lacking in the racially mixed Southeast and Southwest . 
Continental Europe is becoming , and will become , more ethnically mixed as more newcomers from Eastern Europe and the developing world arrive . 
Xenophobic parties are on the rise across Europe ; in some cases , they are in office . 
Think of JÃ¶rg Haider and the late Pym Fortuyn , or , to a lesser extent , Italy &apos;s Northern League . 
It will not be long before even Europe &apos;s more respectable conservative parties reach for rhetoric about &quot; foreigners coming here to feast off of our taxes . &quot; 
Simply put , when middle-class Europeans begin to think that a good portion of the poor are recent immigrants , their ingrained belief in the virtue of the welfare state will begin to waver . 
Even Europe &apos;s leftist intelligentsia now associates crime and urban squalor with immigration . 
The step from here to lamenting the high taxes spent on welfare for immigrants is a but a short one . 
When this happens - and I say &quot; when , &quot; not &quot; if &quot; - there are three possible political responses . 
One is to close borders to poor immigrants , eliminating any correlation between poverty and immigration . 
The second is to somehow restrict welfare benefits to &quot; natives . &quot; 
The third is to reduce the size of welfare for all because political support for it is declining . 
The first strategy is short sighted and the second odious . 
I hope that the third one will win out , because it would mean relatively open borders , no discrimination , and less government intervention . 
Not to worry : the European welfare state will remain more generous than the stingy American one , but it may become more manageable and less intrusive . 
The fact that this will come about because of ethnic &quot; animosity &quot; is sad and depressing . 
The silver lining is that the European welfare state does indeed need trimming !
