The Irrepressible 1930 &quot; s 
LONDON - The just concluded G-20 meeting in Seoul broke up without agreement on either currencies or trade . 
China and the United States accused each other of deliberately manipulating their currencies to get a trade advantage . 
The Doha Round of global trade talks remain stalled . 
And , amid talk of the &quot; risks &quot; of new currency and trade wars , such wars have already begun . 
Thus , despite global leaders &quot; vows to the contrary , it seems that the dreadful protectionist precedent of the 1930 &quot; s is about to be revived . 
That decade &apos;s trade war was started by the US with the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 . 
The British retaliated with the Import Duties Act of 1932 , followed by Imperial Preference . 
Soon , the world economy was a thicket of trade barriers . 
Britain fired the first shot in the 1930 &quot; s currency war , leaving the gold standard in September 1931 . 
The US retaliated by leaving the gold standard in April 1933 . 
The pound fell against the dollar , then the dollar against the pound . 
While the two main currencies of the day were slugging it out , France headed a European &quot; gold bloc &quot; of countries whose currencies became increasingly overvalued against both , until the bloc collapsed in 1936 . 
A world economic conference , convened in London in 1933 to end the currency war , adjourned without reaching any decision . 
Substitute China for Britain and today &apos;s eurozone for the gold bloc and the trend of events today has the same ominous feel . 
The US Federal Reserve now proposes to stimulate the American economy by printing more money - a second round of ( quantitative easing , or QE2 ) , to the tune of $ 600 billion . 
Almost no one remembers that President Franklin Roosevelt tried the same thing in 1933 . 
Prices had started falling in September of that year , following a brief commodity boom . George F. Warren , a professor of farm management at Cornell University , told FDR that the way to raise prices was by reducing the gold value of the dollar . 
Under the gold standard , the dollar was convertible into gold at a fixed price of $ 20.67 an ounce . 
To stabilize the price level , the economist Irving Fisher had produced a plan for a &quot; compensated dollar , &quot; which would vary the dollar &apos;s gold value to offset rising or falling prices , in effect allowing the Fed to issue more or fewer dollars as dictated by business conditions . 
In response to deflationary pressure , Fisher &apos;s plan would have enabled banks to draw down their reserves and thus , supposedly , increase their lending ( or create deposits ) . 
The extra spending would cause prices to rise , which would stimulate business activity . 
Fisher provided a new rationale for an old practice of debasing the coinage called seignorage . 
The variant proposed by Warren , and followed by FDR in 1933 , was to raise the price at which the government bought gold from the mint . 
Since a higher price meant that each dollar cost less in terms of gold , the result would be the same as in the Fisher plan . 
Domestic prices would rise , helping farmers , and the external value of the dollar would fall , helping exporters . 
Starting on 25 October 1933 , Roosevelt , Henry Morgenthau , his acting Secretary of the Treasury , and Jesse Jones , head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , met every morning in Roosevelt &apos;s bedroom to set the price of gold . 
One day , they increased it by $ 0.21 , since 21 seemed like a lucky number . 
At first , they bought only newly minted gold in the US . 
Later they bought up gold supplies from abroad . 
The gold-buying policy raised the official gold price from $ 20.67 an ounce in October 1933 to $ 35.00 an ounce in January 1934 , when the experiment was discontinued . 
By then , several hundred million dollars had been pumped into the banking system . 
The results were disappointing , however . 
Buying foreign gold did succeed in driving down the dollar &apos;s value in terms of gold . 
But domestic prices continued falling throughout the three months of the gold-buying spree . 
The Fed &apos;s more orthodox efforts at quantitative easing produced equally discouraging results . 
In John Kenneth Galbraith &apos;s summary : &quot; Either from a shortage of borrowers , an unwillingness to lend , or an overriding desire to be liquid - undoubtedly it was some of all three - the banks accumulated reserves in excess of requirements . 
Reserves of member banks at Fed were $ 256 million more than required in 1932 ; $ 528 million in 1933 , $ 1.6 billion in 1934 , $ 2.6 billion in 1936 . &quot; 
What was wrong with the Fed &apos;s policy was the so-called quantity theory of money on which it was based . 
This theory held that prices depend on the supply of money relative to the quantity of goods and services being sold . 
But money includes bank deposits , which depend on business confidence . 
As the saying went , &quot; You can &apos;t push on a string . &quot; 
Keynes wrote at the time : &quot; Some people seem to infer ... that output and income can be raised by increasing the quantity of money . 
But this is like trying to get fat by buying a larger belt . 
In the United States today , the belt is plenty big enough for the belly .... It is &#91; not &#93; the quantity of money , &#91; but &#93; the volume of expenditure which is the operative factor . &quot; 
Now the US , relying on the same flawed theory , is doing it again . 
But the resulting increase in US exports at the expense of Chinese , Japanese , and European producers is precisely the purpose . 
The euro will become progressively overvalued , just as the gold bloc was in the 1930 &quot; s . 
Since the eurozone is committed to austerity , its only recourse is protectionism . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s policy of slowly letting the renminbi rise against the dollar might well go into reverse , provoking US protectionism . 
The failure of the G-20 &quot; s Seoul meeting to make any progress towards agreement on exchange rates or future reserve arrangements opens the door to a re-run of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Let &apos;s hope that wisdom prevails before the rise of another Hitler .
