Free Trade with a Human Face 
MEXICO CITY - Although many Americans believe immigration is a domestic issue that should be excluded from talks with other governments , this is not a view held by other nations - or by the United States . 
Indeed , the US negotiated its first immigration deal in 1907 , maintained for more than two decades a controversial treaty with Mexico covering immigration , and has kept up immigration talks and deals even with Fidel Castro since the early 1960 &quot; s . 
For many Latin American nations , not just Mexico , immigration is the single most important issue in their relations with the US . 
The Caribbean islands all have a similarly high proportion of their citizens residing in the US and depend as much as Mexico on remittances . 
The same is true for much of Central America . 
So almost all of Latin America is deeply affected by the current immigration climate in the US , and would benefit greatly from the type of comprehensive immigration reform that both John McCain and Barack Obama have supported . 
The Bush administration &apos;s regrettable decision to build fences along the US-Mexico border , raid workplaces and housing sites , detain and deport foreigners without papers , is viewed in Latin America as being hypocritical and offensive . 
The issue is all the more painful and disappointing since most Latin American foreign ministries know full well that these attitudes are pure politics , nothing more . 
Everyone knows what viable immigration reform in the US will entail : tightening security at the border , but also including gates in the walls currently being built ; legalizing , with expeditious and sensible fines and conditions , the 15 million or so foreigners present in the US illegally ; and establishing a migrant or temporary worker program that allows a sufficient number of foreigners to satisfy the growing needs of the US economy , with paths both to regular visits home and to US permanent residence . 
A second component is political will and timing . 
Bush had it right at the beginning : his willingness to negotiate an immigration agreement with Mexico at the start of his term was probably the only way to get it done . 
Moving quickly is probably the only way the next president can succeed on this front as well . 
If immigration is to become a less heated issue , the US must address the needs of Latin America &apos;s economies . 
Here , one of the key challenges facing the next US administration lies in the existing and pending free-trade agreements between the US and Latin America . 
If John McCain is elected , tinkering with or overhauling NAFTA , CAFTA , and free-trade deals with Chile and Peru , as Barack Obama has proposed , will be unlikely . 
If recession drags on and Americans continue to blame trade agreements - erroneously - for growing unemployment , falling wages , and yawning inequality , opposition to these deals will grow . 
Instead of waiting for the pressure to mount , the next president would do well to preempt it with an ambitious agenda on free-trade reform that would benefit everyone . 
In this respect , the US could learn from the European Union . 
American trade agreements have been faulted for limiting themselves to trade . 
The response has always been : the US is not Europe , nor is it in the business of nation-building or reconstruction . 
First , clear and explicit human rights and democracy clauses should be included , along the lines of similar clauses in the Mexican and Chilean Economic Association treaties with the EU . 
Second , more specific provisions on labor , the environment , gender equality , and indigenous rights are needed , as well as anti-trust , regulatory , and judicial reform provisions , for reasons both of principle and political expediency . 
Although there have been enormous improvements in most of these areas , there remains a huge agenda , particularly with regard to breaking up or regulating monopolies - public , private , commercial , trade union-based - that plague nearly every country in the region . 
These revised agreements should include bold , enlightened provisions for infrastructure and &quot; social-cohesion &quot; funds , since these can make the difference between muddling through and true success . 
Free-trade advocates should not view Obama &apos;s demand that these deals be revisited as a mistake , but rather as an opportunity to improve and deepen them ; 
Improving Mexican and Central American infrastructure , education , and rule of law , or improving Colombian and Peruvian drug-enforcement efforts and respect for labor laws and human rights , are all in America &apos;s interest , and-free trade agreements can help rather than harm such efforts . 
If the US and Latin America can face up to the challenges of trade and immigration together , the next US president may leave a weightier mark on the hemispheric relationship than any American leader in three generations .
