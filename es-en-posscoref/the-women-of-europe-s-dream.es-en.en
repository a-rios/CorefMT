The Women of Europe &apos;s Dream 
LAUSANNE - I was born in 1945 . 
My grandfather was a German Jew . 
Fortunately , none of my immediate family perished in the Holocaust . 
But its shadow hung over me throughout my formative years . 
When I began , in my teens , to meet with German contemporaries , there was an initial reticence and discomfort . 
But we talked and talked and talked . 
There was no attempt to hide the past , but there was a burning desire to make a different future . 
It followed that I became an ardent Europhile . 
Two decades ago , the Berlin Wall was torn asunder by jubilant crowds . 
Today , ten former communist nations are fully integrated members of the European Union . 
Were my father to reappear suddenly and I told him that Lithuania was a member state , he would stare in disbelief and wonder what I was smoking . 
The sad news , however , is that as the structure of the Union ( for example , the single market and the single currency ) has been put in place , the spirit of unity has died . 
The European &quot; project &quot; has become an exercise of unalloyed cynicism . 
The most depressing illustration of this has been the handling of the &quot; European Constitution &quot; and the Lisbon Treaty , and the totally unedifying means by which the European president , a key part of the Lisbon Treaty , is being selected . 
The good news is that Tony Blair &apos;s candidacy seems to have been ditched . 
The reasons for his inappropriateness for the post are too numerous to mention - the single word &quot; Iraq &quot; should suffice . 
It would have been an act of supreme cynicism and hypocrisy , even by European standards , had he been selected . 
The bad news is that the other candidates allegedly being considered - all current or mainly former heads of government - are as inspiring as cold porridge . 
The implications of what we are currently witnessing could be enormous . 
As impressive as Europe &apos;s history has been since the Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community in 1957 , by no means should it be assumed that the EU has become permanent . 
Indeed , on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , no less a Euro-luminary than Jacques Delors expressed the fear that the EU could &quot; unravel &quot; ; 
Germany &apos;s former foreign minister , Joschka Fischer , expressed similar sentiments in an interview on the BBC in early 2009 . 
While such an outcome may be improbable , it would be complacent folly to dismiss the possibility . 
No institution , society , or civilization can survive purely on autopilot . 
History , after all , is replete with &quot; rise-and-fall &quot; stories . 
So who the EU president will be matters a lot . What is needed is someone of impeccable integrity and the capacity to inspire - and especially to engage Europe &apos;s young people . 
I see only two possible candidates that could meet these qualities : former Irish President Mary Robinson and French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde . 
I have not excluded men a priori in this exercise , but none occurred to me , and in any case the EU establishment has too many middle-aged white men as it is . 
Although the differences between Robinson and Lagarde are many , both would be excellent choices . 
Robinson may be the more inspirational candidate in light of the projects with which she has been involved since leaving office : Chair of the United Nations Human Rights Commission , Honorary President of Oxfam International , Chair of the International Institute for Environment and Development , Chair of the Council of Women World Leaders , and founder of the Ethical Globalization Initiative . 
Lagarde has other strengths . 
She is an accomplished professional , having been Chair of one of the world &apos;s largest law firms and ranked by Forbes in 2008 as the 14th most powerful woman in the world . 
Thus , she has had two brilliant careers - in business and in politics - and has enormous charisma . 
Both women therefore represent very different choices as leaders and potential role models . 
Moreover , Robinson , born in 1944 , is a twentieth-century person . 
The presidency of the EU would mark the twilight of her career . 
Lagarde , at 53 , is considerably younger . 
Reviving the European dream , however , requires not just the choice of an individual . 
There has to be a cause . 
And this is where a key question hangs over Lagarde : how does she feel about Turkey &apos;s membership in the Union ? 
Her boss , Nicolas Sarkozy , is vehemently opposed , but Sarkozy ( who cannot speak English and is computer illiterate ) can hardly be described as a twenty-first-century role model . 
Lagarde , by contrast , seems to be a global Renaissance woman , but her views on Turkey &apos;s EU membership could disprove that image . 
Perhaps the greatest challenge for Europe in the twenty-first century is to bring down the walls between its non-Muslim and Muslim communities . 
This applies not only to Muslim citizens in the EU , but also to those in the Balkans - notably Bosnia , Kosovo , and Albania - in the former Soviet Union , and especially in Turkey . 
This cannot be accomplished overnight . 
Incorporating Turkey - and eventually other majority Muslim European countries - into the EU is the European dream of the twenty-first century . 
Getting the right president in 2010 would be an important step in this journey . 
Robinson or Lagarde could be the inspiring leaders that the EU needs to make this dream a reality .
