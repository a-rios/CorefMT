Abenomics for Asia 
TOKYO - Once again , Japan is Asia &apos;s odd country out . 
For two decades , as one Asian economy after another boomed , Japan &apos;s economy remained virtually stagnant . 
Now , with GDP growth in Asia &apos;s two giants , China and India , slowing precipitously - a decline that appears to be contributing to diminishing economic performance in much of the rest of Asia - Japan is recording its strongest growth since its 1980 &quot; s boom . 
But , just as Japan &apos;s post-war economic model became the template for the Asian economic miracles of recent decades , the reforms currently being implemented by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ( &quot; Abenomics &quot; ) may offer Asian economies a path back to strong growth . 
If the fallout from China &apos;s slowdown is not to hit the entire region and jeopardize the economic integration that has already taken place , Asia &apos;s governments - beginning with China - will need to embrace similar reforms . 
How did Asia &apos;s boom fade so quickly ? 
Economics is supposedly a cold-blooded subject . 
Japan has paid a high price for this attitude . 
Even after its property bubble burst 24 years ago , the authorities continued to believe that the country &apos;s growth model needed no adjustment . 
The result was two lost decades of deflation and introspection before Japan finally embraced the reforms needed to kick-start a new , more open - and hence more vibrant - economic model . 
China and India , it seems , have also succumbed to economic hubris . 
Three decades of success in China , and a decade in which India supposedly overcame the old , slow , &quot; Hindu rate of growth , &quot; are ending with both economies slowing precipitously . 
And both are slowing for the same reason : stalled reform , which is a direct result of governments being so satisfied with today &apos;s conditions that they fail to address tomorrow &apos;s rising dangers . 
China &apos;s government continues to turn a blind eye toward banks that lend to the politically well connected , or that tolerate companies - mostly state-owned - with poor financial discipline . 
Indeed , total public- and private-sector debt in China is now around 200 % of GDP , up by more than one-third in five years . 
Reckless lending is undermining efficient allocation of capital and preventing China from drawing a line under the investment- and export-led growth model of the past three decades and basing future growth more on domestic consumption . 
Likewise , India &apos;s government , having embraced economic liberalization , has essentially pulled back from it in recent years . 
Plans to allow foreign investment in retailing and other key economic sectors have been put on hold . 
In critical industries - mobile communications and mining are perhaps the two most important examples - privatization has been corrupted by cronyism . 
Moreover , India remains an inward-looking economy that attracts relatively little foreign investment and plays a much smaller role in world trade than it should . 
Notwithstanding its renowned software industry , India plays little part in the production chains that underpin Asia &apos;s regional trade patterns . 
The result - as visible as it was predictable - has been a sharp slowdown in economic growth . 
To be fair , there is a growing recognition in some countries of the need for change . 
The need to restore economic dynamism was the focus of South Korea &apos;s presidential election in 2012 , which brought the country &apos;s first-ever female president , Park Geun-hye , to power . 
Today , the country is gripped by an important debate about how to reform the chaebol , the mammoth industrial conglomerates that did so much to lift the country out of poverty and into the front ranks of the world &apos;s economies . 
Park &apos;s status as the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee , who put the chaebol at the center of South Korea &apos;s economy , could give her the credibility needed to recast their economic role . 
Elsewhere in Asia , including in China , the debate is only beginning . 
But progress on reform , particularly in finance , must come quickly , because in most countries - India is the main exception - the demographic window of a growing working-age population is closing , if not already shut . 
It is not necessarily bad for Asia &apos;s traditionally high savings rates to fall ; after all , consumption typically rises with an aging population . 
But savings will need to be allocated far more efficiently than in the past . 
Japan &apos;s lost decades provide a grim lesson of the economic cost of neglecting such reform . 
Moreover , borrowing in US dollars to finance current investment spending - as many emerging economies have done in recent years , as the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of quantitative easing flooded emerging markets with cheap funds - is no substitute . 
Indonesia , Thailand , and others are now finding it difficult to service these loans as their exchange rates fall against the dollar in the wake of the Fed &apos;s plans to &quot; taper &quot; its policy . 
Indeed , the debt build-up is so large that markets now fear a repeat of Asia &apos;s financial crisis . 
The Japanese precedent matters all the more , given that , 16 years after the Asian financial crisis nearly wiped out decades of hard-earned growth , Asia &apos;s banks and capital markets remain inefficient . 
Asia &apos;s economies need deep , well-regulated capital markets , so that savings can be allocated to where they yield the highest returns . 
Instead , today &apos;s poorly regulated financial sectors - China is the biggest culprit - misprice capital . 
Moreover , banks are too dominant : Asia ( including Japan ) accounts for more than half of the world &apos;s population but barely a quarter of global capital-market capitalization . 
Sixteen years ago , the Asian financial crisis erupted , following the Thai government &apos;s decision to float the baht in the face of speculative attacks . 
The response of governments to that crisis has shaped much of the region &apos;s economic policymaking ever since . 
If Asia is to avoid another crisis on a similar scale , or lost decades of growth , its governments will need to embrace the type of all-encompassing reforms that Japan is undertaking . 
Abenomics , it seems , is for everyone .
