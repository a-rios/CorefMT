Egypt Needs a President , Not a Pharaoh 
Egypt is undergoing a heated nationwide debate over political reform . 
The central issue is a demand by all opposition parties and civil society groups to amend the 1971 constitution and abolish the 23-year-old State of Emergency that was imposed following Anwar Sadat &apos;s assassination in 1981 . 
Such demands are not new . 
But President Hosni Mubarak and the ruling National Democratic Party have been stonewalling since the mid-1980 &apos;s . 
What makes the demands for reform more pressing this time are ominous developments in Egypt , the region , and in the wider world . 
At home , concern about Mubarak &apos;s age ( 76 ) and deteriorating health has grown . 
Mubarak &apos;s ill health , widely rumored for years , was never officially acknowledged until November 2003 , when it could no longer be covered up . 
While speaking to Parliament , Mubarak fainted before millions of TV viewers . 
Although he returned an hour later and delivered the rest of his speech , Egyptians began to demand greater transparency regarding the president &apos;s health as well as other state affairs . 
Meanwhile , Egypt &apos;s sagging economy , high unemployment rate , and rampant corruption have driven many Egyptian youngsters to despair . 
More than one half of living Egyptians were born since Mubarak assumed office . 
According to a recent report by the UN Development Program , roughly half of those between 15 and 30 years old dream of emigrating to Europe , North America , or Australia . 
There are weekly reports of would-be illegal Egyptian immigrants drowning in the Mediterranean . 
A few weeks ago , several youngsters suffocated to death while being deported back to Egypt across the Libyan desert in overloaded trucks . 
The incident caused an uproar that compelled the authorities to arrest , interrogate , and try the Egyptian police officers in charge . 
Regional and international events have also emboldened the Egyptian opposition , not only to press for reform , but to focus on amending the constitution &apos;s articles that pertain to the presidency . 
Mubarak has been re-elected four times , and rumors have persisted that he will either seek a fifth six-year term or establish a &quot; hereditary republic &quot; and groom his 41-year old son , Gamal , to succeed him , like Syria &apos;s Hafez al-Assad and son , Bashar . 
The opposition battle cry is &quot; No &quot; to Mubarak &apos;s re-election and &quot; No &quot; to passing the presidency to Gamal . 
Many Egyptians may not have major misgivings about Gamal Mubarak per se , but they find it mortifying that , after 24 years of the father , they might be stuck with another 24 or more years of the son . 
The current constitution was adopted in October 1971 , and has 211 articles , 30 of which concern the presidency . 
The president is nominated by two-thirds of the People &apos;s Assembly , and endorsed in a plebiscite that allows only for a simple &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No . &quot; 
A simple majority of the ballots is required to win a six-year term , which is renewable indefinitely by the same process . 
These lax procedures contrast jarringly with the president &apos;s powers . 
The president is the head of state and commander-in-chief ; officiates over the Supreme Judiciary Council , the Supreme Police Council , and the Cabinet of Ministers ; and can appoint and recall one or more vice-presidents at his sole discretion . 
He also appoints the prime minister and senior ministers , and must approve all other ministers , ambassadors , and state representatives . 
He can call general elections , declare war , impose a state of emergency , and issue decrees that have the force of law . 
There are no checks and balances on these powers . 
A single article stipulates that , &quot; Accusation of the President of committing grand treason or any other criminal act may be made upon a motion submitted by at least one-third of members of the People &apos;s Assembly and approved by two-thirds . &quot; 
The president is then suspended from carrying out his duties , and the vice-president fills in until the accusation is resolved . 
But Mubarak has never enacted the law essential to implementing this article or appointed a vice-president , despite repeated popular demands to do so . 
The result has been a de facto &quot; imperial presidency , &quot; with Mubarak likened to the god-king Pharaohs of ancient Egypt . 
No other head of state in modern times enjoys as much power . 
A more apt analogy popular in Egypt compares Mubarak to Leonid Brezhnev , who for two decades presided over the Soviet Union &apos;s stagnation and decline . 
Egypt &apos;s status as a regional power under Mubarak has similarly weakened steadily . 
On the economic front , annual foreign investment inflows have plummeted from $ 3 billion in the mid-1990 &apos;s to a minuscule $ 300 million in 2003 . 
Demands for reform are now focused on introducing direct presidential elections with two or more contenders , and limiting presidents to two consecutive terms in office . 
It is no less important to reduce the presidency &apos;s sweeping powers and formulate viable mechanisms for enforcing the accountability of all public officials without exception . 
Should Mubarak and his government fail to recommend constitutional amendments that satisfy these demands , ever more Egyptians will desert the regime and risk their lives in search of salvation in other lands .
