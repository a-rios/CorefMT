A Nice Mess in Nice 
LONDON : A hundred years ago , the humorous English magazine Punch carried a cartoon which depicted a young and nervous curate eating breakfast with his bishop . 
He was eating a boiled egg , and clearly not enjoying it . 
The bishop enquired : &quot; I say - is your egg all right ? &quot; 
The cartoon caught the English fancy , and created a catch-phrase still in use today , although it is usually misunderstood and misused . 
Someone may say : &quot; It &apos;s a bit of a curate &apos;s egg , &quot; when he means that something is a mixture of good and bad . 
But of course the point of the original joke was that the curate was just being polite : an egg is either good or bad , and his was bad . 
This week &apos;s European Summit at Nice ( December 7-9 ) looks like being a curate &apos;s egg . 
The question is , will it be bad all through and a failure ? 
The probable answer is : both . 
It will almost certainly fail to achieve its immediate objectives ; but it may open the door to serious progress afterwards . 
The ostensible purpose of the summit is to make those changes in the European Union &apos;s decision-making machinery that would enable it to cope with the admission of at least 12 new members , mainly from Central and Eastern Europe . 
Everyone knows that these changes ought to be radical , even semi-federal . 
At the very least , the coming enlargement will call for much more majority voting in the Council of Ministers , if the Union is not be paralyzed by 27 member states and 27 national vetoes . 
But most member states are unwilling to contemplate anything that far-reaching . 
The host French , who currently hold the EU Presidency , have listed 50 policy areas where majority voting might be possible . 
Every country , however , has special sensitivities : the Germans are unwilling to be outvoted on immigration ; the French are unwilling to be outvoted on trade in services ; the British are unwilling to be outvoted on taxation . 
The cumulative result of all these national objections , is that the Nice summit is likely to see only a modest increase in the potential for majority voting , much smaller than enlargement requires . 
A similar reluctance will dominate the rest of the immediate institutional agenda . 
In principle , the Commission ought to be slimmed down after enlargement , with fewer Commissioners than member states . 
Equally , big member states ought to have more votes in the Council of Ministers , to reflect their greater populations . 
Small member states do not like either proposition , because they would lose Commissioners and votes . 
On both issues , expect a serious tug-of-war , and any decisions are likely to be half-hearted , or in practice postponed . 
Yet , the 15 member states may compensate for their collective failure of nerve by opening up easier options for flexible or multi-speed integration . 
This might be a way round the majority voting dilemma , since it would allow groups of member states to cooperate together in particular areas , without waiting for the unanimous agreement of all partners . 
Whether this would really be a desirable procedure is hotly debated ; but the fact is that multi-speed integration already exists in the sense that Britain and Denmark are not now , and may never be , members of the euro . 
If these scraps were to be the sum total of the Nice summit , it will prove unsatisfactory , even a failure . 
But the real significance of the meeting may turn out to be , not the limited decisions which the heads of government are able and willing to take this time round , but the opening up , virtually for the first time , of serious discussion about the future direction of the European Union . 
One thing that will happen at Nice will be the formal adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights . 
In its present form , this document recapitulates all kinds of rights which EU citizens already enjoy under existing laws ; it is not intended to confer any new rights , and it cannot be enforced in the European Court of Justice . 
In other words , it is a public relations conjuring trick , designed to make the EU seem more attractive , without actually conferring any real benefits . 
Even as a conjuring trick , the Charter could be influential . 
For example , Article 2 reads : &quot; Everyone has the right to life . 
No one shall be condemned to the death penalty , or executed . &quot; 
It seems evident that this principle will be effectively binding on all member states , and all candidates for membership . 
The question at Nice will be whether the Charter should be incorporated into the EU Treaties , and thus given the force of law . 
Another similar question at Nice will be whether the time has come to simplify the EU Treaties , which are now a confusing jumble of general principles and difficult detail . 
Simplification might be intended , at the start , as another conjuring trick : to make the Treaties more comprehensible to voters without changing anything in law . 
But it could also become the first , essential step on the road to the drafting of a European constitution .
