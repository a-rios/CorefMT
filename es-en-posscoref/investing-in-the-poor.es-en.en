Investing in the Poor 
Most people believe that the world of finance has no concern for the little guy , for all the low- and middle-income people who , after all , contribute little to the bottom line . 
Today &apos;s huge companies and the financial wizards who lead them - or buy and sell them - may be generous to their churches , favorite charities , and families and friends , but their professional lives are defined solely by the relentless pursuit of profits . 
That perception may be largely true , but not entirely so . 
Consider Muhammad Yunus , who won the Nobel Peace Prize last October . 
His Grameen Bank , founded in 1976 in Bangladesh , has offered tiny loans to some of the poorest people in the world , helping to lift many borrowers out of poverty . 
The Bank made a profit and grew over the years - and has inspired similar microcredit schemes elsewhere . 
But was money Yunus &apos;s ultimate motive ? 
In interviews , he reveals that he was actually motivated by a deep sympathy for the plight of the poor in his country . 
His goal of building a profitable lending business seems to have reflected his desire to believe in the trustworthiness of his clients . 
He tried to make a profit in microfinance in order to prove these neglected people &apos;s creditworthiness , so that he could continue lending to them . 
Paradoxically , then , while Yunus was pursuing profit , he was apparently not doing it for the money . 
And there are others within the field of finance who are similarly motivated . 
Indeed , the history of financial institutions for low-income people is largely a history of philanthropic or idealistic movements , not just activities focused entirely on the bottom line . 
The cooperative movement of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was associated with a long list of financial and insurance institutions - including savings banks , building societies , and savings-and-loan societies - to help less-advantaged people . 
Such philanthropic finance continues today . 
Peter Tufano , a finance professor at Harvard Business School , has quietly been doing nonprofit work with the foundation he created , Doorways to Dreams , to help low-income people improve their financial prospects . 
As far as I can determine in talking with him , his purpose is entirely high-minded . 
He doesn &apos;t seem to care about making money for himself . 
According to Tufano , the fundamental problem in encouraging low-income people to save is that they need the money not just to manage their lives years in the future , when they retire , but also to deal with short-term crises . 
But if government programs designed to promote saving by low-income people don &apos;t tie up their money for many years until retirement , they will often succumb to temptation and spend the money frivolously . 
Tufano approaches the problem with real sympathy for these people , and a realistic idea about how to help them : premium savings bonds . 
In addition to normal interest payments , these bonds have an attached lottery - an enticement to keep the money in savings . 
Low-income people manifestly enjoy lotteries , and they will acquire the habit of looking forward to the lottery dates , which will deter them from cashing in their bonds . 
But if a real emergency arises , they can get their money . 
In fact , lottery bonds have a long history . 
In 1694 , the English government issued a 10 % 16-year bond called &quot; the Million Adventure , &quot; which awarded prizes randomly each year to its holders . 
Likewise , Harold MacMillan &apos;s government created a lottery bonds program - called premium bonds , or &quot; saving with a thrill &quot; - in the United Kingdom in 1956 . 
The program was controversial at first : many viewed it as immoral , because of its connection with gambling . 
But the program has grown , and today premium bonds have a place in the saving portfolio of 23 million people , almost 40 % of the UK population . 
Sweden , too , has such bonds , as do other countries . 
But , while such bonds have succeeded in raising savings rates in the countries that have created them , they have not had advocates in the United States . 
Tufano &apos;s strategy to change that is to test his ideas in partnership with firms . 
He has launched pilot tests of &quot; prize-linked &quot; accounts in cooperation with Centra Credit Union , based in Columbus , Indiana . 
If the product helps families save , he hopes to persuade lawmakers to make this type of savings scheme easier to offer in America . 
Tufano is the first to admit that some of the best ideas for financial innovation are very old , even hundreds of years old . 
They may get lost for a while , and initially they may sound strange when they are rediscovered , but people like Yunus and Tufano show that they can be updated and implemented with the help of disinterested but passionate advocacy . 
Their inherent spirit of goodwill , and the goodwill they can inspire from other financial professionals , holds out the hope of a brighter future to everyone , especially those who are most in need .
