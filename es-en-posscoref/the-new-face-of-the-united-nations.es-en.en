The New Face of the United Nations 
On January 1 , 2007 , Ban Ki-Moon , South Korea &apos;s former foreign minister , will become United Nations Secretary-General , following Kofi Annan &apos;s ten-year tenure . 
Annan inspired the world with his diplomacy and leadership on poverty reduction and human rights , but the war in Iraq divided the world and drew attention and financial resources away from crisis regions and critical long-term problems like climate change , disease control , sustainable energy , and access to water . 
With the recent elections in the United States and the rise of Asia &apos;s global influence , there is an opportunity to turn the world &apos;s attention to the most critical challenges facing our planet . 
In addition to the long-term challenges of poverty , the environment , nuclear proliferation , and UN reform , the new Secretary-General will inherit a long list of hotspots : Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , Palestine , Lebanon , Somalia , Myanmar , Sudan , North Korea , and others . 
Recent attempts to influence developments in these countries through threats and sanctions , and sometimes war , have failed . 
Most are less stable today than they were five years ago . 
Clearly , a new approach is needed . 
The leading Asian countries , including Ban &apos;s South Korea , have long favored a balance of diplomatic approaches and economic incentives as the way to solve complex challenges . 
Rather than relying on sanctions and threats of force , the idea is to underpin long-term prosperity in today &apos;s unstable regions . 
This balanced approach is important because most of the world &apos;s hotspots are in trouble not only , or even mainly , because of politics , but because of the underlying challenges of hunger , disease , and environmental crisis . 
Consider Darfur , a crisis that has been debated in the UN Security Council as a confrontation between the Sudanese Government and the people of Darfur . 
But the deeper truth is that Darfur is unstable because it is home to an impoverished and fast-growing population without adequate supplies of water , food , health clinics , schools , and other basic services . 
Rather than focusing on sanctions , the major powers would do much better to work with Sudan &apos;s government to propose and help to finance long-term development strategies . 
Defusing the crises in Darfur and elsewhere will be among the greatest challenges facing the new Secretary-General . 
Yet it is vital that the UN not simply lurch from one hotspot to the next . 
The UN also has the unique role and opportunity to offer leadership in building a global consensus around vital long-term environmental and economic challenges facing the planet . 
Climate change , deforestation , growing populations , and other ecological strains will challenge the very survival of hundreds of millions of people around the world in the coming decades . 
In fact , from 1992 to 2002 , the UN &apos;s member governments signed a number of treaties and agreements that can and should provide the foundation for long-term global solutions . 
Three treaties emerged in 1992 out of the so-called Rio Conference on the Environment - on climate change , biodiversity conservation , and desertification . 
In 2000 , the member governments agreed on the Millennium Development Goals . 
And in 2002 , they agreed on the Monterrey Consensus , pledging concrete efforts to triple aid flows to the poorest in order to reach the international goal for foreign assistance of 0.7 % of rich-world GNP . 
The key for today &apos;s UN , therefore , is not to create more goals , but to implement those that have been set . 
This , too , fits strongly with the spirit in which Ban has approached his new position . 
He has made clear his intention that the UN should implement the commitments that the world community has made . 
Without implementation , all of the treaties in the world would lead us nowhere . 
During his mandate , the Secretary-General will face the pressing challenge of forging a global agreement on climate change for the years beyond 2012 , when the Kyoto Protocol ends . 
The Millennium Development Goals remain far off track in the poorest countries , with just nine years to go . 
Despite a global pledge to reduce significantly the loss of biological diversity by 2010 , huge areas of rainforest and oceans continue to be destroyed . 
If the United States works more closely within the UN framework , it will find willing partners in the rising Asian powers , which are intent on using their influence and resources to solve today &apos;s challenges . 
After all , Asian countries are interested in global stability to underpin their own long-term development . 
They are acutely aware of their increasing influence around the world , as investors , trading partners , and as contributors to and victims of environmental change . 
Behind the scenes , the Asian powers can help to defuse the crises in Darfur , North Korea , Myanmar , and elsewhere . 
And they will be crucial to forging new cooperative approaches to climate change , water scarcity , and the like . 
The new Secretary-General comes to office with the world yearning to solve festering problems . 
Importantly , there is already broad agreement on a set of shared goals . 
The challenge is implementation .
