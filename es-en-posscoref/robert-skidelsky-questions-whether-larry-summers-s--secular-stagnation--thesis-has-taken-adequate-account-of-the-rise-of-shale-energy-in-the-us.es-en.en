Shale Gas to the Rescue ? 
LONDON - The developed world is slowly emerging from the Great Recession , but a question lingers : How fast and how far will the recovery go ? 
One big source of pessimism has been the idea that we are running out of investment opportunities - and have been since before the 2008 crash . 
But is that true ? 
The last big surge of innovation was the Internet revolution , whose products came onstream in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Following the dot-com collapse of the early 2000 &quot; s , speculation in real estate and financial assets - enabled by cheap money - kept Western economies going . 
The post-2008 slump merely exposed the unsoundness of the preceding boom ; the mediocrity of the recovery reflects the mediocrity of previous prospects , coolly considered . 
The risk now is that a debt-fueled asset spike merely perpetuates the boom-bust cycle . 
The economist Larry Summers has reintroduced the term &quot; secular stagnation &quot; to describe what awaits us . 
By the mid-2000 &quot; s , Summers argued at a recent International Monetary Fund conference , the average prospective return on new investment in the United States had fallen below any feasible reduction in the Federal Reserve &apos;s benchmark interest rate . 
That remains true today . 
We may be in a permanent liquidity trap , in which nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero , but the expected rate of return to investment remains negative . 
Unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing may inflate a new generation of asset bubbles , but the underlying problem - negative returns to new investment - will not have been solved by the time the next crash comes . 
So the problem is poor investment prospects . 
Why ? 
In the 1930 &quot; s , the economist Alvin Hansen argued that opportunities for new investment in already-rich countries were drying up . 
Investment growth had depended on population growth , technological innovation , and westward expansion . 
With the closing of the frontier and static populations , growth would depend on innovation ; but future innovation would require smaller inputs of capital and labor than in the past . 
In other words , the returns to capital were bound to fall as it became more abundant relative to population . 
In this situation , full employment could be maintained only by running continuous fiscal deficits . 
John Maynard Keynes held a different view . 
In 1945 , he wrote to T.S. Eliot : &quot; &#91; T &#93; he full employment policy by means of investment is only one particular application of an intellectual theorem . 
You can produce the result just as well by consuming more or working less . 
Personally , I regard the investment policy as first aid .... Less work is the ultimate solution . &quot; Developed countries &quot; strong postwar investment performance dispelled fear of secular stagnation . 
But this occurred after a world war that had created huge pent-up demand for new equipment , transport infrastructure , and household appliances , together with a military-industrial complex that armed the West during the Cold War . 
The real rate of return to capital may have started to decline by the early 1970 &quot; s ; productivity growth certainly has slowed since then . 
Some crucial changes in the political economy of Western capitalism in the 1980 &quot; s can also be viewed in this light : the rise of neoliberal ideology , the growing inequality of wealth and incomes , the increase in structural unemployment , the growth of financial services , globalization , the invention of post-Cold War threats to sustain military spending , and so on . 
The question today is whether a new upsurge of investment will come to our rescue . 
Optimists point to the shale-energy revolution in the US . 
The McKinsey Global Institute has identified shale energy as a &quot; game changer &quot; for the world economy , estimatingthat it could boost America &apos;s GDP by as much as 4 % ( $ 690 billion ) per year and add 1.7 million permanent jobs to the labor market by 2020 . 
From 2007 to 2012 , North American shale-gas production grew at an average annual rate of more than 50 % . 
With the share of imports in US natural-gas consumption dropping from 16.5 % in 2007 to 11 % in 2010 , America is on the path to energy self-sufficiency . 
Likewise , a September 2013 report by IHS concludes that midstream industries like transportation and downstream industries like manufacturing and chemicals are also receiving a massive stimulus . 
As a result of the shale-energy boom , &quot; over $ 216 billion in total will be invested in the midstream and downstream oil and gas industries &quot; from 2012 to 2025 . 
Nearly 380,000 of the 2.1 million jobs that shale-related industries generated in the US in 2012 , were created in these areas . 
Beyond this , the most dramatic impact of shale oil and gas on the economy has been the fall in energy prices . 
In the US , the price of natural gas has fallen to $ 4 per MMBtu , from $ 13 in 2008 , boosting household purchasing power . 
IHS estimates that in 2012 , developments in the shale-energy industry increased households &quot; real disposable income by more than $ 1,200 . 
Thus the shale revolution represents a huge stimulus for America , in terms of investment , exports , and a reduction in energy costs . 
I am not in a position either to judge the quantitative impact of shale energy on the US economy and , via growth there , on the rest of the world , or to comment on its geopolitical consequences or net effect on carbon emissions . 
But it does seem to me that contemporary apostles of secular stagnation like Summers and Paul Krugman at least ought to be taking the shale-energy revolution into account .
