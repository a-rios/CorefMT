The Anarchist and the President 
BOGOT√Å - The Julian Assange affair means different things to different people , but one lesson should be clear to all : states are not inconsequential to journalism . 
When WikiLeaks hit the global news scene , it was saluted as a true original : an innovative form of journalism that countered states &quot; power by challenging their ability to suppress critical , sensitive , or unflattering news . 
WikiLeaks capitalized on the potential of digital technologies to circumvent official censorship and , thanks to whistle-blowers , disseminated information that governments wanted to keep secret . 
As a result , Assange was viewed as the embodiment of a new type of &quot; anarchist &quot; journalist who could ignore state borders and scare government officials ( or at least make them more cautious about what they write in diplomatic cables ) . 
Those who championed WikiLeaks rushed to celebrate it as a shining example of crusading , &quot; stateless &quot; journalism . 
Assange &apos;s international legal troubles , however , show that the state is alive and well , and that journalism is not beyond its reach . 
The state is not a relic of bygone times , displaced by global accountability . 
The visible hand of the state ( actually , several states ) is everywhere in this diplomatic imbroglio . 
The fact that Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa has emerged as Assange &apos;s foremost ally is profoundly ironic . 
Correa , who has tightened the screws on his country &apos;s press , hardly stands as the flag-bearer for the libertarian tradition of the press that Assange , the poster boy of &quot; stateless &quot; journalism , represents . 
Rather , he embodies a new version of an old breed of Latin American populist presidents , notoriously impatient with dissent and quick to stifle criticism . 
The return of populism in Argentina , Bolivia , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and Venezuela in the past decade has reinvigorated a Manichean view of the press : news organizations are seen as either &quot; loyal &quot; or &quot; subversive . &quot; 
Journalists are the government &apos;s communication arm or the enemy that must be co-opted or controlled ( repressed ) . 
The idea that the press should ensure political accountability , inform the public , and encourage more responsive government is foreign to the populist conviction that identifies &quot; good journalism &quot; with sycophantic scribes . 
Populist leaders in Latin America follow a long tradition of &quot; l &apos;etat c &apos;est moi &quot; : the president as the embodiment of the state . 
Public media resources are used to strengthen the executive rather than to serve the public interest , and presidents resort to &quot; gag &quot; laws to silence actual and potential critics . 
Thus , in their own national broadcasts - often weekly occurrences - populist presidents fulminate against journalists who dare to demand information or criticize public policies , plainly contradicting their own lofty rhetoric about citizen journalism and grassroots power . 
They generously reward the lapdog press , while castigating genuine watchdog journalism - or any media outlet that refuses to toe the official line . 
Correa has used a long list of colorful insults to characterize the press and journalists . 
Indeed , he has virtually written the playbook for discouraging the kind of journalism championed by WikiLeaks . 
For example , he has brought multimillion-dollar lawsuits against journalists who investigated corruption in his administration and columnists who criticized him . 
Moreover , his administration has proposed a new media law that confers significant power on public officials to determine suitable content - the very opposite of the kind of unrestrained freedom of expression that WikiLeaks symbolizes . 
Likewise , Correa has dispatched members of his cabinet to cut off public advertising in media outlets that he regards as adversaries , as if the use of public resources should be subject to calculations of personal costs and benefits . 
And , insisting on non-interference in Ecuador &apos;s internal affairs , the Correa administration has launched an all-out offensive against the Organization of American States &quot; Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression . 
So Correa &apos;s record is not exactly a paragon of support for the collaborative , critical , and open journalism promoted by WikiLeaks . 
In fact , it is hard to imagine that Correa would have embraced Assange had WikiLeaks revealed Ecuadorian state secrets , rather than the indiscretions and intrigue of American diplomacy . 
However the Assange saga unfolds , it has already poured cold water on the idea of lawless , post-national &quot; hacktivism . &quot; 
The apparent anarchy of the Internet and digital news fueled a vibrant global movement of people eager to shed light on the inner workings of governments and corporations . 
Now that movement has run up against the state &apos;s persistent power . 
Fortunately for Assange , a sympathetic president was willing to throw him a lifeline as he floundered in the treacherous waters of international law . 
Unfortunately for the movement that he represents , this also means that even the quintessential anarchist-journalist , now holed up in Ecuador &apos;s embassy in London , needs the protection of a state .
