Globalization and Anti-Americanism 
Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world . 
American Democrats say that President Bush &apos;s policies have squandered America &apos;s attractiveness . 
Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization . 
Anti-Americanism , they say , will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat . 
I believe that such views lack historical perspective . 
Contrary to conventional wisdom , globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world . 
Although the United States is at the forefront of the current information revolution , which is creating many similarities in social and cultural habits ( such as television viewing or Internet use ) that are attributed to Americanization , correlation is not causation . 
To see why , imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at a rapid rate in a world in which America did not exist . 
You would still expect major social and cultural changes from such modernization . 
Of course , because the US exists and is at the forefront of the information revolution , there is a degree of Americanization , but that is likely to diminish over the course of the twenty-first century as technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own ways . 
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan , a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization . 
In the middle of the nineteenth century , Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization , and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness . 
During the Meiji Restoration , Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism . 
It sent young people to the West for education . 
Its delegations scoured the world for ideas in science , technology , and industry . 
In the political realm , Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions , but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor . 
The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world is not simply that an Asian country can compete , but that after a century and a half of globalization , it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture . 
More fundamentally , the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture . 
Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality . 
As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it , those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization , betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact . 
Do we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time ? 
To find any of them one has to travel to the small , primitive , magico-religious communities made up of people ... who due to their primitive condition , become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination . 
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US . 
For example , many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War . 
Globalization is also a two-edged sword . 
In some areas , there is not only a backlash against American cultural imports , but an effort to change American culture itself . 
Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans , but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed , across much of the world . 
American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism . 
More subtly , America &apos;s openness to immigration both enriches and changes American culture . 
Finally , globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity . 
Some French commentators express fear that in a world of Internet global marketing , there will no longer be room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different types of cheese . 
But on the contrary , the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way that encourages niche markets , including hundreds of Web sites dedicated only to cheese . 
The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities . 
The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago . 
Britain , Belgium , and Spain , among others in Europe , have devolved more power to local regions . 
The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures . 
Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T-shirt logos and soft drink brands , but an underlying cultural diversity will remain . 
American culture is now prominent , and it contributes to America &apos;s attractiveness - its &quot; soft power &quot; - in many , but not all , areas . 
At the same time , immigrants , ideas , and events outside America &apos;s borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US . 
As globalization spreads technical capabilities , and information technology allows broader participation in global communications , American economic and cultural preponderance may diminish . 
A little less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about Americanization , fewer complaints about American arrogance , and less intensity in the anti-American backlash . 
The US may have less control in the future , but it may find itself living in a world somewhat more congenial to its basic values of democracy , free markets , individual liberties , and human rights .
