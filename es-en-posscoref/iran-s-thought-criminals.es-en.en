Iran &apos;s Thought Criminals 
My friend , the intellectual Kian Tajbakhsh , is in jail in Iran for , well , being an intellectual . 
He has not had access to a lawyer nor any visitors since being jailed for espionage and undermining the state . 
In short , if you live in Iran nowadays , intellectuals are the new terrorists . 
As in Hitler &apos;s Germany and Stalin &apos;s Russia , purveyors of ideas , information , and emotions are the enemy in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s Iran , especially if the people espousing such ideas happen to work for a foreign organization . 
And , thanks to Iran &apos;s example , that trend is proliferating across the Muslim world . 
Tajbakhsh , an internationally respected scholar , social scientist , urban planner , and dual citizen of Iran and the United States , has languished in Tehran &apos;s Evin Prison - notorious for its documented cases of torture and detainee abuse - since May 11 . 
I was shocked last week to see him on Iranian TV , pale and wan , giving the kind of faked confession that would have made Soviet prosecutors blush . 
Soft spoken , mild mannered , thoughtful , and with a wonderful sense of humor , Tajbakhsh is portrayed by the Iranian government as a ravenous wolf ready to devour the regime . 
Tajbakhsh was arrested along with other leading Iranian-American intellectuals , including Haleh Esfandiari of the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars . 
Esfandiari is a 67-year-old grandmother - just the right age to set about undermining Iran . 
Her lawyer , Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi , has been denied access to her . 
Meanwhile , journalist Parnaz Azima is not allowed to leave Iran . 
As an intellectual , Tajbakhsh cannot expect the world &apos;s celebrities to beg Iran &apos;s government for his release . 
Instead , he has received support from other intellectuals , such as the 3,400 members of the PEN American Center , the writers &quot; organization that fights for freedom of expression . 
The 14,000 members of the American Sociological Association have also asked for his release . 
You would think Tajbakhsh &apos;s record in Iran would rule out an accusation of treason . 
He has been a consultant to several Iranian ministries on urban planning , and helped the government in major rebuilding projects after the devastating earthquake that destroyed the ancient city of Bam in 2003 . 
In 2006 , he completed a three-year study of local government in Iran - hardly the stuff of insurrection and regime change . 
But Tajbakhsh was also a consultant to the Soros Foundation , which , according to Ahmadinejad &apos;s government , has worked against Islam . 
That idea is preposterous . 
In fact , the Foundation &apos;s many contributions to the Islamic world include help following catastrophic natural disasters in Pakistan and Indonesia , providing medical supplies to the Palestinians under blockade , and allowing scholars and intellectuals to learn from each other by translating and publishing works from English into local languages and vice versa . 
What makes Tajbakhsh &apos;s incarceration look truly pathetic is that Iran boasts of one of the oldest civilizations in the world . 
Persians mingled easily with the Egyptians , Greeks , and Romans , conveying their skills , discoveries , and statecraft to the West . 
The image of the Persians portrayed in the recent movie 300 is simply false . 
Moreover , Muslim Iranians have always respected their pre-Islamic civilization . 
Thus , the Islamic revolutionaries in 1979 made a point of preserving the Zoroastrian fire temples . 
In its Muslim era , Iran has boasted of some of the greatest poets , writers , and scientists in the world . 
None of this would have been possible if Iran &apos;s ancient Muslim rulers had not allowed academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas and expression - something that is sorely missing in today &apos;s Islamic Republic . 
Other autocratic rulers in the Muslim world are learning from Iran &apos;s example , cracking down hard on intellectuals , journalists , lawyers , women activists , or just about anyone who has ideas and wants to exchange them with others . 
For such Muslim rulers , intellectuals are the new global terrorists , bombarding their regimes with intellectualism . 
And my friend Kian Tajbakhsh - alone in his cell in Evin Prison wondering what he has done wrong - is the face of this new form of repression .
