Two Cheers for the New Normal 
JAKARTA - The conventional wisdom about the state of the world economy goes something like this : Since the start of the 2007-2008 financial crisis , the developed world has struggled to recover , with only the United States able to adjust . 
Emerging countries have fared better , but they , too , have started to flounder lately . 
In a bleak economic climate , the argument goes , the only winners have been the wealthy , resulting in skyrocketing inequality . 
That scenario sounds entirely right - until , on closer examination , it turns out to be completely wrong . 
Start with economic growth . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , during the first decade of this century , annual global growth averaged 3.7 % , compared to 3.3 % in the 1980s and 1990s . 
In the last four years , growth has averaged 3.4 % . 
This is far lower than what many had hoped ; in 2010 , I predicted that in the coming decade , the world could grow at a 4.1 % annual rate . 
But 3.4 % is hardly disastrous by historical standards . 
To be sure , all of the large , developed economies are growing more slowly than they did when their economic engines were roaring . 
But it is only the eurozone that has badly disappointed in recent years . 
I had assumed , when I made my projections in 2010 , that the region &apos;s poor demographics and weak productivity would prevent it from growing at more than 1.5 % a year . 
Instead , it has managed only a meager 0.3 % . 
For Japan , the US , and the United Kingdom , the prospects are brighter . 
It should be relatively straightforward for them to grow at an average rate that outpaces that of the last decade - a period that includes the peak of the financial crisis . 
In addition , the dramatic drop in the price of crude oil will serve as the equivalent of a large tax cut for consumers . 
Indeed , I am rather baffled by the IMF &apos;s decision to downgrade its growth forecast for much of the world . 
If anything , with oil prices falling , an upward revision seems warranted . 
Another factor supporting a more positive outlook is the rebalancing that has occurred between the US and China , the world &apos;s two largest economies . 
Each entered the financial crisis with huge current-account imbalances . 
The US was running a deficit of more than 6.5 % of its GDP , and China had a surplus of close to 10 % of its GDP . 
Today , the US deficit has fallen to about 2 % , and the Chinese surplus is less than 3 % . 
Given that their intertwined imbalances were key drivers of the financial crisis , this is a welcome development . 
It has recently become fashionable to disparage the economic performance of the large emerging countries , particularly China and the other BRIC economies ( Brazil , Russia , and India ) . 
But it is hardly a surprise that these countries are no longer growing as fast as they once did . 
In 2010 , I predicted that China &apos;s annual growth would slow to 7.5 % . 
It has since averaged 8 % . 
India &apos;s performance has been more discouraging , though growth has picked up since early 2014 . 
The only real disappointments are Brazil and Russia , both of which have struggled ( again , not surprisingly ) with much lower commodity prices . 
Their lethargic performance , together with the eurozone &apos;s , is the main reason why the world economy has not managed the 4.1 % growth that optimists like me thought was feasible . 
The conventional wisdom on wealth and inequality is similarly mistaken . 
From 2000 to 2014 , global GDP more than doubled , from $ 31.8 trillion to over $ 75 trillion . 
Over the same period , China &apos;s nominal GDP soared from $ 1.2 trillion to more than $ 10 trillion - growing at more than four times the global rate . 
In 2000 , the BRIC economies &quot; combined size was about a quarter of US GDP . 
Today , they have nearly caught up , with a combined GDP of more than $ 16 trillion , just short of America &apos;s $ 17.4 trillion . 
Indeed , since 2000 , the BRICs have been responsible for nearly a third of the rise in nominal global GDP . 
And other emerging countries have performed similarly well . 
Nigeria &apos;s economy has grown 11-fold since 2000 , and Indonesia &apos;s has more than quintupled . 
Since 2008 , these two developing giants have contributed more to global GDP growth than the EU has . 
Statistics like these utterly disprove the idea that global inequality is growing . 
Gaps in income and wealth may be shooting up within individual countries , but per capita income in developing countries is rising much faster than in the advanced economies . 
Indeed , that is why one of the key targets of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals - to halve the number of people living in absolute poverty - was achieved five years ahead of the deadline . 
None of this is meant to deny that we are living in challenging and uncertain times . 
But one thing is clear : economically , at least , the world is continuing to become a better place .
