Our Virtual Middle Ages 
Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia , is the most impressive collective intellectual project ever attempted - and perhaps achieved . 
It demands both the attention and the contribution of anyone concerned with the future of knowledge . 
Because of the speed with which it has become a fixture in cyberspace , Wikipedia &quot; s true significance has gone largely unremarked . 
Since its sixth anniversary in 2007 , Wikipedia has consistently ranked in the top ten most frequently viewed Web sites worldwide . 
Everyday it is consulted by 7 % of all 1.2 billion Internet users , and its rate of usage is growing faster than that of Internet usage as a whole . 
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia to which anyone with a modicum of time , articulateness , and computer skills can contribute . 
Anyone can change any entry or add a new entry , and the results will immediately appear for all to see - and potentially contest . 
&quot; Wiki &quot; is a Hawaiian root that was officially added to English in 2007 to signify something done quickly - in this case , changes in the collective body of knowledge . 
Some 4.7 million &quot; Wikipedians &quot; have now contributed to 5.3 million entries , one-third of which are in English , with the rest in more than 250 other languages . 
Moreover , there is a relatively large group of hardcore contributors : roughly 75,000 Wikipedians have made at least five contributions in any given 30-day period . 
The quality of articles is uneven , as might be expected of a self-organizing process , but it is not uniformly bad . 
True , topics favored by sex-starved male geeks have been elaborated in disturbingly exquisite detail , while less alluring matters often lie fallow . 
Nevertheless , according to University of Chicago Law professor Cass Sunstein , Wikipedia is now cited four times more often than the Encyclopedia Britannica in US judicial decisions . 
Moreover , Nature &quot; s 2005 evaluation of the two encyclopedias in terms of comparably developed scientific articles found that Wikipedia averaged four errors to the Britannica &quot; s three . 
That difference probably has been narrowed since then . 
Wikipedia &apos;s boosters trumpet it as heralding the arrival of &quot; Web 2.0 . &quot; 
Whereas &quot; Web 1.0 &quot; facilitated the storage and transmission of vast amounts of different kinds of information in cyberspace , &quot; Web 2.0 &quot; supposedly renders the whole process interactive , removing the final frontier separating the transmitter and receiver of information . 
But we have been here before - in fact , for most of human history . 
The sharp divide between producers and consumers of knowledge began only about 300 years ago , when book printers secured royal protection for their trade in the face of piracy in a rapidly expanding literary market . 
The legacy of their success , copyright law , continues to impede attempts to render cyberspace a free marketplace of ideas . 
Before , there were fewer readers and writers , but they were the same people , and had relatively direct access to each other &apos;s work . 
Indeed , a much smaller , slower , and more fragmented version of the Wikipedia community came into existence with the rise of universities in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Europe . 
The large ornamental codices of the early Middle Ages gave way to portable &quot; handbooks &quot; designed for the lighter touch of a quill pen . 
However , the pages of these books continued to be made of animal hide , which could easily be written over . 
This often made it difficult to attribute authorship , because a text might consist of a copied lecture in which the copyist &apos;s comments were inserted and then perhaps altered as the book passed to other hands . 
Wikipedia has remedied many of those technical problems . 
Any change to an entry automatically generates a historical trace , so entries can be read as what medieval scholars call a &quot; palimpsest , &quot; a text that has been successively overwritten . 
Moreover , &quot; talk pages &quot; provide ample opportunity to discuss actual and possible changes . 
While Wikipedians do not need to pass around copies of their text - everyone owns a virtual copy - Wikipedia &quot; s content policy remains deeply medieval in spirit . 
That policy consists of three rules : 1 ) no original research ; 2 ) a neutral point of view ; and 3 ) verifiability . 
These rules are designed for people with reference material at their disposal but no authority to evaluate it . 
Such was the epistemic position of the Middle Ages , which presumed all humans to be mutually equal but subordinate to an inscrutable God . 
The most one could hope for , then , was a perfectly balanced dialectic . 
In the Middle Ages , this attitude spawned scholastic disputation . 
In cyberspace , the same practice , often dismissed as &quot; trolling , &quot; remains the backbone of Wikipedia &quot; s quality control . 
Wikipedia embodies a democratic medievalism that does not respect claims to personal expertise in the absence of verifiable sources . 
To fully realize this ideal , participation in Wikipedia might be made compulsory for advanced undergraduates and Master &apos;s degree candidates worldwide . 
The expected norms of conduct of these students correspond exactly to Wikipedia &quot; s content policy : one is not expected to do original research , but to know where the research material is and how to argue about it . 
Compulsory student participation would not only improve Wikipedia &quot; s already impressive collective knowledge base , but also might help curb the elitist pretensions of researchers in the global knowledge system .
