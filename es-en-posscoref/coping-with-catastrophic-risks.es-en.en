Coping with Catastrophic Risks 
One year after the Indian Ocean tsunami , what are the lessons ? 
The biggest one is that it was the type of disaster to which policymakers pay too little attention - one that has a very low or unknown probability of occurring , but that creates enormous losses if it does occur . 
Great as the death toll , physical and emotional suffering of survivors , and property damage caused by the tsunami were , even greater losses could be inflicted by other disasters of low ( but not negligible ) , or unknown , probability . 
For example , the asteroid that exploded above Siberia in 1908 with the force of a hydrogen bomb might have killed millions of people had it exploded above a major city . 
Yet that asteroid was only about 200 feet in diameter . 
Other catastrophic risks include natural epidemics ( the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza killed between 20 million and 40 million people ) , nuclear or biological attacks by terrorists , certain types of lab accidents , and abrupt global warming . 
The probability of catastrophes , whether intentional or not , resulting from human activity appears to be increasing because of the rapidity and direction of technological advances . 
The fact that a catastrophe is unlikely to occur is not a rational justification for ignoring the risk of its occurrence . 
Suppose that a tsunami as destructive as the one in the Indian Ocean last year occurs on average once a century and kills 250,000 people . 
That is an average of 2,500 deaths per year . 
If such a toll could be substantially reduced at moderate cost , the investment would be worthwhile . 
Educating residents of low-lying coastal areas about the warning signs of a tsunami ( tremors and a sudden recession in the ocean ) , establishing a warning system involving emergency broadcasts , telephoned warnings , and air-raid-type sirens , and improving emergency response systems would have saved many who were killed by the Indian Ocean tsunami . 
At the same time , the cost would have been well below any reasonable estimate of the average losses that can be expected from tsunamis . 
There are several reasons why such measures weren &apos;t taken in anticipation of a tsunami on the scale that occurred . 
First , although a once-in-a-century event is as likely to occur at the beginning of the century as at any other time , it is much less likely to occur in the first decade of the century than later . 
Politicians with limited terms of office and thus foreshortened political horizons are likely to discount low-risk disaster possibilities , since the risk of damage to their careers from failing to take precautionary measures is truncated . 
Second , to the extent that effective precautions require governmental action , the fact that government is a centralized system of control makes it difficult for officials to respond to the full spectrum of possible risks against which cost-justified measures might be taken . 
Given the variety of matters to which they must attend , officials are likely to have a high threshold of attention below which risks are ignored . 
Third , where risks are regional or global rather than local , many national governments , especially in poorer and smaller countries , may drag their heels in the hope that larger and richer countries will bear the costs of addressing them . 
Knowing this , larger and richer countries may be reluctant to take precautionary measures , as this would reward and thus encourage &quot; free riding . &quot; 
Fourth , countries are poor often because of weak , inefficient , or corrupt government , characteristics that may disable them from taking cost-justified precautions . 
And the difficulty people everywhere have in thinking in terms of probabilities - especially low probabilities , which they tend to write off - weakens political support for incurring the costs of taking precautionary measures . 
An even more dramatic example of neglect of low-probability / high-cost risks is the danger of an asteroid strike , which is analytically similar to the menace of tsunamis . 
Indeed , in part because tsunamis are one of the risks of an asteroid collision , the Indian Ocean disaster has stimulated new interest in asteroid defense . 
Deflecting an asteroid from its orbit when it is still hundreds of millions of miles from Earth is a feasible undertaking . 
Nevertheless , in the United States , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) spends only $ 4 million of its annual budget of more than $ 10 billion on mapping dangerously close large asteroids . 
At the current rate , NASA may not complete the task for another decade , even though such mapping is the key to an asteroid defense because it may give us years of warning . 
The fact that a disaster of a particular type has not occurred recently or even within human memory ( or even ever ) is a bad reason to ignore it . 
The risk may be slight , but if the consequences should it materialize are great enough , the expected cost of disaster may be sufficient to warrant defensive measures .
