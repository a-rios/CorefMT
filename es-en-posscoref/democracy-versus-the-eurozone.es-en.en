Democracy versus the Eurozone 
BRUSSELS - The European Union is a voluntary quasi-federation of sovereign and democratic states in which elections matter and each country seeks to determine its own destiny , regardless of the wishes of its partners . 
But it should now be apparent to everyone that the eurozone was designed with a very different institutional arrangement in mind . 
Indeed , that design gap has turned out to be a major source of the monetary union &apos;s current crisis . 
Last October , Greece &apos;s then-prime minister , George Papandreou , proposed a popular referendum on the second rescue package that had just been agreed at the EU &apos;s summit in Brussels . 
He was quickly told off by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy , and Greeks never voted on it . 
But , less than a year later , the referendum is de facto taking place anyway . 
In a union of democracies , it is impossible to force sovereign countries to adhere to rules if their citizens do not accept them anymore . 
This has profound implications : all of those grandiose plans to create a political union to support the euro with a common fiscal policy cannot work as long as EU member countries remain both democratic and sovereign . 
Governments may sign treaties and make solemn commitments to subordinate their fiscal policy to EU rules ( or to be more precise , to the wishes of Germany and the European Central Bank ) . 
But , in the end , the &quot; people &quot; remain the real sovereign , and they can choose to ignore their governments &quot; promises and reject any adjustment program from &quot; Brussels . &quot; 
In contrast to the United States , the EU cannot send its marshals to enforce its pacts or collect debt . 
Any country can leave the EU , and thus the eurozone , when the perceived burden of its obligations becomes too onerous . 
Until now , it had been assumed that the cost of exit would be so high that it would never be considered . 
That is no longer true , at least for Greece . 
But , more broadly , EU commitments have now become relative , which implies that jointly guaranteed Eurobonds cannot be the silver bullet that some hope . 
As long as member states remain fully sovereign , no one can fully reassure investors that in the event of a eurozone breakup , some states will not simply refuse to pay , or at least refuse to pay for the others . 
It is not surprising that bonds issued by the European Financial Stability Facility ( the eurozone &apos;s rescue fund ) are trading at a substantial premium over German debt . 
All variants of Eurobonds come with supposedly strong conditionality . 
Countries that want to use them must follow strict fiscal rules . 
But who guarantees that these rules will actually be followed ? 
Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s victory over Sarkozy in France &apos;s presidential election shows that an apparent consensus on the need for austerity can crumble quickly . 
What recourse do creditor countries have if the debtor countries become the majority and decide to increase spending ? 
The recently agreed measures to strengthen economic-policy coordination in the eurozone ( the so-called &quot; six pack &quot; ) imply in principle that the European Commission should be the arbiter in such matters , and that its adjustment programs can formally be overturned only by a two-thirds majority of the member states . 
But it is unlikely that the Commission will ever be able to impose its view on a large country . 
Spain &apos;s experience is instructive in this respect . 
After the recent elections there , Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy &apos;s new government announced that it did not feel bound by the adjustment program agreed to by the previous administration . 
Rajoy was roundly rebuked for the form of his announcement , but its substance was proven right : Spain &apos;s adjustment program is now being made more lenient . 
The reality is that the larger member states are more equal than the others . 
Of course , this is not fair , but the EU &apos;s inability to impose its view on democratic countries might actually sometimes be for the best , given that even the Commission is fallible . 
The broader message from the Greek and French elections is that the attempt to impose a benevolent creditors &quot; dictatorship is now being met by a debtors &quot; revolt . 
Financial markets have reacted as strongly as they have because investors recognize that the &quot; sovereign &quot; in sovereign debt is an electorate that can simply decide not to pay . 
This is already the case in Greece , but the fate of the euro will be decided in the larger , systemically important countries like Italy and Spain . 
Only determined action by their governments , supported by their citizens , will show that they merit unreserved support from the rest of the eurozone . 
At this point , nothing less can save the common currency .
