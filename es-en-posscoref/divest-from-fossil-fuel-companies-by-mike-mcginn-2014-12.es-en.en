Divest in a Better Future 
SEATTLE - Sometimes the best measure of a movement &apos;s momentum is the reaction of its critics . 
When , in early October , the Australian National University ( ANU ) announced that it would sell its shares in seven fossil-fuel and mining companies , it triggered a chorus of criticism from the country &apos;s conservative politicians . 
These nominal champions of the free market were quick to tell the university what it should do with its money . The Treasurer of Australia , Joe Hockey , disparaged the ANU &apos;s decision as being &quot; removed from reality . &quot; 
Others chimed in , calling it &quot; a disgrace , &quot; &quot; very strange , &quot; and &quot; narrow-minded and irresponsible . &quot; 
Never mind that the sums involved were relatively small - making up less than 2 % of the university &apos;s estimated $ 1 billion portfolio . 
As the drive to divest from fossil fuels picks up speed , such panicky responses are becoming increasingly common . 
The outrage of Australia &apos;s conservatives reminds me of the reaction I received when I testified before the US Congress in 2013 that we should &quot; keep our coal in the ground where it belongs . &quot; 
David McKinley , a Republican congressman from West Virginia , in the heart of America &apos;s coal country , replied that my words &quot; sent a shiver up &#91; his &#93; spine , &quot; then changed the subject to the crime rate in Seattle , where I was Mayor . 
Even ExxonMobil appears shaken . 
The company recently published a long , defensive blog post responding to what it described as a &quot; full-throated endorsement &quot; of fossil-fuel divestment by Mary Robinson , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon &apos;s special envoy for climate change . 
The fossil-fuel industry clearly sees the divestment movement as the political threat that it is . 
When enough people say no to investing in fossil-fuel production , the next step has to be keeping coal , oil , and gas in the ground . 
That is a necessary step if we are to head off the most dangerous consequences of climate change . 
To prevent world temperatures from rising above the 2ยบ Celsius threshold that climate scientists believe represents a tipping point beyond which the worst effects could no longer be mitigated , we will need to leave approximately 80 % of known fossil-fuel reserves untapped . 
Oil and coal companies and their political allies warn us of fiscal catastrophe if we do that - as if heat waves , droughts , storms , and rising seas did not bring their own fiscal and social catastrophes . 
As Mayor of Seattle , I supported the creation of energy-efficient buildings , the development of solar , wind , and hydroelectric power , and a shift toward walking , biking , and public transit as alternatives to driving - strategies that can help to build a more resilient economy and provide viable alternatives to fossil fuels . 
But they cannot prevent the worst of global warming , particularly if they result in coal and oil simply being sold elsewhere . 
As imperfect as our governance systems are , at some point the public and its leaders may demand that we confront the truth about global warming . 
If you are a prudent and cautious investor , contemplate that possibility for a moment . 
Stock values in the fossil-fuel industry - which are based on the assumption that companies will be able to extract and burn all known reserves - will plummet . 
Investing in these companies , it turns out , is extraordinarily risky . 
As anyone who receives investment statements knows , &quot; past performance is no guarantee of future performance . &quot; 
That reality implies another compelling case for divestment . 
To be sure , some will claim that the world will never change and that we will continue to depend on fossil fuels forever . 
But one has only to look to Seattle , where gay couples marry in City Hall and marijuana is sold in licensed retail outlets , to see the human capacity to reexamine deeply held assumptions . 
The prudent investor , and the wise business leader , will look where the economy is headed , not where it has been . 
The ANU &apos;s decision looks like a sage one to anyone not in thrall to oil and gas companies , and it will only look wiser with the passing of time . 
Good on them . 
When I put Seattle on the path to divestment in 2013 , my decision was well received by the young people who will have to live with the consequences of global warming , as well as the general public . 
As the political pressure mounts , the university &apos;s administrators need only listen to the students . 
We need more courage like that shown by the ANU . 
Its leaders bucked the power of coal and oil interests , which wield enormous power in Australia . 
If they can do it to popular acclaim , others can , too .
