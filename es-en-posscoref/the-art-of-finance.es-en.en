The Art of Finance 
PRINCETON - In the middle of September &apos;s financial meltdown , a remarkable event occurred in London . 
While the City of London was shaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the run on HBOS , Sotheby &apos;s staged a record-breaking auction for the works of the artist Damien Hirst , which produced a gross take of around $ 200 million . 
Compared to the values that were being destroyed on Wall Street , this was small change ; but it was a remarkable vote of confidence in the work of one artist . 
Financial bubbles , like the one that has just definitively burst , are intimately related to the world of art . 
Renaissance Florence depended on the patronage of the Medici . 
Sixteenth-century Venice turned the wealth of the spice trade into the canvases of Titian and Tintoretto . 
The world &apos;s next great commercial center was Amsterdam , where again the successful burghers pushed for a new style of art and produced the age of Rembrandt . 
The great nineteenth- and early twentieth-century financiers , men like J.P. Morgan , Henry Frick , and Andrew Mellon , spent a large part of their fortunes on art . 
From their viewpoint , collecting art was not simply a matter of benevolence or public spiritedness . 
Nor was it simply a very expensive hobby . 
Their galleries showed in a visible and very public way the discernment and judgment that their financial business depended on . 
Financial judgment , by contrast , is not by its nature open to inspection . 
It depends on inside deals , on moving ahead of the market . 
It is impossible to tell who is making good bets and who is gambling recklessly . 
Consequently , it is helpful to have a proxy activity that enables outsiders to see that the process of discernment and valuation really occurs . 
The recent era of global finance - maybe we can already possibly speak of it as being past - differed from the financial surge of a century ago . 
Its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel . 
To some of its participants , collecting contemporary art showed how finance had become much more of a creative process than it was the world of the older financiers . 
Morgan or Mellon collected largely old masters from the cinquecento , whose reputation was clearly and solidly established . 
The new art collectors , however , were more like the Medici : they were really stimulating new cultural creation . 
As with their investments , the habitués of contemporary art markets relied not purely on their own judgment , but on teams of sophisticated advisers and dealers who could give opinions on what trends best caught the spirit of the age . 
Naïve outsiders found the world of contemporary art bewildering . 
Why was a cow preserved in formaldehyde a great cultural achievement ? 
What did the sheets of cloth covered by regularly interspersed colored dots - the products of Hirst &apos;s large and mechanized workshops - have to do with artistic innovation or originality ? 
But was not the same incomprehension on the part of the broad public characteristic of the increasingly sophisticated financial products that were being traded ? 
Indeed , the nature of the risks involved was not clear , it seems , even to regulators or the senior management of the firms that were building the business . 
Some modern artists and their patrons explicitly point to the parallel between contemporary art and new financial products . 
Deutsche Bank , Europe &apos;s most prominent art-collecting bank , published the view of academic experts to the effect that customers , the broad public , were &quot; extremely conservative , boring , lack imagination , and don &apos;t know their own minds . &quot; 
After financial implosions , such as the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000 or the sub-prime meltdown of 2007-8 , such views appear arrogant . 
The parallel between bewildering and apparently meaningless art and unintelligible financial products is damning rather than reassuring . 
So why was the Hirst auction such a success ? 
In part , because the art involved was far from being unintelligible . 
The most eagerly anticipated item , a bull with golden horns and hooves , was entitled , with obvious intent , &quot; The Golden Calf . &quot; 
But there was also another motive driving the bidders . 
One hint was that Russian buyers paid the big money , at the very moment that Russia &apos;s banking system was melting down . 
At the same time , there was a surge in demand for gold jewelry . 
The search for non-financial assets looks like characteristic behavior in any financial crisis - what was known during the great drama of hyperinflation in Weimar Germany as &quot; die Flucht in die Sachwerte , &quot; the flight to material assets . 
Art also functions as a store of value . 
But in order to be sure of the reliability of this function , the purchaser must be convinced of the long-term valuation of the object of desire . 
The bankers of the Italian Renaissance also bought works of art because they reminded them of timeless values that transcended quotidian transactions . 
They saw their acquisitions of paintings and sculptures as a connection to eternity . 
Who can say the same for the products of Damien Hirst ?
