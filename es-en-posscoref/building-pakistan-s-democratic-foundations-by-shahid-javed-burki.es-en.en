Resilient Pakistan ? 
ISLAMABAD - Since mid-December , Pakistan has experienced political and economic volatility that is extraordinary even by Pakistani standards . 
The fragile political structure that began to be erected following the resumption of civilian government in 2008 is now shaking . 
A key source of this unrest is Tahirul Qadri , a Toronto-based Muslim cleric who arrived in Lahore in early December . 
Ten days later , he addressed a mammoth public meeting at the city &apos;s Minar-e-Pakistan grounds , where , a year earlier , the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan had launched what he not very appropriately termed a political tsunami . 
Qadri issued a 20-day ultimatum to the government in Islamabad to purge the political system of rampant corruption , reconstitute the Election Commission , and appoint a caretaker administration to oversee the upcoming vote . 
The caretakers , he said , should include technocrats , retired military officers , and judges - and could remain in office longer than the constitutionally permitted 90 days . 
Unless the government took these steps , he would lead a million-man march on the capital . 
When the government did not oblige , 50,000 people set out on the fabled Grand Trunk Road to Islamabad , taking 36 hours to complete the 300-kilometer trek . 
Qadri addressed the marchers repeatedly ; liberally mixing political metaphors , he called himself a latter-day Mao Zedong on a journey to launch a system-cleansing jihad and initiate a Pakistani version of the Arab Spring . 
On January 10 , while Qadri was planning his march , two suicide bombers sent by the extremist Lashkar-e-Jhangvi , a banned Sunni group , attacked the Shia Hazara community in Quetta , killing almost a hundred people . 
The Hazaras reacted to the attack by making the coffins of the dead a symbol of protest . 
They lined up the dead on Alamdaar Street , which runs through the city &apos;s Shia community , and refused to bury them until the government dismissed inept and corrupt local officials , led by a local nawab who spent more time abroad or in Islamabad than in the provincial capital . 
The government succumbed and removed the chief minister and his cabinet , placing the troubled province under the care of the provincial governor . 
Five days later , Pakistan &apos;s ever-active Supreme Court ordered the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and 16 other senior government officials for alleged involvement in what was called the &quot; rental power &quot; case . 
The case dates back to 2008-2011 , when Ashraf , who was Minister of Water and Power at the time , oversaw large contracts to rent power generators , which were needed to ease an electricity shortage that was costing the economy up to 5 % of GDP . 
Several reports in the print and electronic media suggested that the contracts awarded by Ashraf &apos;s ministry were tainted . 
The finance ministry called in the Asian Development Bank , which confirmed that a large amount of money had leaked from the agreements , and that many of the rental units generated much less power than promised . 
The Supreme Court took note of the ADB &apos;s findings and started proceedings against Ashraf and other senior officials , including several from the finance ministry . 
Ashraf resigned from the cabinet , only to be brought back later as Prime Minister . 
In earlier times , crises of much lesser intensity would have brought the military rushing onto the political stage , as happened in 1958 , 1969 , 1977 , and 1999 . 
Indeed , the army has ruled Pakistan for a total of 33 years since independence in 1947 . 
But this time the soldiers have remained in their barracks , for the simple reason that an awakened populace , an active civil society , and a free and vibrant media would not tolerate another venture into politics by the army . 
After almost five years of democratic rule , Pakistan is on its way to establishing a durable and representative political order . 
While it has not produced clean and efficient government , there seems to be considerable comfort in the popular belief that , by working together , Pakistanis will find a way out of the mess in which the country finds itself . 
A late-evening meeting of most opposition parties in Lahore on January 16 rejected Qadri &apos;s demands , while telling the government to stay the course toward the general election . 
A day later , the government found a face-saving formula to send the preacher-politician - and , more important , his followers - home , promising that the Election Commission will be given the time to determine candidates &quot; eligibility under the relevant constitutional provisions . 
So , in a way , Qadri &apos;s arrival in Pakistan and his intense political activism have served a purpose : he has reinforced the people &apos;s faith in a system that they are continuing to build .
