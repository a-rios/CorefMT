Armageddon Can Wait 
CAMBRIDGE - Where are global currencies headed in 2011 ? 
After three years of huge , crisis-driven exchange-rate swings , it is useful to take stock both of currency values and of the exchange-rate system as a whole . 
And my best guess is that we will see a mix of currency wars , currency collapses , and currency chaos in the year ahead - but that this won &apos;t spell the end of the economic recovery , much less the end of the world . 
Let &apos;s start by acknowledging that the modern system of floating exchange rates has , on the whole , acquitted itself remarkably well . 
True , given complex risk factors and idiosyncratic policy preferences , it has been particularly challenging of late to divine the logic underlying big exchange-rate swings . 
For example , even though the United States was at the heart of the financial crisis , the dollar initially soared . 
But , even if exchange rates work in mysterious ways , their cushioning effect is undeniable . 
The sharp depreciation of the euro after the crisis helped sustain German exports , thereby keeping the eurozone afloat . 
Emerging markets &quot; currencies also collapsed , even in economies with huge foreign-exchange reserves and relatively little debt . 
Since then , most emerging-market currencies have rebounded sharply . 
In hindsight , these exchange-rate swings mirrored the initial collapse and subsequent rebound in global trade , helping to mitigate the recession . 
By contrast , the financial crisis was hardly an advertisement for expanding the scope of fixed exchange rates . 
The eurozone &apos;s peripheral countries , including Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Spain , found themselves pinned to the mast of the common currency , unable to gain competitiveness through exchange-rate depreciation . 
The intellectual father of the euro , Columbia University &apos;s Robert Mundell , once famously opined that the optimal number of currencies in the world is an odd number , preferably less than three . 
It is hard to see why right now . 
Perhaps when we have one world government , it will make sense to have one world currency . But , even setting aside the equilibrating benefits of flexible currencies , the prospect of a single , omnipotent central bank is not particularly appealing . 
Witness the vitriol and hysteria that accompanied the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of so-called &quot; quantitative easing . &quot; 
Imagine the panic that would have ensued in a world where gold , storable commodities , and art were the only ways for investors to flee from the dollar . 
But the continuing success of the floating exchange-rate system does not imply a smooth ride in 2011 . 
For starters , we can certainly expect a continuation of the so-called currency wars , in which countries strive to keep their exchange rates from appreciating too rapidly and choking off exports . 
Asian governments will probably gradually &quot; lose &quot; their battle in this war in 2011 , allowing their currencies to appreciate in the face of inflationary pressures and threats of trade retaliation . 
As for currency collapse , the most prominent candidate has to be the euro . 
In an ideal world , Europe would deal with its excessive debt burdens through a restructuring of Greek , Irish , and Portuguese liabilities , as well as municipal and bank debt in Spain . 
At the same time , these countries would regain export competiveness through massive wage reductions . 
For now , however , European policymakers seem to prefer to keep escalating the size of bridge loans to the periphery , not wanting to acknowledge that private markets will ultimately require a more durable and sustainable solution . 
No risk factor is more dangerous for a currency than policymakers &quot; refusal to face fiscal realities ; until European officials do , the euro remains vulnerable . 
The dollar , on the other hand , looks like a safer bet in 2011 . 
For one thing , its purchasing power is already scraping along at a fairly low level globally - indeed , near an all-time low , according to the Fed &apos;s broad dollar exchange-rate index . 
Thus , normal re-equilibration to &quot; purchasing power parity &quot; should give the dollar slight upward momentum . 
Of course , some believe that the Fed &apos;s mass purchases of US debt poses an even bigger risk than Europe &apos;s sovereign debt crisis . 
Perhaps , but most students of monetary policy view quantitative easing as the textbook policy for pulling an economy out of a zero-interest-rate &quot; liquidity trap , &quot; thereby preventing the onset of a sustained deflation , which would exacerbate debt burdens . 
As for China &apos;s renminbi , it is still supported by a highly political exchange-rate regime . 
Eventually , China &apos;s rapid growth will have to be reflected in a significant rise in its currency , its domestic price level , or in both . 
But , in 2011 , most of the equilibration will likely take place through inflation . 
Finally , currency chaos is the safest bet of all , with sharp and unpredictable swings in floating exchange rates around the world . 
During the mid-2000 &quot; s , there was a brief window when some argued that currencies had become more stable as a corollary of the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; in macroeconomic activity . 
Nobody is saying that now . 
The floating exchange-rate system works surprisingly well , but currency volatility and unpredictability look likely to remain an enduring constant in 2011 and beyond .
