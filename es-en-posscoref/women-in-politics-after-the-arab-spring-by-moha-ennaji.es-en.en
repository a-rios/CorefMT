Arab Women &apos;s Unfinished Revolution 
FEZ - Though women across the Middle East participated actively in the Arab Spring protests that began in late 2010 , they remain second-class citizens , even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes . 
Indeed , the Islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics . 
In conducting interviews with women in the region , I am struck by their overall pessimism . 
They fear the loss of their rights . 
They see economic disintegration all around them , raising the possibility of a further increase in violence . 
As social bonds fray , they feel increasingly vulnerable . 
More than once , I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions . 
Female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the Arab Spring has been either absent or meager , and women activists worry that Islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender . 
In Egypt , for example , the Freedom and Justice Party , which dominates the parliament , claims that a woman cannot become President . 
Egyptian women were heavily represented in the protests that brought down former President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime in 2011 , but they have been largely excluded from any official decision-making role ever since . 
In Morocco , while there were eightwomen in the previous cabinet , today there is only one in the Islamist-led government . 
In January , the Islamist-dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16 , a major setback . 
Moroccan feminists have protested vigorously , but to no avail . 
Parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit . 
Women hold less than 1 % of seats in the current Egyptian parliament ; previously , they held 12 % . 
In Libya , a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10 % of seats in the constituent assembly for women , but the quota was later abandoned . 
In Tunisia , the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly . 
But 42 of these women are members of Ennahda , which regards Sharia ( Islamic law ) as the source of legislation . 
Long-time Tunisian activists fear that Ennahda , which dominates the assembly , will use the presence of women MPs to restrict women &apos;s rights . 
The recent assassination of the secular Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid has raised the stakes for women there . 
Belaid was a voice on behalf of women &apos;s rights , and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all Tunisians , including women . 
Unfortunately , conservative forces in the Arab world repeatedly turn against women when political unrest spreads . 
In Bahrain , several women protesters have been arrested and tortured . 
In Yemen , the authorities call on male relatives to &quot; tame &quot; their women . 
In Tunisia , the most Westernized of the Arab countries , women have been attacked at universities and schools , and are being forced to wear the hijab . 
A woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in September 2012 was charged with public indecency when she filed a complaint . 
Likewise , in Egypt , women protesters face greater scrutiny than men . 
Those arrested by the military during the anti-Mubarak protests were subjected to virginity tests as a form of intimidation . 
Across the Middle East , Islamist militias have harassed , arrested , raped , and tortured women pro-democracy activists . 
The model of Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution in 1979 , which imposed second-class citizenship on women , is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties . 
These countries are at a crossroads . 
Women make up half of the Middle East &apos;s population , and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact . 
Organizations like the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women . 
Simply put , the Arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life . 
In her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2011 , Yemeni political activist Tawakkol Karman , made the point clearly : &quot; The solution to women &apos;s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated , the energy of both women and men together . &quot; 
Middle Eastern countries should protect and consolidate women &apos;s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits . 
They must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence . 
The hope for women &apos;s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible .
