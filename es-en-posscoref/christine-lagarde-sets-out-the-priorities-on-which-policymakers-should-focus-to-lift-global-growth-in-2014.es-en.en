Re-Empowering the Global Economy 
WASHINGTON , DC - The global economy in 2013 remained suspended between the poles of hope and uncertainty . 
While recovery gained momentum , particularly in some advanced economies , the world economy is not yet flying on all engines - and is likely to remain underpowered next year as well . 
The International Monetary Fund &apos;s latest forecast puts global GDP growth at 3.6 % in 2014 , which is decent , but still below potential growth of around 4 % . 
In other words , the world could still generate considerably more jobs without fueling inflationary pressure . 
This means that the IMF &apos;s members - whether advanced , emerging-market , or developing economies - have more work to do . 
A strong and lasting recovery that lifts all countries and all peoples requires policymakers to press ahead on all fronts - fiscal , structural , and financial . 
At the same time , the international community must reinvigorate its efforts to strengthen cooperation through the G-20 , the IMF , and other actors . 
Indeed , only through such collaboration can we overcome the lingering impact of the global crisis . 
We have certainly avoided the worst-case scenario ( Great Depression II ) over the past five years , thanks to the efforts of global policymakers - particularly the determination of central banks to keep global interest rates low and to support the financial system , coupled with fiscal stimulus in some countries . 
But the time has come to push further , including by using the room created by unconventional monetary policies to implement structural reforms that can jump-start growth and create jobs . 
What happens in advanced economies is central to global prospects ; and , despite their stronger performance recently , the risks of stagnation and deflation continue to loom large . 
Central banks should return to more conventional monetary policies only when robust growth is firmly rooted . 
The United States has long been the main engine driving the global economy , and private demand there has regained vigor . 
But key challenges lie ahead . 
For example , it is vitally important that policymakers follow through on the recent budget agreement and end the political wrangling over the country &apos;s fiscal future . 
Greater certainty about the direction of policy could restore growth to a level that would lift the entire global economy . 
In Japan , recovery has been spurred by the mix of aggressive monetary and fiscal policies known as &quot; Abenomics . &quot; 
This is an important development . 
The challenge now is to agree on medium-term fiscal adjustments and implement the structural reforms - including deregulation of product and service markets and measures to boost the share of women in the workplace - that are needed to give growth a firm foundation and finally banish the specter of deflation . 
Europe is also at a key juncture . 
The eurozone is finally showing signs of recovery , but growth is uneven and unbalanced . 
While many countries are doing well , demand in general remains weak , and unemployment in the periphery remains obstinately high , particularly for young people . 
One area of uncertainty for Europe is the health of its banks . 
The forthcoming stress tests and asset-quality review can help restore confidence and advance financial integration , but only if they are conducted well . 
Europe also needs to boost demand , strengthen its financial and fiscal architecture , and put in place structural reforms to ensure sustained growth and job creation . 
Over the past half-decade , the emerging markets have been in the vanguard of economic recovery : together with developing countries , they have accounted for three-quarters of global GDP growth . 
But these economies &quot; momentum slowed in 2013 , as uncertainty about the timing of monetary-policy normalization in the US coincided with doubts about the sustainability of their growth path . 
While the worst fears have faded , the emerging economies face new policy challenges . 
In responding to slower demand , policymakers must be wary of financial excess , especially in the form of asset bubbles or rising debt . 
They should also focus on strengthening financial regulation , in order to manage credit cycles and capital flows more effectively , and on reestablishing fiscal room for maneuver . 
Low-income countries have been a bright spot for the global economy over the last five years as well . 
They proved resilient in the face of crisis , and many - especially in Africa , where annual output rose by about 5 % in 2013 - are enjoying strong growth . 
Now is the time to build on these gains , primarily by strengthening these countries &quot; capacity to raise revenues . 
With demand from emerging markets weakening , low-income countries should bolster their defenses against a serious downturn , even as they continue to focus their spending on key social programs and infrastructure projects . 
Middle Eastern countries in transition face additional challenges in the form of social instability and political uncertainty . 
These problems should be addressed by laying the groundwork for dynamic , transparent economies , promoting more inclusive growth , and ensuring continued support from the international community . 
While challenges vary by country and region , many common problems must be addressed in the years ahead . 
Too many countries face a legacy of high public and private debt , fiscal and current-account imbalances , and growth models that are unable to generate enough jobs . 
The international community also needs to complete the regulatory reforms required to create a safer financial system that better supports the needs of the real economy . 
These are not abstract challenges . 
Only by addressing them can we ensure future prosperity at a time when billions of people have rising aspirations - to find jobs , to rise out of poverty , and to one day join the global middle class . 
In 2014 , we need to take the steps that would help make this dream a reality . 
The IMF is committed to working with its 188 member countries to define and implement the policy measures that can power the engines of growth - and lift all people to renewed prosperity .
