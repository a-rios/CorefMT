Iran &apos;s Last Chance ? 
MADRID - The latest round of negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program between Iran and the so-called &quot; 5 + 1 &quot; group ( the United Nations Security Council &apos;s five permanent members - the United States , the United Kingdom , Russia , France , and China - plus Germany ) has now begun . 
Following more than a year of deadlock , after negotiations in January 2011 led nowhere , this dialogue is for many the last chance to find a peaceful solution to a nearly decade-long conflict ( in which I participated closely from 2006 to 2009 as the West &apos;s main negotiator with Iran ) . 
The objective of the talks , chaired by the European Union &apos;s foreign-policy chief , Catherine Ashton , and Iran &apos;s chief negotiator , Saeed Jalili , is still to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment and to comply with Security Council resolutions and its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
First , domestic economic and political conditions in Iran have changed markedly since the last round of talks . 
International pressure has mounted since the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed last November that the country &apos;s nuclear program was advancing towards the production of nuclear arms , rather than electricity or medical isotopes , with new sanctions imposed on Iranian oil exports and on transactions with the Central Bank of Iran . 
Although rising global energy prices have given Iran some respite in recent months , the sanctions have made themselves felt more than ever among Iranian consumers . 
The rial has lost 40 % of its value since October ( making imports less affordable ) , and financial transactions have become much more expensive and difficult for the government , businesses , and households alike . 
Moreover , Iran &apos;s leadership is fragmented and weak . 
Relations between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei continue to deteriorate , while tensions are growing within the Revolutionary Guard . 
It remains to be seen what impact these political developments will have on the negotiations . 
Second , Iran &apos;s regional standing has been shaken by the wave of Arab revolts , especially in Syria - a decisive country , given its strategic relations with both Iran and Russia . 
Indeed , Syria is Iran &apos;s main ally in the Middle East , as well as being the only country outside of the former Soviet Union in which Russia has a military base . 
Russia &apos;s need to reconcile its role in these negotiations with its interests in Syria makes an already-complicated dialogue more difficult . 
The strategy with respect to the Gulf &apos;s Sunni monarchies has also changed . 
Today , these countries are more at odds with both Iran and Syria than they have been for decades . 
Led by Qatar and Saudi Arabia , they have openly admitted the possibility of arming Syrian rebels in order to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad . 
Moreover , Saudi Arabia &apos;s oil reserves enable it to give crucial support to oil-export sanctions on Iran by offsetting the loss of global supply . 
China , with its growing energy dependency on the Gulf states , will have to weigh that factor carefully at the negotiating table . 
Along with Russia , China has backed Syria in the Security Council , and it was recently revealed that Iran helped Syria to defy international sanctions by providing a ship to transport oil from Syria to a state-owned company in China . 
Third , Israel , already unhappy with the outcome of the previous round of negotiations , is becoming increasingly uneasy . 
With Iran &apos;s nuclear program advancing and political uncertainty looming over the region , Israel supports a military operation against Iran in 2012 , before , in the words of Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak , it crosses the &quot; immunity zone , &quot; beyond which intervention would be futile . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , speaking last month to the membership of AIPAC , the largest pro-Israel lobby in the US , emphasized the urgency of the situation . 
Finally , US President Barack Obama knows that his reelection depends on avoiding mistakes in this matter . 
But how can a lengthy negotiation be carried out without seeming to benefit the party , which wants to gain more time ? 
Political optics - that is , the management of public perceptions - will be a very important part of this negotiation . 
For now , America is keeping a channel open for direct dialogue with Iran ( as US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned Barak months ago ) . 
On the first day of the talks in Istanbul , Jalili accepted a US request for a bilateral meeting within the context of the negotiations , and all participants deemed the results so far to be a step in the right direction . 
If we want to ensure that Iran never has a nuclear weapon , the only guarantee is to change its desire to possess one . 
And the best way to do that is still by negotiating , rather than by using force . 
No one has calculated the consequences of a war . 
Everyone has good reason to sit down and talk .
