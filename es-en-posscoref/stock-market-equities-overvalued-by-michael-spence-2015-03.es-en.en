Are Equities Overvalued ? 
MILAN - Since the global economic crisis , sharp divergences in economic performance have contributed to considerable stock-market volatility . 
Now , equity prices are reaching relatively high levels by conventional measures - and investors are starting to get nervous . 
The question is whether stock valuations are excessive relative to future earnings potential . 
The answer depends on two key variables : the discount rate and future earnings growth . 
A lower discount rate and / or a higher rate of expected earnings growth would justify higher equity valuations . 
The S P &apos;s price-to-earnings ( P / E ) ratio for the trailing 12 months is close to 20 , compared to a long-run mean of 15.53 and a median of 14.57 . 
The Shiller P / E ratio - based on average real ( inflation-adjusted ) earnings from the last ten years - is at 27.08 , with a mean and median of 16.59 and 15.96 , respectively . 
And , in February , the forward 12-month earnings P / E ratio , which uses managers &quot; future earnings guidance , reached an 11-year high of 17.1 , with the five- and ten-year averages standing at about 14 and the 15-year average at 16 . 
The stock market &apos;s recent performance often is attributed to the unconventional monetary policies that many central banks have been pursuing . 
According to the standard formulation , stock prices tend to revert toward the present value of estimated future earnings ( including growth in those earnings ) , discounted at the so-called &quot; risk-free rate , &quot; augmented by an equity risk premium . 
More precisely , the forward earnings yield - that is , the inverse of the P / E ratio - is equal to the risk-free rate plus the equity premium , minus the growth rate of earnings . 
( Of course , markets take detours along the way , driven by , say , irrational exuberance , temporary declines in the impact of value investors , or mistimed contrarian trades . ) 
Monetary policy may have bolstered stock prices in two ways , either lowering the discount rate by compressing the equity risk premium , or simply reducing risk-free rates for long enough to raise the present value of stocks . 
In either case , equity prices should level off at some point , allowing earnings to catch up , or even correct downward . 
But the monetary-policy story , while plausible , is not ironclad . 
Indeed , other factors may explain - or at least contribute to - current stock-market trends . 
A key factor is earnings growth . 
In the long run , it is reasonable to expect that revenue growth would be broadly consistent with economic growth - and , as it stands , there is little acceleration on this front . 
Earnings can grow faster than revenues for a prolonged ( though not indefinite ) period , if companies cut costs or reduce investment - a trend that would , over time , lower depreciation charges . 
In theory , corporate-tax cuts could have the same effect . 
Furthermore , the economy &apos;s equilibrium conditions could change , so that aggregate earnings would capture a larger share of national income . 
There is some evidence that this is now occurring in advanced economies , with the proliferation of labor-saving digital technologies and the globalization of supply chains suppressing income growth . 
That said , some trends may be having the opposite effect on expectations for earnings growth . 
More than two-fifths of the S P 500 &quot; s earnings come from external markets , some of which , like Europe and Japan , are barely growing , while others , like China , are slowing . 
The appreciation of the dollar exacerbates the situation for US markets , because it creates headwinds for exporters and causes companies &quot; foreign earnings , reported in dollars , to decline . 
And a slowdown in productivity growth , together with excessive leverage and persistent public-sector underinvestment , may be undermining medium-term potential economic growth . 
While expectations of faster earnings growth may well be contributing to elevated P / E levels , the current situation is complicated , to say the least . 
What is certain is that expectations of high earnings growth would have a more durable positive effect on P / E levels than the suppression of the equity risk premium . 
The other important factor affecting P / E is the risk-free rate . 
As monetary policy normalizes - a process that has already begun in the United States - the risk-free rate is expected to rise to a level that is consistent with stable 2 % inflation , which , in turn , corresponds with a level of unemployment . 
What precisely that rate is , however , remains uncertain - and extremely difficult to determine , given that it is affected by virtually every aspect of the unfolding growth patterns . 
Nonetheless , several features of current growth patterns stand out : excess productive capacity , persistent high leverage , declining labor content in goods-and-services production , and an increasingly unequal distribution of income both between labor and capital , and across labor-income segments , with their differential savings rates . 
Together , these patterns could lead to an extended period in which aggregate demand limits growth . 
With growth not constrained on the supply side , there would be little inflationary pressure , and the neutral interest rate that is consistent with non-inflationary full employment could simply be lower than it used to be for an extended period . 
Where does this leave us ? 
In my view , it is difficult to make a strong case for a significant sustained increase in earnings growth in this environment , meaning that growth alone would not justify current equity valuations . 
But the lower-discount-rate argument is more persuasive , and is consistent with underlying economic conditions and central banks &quot; mandates . 
That said , in such a complex environment , investors can be expected to reach widely disparate conclusions , which will sustain - if not increase - market volatility .
