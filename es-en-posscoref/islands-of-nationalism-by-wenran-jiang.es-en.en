Islands of Nationalism 
BEIJING - If the recent tension between China and Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea is any indication , relations between the world &apos;s second and third largest economies will not be smooth for some time to come , despite ever-increasing bilateral trade and investment . 
That is because both countries &quot; latest rush to affirm their sovereignty over the islands - called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese - reflects a sense of insecurity and a perception that the other side is taking an aggressive stand , which means that the issue is unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future . 
On the Japanese side , there is growing anxiety over China &apos;s increasing economic and military prowess , such that some nationalists would like to &quot; settle &quot; the matter in Japan &apos;s favor as soon as possible . 
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara &apos;s recent call for Japan &apos;s government to &quot; purchase &quot; the islands from &quot; private &quot; Japanese owners can be explained in this context . 
On the Chinese side , the maritime quarrels with Japan - and with Brunei , Malaysia , Vietnam , and the Philippines in the South China Sea - have reignited a national debate about whether China &apos;s foreign policy is too weak in terms of asserting the country &apos;s interests . 
America &apos;s &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia , viewed by many Chinese as an effort by the United States to reassert itself in Asia by supporting other Asian states in &quot; containing &quot; China &apos;s rise , has fueled a siege mentality among Chinese nationalists . 
Their response is to call for tough military action in the South China Sea , and to stage symbolic landings on the Diaoyu / Senkaku islands , such as those staged by Hong Kong activists on August 15 . 
Japan arrested the activists , but deported them soon after , thus avoiding a prolonged confrontation with China . 
The Japanese authorities clearly learned a lesson from their detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain two years ago , when they eventually acceded to Chinese pressure - which included a range of harsh , and escalating , political and economic measures- to release him . 
Soon after the Hong Kong activists &apos; protest landing on the disputed islands , Japanese citizens , including local assembly members , staged their own landing there . 
Moreover , the Japanese government , while rejecting a further appeal from Ishihara to provide land on the isles to the Tokyo municipality , is , however , raising money to purchase some of the islands from their supposedly bankrupt Japanese owner . 
Such mixed signals have further inflamed nationalist sentiments in China , and anti-Japanese demonstrations have broken out in many Chinese cities , including an attack on the Japanese ambassador &apos;s official vehicle . 
Both sides urgently need to cool off , especially in order to contain their extremist elements and prevent them from taking over the issue and setting the policy agenda . 
In the short term , China &apos;s government should discourage further anti-Japanese demonstrations . 
Well-educated Chinese should understand that destroying Japanese cars ( which are made in China ) and similar behavior are not rational ways to express an opinion about a territorial dispute with Japan . 
And China &apos;s government should work with the Hong Kong authorities to prevent another attempt by Chinese activists to land on Senkaku / Diaoyu again in October . 
For its part , Japan should suspend its plan to buy the islands , an effort that is certain to make matters worse if it goes ahead . 
The status quo is that the Chinese government has not challenged Japan &apos;s de facto control of the islands , so further action to force China &apos;s hand would be extremely unwise . 
In the medium term , the two governments should work out a formula for coping with scenarios that now play out regularly . 
A crisis-management team , composed of representatives of both countries &quot; foreign ministries , coast guards , and militaries , should not only meet regularly , but should also consult each other in emergency situations , thereby minimizing the risk that matters get out of control . 
Moreover , such a formula should bar provocative actions by either side , including military exercises , such as those staged recently by China and , jointly , by the US and Japan . 
It should also contain a standard procedure for managing the aftermath when behavior by citizens of either country forces the two governments into unexpected situations . 
In the long run , the best outcome is a peaceful resolution to the sovereignty issue , or , barring that , a compromise that satisfies both sides &quot; core interests . 
Joint development of the area &apos;s resources , which both countries need , should be returned to the bilateral agenda . 
China &apos;s former leader Deng Xiaoping famously proposed that , for the sake of better Sino-Japanese relations , the two countries should shelve the Diaoyu / Senkaku dispute for future generations to resolve . 
That wisdom remains the best advice to date , especially given that the consequences of a worsening bilateral relationship would extend far beyond China and Japan .
