Government Accountability or Government Accounting ? 
Paris amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; 
But he should have . 
The opposition quickly attacked the move as a &quot; dangerous gimmick &quot; and a &quot; smokescreen . &quot; 
One pundit asked , &quot; Will the time soon come when ministers are hired by head-hunters ? &quot; 
And a young MP declared that &quot; France cannot be managed like a bolt factory . &quot; 
But what is so absurd about establishing standards by which to assess the fulfillment of Sarkozy &apos;s campaign promises ? 
As soon as they were appointed in June 2007 , Sarkozy &apos;s ministers were given a clear set of objectives in the form of a letter of intent . 
Isn &apos;t it normal to create some means of holding ministers accountable ? 
A culture of &quot; results &quot; has become central to economic modernization in France , so shouldn &apos;t the same be true of French governments , with their entrenched inclination toward passivity and aloofness ? And the issue of setting measurable standards for government operations is not confined to France . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made such quantifiable goals a hallmark of his leadership ever since he was Chancellor of the Exchequer . 
Of course , the institutions charged with supervising France &apos;s public sector , such as the Cour des comptes or the Inspection générale des finances , have the skills and capacities that are needed to fulfill their tasks . 
Moreover , French public policies are subject to a general review procedure . 
But the culture of a private auditing firm can bring something new by moving beyond a basic review of legality to a general assessment of performance . 
For the plan &apos;s opponents , the main causes of indignation are the criteria for assessment . 
Should the immigration minister be judged according to the number of illegal immigrants expelled ? 
Should the education minister be assessed according to how much overtime work teachers are made to perform ? 
Should the culture minister be assessed according to the number of visitors to free museums and the share of French movies in the domestic market ? 
Such questions hide more basic ones : can the fulfillment of political goals really be quantified ? 
Is it possible to evaluate a state in the same way that you evaluate a firm , thereby reducing its performance to a set of specific actions ? 
To some extent , the answer is yes . 
After all , state bureaucracies are , on one level , simply a species of the large and complex organizations that , in the private sector , are subject to standardized performance indicators . 
In many Western democracies - New Zealand , Sweden , the United Kingdom , and even Italy - efforts at administrative modernization have focused on forging a stronger link between management and performance . 
On another level , however , state bureaucracies are very different from private-sector organizations , for they have their own characteristics and objectives , which will be endangered were they are reduced to quantitative standards of performance and efficiency . 
Indeed , one of the main reasons why certain tasks are given to governments , rather than left to the private sector , is that ordinary market mechanisms do not work in the case of so-called &quot; public goods &quot; because the market cannot determine the optimal level of their supply . 
Quantitative targets thus hide the crucial policy decision about the right &quot; portfolio &quot; of services that a government should provide . 
And if assessment of state action were based only on a set of pre-defined quantitative targets , ministers would also understandably - but mistakenly - neglect quality and other important objectives . 
So , should the French be worried ? 
According to Prime Minister Francois Fillon , &quot; We are not at school . &quot; 
Beyond technical criteria , ministers will still be assessed according to the influence exercised by their party or political faction , election results , and their popularity among the media and the public . 
Thus , there is no contradiction between the aim of turning ministers into efficient managers and parliament &apos;s power to hold members of the government accountable . 
Eventually , the voters will have the final say . 
So , targeting quantitative objectives can be a useful innovation , but only as long as its purpose is to provide a new tool in managing certain aspects of the state &apos;s performance . 
Beyond that point , the goals of state action - the substance of ministers &quot; responsibilities - will still be assessed according to values whose richness and complexity cannot be reduced to the cold one-dimensionality of a spread sheet .
