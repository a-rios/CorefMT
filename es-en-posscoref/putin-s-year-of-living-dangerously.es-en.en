Putin &apos;s Year of Living Dangerously 
MOSCOW - In the spring of 2008 , Russian President Vladimir Putin was on top of the world . 
Oil and gas prices were sky high , with export revenues flooding the Kremlin &apos;s coffers . 
The country &apos;s once powerful military , which collapsed with the demise of communism in 1991 , was being rebuilt . 
And Putin &apos;s handpicked successor , Dmitri Medvedev , had been eased into power , while Putin downshifted into the premiership . 
The United States , moreover , remained a perfect foil for a leader with pretensions to global leadership . 
Russia &apos;s seeming military revival also played a part in boosting the domestic economy . 
Arms sales , worth close to $ 8 billion , were again competing globally with Great Britain and the US , going to nearly 80 countries , including Venezuela , China , India , Algeria , Iran , Malaysia , and Serbia . 
So good did things seem that Russia suddenly discovered that , perhaps for the first time since the early days of the Soviet era , the country actually had some &quot; soft power . &quot; 
This first became apparent when the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2014 Winter Games to the Black Sea resort of Sochi . 
In 2007 , Putin addressed the Olympic Committee ( in English ) , and persuasively argued that the Games will &quot; play a major role in Russia &apos;s future . 
They will help Russia &apos;s transition as a young democracy . &quot; 
In May 2008 , Russia won the world hockey championship , beating Canada . 
In June , it almost won the Euro 2008 football championship , losing in the semi-finals to Spain . 
Next came the Eurovision Song Contest , an annual competition of pop ( rarely first class ) European singers , at which Russia &apos;s Dima Bilan gained first prize for his musical clip &quot; Believe . &quot; 
That , too , helped rekindle a sense of national pride , extending from the Kremlin to the streets . 
Russians habitually respond with black humor to events both good and bad , and the events of 2008 were no exception . 
One joke nicely encapsulates the hubris that Putin and his Kremlin allies felt : Putin and Medvedev discuss their newly found invincibility . 
&quot; Eurovision , hockey , soccer , smooth presidential transition - what a lucky streak , &quot; muses Medvedev . 
&quot; Indeed , time to initiate World War III , &quot; enthuses Putin . 
But , as usual , pride precedes a fall . 
The fall began with an event that Putin perceived as a mighty triumph - his blitzkrieg in August against Georgia . 
Yes , the Kremlin was able to smack down the uppity Mikheil Saakashvili &apos;s hope of reuniting his country by force . 
All the post-Cold War certainties in Europe melted away , and with them went Putin &apos;s reputation as a reliable manager of Russia &apos;s economy . 
Capital began to flee the country , which may not have mattered had the world economy not tanked in September . 
The reserves that Russia accumulated during the oil boom years are steadily being drained away . 
With oil prices collapsing , this pool of resources won &apos;t be refilled quickly . 
Nevertheless , Putin is trying to spend his way out of the crisis . 
Moreover , with animosity between East and West at their highest since the Cold War &apos;s end , Russia &apos;s trading partners are anxiously looking for other options , which may mean that Putin has damaged Russia &apos;s long-term prospects for an export-led recovery as well . 
Indeed , the Georgian war antagonized not only the west , but also China , which has a vital strategic interest in maintaining the post-Cold War geo-strategic settlement . 
China , after all , has no desire to see a &quot; Soviet Reunion &quot; on its border . 
Besides antagonizing China , the Georgian war also exposed the hollowness of Russia &apos;s military re-armament . 
Yes , the Russian army could smash Georgia and most of its ex-Soviet neighbors , but its performance in Georgia shows that it remains the same lumbering , badly motivated outfit that it was in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Now that America is no longer saddled with a president loathed around the world , Putin has lost one of the key tools that had helped him boost Russia &apos;s international standing . 
Poking Bush in the eye was a fine thing to do in the eyes of many people , particularly in Europe .
