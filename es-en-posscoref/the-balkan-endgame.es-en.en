The Balkan Endgame 
ROME - Twenty years after the collapse of Yugoslavia and the communist regime in Albania , the western Balkans region is at a turning point once again . 
Slovenia is in the European Union , Croatia is very close to membership , and all of the region &apos;s other countries have started along the EU path . 
Yet there remains a danger that this positive progress can still be undermined . 
Indeed , although EU integration is already bringing democracy and stability to the countries of the Balkans , it is an unfinished job , and completing that task is both vital and uncertain . 
The current economic crisis is leading public opinion in the western Balkans to lose confidence that peace and economic growth are still within reach , creating the risk of a possible slowdown in the integration process . 
As a whole , the region has made notable progress . 
Pro-European governments are now in place across the Balkans . 
The recent elections in Bosnia show that the electorate is still ethnically oriented . 
It is our task - with the support of the new Bosnian leadership - to redirect this approach to a genuine European mindset . 
Democratic reforms are proving to be an increasingly effective cure for the instability created in the past by nationalism and ethnic strains . 
The key issue is to ensure that the western Balkans keeps its focus on the European agenda , which means that the EU must provide guidance and encouragement through tangible initiatives . 
That is why , at the EU-United States summit held in Prague last year , I proposed an eight-pronged initiative , elements of which have now been fully or partially taken up , including the Conference held in Sarajevo last June where the EU reiterated its commitment to the integration process of the Balkans region as whole . 
New EU membership applications confirm the desire of Balkan governments to engage seriously in internal reforms . 
From its part , Europe is delivering as soon as the counties are adopting the necessary reforms . 
The EU needs to give clear signals to public opinion across the region that meeting EU benchmarks has tangible effects on their lives . 
Serbia is emblematic of the importance of doing so , as public support there for the EU integration process has risen sharply in a only months , from 40 % to 60 % , thanks in large part to the EU &apos;s decision of earlier this year to liberalize the visa regime . 
The EU integration process is also proving a powerful driver for much-needed reform in Bosnia . 
Despite the country &apos;s worrisome political stalemate , and the seeming entrenchment , at least for the moment , of ethnic politics , the chance to grab the &quot; low-hanging fruit &quot; of visa liberalization did encourage the Bosnian leadership to make a serious effort at reform in a relatively short period of time . 
Over the last 20 years , the goal of EU membership has proved an invaluable asset for stabilizing , democratizing , and modernizing the western Balkans . 
Now it is up to leaders in the region to overcome the remaining obstacles , starting with an understanding between the governments of Belgrade and Pristina . 
The EU has offered to play a facilitating role : we urge both leaderships to promptly seize this opportunity , with a view to their states &quot; further steps along the path towards the European family to which all Balkan countries naturally belong . 
The EU &apos;s ability to overcome &quot; enlargement fatigue &quot; and maintain its commitments to the region are also dependent on public support , so we must not stint in our efforts to convey to our citizens the political and economic advantages of accession of the countries of the western Balkans to the EU .
