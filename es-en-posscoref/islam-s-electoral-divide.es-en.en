Islam \ u0027s Electoral Divide 
How to reform the Islamic world will be among the topics NATO &apos;s leaders will discuss in Turkey next week . 
Both President Bush and the European Union have proposed bold democratization initiatives in the region . 
Can such initiatives succeed ? 
Islam and democracy are frequently presumed to be bitter antagonists . 
A careful study of the world &apos;s 47 Muslim-majority states , however , shows that Islam and democracy can and do co-exist . 
The real gap is narrower : it is the Arab world , not Islam , which seems at loggerheads with democracy . 
This conclusion is based on comparing Muslim countries &apos; &quot; electoral competitiveness . &quot; 
If a government sprang from reasonably fair elections and the elected government is able to fill the most important political offices , the country is deemed &quot; electorally competitive . &quot; 
Electorally competitive countries are not necessarily democratic : some do not fully control the state &apos;s territory ; others violate both their constitutions and human rights . 
But electoral competitiveness is always a necessary condition for democracy - and therefore a central consideration when evaluating a country &apos;s prospects for democratization . 
Two initiatives - the Polity Project , founded by political scientist Ted Gurr , and Freedom House &apos;s annual Freedom in the World surveys - gauge political rights in almost every country . 
The differences between Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries are striking . 
Of 29 non-Arab Muslim countries evaluated by Polity IV , 11 enjoyed significant political rights for at least three consecutive years in the period from 1972 to 2000 , while eight experienced at least five consecutive years of political rights . 
The Freedom House scores are remarkably similar : 12 of 31 non-Arab Muslim countries had relatively high scores for at least three consecutive years , and eight for five consecutive years . 
Both research teams rate Albania , Bangladesh , the Gambia , Malaysia , Mali , Niger , Nigeria , Pakistan , and Turkey as meeting the three-year criterion , with all but Albania and Niger meeting the five-year criterion . 
But on the Arab side , only Lebanon had three consecutive years of relatively strong political rights - before the 15-year civil war that began in 1975 - and no country experienced five consecutive years of strong rights . 
A non-Arab Muslim country in the period from 1972 to 2000 was almost 20 times more likely to be electorally competitive than an Arab Muslim-majority country . 
In the non-Arab Muslim-majority subset , both Polity IV and Freedom House rate nine countries as having experienced at least three consecutive years of substantial political rights . 
Strikingly , seven of them are clear &quot; overachievers , &quot; because they also have low per capita GDP levels . 
Indeed , five of the nine qualify as &quot; great overachievers &quot; - significant political rights despite annual per capita income of less than $ 1,500 . 
By contrast , none of the 16 Arab Muslim-majority countries is an overachiever . 
Seven had annual per capita income levels exceeding $ 5,500 in the period from 1972 to 2000 but no significant political rights for three consecutive years . 
These states are electoral &quot; underachievers &quot; - weak political rights despite relative affluence . 
Elections do occur in the Arab world , and they vary in frequency and significance . 
In the complete autocracies - Saudi Arabia , Libya , Syria , Tunisia , Iraq under Saddam , and the United Arab Emirates - there have been no meaningful elections to fill the most important offices . 
The UAE , a somewhat decentralized and consensual federation , is not as dictatorial as the others , but only seven voters - the traditional rulers of the federation &apos;s seven emirates - elect the president . 
Elections have begun to play a greater role in Qatar , Kuwait , Bahrain , and Oman , but none uses free and fair elections to fill the most important and powerful political offices . 
Traditional monarchs still have broad powers of appointment and decree . 
Finally , some Arab countries are not electorally competitive now but once did use free and fair elections to fill the state &apos;s most politically powerful offices ( Lebanon ) . 
Others seemed close to doing so ( Yemen , Morocco , and Jordan ) or had a possible political opening but are now substantially farther away from being electorally competitive ( Egypt and , arguably , Algeria ) . 
It makes intuitive sense that Islam cannot by itself explain such differences . 
All of the world &apos;s religions contain some doctrines and practices that are potentially harmful to the emergence of democracy , and others that are potentially beneficial . 
A beneficial Islamic doctrine is the Koranic injunction that &quot; there shall be no compulsion in matters of religion . &quot; 
Others include shura ( consultation ) , ijtihad ( independent reasoning ) , and ijma ( consensus ) . 
Perhaps religious and political leaders in electorally overachieving states such as Senegal , Mali , Bangladesh , and Indonesia draw upon some of these concepts . 
Most political cultures can and do change over time , because to some extent they are socially constructed by new opportunities , threats , and contexts generally . 
Witness Catholicism &apos;s pro-democratic transformation . 
Unless Arab political culture is shown to be uniquely and permanently inimical to electoral competitiveness , it makes more sense to understand the democratic divide in the Muslim world in terms of the political - as opposed to the ethnic or religious - particularities of the Middle East and North Africa . 
One such particularity is that many contemporary Arab states were established with relatively new and arbitrary boundaries , and were then occupied and often reconfigured as European colonies . 
The linguistic dominance of Arabic throughout the Middle East and North Africa , together with pan-Arabism , reinforced weak national identities . 
Anyone even remotely familiar with the region knows how common is the phrase &quot; the Arab nation &quot; ( watan ) . 
Furthermore , unlike Latin America , Africa , and elsewhere , Middle East democrats have not benefited from the Cold War &apos;s end . 
The US continues to subsidize authoritarian Arab regimes , such as Egypt ( which receives at least $ 2 billion a year ) , because it buys peace with Israel and maintains US geopolitical influence in the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
Resolving that conflict - itself a key aspect of Arab political identity - might enable Arab political culture to change . 
But NATO &apos;s leaders should bear in mind that , viewed in comparative and historical perspective , such change will be less an imposition from outside and more the result of internal pressures and initiatives .
