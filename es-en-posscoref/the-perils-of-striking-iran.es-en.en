The Perils of Striking Iran 
In the winter of 2002-03 , supporters of regime change in Iraq were upbeat in their vision of the post-invasion phase of the war . 
Anyone who suggested that what is happening today was a likely scenario was criticized as being a pro-Saddam appeaser , anti-American , or both . 
Yet a sober assessment of the difficulties ahead would have helped to avoid many of the mistakes that have proved to be so costly in terms of American lives and resources - not to mention the suffering of Iraqis . 
Now some voices in the United States and elsewhere are proposing military action against Iran . 
So it is logical to ask : what are the realistic scenarios concerning the consequences of such an intervention ? 
Are there any plans regarding how to handle the post-strike situation ? 
Without doubt , those willing to strike - either alone or in a coalition - have a range of options , ranging from naval and air blockades to targeted raids , sabotage inside the country , and massive attack from without . 
But the Iranians also have cards up their sleeve - some predictable , some wild . 
They may become malicious and aggressive in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah militia may reinitiate hostilities . 
Terrorist groups , both old and newly created , may receive fresh funding and volunteers . 
A direct military showdown in the Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz , through which about 40 % of the world &apos;s traded oil is shipped , cannot be ruled out . 
As a consequence , oil prices would skyrocket . 
Some analysts argue that the negative effects of such an outcome would only last for &quot; months . &quot; 
In their view , once Iran &apos;s military capabilities and nuclear program are destroyed , the Iranians will no longer represent a threat . 
However , it seems obvious that whatever happens , the Iranians will fight an asymmetric war not only on their own territory , but also in the neighboring region for years to come . 
As the case of Iraq shows , &quot; months &quot; is a long time in the Middle East . 
The fact that an Iranian reaction to a military attack might be ferocious does not mean that Iran &apos;s government should be allowed to do whatever it deems appropriate . 
On the contrary , the international community must be ready to enforce the most sacrosanct rules of peaceful coexistence , and sometimes this may include resorting to the use of force . 
But , in an interdependent and interconnected world , the use of force cannot be the result of national political calculations . 
Rather , it must be the product of the widest possible consensus on a critical threat assessment . 
The war against Iraq in 1991 is the leading example of military intervention following global consensus . 
If such a consensus cannot be reached , at least Western powers and like-minded states must agree , as in Kosovo in 1999 , for example . 
The third possibility - military action endorsed by a small group of states - should be avoided , for practical , legal , and moral reasons . 
Today , efficiency of external action is inextricably linked to its legitimacy . 
When it comes to deciding on how to deal with Iran , the US and its allies should bear in mind the following principles . 
First , it is crucial to make a rational threat assessment . 
Learning the lessons of the decision to invade Iraq , democracies should not allow personal obsessions , fantasies , and dogmas to contaminate the foreign policy-making process . 
It is essential to distinguish between what we know , what we ought to know - and what , therefore , we would like the Iranians to tell us - and what is speculation . 
Alarm bells signaling that the time to take action has arrived should ring at the right moment , and not before . 
Second , as long as a serious breach of international law is not detected , negotiations with Iran must continue . 
Iran is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has repeatedly declared that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only . 
Engaging in discussions with Iran does not necessarily mean that we believe or deny those declarations . 
Rather , it provides a way of reaching a better understanding of their point of view . 
Negotiations are useful , too , because they promote an internal debate in Iran . 
While an end to all contacts would probably lead to further radicalization , negotiations and the mere prospect of a future settlement may reinforce the influence of moderates . 
With historical perspective , lack of proper negotiations has been counterproductive in the North Korean case . 
Third , sanctions should not be discarded , but they should be interpreted as a means of pressure rather than as a mere prelude to war . 
As Javier Solana , the European Union &apos;s chief diplomat , who has conducted lengthy negotiations with Iran , rightly points out , even if the United Nations Security Council approves sanctions against Iran , the door to negotiations will always be open . 
The same applies , of course , to sanctions dictated by Western powers on their own . 
Finally , dealing with the Middle East , not just with Iran , requires a fresh , open-minded , and comprehensive approach . 
All regional and local actors should be involved . 
New methods should be explored . 
The US administration must recognize that foreign policy is not security policy , and that a powerful military is not a magic wand . 
True , if one has a hammer , all problems look like nails . 
The real trouble begins when one thinks that the hammer might be the right solution for headaches , too .
