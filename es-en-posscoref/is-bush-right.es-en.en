Is Bush Right ? 
Whatever critics at home and abroad may think , the &quot; surge &quot; that President Bush is planning for Iraq is more than a troop increase ; it is a new and high-risk regional strategy . 
True , Bush &apos;s plan will prove far too little and comes far too late to stabilize Iraq . 
But it does offer the United States some longer-term benefits in the regional battle with Iran for influence . 
At the heart of the new strategy is Bush &apos;s decision to take the fight directly to Iraq &apos;s most powerful militia , the Mahdi Army . 
Under the nominal control of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr , the group has become Iraq &apos;s largest and best-armed fighting force and is pursuing its own political and security agenda . 
The Mahdi Army has exchanged fire with US troops before , most notably during the fierce battles for control of the southern Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala in 2004 . 
Those confrontations ended with a truce of sorts - though skirmishes have continued - because US forces have been reluctant to fight Sunni insurgents and Shi &apos;a militiamen at the same time . 
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has also been reluctant to take on the Mahdi Army , mainly because the support of Sadr loyalists in Iraq &apos;s parliament is crucial for his political survival . 
Now , instead of waiting for Maliki to act , US forces appear poised to do the job themselves . 
If they can significantly degrade the militia &apos;s strength , or at least contain its influence within Baghdad &apos;s Shi &apos;a slums , the Iraqi government will have a somewhat better chance of developing a credible security force and Bush can claim some success . 
At the very least , the new strategy recognizes that the gravest challenge to stability in the near term comes from militia groups in general and the Mahdi Army in particular . 
Then there is the broader and growing conflict with Iran . 
Recent official US rhetoric and actions on the ground - including the arrest of five Iranians in Irbil in early January and Bush &apos;s authorization of deadly force against Iranians who threaten Iraqi security or US troops - reflect a much more confrontational approach toward Iran &apos;s influence inside Iraq . 
But it also indicates recognition that Iran &apos;s effort to extend its regional influence poses the single biggest challenge to the Middle East &apos;s long-term stability . 
To be sure , Bush &apos;s new strategy is highly unlikely to help Iraqis avert a slide into sectarian civil war . 
A temporary 16 % boost in troops simply is not enough to get that job done . 
Bush insists that there will soon be enough US troops in central Iraq to &quot; hold &quot; areas seized from militia groups and insurgents . 
But for how long ? 
A month ? 
Four months ? 
Three years ? 
American troops will eventually leave Iraq , and all the relevant parties - the Maliki government , Shi &apos;a militias , Sunni insurgents , Iran , and Iraq &apos;s Sunni Arab neighbors - know it . 
Sadr can simply hold back and wait the Americans out . 
Moreover , any viable solution in Iraq requires political agreement among Iraqis , which in turn will depend on their willingness to compromise . 
Laws guaranteeing a fair division of Iraqi oil profits must be drafted , and all factions must have confidence that what is agreed will be enforced . 
Sunnis must be persuaded that neither their minority status nor former membership in Saddam Hussein &apos;s Ba &apos;ath Party will exclude them from political and economic life . 
But Sunnis and Shi &apos;a are now killing one another in increasing numbers , and the new aggressiveness of US forces will make compromise all but impossible . 
It is unrealistic to expect Iraqi politicians to make substantial political sacrifices while their constituents are fighting Americans and one another . 
Finally , Bush &apos;s strategy already faces challenges at home . 
Few Americans - and therefore few US lawmakers - have much confidence in Bush &apos;s leadership on Iraq . 
If the new strategy fails to produce positive and tangible results within a few months , the steady domestic drumbeat for troop withdrawals will become deafening . 
A sharp spike in US casualties would compound the pressure to get out . 
Even so , the new strategy has some benefits . 
First , it sidelines Maliki , which means that he will be less damaged politically than if he were directly identified with US attacks on Iraqi Shi &apos;a . 
US actions will spark Iraqi criticism that Maliki is impotent or an American puppet , but those charges have already been made . 
Nothing could be worse for Maliki than explicit authorization for attacks on Shi &apos;a militias , and the near-term survival of his government is crucial if any progress is to be made on the political challenges facing all of Iraq &apos;s factions . 
Second , the new strategy will keep the Mahdi Army on its heels . 
Sadr &apos;s militia threatens to quickly become Iraq &apos;s answer to Hezbollah : a well-armed , politically connected private army with its own foreign policy . 
The more that US forces can degrade the Mahdi Army &apos;s position and force Sadr into face-saving political moves , the weaker the militia will be relative to other forces in Iraq after US troops head home . 
Finally , taking the fight directly to Iraq &apos;s most powerful Shi &apos;a militia and Iranians inside Iraq will align the US much more closely with its traditional Sunni Arab allies - Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Jordan , and the Gulf states . 
Arab governments have been especially angry over the chaos in Iraq , fearing that the US will abandon the Sunni minority to the not-so-tender mercies of revenge-minded Shi &apos;a and expressing growing anxiety that the war has empowered Iran to extend Shi &apos;a influence throughout the Middle East . 
When Iraq falls apart , as now appears all but inevitable , the US will need as many friends in the region as it can get , particularly as the battle with Iran for regional influence and the conflict over its nuclear program intensifies . 
If nothing else , having a common enemy will help the US and its Arab allies restore damaged ties .
