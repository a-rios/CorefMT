The Audacity of Hope for Palestine 
SINGAPORE - The world will be enveloped in a heavy cloud of gloom and doom this year . 
Economies will sputter , governments will fall , and companies will fail . 
But the biggest danger of all is a sense of hopelessness . 
Preventing this requires resolving some large and apparently intractable problem . 
Closing the Doha Round of world trade talks provides one such opportunity . 
But an even better opportunity is provided by the Israel-Palestine conflict . 
Many people around the world , especially in the West , have convinced themselves that this conflict is beyond resolution . 
Several efforts have been made since the famous Oslo accords of 1993 . 
All failed . 
But few have noticed that an unusual constellation of forces has emerged , opening a remarkable new window of opportunity for a solution . 
Such geopolitical opportunities are rare , and it would be a great tragedy not to seize this one . 
For a start , there seems to be a near-universal consensus that any solution will be based on the Taba accords worked out by President Bill Clinton in January 2001 . 
Palestinian diplomats have told me they can accept this package . 
Equally important , there is now a near-universal consensus among virtually all the Arab states that a peace settlement is in their interest . 
Many , including Egypt and Saudi Arabia , are more concerned with the rise of Iran . 
An agreement with Israel could strengthen their hand in dealing with Iran and deprive the Iranian government of an opportunity to whip up Arab popular sentiment against Arab governments &quot; position on Palestine . 
The big question is whether Israel is ready . 
But , despite the difficult political situation in Israel , there seems to be a growing consensus among the Israeli elite that time is no longer on Israel &apos;s side . 
It may also help that Israel &apos;s foreign policy will now be run by two perceived hardliners , Binyamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman . 
Just as it took a Richard Nixon to go to China , it will take a Netanyahu to enforce a peace settlement that will require a withdrawal from most of the West Bank settlements . 
When I visited Israel in 1997 , I called on then-Prime Minister Netanyahu , as he and I had been colleagues when we both served as ambassadors to the United Nations . 
I will never forget what he said to me : &quot; Kishore , ignore the media stories . 
I am in favor of peace . &quot; 
The broad coalition , including Lieberman and Ehud Barak , also makes peace more likely . 
Any good peace settlement requires a powerful mediator . 
Fortunately , a candidate has arrived in the person of United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
Her two predecessors , Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice , did not have the most important credential : trust from both sides . 
She does . 
I have only shaken hands with Clinton once , early one Sunday morning in a synagogue in New York City several years ago . 
I was truly impressed that this small synagogue could marshal the presence of New York &apos;s two senators , Clinton and Charles Schumer , and several other congressmen for an early breakfast gathering . 
I could see at first hand that Clinton enjoyed the trust of the Jewish community - a necessary requirement for any Middle East mediator . 
Clinton also showed her diplomatic skill when she visited the region in March 2009 . 
She reaffirmed her commitment to Israeli security . 
She showed concern for the humanitarian plight of Gaza &apos;s residents . 
Her deftness is not surprising . 
Her husband , Bill Clinton , studied the Middle East problem intensely , which showed in the quality of the peace proposal that he put together . 
Undoubtedly , the perception that Clinton will be completing the work that her husband began in the region will be a major motivating factor . 
Such personal considerations do matter . 
There is also no doubt that if she succeeds in brokering a two-state solution , she would be a prime candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize . 
That outcome would be applauded around the world . 
Few Americans are aware that rapid globalization of the Islamic world has produced a political grid that links all 1.3 billion Muslims on some key issues . 
The Israel-Palestine conflict has produced negative political repercussions that travel instantly to all corners of the Islamic world . 
Barack Obama &apos;s election as US president and his natural popularity in the Islamic world have helped to curb some of these repercussions . 
If this could be combined with a peace settlement , the world would suddenly experience a rush of hope that would break through today &apos;s global cloud of gloom . 
And the audacity of hope is what the world needs most today .
