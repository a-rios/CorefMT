The Risks of Withdrawal 
BERLIN - Entering a war is easy ; getting out of it is the hard part . 
That axiom is particularly true for the United States today , as it muddles through three wars - two of which were forced upon it ( Afghanistan and the &quot; war on terror &quot; ) , with the third ( Iraq ) started unnecessarily by a US administration blinded by ideology and hubris . 
The US has no prospect of a military victory in Afghanistan or Iraq ; these wars &quot; economic costs can hardly be borne anymore , and political support at home is dwindling . 
America must withdraw , but the price - for the US , its allies in the region , and for the West - remains an open question . 
The last US combat troops have pulled out of Iraq . 
Despite using all the means at its disposal , the world &apos;s greatest military power managed only to create a precarious domestic stability . 
No one today is hanging &quot; Mission accomplished ! &quot; banners . 
None of the urgent political problems caused by US intervention - the distribution of power between Shia and Sunni , between Kurds and Arabs , and between Baghdad and the regions - was actually resolved . 
Iraq remains a state without a common nation . 
Moreover , it threatens to turn into a battleground for its neighbors &quot; opposing interests . 
The struggle between the leading Sunni power , Saudi Arabia , and Shia Iran for Persian Gulf hegemony threatens to turn Iraq into a battlefield again , including another round of civil war . 
Neighboring Syria and Turkey would probably be dragged into such a conflict instantaneously . 
One can only hope that the vacuum created by America &apos;s withdrawal doesn &apos;t implode in violence . 
The situation in Afghanistan is even more complicated . 
Afghanistan is the mirror image of Iraq : a nation without a state . 
Separatism was never a threat here , but ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979 , the country has been a theater of war for global and regional conflicts . 
What we see in Afghanistan isn &apos;t just a civil war . 
Via their Afghan allies , Pakistan in particular but also Saudi Arabia , Iran , India , and Central Asian countries are embroiled in a fight for influence . 
At first , the war in Afghanistan was a war of liberation against the Red Army ; then it turned into a civil war , and from the mid-1990 &quot; s it was subsumed in the Indian-Pakistani conflict , as Pakistan sought to achieve strategic depth and regional influence via the Taliban , a creation of the Pakistani secret service , the ISI . 
The terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , turned Afghanistan into the theater of a global war . 
But what will now follow ? 
A relapse into regional war and Islamist terror ? 
Or will developments take an unforeseeable turn ? 
The US and NATO are caught in a quandary in Afghanistan . 
They can neither remain in the country indefinitely , nor can they just leave . 
Indeed , it is forgotten all too often that the US de facto withdrew from the country once before , following the Soviet retreat of February 1989 . 
Twelve years later , after the terrorist attacks of 2001 , the US and its Western allies had to return to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban , which had turned Afghanistan into a breeding ground of Islamist terrorism . 
The lessons of the 1990 &quot; s aren &apos;t difficult to understand and are too important to ignore . 
Apparently , though , some Western officials are trying to do just that . 
The Europeans would prefer to withdraw sooner rather than later , and the US will probably follow suit . 
It is now apparent how great a mistake the US made by never developing a proper political strategy for Afghanistan , relying instead almost exclusively on military means . 
Indeed , the strategy for &quot; Afghanization &quot; of the conflict by training local security forces - agreed upon at the beginning of this year at a conference in London - is based mainly on the US and European timetable for withdrawal , not on the situation within the country and in the region . 
If the US and NATO leave Afghanistan to its own devices without first creating a minimum of regional stability , it is all but certain that the Islamist danger will return in relatively short order , and will be greater than it was in the 1990 &quot; s . 
But regional stability primarily requires the clarification of Pakistan &apos;s role in Afghanistan . 
And the same challenge hides behind the formula of &quot; inclusion of the Taliban &quot; in any settlement for Afghanistan , because the Taliban have no bargaining power without Pakistan , as recent events have shown . 
The key to Afghanistan lies in Islamabad , not in Kabul , which means that US President Barack Obama &apos;s special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , is more important now than the military commander in Afghanistan , General David Petraeus . 
It is in Pakistan &apos;s capital that a regional solution will have to be negotiated , and the conditions for success are by no means hopeless , though it involves the far more complicated - and rarely mentioned - issue of Indian-Pakistani relations . 
The West wants to withdraw from Afghanistan and will surely do so . 
The irony , however , is that withdrawal might lead the West into a new , far more dangerous regional war as Iran proceeds toward its goal of developing nuclear weapons . 
If that happens , withdrawal plans will be returned to the shelf - probably for many years .
