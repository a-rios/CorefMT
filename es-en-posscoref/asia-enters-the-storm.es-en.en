Asia Enters the Storm 
BERKELEY - As 2011 draws to a close , there are growing signs that Asia is becoming caught up in the global slowdown , dashing hopes that the region &apos;s economies would &quot; decouple &quot; from the prolonged recession in Europe and America &apos;s lackluster recovery . 
China &apos;s export growth is slipping , owing to faltering demand in Europe , which has surpassed the United States as China &apos;s largest foreign market . 
Indeed , China &apos;s manufacturing activity is contracting for the first time in almost three years . 
Reverberations are already evident in other emerging Asian economies that depend on exports both to China-based manufacturers and to the US and Europe . 
Decoupling did not occur in 2008 , when exports accounted for about 45 % of pan-Asian GDP ( excluding Japan ) and every emerging country in the region experienced a sharp contraction in growth as world trade plummeted . 
Nor is decoupling likely today , because exports still account for about the same share of the region &apos;s GDP , and about 50 % of these exports are still headed to developed countries . 
So the idea of decoupling appears to be a chimera . 
Even if the euro crisis is resolved , austerity in Europe , along with anemic growth or worse in the US , will mean a slowdown in export-dependent Asia . 
But Asia &apos;s economies can still grow much faster than the developed West if they respond to prolonged stagnation by rebalancing their growth toward internal demand , especially household consumption . 
The good news is that these economies have substantial room for such rebalancing , as well as the policy flexibility to accomplish it . 
The share of consumption in GDP in these economies fell from more than 60 % in the early 1980 &quot; s to less than 50 % today . 
In China , it is less than 40 % - far below the norm for the world &apos;s major economies and for other Asian economies at a comparable stage of development - despite nearly 7 % annual average growth in China &apos;s per capita consumption in recent years . 
The Asian economies are home to 3.5 billion consumers , but their share in global consumption remains small - much smaller than their share in global GDP . 
China alone accounts for 20 % of the world &apos;s population , nearly 11 % of global GDP , but only 3 % of global consumption . 
China and most of the other emerging Asian economies have strong government balance sheets - the GDP shares of their budget deficits and public debt are relatively small . 
As a result , they have the fiscal firepower to boost consumption in order to mitigate the effects of declining exports . 
True , many local governments in China are saddled with debt , some of which may need to be restructured . 
But the central government enjoyed a 28 % increase in revenues over the last year , and has more than $ 3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves . 
In addition , the moderation of inflationary pressure as a result of slower growth and cooling global commodity markets will allow Chinese and other Asian policymakers to shift their focus from containing economic overheating to rebalancing growth . 
In China , where inflation is falling sharply , monetary policy has already begun to ease . 
Even with significant policy support , however , most of the smaller Asian economies - Taiwan , Thailand , Singapore , and even South Korea - will not be able to replace external demand with internal demand to the same extent that China can . 
So , even with rebalancing , exports will remain a significant determinant of their growth , and China is already their major export market . 
That is why China &apos;s rebalancing is so important not only for its own economy , but for all of China-centric Asia . 
Intra-regional trade flows have surged during the last decade , but they have been concentrated in parts and components that go into finished products assembled in China for export to developed countries . 
With depressed markets in the developed world , intra-regional trade in the future will depend more on exports to satisfy Chinese domestic demand . 
Again , there is cause for optimism : China &apos;s imports from Asia have been growing faster than China &apos;s exports to the US for the last several years . 
China responded to the 2009 global slowdown with dramatic fiscal and monetary stimulus , which fueled a rapid investment-led recovery at home and throughout Asia . 
Investment , mainly by local governments and state-owned companies with easy access to bank financing , soared to more than 45 % of GDP , and , consistent with China &apos;s long-run urbanization strategy , was concentrated in infrastructure and property-development projects . 
Over time , much of the expansion in capacity will be absorbed , as an estimated 15 million people move from rural to urban areas each year over the next decade . 
But , for now , many investment projects are not yet generating enough income to service their debts ( some of them never will ) , and there is significant spare capacity . 
Confronted with another global slowdown that could depress its export markets for years , China needs to boost consumption even as it cools investment . 
And it needs to so in ways that do not rely on excessive credit expansion . 
China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan , which will take effect in 2012 , recognizes these policy imperatives and calls for several measures to fulfill them , including wage increases for urban workers ; income support for rural households ; enhanced access to capital for small businesses , especially in the underbuilt services sector ; and more generous social-welfare programs , which would reduce Chinese households &quot; high levels of precautionary saving . 
All of these measures are already underway , and Chinese leaders appear committed to embracing a new growth strategy that will benefit both China &apos;s population and Asia as a whole . 
The Asian economies should not count on being able to decouple from the economic woes of Europe and the US in the short run . 
But there are promising signs that , over time , the advanced countries &quot; difficulties will trigger a healthy , if belated , shift in Asia &apos;s development strategy , with China leading the way .
