A Theory of European Citizenship 
There is something tragic about Europe &apos;s current development . 
Democracy &apos;s march across the continent , and the formation of a single market across much of Europe , have created unprecedented stability , security , and prosperity . 
The new single currency , the euro , and the European Union &apos;s promise to admit as many as ten new members in 2004 , are powerful indicators of ongoing integration . 
Yet , the ability of European institutions to accommodate deeper and broader integration is increasingly undermined by the persistence of a contradictory and long-obsolete ideal : the nation-state as the basis of political legitimacy and sovereignty . 
It is largely because the idea of common European citizenship is often understood by analogy to that of national citizenship that further European integration engenders so much fear and opposition . 
The nation-state in the traditional sense presupposed a citizenry that was created as competing collective identities decayed . 
Venetians became Italians , Bavarians became Germans , and so on . 
Nation-builders throughout Europe promoted - with varying degrees of success , to be sure - the emergence of a dominant culture , an official language , and an identity based partly on distinctions vis-Ã -vis neighboring states , peoples and cultures . 
National minorities everywhere faced expulsion or enormous official pressure to assimilate . 
A European nation-state in this sense was untenable even for the original six members of the European Community - all of them highly industrialized countries with similar social and political traditions and institutions . 
It is no more feasible today for the EU &apos;s 15 members , and further enlargement means that the multitude of collective identities , cultures , languages , religions , and worldviews will become greater still . 
The singular &quot; people &quot; that defines citizenship in a traditional nation-state could be forged only by plunging Europe into appalling repression and war lasting generations , if not centuries . 
Of course , European integration has been driven from the outset precisely by the shared historical memory of the terrible suffering wrought by aggressive nationalism . 
But without an alternative to the nation-state as the basis of citizenship , the legitimacy and effectiveness of EU institutions have come under growing strain . 
Witness , for example , Ireland &apos;s veto of the institutional reforms adopted at the EU &apos;s Nice summit in December 2000 - reforms without which enlargement cannot go forward . 
Similarly , opinion polls show that support for EU membership has fallen rapidly even in many candidate countries . 
Political leaders such as Vaclav Klaus in the Czech Republic and Viktor Orban in Hungary welcome the common market , but argue that their nation-states did not re-gain their 
Yet free movement of goods and services , labor , capital , and ideas ( the single market &apos;s &quot; four freedoms &quot; ) makes irrelevant much of what traditional European nation-states do - namely , defending these freedoms within a smaller territory . 
With the EU &apos;s internal borders reduced to purely administrative boundaries , this task has passed to institutions that wield immense preemptive authority over member states . 
An alternative must therefore be found to a definition of citizenship that regards these institutions as merely some sort of formalized representation of member states &apos; common political will . 
What should an alternative conception of European citizenship look like ? 
The US model of political identity , shaped by a legacy of immigration and voluntary cultural integration , cannot be simply transposed to Europe , where distinct traditions , cultures , and attitudes are so deeply entrenched . 
But a conception of citizenship that is 
Indeed , this is the 
Assuming that you are rational , you must calculate that you may be a member of a cultural minority . 
Obviously , you will not choose rules that define citizenship in terms of a particular cultural identity . 
On the contrary , you will seek to hedge your bets by ensuring that citizenship is constituted by individual rights of participation in collective projects , backed up by a legal system that guarantees these rights . 
Citizenship in this sense views political sovereignty and legitimacy as features of institutions that foster 
European citizenship understood in this way is compatible with a multitude of collective identities ranging from family or friendship groups to professional associations and corporations , regionally defined communities , and shared cultural , political and religious affinities . 
Such a conception stabilizes social cooperation within Europe because it reflects a basic normative consensus on the design of institutions and thus orients individual behavior toward preserving these institutions . 
In fact , a well-developed conception of democratic citizenship will always emphasize individual rights . 
Citizenship is not constituted by groups , but by individuals interacting
