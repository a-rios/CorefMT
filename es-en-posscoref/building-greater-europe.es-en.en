Building Greater Europe 
MOSCOW - Greater Europe is at a crossroads . 
Twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain , it remains divided , unable to unify into a global force . 
Each of the three parts of Greater Europe - Russia , the European Union , and the countries between them - is in crisis . 
The causes and forms of these crises differ , but the consequences are almost identical . 
Russia has reached the limit of growth derived from its post-communist reconstruction . 
Today , it has strengthened its state institutions , overcome economic decline , and regained status as a major actor in world politics . 
Yet Russia &apos;s future is questionable . 
Soviet resources , in terms both of infrastructure and ideology , are exhausted . 
The country &apos;s economy remains unable to make optimal use of relatively high energy-export revenues . 
Russian society and its leaders have no clear vision of the future , and the country &apos;s demographic decline offers little hope of a rapid and sustainable turnaround . 
The EU gives the outward impression of being a successful project . 
Europeans are experiencing an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity ; their integration model has now spread to include most of the continent . 
Consolidation is giving way to friction , with more energy needed to overcome the EU &apos;s internal problems . 
The EU &apos;s inefficiencies , coupled with changes in the international priorities of some of its member states , have led to a decline in the Union &apos;s political clout . 
If this trend continues , the EU &apos;s waning influence will inevitably weaken its economic position and reduce its competitiveness . 
The EU &apos;s future enlargement to adjacent territories - the essence of its foreign policy in the last 15 years - will become less and less likely . 
In short , the EU will no longer be able to offer attractive membership prospects to neighboring countries , nor will it be able to allocate adequate resources for surrogate membership schemes like the Eastern Partnership . 
This dilemma has begun to have a negative effect on the countries that lie between Russia and the EU . 
Developments in these countries during the postcommunist years marked a gradual change from Russian to European influence , but that is not irreversible . 
The EU and NATO are unable to expand farther , even though they may want to maintain post-Soviet countries &quot; interest in membership in order to prevent their possible return to Russia &apos;s orbit . 
These &quot; intermediate &quot; countries therefore remain in limbo . 
The global economic crisis has aggravated this ambiguity , while also markedly reducing the flow of resources that these needy countries receive . 
Greater Europe &apos;s three parts are , then , in a state of strategic uncertainty . 
The postcommunist transitional agenda is exhausted , without having yielded a sustainable European politico-economic structure . 
Although no new project is in sight , two basic scenarios appear possible . 
The first scenario is a continuation of the current situation . 
Russia and the EU would continue trying to consolidate their positions by competing for influence over their mutual neighbors . 
The EU &apos;s greater economic power still attracts other countries , but this power might lose its luster if the EU continues to disappoint them by failing to meet their expectations . 
While Russia is not as politically or economically appealing as the EU , it can fall back on reliance on its natural resources to achieve its political objectives in adjacent territories . 
Moreover , both the US and China nowadays find Russia to be more strategically interesting than Europe , and that doesn &apos;t go unnoticed in , say , Kiev or Minsk . 
Both the EU and Russia have advantages to offer , so competition between them could be fierce . 
The climate-change conference in Copenhagen last December illustrated this decline , as it was the four main emerging countries - China , India , Brazil , and South Africa - that held the key negotiations in which US President Barack Obama actively intervened . 
Russia had a low profile , but the EU , which considers itself the leader of climate policy , was simply informed post factum . 
If the political environment continues to develop in this manner , Greater Europe , torn by conflicts rooted in its past , will have to take a subordinate role on the global stage . 
In the second scenario , Russia and the EU would pool their efforts and collaborate . 
Greater Europe would thus be able to claim a leading role in addressing international issues . 
Once Russia and the EU decide to consolidate their efforts , they would inevitably address their neighbors &quot; difficulties in the context of shared responsibility , not rivalry . 
Closer integration with the EU is therefore widely seen as important to the success of Russia &apos;s own economic transformation . 
But model of integration followed from the 1990 &quot; s up until about 2005 was not a success . 
The obstacles hindering its success included Russia &apos;s inability or refusal to transform itself in line with the European model , as well as Europe &apos;s lack of the ambition and imagination needed to launch a new project for the genuine unification of the whole of Europe . 
If kept separate , the three parts that make up Greater Europe will become politically marginalized . 
Preventing this requires political will , especially within the EU , which all too often seems to favor playing a neutral role . 
To work , integration must be balanced and equal , with both Russia and the EU adopting some of each other &apos;s ideas . 
This process will occur as the two parties start to identify priority areas for interaction , beginning with oil and gas , as well as military-technical and aerospace cooperation . 
Without such a process , Europe will remain divided , with no leadership role in the twenty-first century .
