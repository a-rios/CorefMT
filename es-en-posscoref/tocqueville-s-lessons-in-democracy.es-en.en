Tocqueville &apos;s Lessons in Democracy 
It seems appropriate that , due to the Iraq war , the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville &apos;s birth . 
Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy &apos;s triumph as our destiny , while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty . 
Should we still share his worries ? 
Tocqueville viewed democracy not only as a political regime , but , above all , as an intellectual regime that shapes a society &apos;s customs in general , thereby giving it a sociological and psychological dimension . 
Democratic regimes , Tocqueville argued , determine our thoughts , desires , and passions . 
Just as there was Renaissance man and , in the twentieth century , homo sovieticus , &quot; democratic man &quot; is a form of human being . 
For Tocqueville , democracy &apos;s systemic effects could lead citizens to deprive themselves of reasoned thought . 
They could only pretend to judge events and values on their own ; in reality , they would merely copy the rough and simplified opinions of the masses . 
Indeed , what Tocqueville called the hold of &quot; social power &quot; on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes - a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation . 
Tocqueville believed that there are no effective long-term constraints on this tendency . 
Neither local democracy nor small societies , neither governmental checks and balances nor civil rights , can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause . 
Schools have the power to be little more than enclaves from the corrosive strength of social influences on how the mind works . 
Similarly , while Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients did , or having a religious faith , could sometimes elevate the soul , both conflict with the democratic ideal if they become officially prescribed in public life . 
In this sense , Tocqueville &apos;s intellectual heirs include the neo-Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School , as well as Hannah Arendt , all of whom feared above all the disintegration of reason in modern societies . 
Indeed , the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy Against Itself . 
The democratic way of life , these writers argue , tends to destroy original thought and to suppress &quot; high &quot; culture , yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to democracy &apos;s enemies . 
But , while history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses , the greater risk for democratic nations is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and short-term thinking for immediate gratification . 
The past - despite rituals that seek to commemorate historic moments - is obliterated by an addiction to the now and the new . 
Even the supposedly well-educated ruling class is subject to this bewitchment . 
The essential problem of the democratic mind is its lack of historical consciousness . 
Do the defects of democracy really mean , as Tocqueville claimed , that resigned pessimism is the only - realistic but unsustainable - path open to us ? 
I don &apos;t think so . 
There are means to fight against what might be called today &apos;s growing &quot; democratic stupidity . &quot; 
The first defense is to push for an educational system that really forms critical minds , namely through the ( nowadays ) largely neglected subjects of literature , history , and philosophy . 
If the informed and critical citizenry that democracy requires is to be formed , our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to sharpen the analytical capacities of students . 
The biggest impediment to such an education are the mass media , with its tendency to cultivate superficiality and amusement . 
Many people nowadays spend more of their lives watching television than they do in classrooms . 
The passivity that mass media encourages is the polar opposite of the active engagement that democratic citizens need . 
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media ( other than quality newspapers ) would , of their own volition , become instruments of an education that enhances citizens &quot; critical capacities . 
This concern about mass media is no mere elitist scorn for popular culture . 
The question is not one of popularity alone - after all , Mozart was popular in his day , and Shakespeare &apos;s plays attracted the poor as well as the rich - but of mass culture &apos;s refusal to challenge and provoke . 
The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences . 
Indeed , for a long time a globalized media culture , one unable to inspire the capacity for critical thought or create elevated feelings , has been on the rise . 
It is a culture that , through its carelessness , threatens democratic freedom because it fails to create any sense of obligation - to society , to history , to community . 
Is it too late to do anything about a culture that so deadens the spirit ? 
Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency in the face of the deracinating force of mass democracy . 
Will the myopia of our leaders also serve as an agent of his disquieting prophecy ?
