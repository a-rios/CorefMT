China &apos;s Growth Secret 
SHANGHAI - Many people are profoundly pessimistic about the Chinese economy &apos;s growth prospects , owing to the emergence of massive debt , excessive investment , overcapacity , and so-called &quot; ghost cities &quot; since the 2008 global financial crisis . 
They have , in various forms , affected China &apos;s economy since 1978 , and were evident in East Asia &apos;s other high-performing economies - Taiwan , South Korea , and even Japan - during their periods of rapid growth . 
Nonetheless , in the 35 years since Deng Xiaoping initiated his program of &quot; reform and opening up , &quot; China has recorded 9.7 % average annual growth . 
And it took only 40 years for South Korea and Taiwan to complete their transitions from low- to high-income status . 
How did these economies manage to grow so fast for so long and overcome the serious problems that they faced along the way ? 
The answer is simple : resilience . 
Economic development is a convoluted process , full of challenges and risks , successes and failures , external shocks and internal volatility . 
If a country fails to respond adequately to new challenges as they arise , economic growth and development stall . 
Many countries in Latin America and South Asia , for example , have become mired in the so-called &quot; middle-income trap , &quot; because they failed to adjust their growth models in a timely manner . 
East Asia &apos;s economies , by contrast , consistently adjusted their growth strategies and engaged in continuous institutional reform . 
The aim was not to tackle the problems they faced directly , but to induce new , more efficient activities that would help to turn debt into assets and maximize use of the economy &apos;s capacity . 
In this sense , East Asia &apos;s economies have embraced the process of &quot; creative destruction &quot; described by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter , whereby the economic structure is continually revolutionized from within . 
Moreover , by implementing incremental reforms that facilitate - and even encourage - the replacement of old , inefficient sources of growth with new , more dynamic ones , they have expedited this process . 
For example , China &apos;s productivity-enhancing agricultural reforms in the 1980s were spurred partly by growth in the non-agricultural sector , a result of policies aimed at stimulating township and village enterprises . 
Similarly , in the 1990s , China addressed the buildup of bad debt and unfinished construction projects - the result of state-owned enterprises &quot; chronic loss-making and excessive property investment , respectively - by implementing institutional reforms that stimulated growth in more dynamic sectors , thereby offsetting the SOEs &quot; declining return on capital . 
Resilience has thus characterized the interaction between the government and markets since the introduction of Deng &apos;s reforms . 
Indeed , according to the late economist Gustav Ranis , the interactive dynamic of policy and market institutions was the key to the success of the East Asian economies . 
For example , fiscal decentralization in China , spurred by local institutions &quot; demands for increased autonomy , has helped to fuel regional competition and sustain an increasingly market-oriented economic environment . 
This interactive dynamic is also reflected in the formation of industrial policies . 
In China , though clusters of vibrant smaller manufacturers are flourishing , policymakers have done relatively little to promote industrial development and upgrading . 
Another source of resilience in East Asia are local governments . 
For starters , they are responsible for public capital expenditure , driving the improvement in China &apos;s physical infrastructure and yielding reasonable returns for private investors . 
This advances the objective of helping local businesses , particularly innovative small and medium-size firms , to grow and thrive . 
To this end , local governments are also helping entrepreneurs gain access to global production chains . 
Finally , local governments have demonstrated a willingness to support institutional innovation . 
After three years of slowing growth and rising debt , China once again finds itself at a crossroads . 
Fortunately , it seems to be choosing the path of flexibility and adjustment , as it pursues an ambitious reform plan that , it is hoped , will enable it to edge closer to - and eventually cross - the high-income threshold .
