Europe &apos;s Second Chance in the Balkans 
Confronting the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991 , former EU Council President Jacques Poos made his famous but now derided statement : &quot; This is the hour of Europe ... not the hour of the Americans . &quot; 
What the EU learned from the subsequent four years of Balkan disasters under its management is now being tested by another major turning point and potential crisis - when and how Kosovo is to become independent . 
Once again , Europe &apos;s role may well prove decisive . 
The decision on Kosovo may not imply the prospect of renewed large-scale conflict , but it does raise serious questions for Europe &apos;s relations with Russia and the United States , as well as for stability throughout the Balkans . 
While the US has a major stake in the outcome , EU countries obviously have the most significant interests in the region , and perhaps this time they will assume a corresponding leadership role . 
For at least the next two months , the United Nations Security Council will debate a blueprint for Kosovo &apos;s future , arduously worked out during a year of &quot; negotiations &quot; between the governments in Belgrade and Pristina by UN envoy and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari . 
The bluebrint provides for Kosovo &apos;s &quot; supervised independence , &quot; maximum protection for Serb and other minorities , and a supervisory role for the EU . 
Ahtisaari &apos;s proposal is an acknowledgement that no agreement between the parties is possible , and that there is no constructive alternative to Kosovo &apos;s independence . 
Together with the US , the EU collectively has rallied around the Ahtisaari proposal . 
But individually , a number of European countries - Spain , Greece , Italy , Cyprus , Romania , Slovakia , and Austria - are skeptical or negative toward Kosovo independence , which raises profound questions about the EU &apos;s resolve . 
Meanwhile , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is waging a tireless and remarkably effective diplomatic campaign denouncing both Ahtisaari and his proposal . 
He has strengthened the position of many in Europe and elsewhere who are skeptical of challenging a country &apos;s territorial integrity or who still claim to believe in a negotiated settlement . 
More worrisome is the current uncertainty about whether a shaky Europe will stand up to Russia , upon which Serbia depends to maintain sovereignty over Kosovo . 
So far , the Kremlin has resolutely stated that it will accept only a settlement agreed to by both parties , in effect endorsing Serbia &apos;s position . 
While conveying the possibility of a veto , Russia &apos;s current strategy is to delay a Security Council vote as long as possible by prompting a new fact-finding mission to Kosovo , which will most likely be followed by renewed insistence on another effort to negotiate a settlement . 
Serbia welcomes delay in the hope that this will stimulate violence by frustrated Kosovars , thereby increasing Europe &apos;s opposition to independence and bolstering Serbia &apos;s dedication to maintaining the status quo , or , as a last resort , to partitioning Kosovo . 
Some European countries apparently believe that they can maintain an EU consensus in support of Ahtisaari &apos;s plan but allow Russian foot-dragging on the grounds that delay is not unreasonable and something better may turn up with additional negotiations . 
But , by adopting such a stance , they thwart their own envoy and may well stimulate the violence they profess to abhor . 
History offers little consolation . 
The EU &apos;s handling of relations with Serbia in the past only encouraged intransigence . 
Instead of repeatedly making clear that Kosovo independence is an indispensable requirement for EU membership - so important to Serbia &apos;s modernization and Balkan stability - EU leaders like Javier Solana laud Kostunica as a great democratic leader . 
They relentlessly but unsuccessfully pressured Montenegro &apos;s leaders to remain in a dysfunctional union with Serbia , condoned Kostunica &apos;s dubious 2006 referendum on a new constitution enshrining Kosovo as a part of Serbia , and weakened demands for Serbia &apos;s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague . 
Realizing Ahtisaari &apos;s proposal will depend on EU solidarity and persistence , coupled with strong American support , to manage the vicissitudes of UN debate , lobby skeptical non-permanent Security Council members , such as Indonesia and South Africa , and persuade Russia to abstain rather than exercise its veto . 
Many believe that Russia will not risk its relations with Europe and the US , ultimately abstaining if Western countries hold firm . 
But Russia appears to be in a Gaullist mood , and has other outstanding issues causing friction with the US and Europe . 
Putin &apos;s Russia is not Yeltsin &apos;s Russia , when the West could simply shunt aside Russian concerns . 
Europe is vulnerable on many fronts , particularly in view of its dependence on Russian energy , while America &apos;s weakened presidency has diminished US influence in Russia . 
If Russia does veto the Ahtisaari plan , the EU &apos;s united facade will likely fracture , with many European countries refusing either to join the US in recognizing an independent Kosovo without the UN &apos;s blessing or to send a supervisory mission there . 
That would open a new and tumultuous era in the Balkans , with more than Kosovo at stake . 
Indeed , with the UN and the Western alliance in disarray , the region could fall victim to further Russian policy mischief .
