The Arab Revolutions &quot; Reality Check 
BERLIN - Two years after popular uprisings began to convulse the Middle East , few people speak of an &quot; Arab Spring &quot; anymore . 
Given Syria &apos;s bloody civil war , the rise to power of Islamist forces through free elections , the ever-deepening political and economic crises in Egypt and Tunisia , increasing instability in Iraq , uncertainty about the future of Jordan and Lebanon , and the threat of war over Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the bright hope of a new Middle East has vanished . 
Add the region &apos;s eastern and western peripheries - Afghanistan and North Africa ( including the Sahel and South Sudan ) - and the picture becomes even grimmer . 
Indeed , Libya is increasingly unstable , al-Qaeda is actively engaged in the Sahel ( as the fighting in Mali shows ) , and no one can foresee what will happen in Afghanistan after the US and its NATO allies withdraw in 2014 . 
All of us tend to make the same mistake repeatedly : we think at the beginning of a revolution that freedom and justice have prevailed over dictatorship and cruelty . 
But history teaches us that what follows is usually nothing good . 
A revolution not only overthrows a repressive regime ; it also destroys the old order , paving the way for a mostly brutal , if not bloody , fight for power to establish a new one - a process that affects foreign and domestic policy alike . 
Normally , revolutions are followed by dangerous times . 
Indeed , exceptions to this pattern are rare : South Africa is one , owing to the genius of one of the century &apos;s most outstanding statesmen , Nelson Mandela . 
The alternative option can be observed in Zimbabwe . 
Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 , though a very interesting reference point for analysts of the Arab revolutions , is not an appropriate reference point , because the region &apos;s new domestic and foreign order resulted from the change in external conditions stemming from the collapse of Soviet power . 
Internally , nearly all of these countries had a very clear idea about what they wanted : democracy , freedom , a market economy , and protection from the return of the Russian empire . 
They wanted the West , and their accession to NATO and the European Union was logical . 
Nothing of the sort applies to the crisis belt of the Middle East . 
No power anywhere , within the region or without , is willing and able to implement the barest vision of a new regional order - or even a vision for parts of it . 
Chaos is a constant threat , with all of its accompanying risks and threats to world peace . 
In addition to poverty , backwardness , repression , rapid population growth , religious and ethnic hatred , and stateless peoples ( such as the Kurds and the Palestinians ) , the region has unstable borders . Many were drawn by the colonial powers , Great Britain and France , after World War I , and most , with the exception of Iran &apos;s and Egypt &apos;s , have little legitimacy . 
As if this were not enough , some countries - including Iran , Saudi Arabia , and even tiny ( but very rich ) Qatar - have ambitions to be regional powers . 
All of these contradictions are currently exploding in Syria , whose population is suffering a humanitarian catastrophe , while the world stands by , up to now unwilling to intervene . 
( If chemical weapons are deployed , intervention will become inevitable . ) 
Although intervention would be temporary and technically limited , everyone seems to be avoiding it , because the stakes are very high : not only a devastating civil war and massive human suffering , but also a new order for the whole of the Middle East . 
Any military intervention would entail a confrontation not only with the Syrian military ( supported by Russia and China ) , but also with Shia Iran and its Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah . 
Moreover , no one can guarantee that intervention would not quickly lead to another war with Israel . 
The dangers of both action and inaction are very high . 
The most likely outcome in Syria is that the human catastrophe will continue until President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime collapses , after which the country very likely could be divided along ethnic and religious lines . 
And Syria &apos;s disintegration could further balkanize the Middle East , potentially unleashing new violence . 
Frontline states like Lebanon , Iraq , and Jordan will not manage to remain aloof from a disintegrating Syria . 
What will happen with Syria &apos;s Kurds and Palestinians , or its Christians , Druze , and smaller Muslim minorities ? 
And what about the Alawites ( the backbone of Assad &apos;s regime ) , who could face a terrible destiny , regardless of whether the country splits up ? 
Unanswered questions abound . 
Of course , even in the face of this misery , we should not lose hope in agreements reached by diplomatic means ; but , realistically , the chances are dwindling every day . 
The whole of the Middle East is in motion , and a new and stable order will take a long time to establish . 
Until then , the region will remain very dangerous , not only internally , but also for its neighbors ( including Europe ) and the world .
