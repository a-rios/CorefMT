Silicon Valley or Demand Mountain ? 
BELLEVUE , WASHINGTON - Everyone wants to know how to build the next Silicon Valley : an innovation hub that draws talent and capital , and that creates jobs , companies , and whole new industries . 
Developed-country governments scramble to subsidize technology that could be the Next Big Thing . 
Emerging-market policymakers hope that incentives like tax breaks and free land will induce innovators to settle and prosper there . 
But most of these well-meaning schemes are missing an essential ingredient : demand . 
Demand for innovation in specific areas of technology has been the common force behind all high-tech hot spots , as well as the most important inventions . 
Technological breakthroughs such as antibiotics and cars responded to a compelling need felt by a huge number of consumers . 
Government projects such as the United States &quot; Apollo program - intended to put a man on the moon - drove demand for more basic technologies ( which are simply inventions that no one has asked for yet ) . 
Silicon Valley itself was built on demand . 
The US Department of Defense put up tens of billions of dollars in contracts for microelectronics , a commitment that both paid down innovators &quot; risk and created an infrastructure that would support the growth of start-ups . 
All demand is not created equal , though , and it is instructive to examine the differences . 
Consumer or market-driven demand - the kind most of us think of when we hear the word - is far less predictable , and therefore much riskier , than state-sponsored demand of the sort that landed a man on the moon . 
Companies that depend solely on their products &quot; commercial appeal are limited in the kinds of innovations that they can safely introduce , because if one of their products fails in the marketplace , they may not survive to build another one . 
This is especially true of start-ups and small companies - the very players that everyone hopes will show up in the next-wave of Silicon Valleys . 
Fortunately , by sponsoring long-term , targeted initiatives , governments can stimulate more predictable demand . 
The Apollo program gave innovators clearly defined goals and a roadmap for getting there : first put animals in orbit , then put people there , then send probes to the moon , then send people there . 
Equally important , the government offered rewards for interim progress , not just ultimate success . 
Putting a monkey in space may not have been the most exciting achievement , but the government was paying for it , so it happened . 
A smart government creates guaranteed demand not only for the solution itself , but for the steps along the way . 
Coupling intermediate technical milestones with guaranteed incentives enables companies to focus on problems that might take ten years or more to solve . 
It also motivates innovators from a variety of industries to take on complex problems that must be addressed by more than one kind of invention . 
The US Defense Department &apos;s microelectronics initiative required not only new materials and circuits , but also new methods of fabrication . 
Because of the reward structure , these efforts could be coordinated , rather than pursued in isolation . 
Unlike market-driven demand , which too often results in a winner-takes-all dynamic , state-sponsored demand creates an environment in which multiple solutions to technical problems can proliferate and coexist . 
The pioneers of microelectronics tried many strategies to supplant vacuum tubes , and they delivered a host of semiconductors and chip designs : germanium , silicon , aluminum , gallium arsenide , PNP , NPN , CMOS , and so on . 
Some of these research efforts were never implemented , but many found their way into specialized devices . 
The diversity of options allowed widespread adoption , paving the way for the digital revolution . 
As with the microelectronics program , government incentives don &apos;t have to line the road all the way to commercial success . 
At some point , companies will be ready to sell products , and market demand can take over . 
The US Department of Defense was the only customer for integrated circuits in 1962 , but by the end of the decade consumers were buying transistor radios and pocket calculators in droves . 
Likewise , state-sponsored demand should not take the form of subsidies to specific technologies or companies ; the government has no business gambling taxpayer money on particular ventures . 
Assuming that risk is the job of venture capitalists and others in finance , not public officials . 
But there is little risk in offering a contract for a job well done : there is no payout if the problem remains unsolved . 
And those payouts are modest compared to the research and development efforts they stimulate . 
A program offering rewards of $ 1-5 billion in contracts or deployment commitments can generate many times that value in private-sector R D. Innovators and their investors are willing to bet big on these opportunities , because they know that the eventual reward in revenue from a global customer base will far exceed the initial investment . 
That makes state-sponsored demand a very efficient mechanism for generating innovation . 
Because of the multiplier effect , small governments and states , and even large cities , can successfully sponsor the kind of demand that fosters a world-class innovation epicenter . 
Certain Scandinavian countries , Chinese provinces , and the city-state of Singapore , for example , are ideally positioned to try this approach . 
Some years ago , I calculated how many units of product need to be sold to launch a technology . 
The number is actually quite modest : If you can move between 100,000 and one million units of a disruptive product , you can establish the technology standards for that category and in time become the global leader of a new industry . 
Government sponsorship ensures that a certain number of people will adopt your product . 
At the start , it need not be that many . 
The economic planners and policymakers who are chasing Silicon Valley &apos;s taillights are learning that they cannot always replicate the entrepreneurial culture and finance mechanisms that flourish there now . 
But they have forgotten how it all started : guaranteed demand , which stimulates the most ambitious kind of innovation . 
The lesson is a simple one : Don &apos;t try to build another Silicon Valley . 
Instead , build a Demand Mountain , and the innovators will come .
