Arab Fathers and Sons 
The problem of succession in the Arab secular republics highlights their predicament in the transition to a post-revolutionary phase , for succession in regimes that fail to build strong institutions always risks triggering a systemic crisis . 
While the decision by some in favor of dynastic succession may be lacking in democracy , it is not entirely devoid of merit . 
Arguably , it is a choice for economic modernization , for an end to the politics of conflict , and for positive political change further down the road . 
Years of Western-backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of a liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes , and turned any abrupt move to free elections into a dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy . 
A democracy that produces governments led by Hamas , Hezbollah , or the Muslim Brotherhood is inevitably bound to be anti-Western and opposed to an American-inspired &quot; peace process &quot; with Israel . 
Syria has already sought to assure regime continuity through quasi-monarchic hereditary succession with the move from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar . 
There are indications that Egypt might follow suit , with Hosni Mubarak &apos;s son , Gamal , taking over . 
Likewise , Libya &apos;s Muammar Khaddafi may be succeeded by his son , Seif el Islam . 
As products of revolutionary military takeovers , these secular nationalist regimes failed to produce genuine popular legitimacy and have had to fall back on the dynastic succession practiced by the regimes they toppled . 
The centrality of hereditary succession in the quest for peace and stability was shown by Hafez al-Assad when he agreed to unprecedented good will gestures aimed at drawing Ehud Barak &apos;s Israeli government into a peace deal . 
An old and sick man who was to die a few months later , he acted with a sense of urgency to reach a deal that would relieve his inexperienced son of the burden of struggling for the recovery of the Golan Heights . 
Bashar Assad remains essentially loyal to his father &apos;s legacy . 
Not unlike North Korea &apos;s and Iran &apos;s defiant nuclear policies , Bashar &apos;s membership in the region &apos;s &quot; axis of evil &quot; is a call for dialogue with America , not an invitation to an invasion , and for a settlement with Israel , not a drive to wage war on it . 
In Egypt , Mubarak turned his back on the lofty rhetoric of Gamal Abdel-Nasser &apos;s revolution and its grand strategic designs . 
Stability is at the heart of his thinking . 
Hence , he could not accept America &apos;s awkward pro-democracy agenda . 
But he was more than willing to occupy center stage in Arab diplomacy &apos;s support of the Annapolis peace conference . 
After all , the passion that the Palestinians &quot; plight evokes among ordinary Egyptians is a dangerous source of instability . 
Mubarak &apos;s succession is being conducted in an especially sophisticated manner . 
His son &apos;s ascension , unlike that of Bashar on the eve of his father &apos;s death , is anything but settled . 
But , by being allowed to acquire popular legitimacy and a high degree of acceptance within the political establishment as the driving force behind the ruling party &apos;s preparations for the post-Mubarak era , Gamal is being positioned strategically to compete effectively for the presidency . 
He is widely credited for setting the country &apos;s agenda , and for being the motor behind the liberal economic reforms that since 2004 have meant a qualitative leap in the Egyptian economy . 
It may be , as President Mubarak &apos;s critics argue , that the faltering progress of democratization reflects the attempt to block all potential challengers to Gamal . 
But , with the decline of secular nationalism and Islamism &apos;s rise , the hidden electoral power of the Muslim Brotherhood poses a mortal threat to the regime and its strategic alliance with the West . 
As a result , the regime refuses to take any chances . 
Nor was Muammar Khaddafi &apos;s decision to stop being an international pariah entirely unrelated to his concern to bequeath to his son a state that lives in peace with the world . 
His abysmal human rights record remains , but the flamboyant &quot; Guide of the Revolution &quot; ceased flirting with weapons of mass destruction and global terrorism in exchange for the end of sanctions and international rehabilitation . 
A sick man whose rule at home is being challenged by Islamist opponents , he decided that international ostracism and domestic troubles is too explosive a combination for his son , a spoiled playboy , to handle . 
Algeria is an especially difficult case . 
The last of the revolutionary generation , President Abdulaziz Buteflika must still conceive a succession that ends his country &apos;s civil war . 
Fully-fledged democracy might lead to victory for Islamists , as it did in 1991 . 
A transition to democracy in the old revolutionary Arab regimes will not correspond to a Western model , nor can it be imposed by American F-16 &quot; s . 
But , as countries like Egypt , Syria , and Lybia might be indicating , hereditary succession is not an inherently reactionary move . 
Rather , it means opting for a controlled transition to a post-revolutionary phase in which economic modernization and international integration might usher in greater political change in the future .
