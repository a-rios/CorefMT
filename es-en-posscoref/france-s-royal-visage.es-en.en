France &apos;s Royal Visage 
Ségolenè Royal has surged to the front of the pack of Socialists who aim to succeed Jacques Chirac as President of France . 
Nobody would have bet a single euro on such a prospect a few months ago . 
Until recently , Royal - who now is merely the head of one France &apos;s 22 regional governments - was best known as the non-married partner of François Hollande , the Socialist Party leader . 
Yet , according to the polls , she is the only left-leaning candidate who looks able to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy , the current Interior Minister and odds-on favorite to be the center-right &apos;s standard bearer in the presidential election next May . 
How did Royal rise so far and so fast ? 
One reason is that she is the only fresh face among those Socialists vying for the party nomination . 
Laurent Fabius , Martine Aubry , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , Jack Lang , and even Hollande are all former senior ministers who neutralized each other , while Lionel Jospin , the former Prime Minister , decided to put an end to his political career after his defeat in 2002 . 
Each of them has strengths and weaknesses , but none seems able to challenge Sarkozy . 
Indeed , confronted with her lead , both Jospin and Hollande have dropped out of the race . 
So there was a vacuum to fill , accompanied by a strong desire among the party faithful for revival . 
Royal &apos;s chief virtue is that she has not taken part in the numerous internal battles that infuriate socialist militants and voters , and her lack of direct association with the party &apos;s leadership has enabled her to avoid blame for its mistakes . 
That is why , far from being a disadvantage , her peripheral position is one of her main assets . 
She has slim and politically minor ministerial experience - Environment Minister in 1992-1993 , Deputy Minister for Secondary Education in 1997-2000 , and Minister for Family Affairs in 2000-2002 - and has drawn attention mainly for her work on subjects related to daily problems , such as kids &quot; TV programs and mistreatment in schools . 
That is why people tend to view her as a sincere politician , rather than one concerned only about personal ambition . 
On security issues and education , Royal differs from the classical left , being something of a hardliner . 
This , too , is an advantage in a country where security is the top priority for most people nowadays . 
A mother of four children who proclaims to believe in traditional family values , she is attractive to right-wing voters , while her non-matrimonial relationship with Hollande makes her seem a quintessentially modern woman . 
Moreover , being a woman is a great asset . 
When disturbed by a question , she usually replies , &quot; Would you have asked the same question to a man ? &quot; 
Ever since Laurent Fabius took a hit in the polls when he mocked her candidacy by asking , &quot; Who will mind the children ? , &quot; her opponents have feared appearing misogynous when attacking her , and when they do criticize her , she immediately assumes the pose of innocent victim , unfairly bashed by schoolboy bullies . 
As a political tactician , she has also been innovative , organizing her campaign on the Internet with a plan to write her program from the responses of users . 
Her motto , &quot; My program is yours , &quot; could prove popular with citizens who , as in many other democracies , do not trust their political elite . 
Even though , like the majority of France &apos;s political class , she was educated at Ecole Nationale d &apos;Administration ( ENA ) , she spurns the language and habits of this elite factory . 
Last but not least , she is attractive . 
Photos of her in a swimming suit , taken by paparazzi during the summer , triggered much discussion across France . 
But the game is not over . 
The Socialist will decide on November 17th who will be their candidate . 
Trailing her in opinion polls , the other contenders cite her lack of credibility on economic policy and international relations . 
No one knows her opinion on the Middle East , terrorism , nuclear deterrence , and international security . 
During the recent Lebanon war , she called for Bill Clinton &apos;s intervention - an insufficient answer for many people . 
Royal &apos;s lack of program has been her strength , but it could yet be her undoing . 
Eventually , she will be obliged to abandon her studied ambiguity , and she will probably pay a price for doing so . 
Few voters will support someone whose political program is based only on education and defense of the family . 
Some Socialists fear that , once nominated , she would not be able to confront Sarkozy in direct debates . 
Moreover , opinion polls in France are fickle omens . 
Since 1981 , no poll favorite has won the presidency . 
According to the polls , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , not François Mitterrand , should have been elected in 1981 . 
In 1988 , just months before the election , Raymond Barre ( a former Prime Minister ) was the arch-favorite , but did not even qualify for the second-round run-off . 
A few weeks before the election in 1995 , Jacques Chirac looked so weak that a journalist bluntly asked him on live TV whether it would not be better for him to give up . 
But Royal is confident in her fate . 
She is far from being a weak contender , and she is a fast learner with a strong campaign team . 
If she can strengthen her program on foreign policy , she may yet open a new chapter in French political history .
