China &apos;s Green Drivers 
BEIJING - Earlier this month , China &apos;s government announced another bold move to ease traffic congestion and reduce carbon emissions : the authorities want 60 % of all motor-vehicle use in towns and cities to be public transportation , and the government in Beijing is urging regional governments to use more zero-emission and alternative-energy vehicles . 
China continues to be the top market for gas-powered vehicles , but it is increasingly clear that its government intends to lead the world in clean-energy vehicles . 
The Renault-Nissan Alliance will support China &apos;s ambition . 
Nissan entered China in 2003 , when Chinese consumers bought 4.5 million cars . 
Skeptics said that Nissan was &quot; late to the game &quot; in China : the Chinese car market was supposedly fully saturated . 
Back then , the world &apos;s top automotive market was the United States , with Americans buying more than 16 million cars and trucks . 
What a difference a decade makes : In 2012 , Chinese consumers purchased an estimated 18 million new cars , a 300 % increase . 
Growth in the Chinese auto sector has silenced the skeptics and exceeded even the most bullish expectations of third-party observers . 
Now the world &apos;s biggest car market has declared a new goal : China wants to have the largest number of clean cars . 
In April , the State Council , China &apos;s highest administrative authority , unveiled targets aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of the country &apos;s cars . 
The State Council wants to produce 500,000 new-energy vehicles - including electric vehicles ( EV ) , plug-in hybrid electric vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles - by 2015 , and is aiming for a production capacity of two million EVs per year by 2020 . 
Ultimately , China wants a total of five million EVs on the country &apos;s roads , powered by an estimated 10,000 charging stations , by 2020 . 
As in 2003 , some observers say that China &apos;s goals are overly ambitious , because the clean-car market will not grow so quickly . 
But China may silence the skeptics once again . 
In 2011 , the Chinese government earmarked $ 1.5 billion annually for the industry for the next 10 years , hoping to transform the country into one of the leading producers of zero-emission vehicles . 
While China &apos;s aim is to promote domestically produced vehicles , all of the world &apos;s major car manufacturers are working together - and with local partners - to roll out their own EV models and gain leadership in the Chinese market . 
China has no choice but to move toward zero-emission cars . 
The country relies on coal for about 70 % of its energy needs . 
In 2011 , China &apos;s energy consumption climbed 9.7 % , reaching 3.7 billion metric tons of standard coal equivalent - the fastest growth rate since 2007 . 
China is not only the world &apos;s largest consumer of coal , but also is second only to the US in oil imports - more than five million barrels of oil per dayin 2011 , from Saudi Arabia , Angola , Iran , Russia , and other producers . 
Reliance on coal and oil has made China the world &apos;s largest source of carbon emissions , and has eroded the quality of life for Chinese citizens . 
Indeed , 16 of the world &apos;s 20 worst cities for air pollution are in China . 
In 2012 , the China Medical Association warned that air pollution could become the country &apos;s biggest health threat , owing to rising rates of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease - particularly in the country &apos;s megacities . 
As a result , the Chinese government is taking bold steps to move beyond fossil fuels . 
In August , China committed about $ 290 billion to clean-energy projects . 
The authorities want renewable energy to account for one-fifth of its total energy demand by 2015 . 
China can now generate 6.2 gigawatts of solar power and 68.3 gigawatts of wind power - the equivalent of 50 coal-fired power plants - and has nine of the world &apos;s top ten solar-energy companies , which together produce 65 % of the world &apos;s photovoltaic panels . 
At the same time , China is implementing stricter fuel-efficiency standards than the United States and many other countries . 
For example , the authorities have imposed a 12 % tax on gas-guzzlers . 
Moreover , China offers incentives of about $ 8,000 for the purchase of EVs . 
This is one of the highest such subsidies in the world , attesting to the authorities &quot; seriousness about encouraging consumers and fleet owners to switch . 
China is also replacing government fleets with EVs . 
The city of Shenzhen , in China &apos;s Pearl River Valley , has 2,350 EVs in its municipal fleet . 
China is encouraging the use of zero-emission EVs because they are &quot; energy agnostic &quot; - that is , they can consume any kind of fuel that is already in the national grid &apos;s mix , including the growing amount of renewable energy . 
So , as China rapidly develops solar power , China &apos;s EVs will become , in essence , solar cars - and wind and hydro cars as those energy sources increase as well . 
When electric cars penetrate the market , they will significantly reduce urban smog . The State Council estimates that achieving the targets for EVs will lower China &apos;s greenhouse-gas emissions by 19 % while reducing the country &apos;s reliance on imported oil - both of which are key national policy goals . 
China is investing in its future by challenging both its citizens and the auto industry to evolve beyond the internal combustible engine . 
The Renault-Nissan Alliance has accepted that challenge , and looks forward to helping the world &apos;s biggest car market become one of the cleanest car markets as well .
