Soft Power and the Struggle Against Terrorism 
Last year , at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , George Carey , the former Archbishop of Canterbury , asked Secretary of State Colin Powell why the United States seemed to focus only on its hard power rather than its soft power . 
Secretary Powell replied that the US had used hard power to win World War II , but he continued : &quot; What followed immediately after hard power ? 
Did the US ask for dominion over a single nation in Europe ? 
No . 
Soft power came in the Marshall Plan Â¼ .We did the same thing in Japan . &quot; 
After the war in Iraq ended , I spoke about soft power ( a concept I developed ) to a conference co-sponsored by the US Army in Washington . 
One speaker was Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld . 
According to a press account , &quot; the top military brass listened sympathetically , &quot; but when someone asked Rumsfeld for his opinion on soft power , he replied , &quot; I don &apos;t know what it means . &quot; 
One of Rumsfeld &apos;s &quot; rules &quot; is that &quot; weakness is provocative . &quot; 
He is correct , up to a point . 
As Osama bin Laden observed , people like a strong horse . 
But power , defined as the ability to influence others , comes in many guises , and soft power is not weakness . 
On the contrary , it is the failure to use soft power effectively that weakens America in the struggle against terrorism . 
Soft power is the ability to get what one wants by attracting others rather than threatening or paying them . 
It is based on culture , political ideals , and policies . 
When you persuade others to want what you want , you do not have to spend as much on sticks and carrots to move them in your direction . 
Hard power , which relies on coercion , grows out of military and economic might . 
It remains crucial in a world populated by threatening states and terrorist organizations . 
But soft power will become increasingly important in preventing terrorists from recruiting new supporters , and for obtaining the international cooperation necessary for countering terrorism . 
The US is more powerful than any country since the Roman Empire , but like Rome , America is neither invincible nor invulnerable . 
Rome did not succumb to the rise of another empire , but to the onslaught of waves of barbarians . 
Modern high-tech terrorists are the new barbarians . 
The US cannot alone hunt down every suspected Al Qaeda leader . 
Nor can it launch a war whenever it wishes without alienating other countries . 
The four-week war in Iraq was a dazzling display of America &apos;s hard military power that removed a vicious tyrant . 
But it did not remove America &apos;s vulnerability to terrorism . 
It was also costly in terms of our soft power to attract others . 
In the aftermath of the war , polls showed a dramatic decline in the popularity of the US even in countries like Britain , Spain , and Italy , whose governments supported the war . 
America &apos;s standing plummeted in Islamic countries , whose support is needed to help track the flow of terrorists , tainted money , and dangerous weapons . 
The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations - Islam versus the West - but a civil war within Islamic civilization between extremists who use violence to enforce their vision and a moderate majority who want things like jobs , education , health care , and dignity as they pursue their faith . 
America will not win unless the moderates win . 
American soft power will never attract Osama bin Laden and the extremists . 
Only hard power can deal with them . 
But soft power will play a crucial role in attracting moderates and denying the extremists new recruits . 
During the Cold War , the West &apos;s strategy of containment combined the hard power of military deterrence with the soft power of attracting people behind the Iron Curtain . 
Behind the wall of military containment , the West ate away Soviet self-confidence with broadcasts , student and cultural exchanges , and the success of capitalist economics . 
As a former KGB official later testified , &quot; Exchanges were a Trojan horse for the Soviet Union . 
They played a tremendous role in the erosion of the Soviet system . &quot; 
In retirement , President Dwight Eisenhower said that he should have taken money out of the defense budget to strengthen the US Information Agency . 
With the Cold War &apos;s end , Americans became more interested in budget savings than in investing in soft power . 
In 2003 , a bipartisan advisory group reported that the US was spending only $ 150 million on public diplomacy in Muslim countries , an amount it called grossly inadequate . 
Indeed , the combined cost for the State Department &apos;s public diplomacy programs and all of America &apos;s international broadcasting is just over $ 1 billion , about the same amount spent by Britain or France , countries that are one-fifth America &apos;s size and whose military budgets are only 25 % as large . 
No one would suggest that America spend as much to launch ideas as to launch bombs , but it does seem odd that the US spends 400 times as much on hard power as on soft power . 
If the US spent just 1 % of the military budget on soft power , it would quadruple its current spending on this key component of the war on terrorism . 
If America is to win that war , its leaders are going to have to do better at combining soft and hard power into &quot; smart power . &quot;
