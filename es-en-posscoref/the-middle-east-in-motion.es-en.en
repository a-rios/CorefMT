The Middle East in Motion 
BERLIN - Great speeches are all too often underestimated as being mere words . 
In fact , they can have powerful consequences . 
This is obviously the case with President Barack Obama &apos;s recent address to the Muslim world in Cairo , because - mere coincidence or excellent timing ? - things in the Middle East have been in flux ever since . 
Since Obama &apos;s Cairo speech , there have been elections in Lebanon where , surprisingly , the alliance of pro-Western parties scored a clear victory against Hezbollah and its allies . 
Also noteworthy in that election is that the losing side immediately accepted defeat and that Syria is now obviously serious about building a new rapport with Lebanon . 
Iran &apos;s recent &quot; election &quot; saw blatant manipulation in favor of the incumbent president incite a democratic mass uprising . 
One is astonished by the fact that Iran &apos;s government did not opt for transparency immediately , by promptly and comprehensively providing the facts about the voting , facts that it alone possesses . 
After all , if President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has genuinely won by a margin of 2 : 1 , there is nothing to fear . 
What is happening , however , is precisely the opposite , and for this there is only one explanation : the election was rigged . 
The election fraud in Iran has caused a mass movement in the country &apos;s cities , which - this much is clear even now - will fundamentally change the country . 
Indeed , either the regime will resort to brute force to suppress the protests , thus abandoning any pretense of democratic legitimacy in favor of de facto military dictatorship , or it will find it impossible to beat the subversive genie of democracy back into its bottle , and Iran will increasingly open up and reform itself . 
In the case of violent suppression , the West will find it a lot harder to hold talks with Iran over its nuclear program , because the regime will be able to rely for its survival solely on isolation and confrontation with the outside world . 
Moreover , talks with the regime would give rise to substantial legitimacy problems in the West . 
The Islamic Republic will not be able to get away with the Chinese option - to combine political suppression at home with economic reform and greater openness to the outside world - because its structures are too weak and brittle for this . 
Indeed , aside from matters of domestic policy and the issue of internal freedom , the choice between the major candidates hinges on the question of whether Iran should seek greater international integration . 
Ahmadinejad stands for a policy of confrontation and partial isolation ; 
A policy of opening the country would therefore quickly put the regime &apos;s existence at risk . 
If Ahmadinejad prevails , the dilemma for the West will be that it will have to deal with a regime discredited by election fraud , but still indispensable for resolving almost all of the Middle East &apos;s important problems : Iran &apos;s own nuclear program and the conflicts in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine . 
Iran is also a key player in cooling the hot spots in the Caucasus and Central Asia . 
A regime in Tehran that must demonstrate external strength to survive its shattered legitimacy at home would therefore make the comprehensive , negotiated settlement that the West seeks much more difficult and risky , if not impossible , to achieve . 
Things have also started to move in a third area : the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians . 
Obama wants a two-state solution , but , unlike Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , he hasn &apos;t postponed tackling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict until the end of his second term in office . 
Instead , Obama has energetically confronted the issue from the start . 
He also doesn &apos;t shy away from a limited conflict with Israel &apos;s government concerning the West Bank settlements . 
The conditions for serious negotiations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , however , are anything but good , owing to a lack of partners on both sides . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now committed himself to a Palestinian state , and the Hamas leadership , which rejects Israel &apos;s right to exist , has agreed to a Palestinian state within the borders prior to June 5 , 1967 . 
But the provisos that each side would demand of the other put into question the sincerity of their commitment to a two-state solution . 
Yet only a government of the Israeli right can end the expansion of the settlements , and only Hamas can stop the violence against Israel . 
These two questions - settlements and security - will have to be simultaneously resolved in a practical manner if the peace process is to be restarted . 
If Obama wants to make serious progress in this conflict , he will have to get the Netanyahu government and Hamas to negotiate . 
This may seem impossible from today &apos;s perspective , but appearances can deceive . 
Such negotiations will be possible if and when both sides - Israel and the Palestinians - form governments of national unity . 
Today &apos;s flux in the Middle East is a highly ambivalent affair , because the situation can improve or ( more likely ) deteriorate . 
But one thing is certain : if the present impasse continues , the situation will only get worse . 
So it is right to take the risks that change requires .
