Beware of Symbols 
Argentina &apos;s crisis has been heating up for a long time . 
So long has the country been in crisis , indeed , that the question is no longer if it may boil over , but when . 
The origins of Argentina &apos;s crisis date back to decisions taken in 1991 , in the fight to contain the steep inflation that marked the death throes of the military junta . 
In that year , Domingo Cavallo , who already held the post of Secretary of the Treasury , took the highly symbolic decision to fix the value of the peso to the dollar through a fixed exchange rate . 
Moreover , he executed this decision in another highly symbolic way , by setting the rate of exchange at one peso for one dollar . 
As symbolism , this was fine . 
The new &quot; hard &quot; peso marked the end of Argentina &apos;s inflationary era , a time when the country showed itself , time and again , as incapable of controlling either its budget , its currency , its inflation or its exchange rate . 
This was to be the beginning of a new era , one in which a responsible , modern Argentina opened itself in a disciplined way to the United States and the world . 
But , as the ancient Greeks taught , the gods destroy by granting us our wishes or fulfilling them too completely . 
Without any doubt , Argentina &apos;s currency reform of a decade ago forms the roots of today &apos;s crisis . 
The reason is almost obvious : Argentina is not the United States , and the peso is not the dollar . 
Argentina is a little economy of the Southern hemisphere ; the US is a large and diversified economy of the Northern hemisphere . 
Argentina exports cows and raw materials ; 
America exports high tech and services . 
Argentina trades with Brazil , America with Japan . 
Argentina must struggle to attract capital ; 
America sucks in capital from all over the world . 
For the two countries to have the same exchange rate is a crime against logic ; it proved itself also a crime against Argentina . 
Until 1999 , everything seemed to prove Domingo Cavallo right . 
Argentina &apos;s growth was fast , its inflation disappeared fast , too . 
Then , the inevitable boomerang occurred : a bitter combination of shocks shattered Argentina &apos;s growth : Brazil devalued its currency , the Real , by around 50 % ; the cost of raw materials , prime Argentine exports , fell sharply . 
All this , while the dollar was appreciating briskly , reflecting the boom of America &apos;s Clinton years . 
That combination was lethal . 
De facto , since 1999 , growth has been negligible and Argentina has endured a thorough crisis . 
This current financial crisis , which now dominates everything in Argentina , is more recent and almost tangential . 
Under the influence of the recession , the budget deficit has ballooned and the creditors of Argentina &apos;s government have concluded that they would not get their money back . 
In reality , the budgetary situation is not so bad : despite today &apos;s recession , Argentina &apos;s budget deficit , save for interest payments , is only about 1 % of GDP . 
The national debt-GDP ratio is less than 60 % , which is the average within the European Union . 
Signor Cavallo , who returned to the Treasury Department in order to save his baby , is right when he asserts that the budgetary problems are simply not as awful as many people believe . 
But Argentina &apos;s creditors , fearful of default , are demanding interest rates so high ( around 50 % today ) that there is no hope that the government can borrow at such rates . 
So default no longer seems a question of &quot; If &quot; but of &quot; When . &quot; 
This financial crisis will probably mark the end of the Cavallo experiment , which was promoted around the world . 
But the main crisis still ahead for Argentina is the economic one , which itself has lasted since 1999 . 
Finding a route out of it will not be easy , for no escape seems obvious : Argentina &apos;s debt is now expressed in dollars and , as in Asia in 1997 , a devaluation will increase the weight of the debt . 
Argentina now has just as good a chance to make things worse as to make them better . 
In economics ( as in most other fields of human existence ) , it is better to beware of symbols .
