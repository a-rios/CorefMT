Russia \ u0027s Culture of Contempt 
Once again , everyone wants to know , where is Russia heading ? 
The trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the possible bankruptcy of his company Yukos , Russia &apos;s biggest company , have incited cries that President Putin is returning the country to the bad old days of dictatorship . 
But in assessing where Russia is heading , political and economic analysis are of little help . 
It is Russia &apos;s social culture that is determining the country &apos;s fate . 
Russia &apos;s political system , indeed , is not what prevents the country from moving forward , and it never has been . 
Whether Russians live under monarchy , communism , Yeltsin &apos;s cowboy market economy or Putin &apos;s supposed dictatorship of law , the result is always the same - the system despises its citizens , eliciting an equal and opposite reaction of derision and distrust . 
Russian capitalism hates the consumer as much as Russian communism did . 
Russia &apos;s people , whether they are waiters or waiting for service , are convinced that they will be ripped off and treated rudely , and so steel themselves with indifference . 
Neither the system nor the people are to blame for this state of affairs . 
It arises partly from the fact that Russia is an &quot; imitation &quot; culture . 
Russia &apos;s first rulers were Nordic princes in the 860 &apos;s , men invited to bring order to the country - even then , or so it seems , Russians didn &apos;t trust themselves to rule themselves effectively . 
Sometimes , Russian imitation produces works of genius . 
After all , Pushkin and Gogol originally grew out of German and French models , although their sheer originality left the mimicry far behind . 
But Russia is simply not as good at copying practical things like laws and economic models as it is at transforming cultural impulses into works of art with a Russian soul . 
Its practical borrowings are invariably stillborn , mostly because of the country &apos;s ingrained culture of contempt . 
Consider Moscow , a highly seasoned imitator ( though nowhere in the league of St. Petersburg , that baroque Italianate city on the Neva , as an urban mimic ) . 
Moscow nowadays has all the trappings of high-end capitalism : Prada , Fouchon , Rolls Royce . 
Its Caf√© des Artistes is as wonderful a French bistro as you will find . 
But something is missing in the usual Russian way - proper utensils . 
Ask a waiter for a steak knife and you will draw a look that suggests you &apos;ve asked for a sword . 
Some restaurants greet their customers with a guard who brusquely asks what they want , as if they came to buy stamps , not to have dinner . 
Of course , the guards know that their job is to ensure that everyone is safe and comfortable , but the Gulag-type notion of what a guard does is too embedded to be removed . 
Their real job is to be &quot; against &quot; - and this time , it is the customers they are to be against . 
The very existence of other people breeds suspicion in Russian guards , and who is to say that they are completely wrong ? 
After all , contract killings and random shootings in restaurants are common affairs , and the idea of excessive protection from everyone goes back to Soviet days , when social contempt was cloaked in the guise of public safety . 
Small wonder , then , that Russians always cut corners , jump over fences , and never follow a path designated for walking - these paths were built not to make life easier for people , but to control them . 
Indeed , fences and barriers in Russia are usually built where there should be a footpath . 
But perhaps the authorities are right to want to keep us in line . 
Anyone who has ever flown into Russia will know this scene : the moment the captain requests the passengers to remain seated until the plane comes to a complete stop , all the Russians on board will respond by immediately standing up and piling into the aisles as if it &apos;s their last chance to get out . 
They know in their bones that the system is out to get them , even if the system is represented by a commercial airliner from a foreign country . 
The simplest things are complicated , and then destroyed , by this culture of suspicion and contempt . 
I once went for lunch to a Swedish-style buffet in Moscow . 
The choice of food was great , a sort of post-modern typical Russian kasha : sushi , salad , borsht , meat , and cabbage . 
But customers received only a small saucer for this feast , and the principle of the smorgasbord - all you can eat - was jettisoned . 
You were allowed to use the buffet only once . 
Customers - who know what a smorgasbord is - understandably try to stuff as much food as they can onto the tiny saucer , sushi on top of roast beef . 
If you dare to ask for a bigger plate or an extra helping , the waitress gives you that withering Soviet look - you want too much . 
Soviet socialism thought its citizens unworthy of any form of service altogether ; 
In the end , there is very little difference . 
And so Russia goes on , undertaking revolutionary changes and not changing at all . 
Incurable suspicion , mutual fear , ubiquitous contempt - confirmed everyday in large and small ways - are our immutable social condition .
