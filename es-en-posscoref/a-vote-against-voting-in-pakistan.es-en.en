A Vote against Voting in Pakistan 
ISLAMABAD  -  
As Pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on February 18 , many observers hope that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government . 
But sometimes democracy is best served by refusing to participate . 
The upcoming election , to be held under the illegal Provisional Constitutional Order ( PCO ) implemented following President Pervez Musharraf &apos;s state of emergency on November 3 , is such a case , which is why my party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote . 
To be sure , contesting the election would provide my party with a great opportunity to take issues to the people . 
In fact , my party &apos;s support has been growing , with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most popular in the frontier province - and gaining ground in every other province . 
But elections by themselves don &apos;t bring democracy . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s president , Robert Mugabe , loves elections . 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been holding elections for 27 years . 
Uzbekistan &apos;s Islam Karimov has been in power for 30 years , and has just been &quot; elected &quot; to a fresh seven-year presidential term . 
Elections are meaningful only if they are perceived to be free and fair , which requires independent referees . 
When my party started eleven years ago , we called ourselves the Movement For Justice . 
We demanded an independent judiciary , because we believed that democracy and prosperity are impossible without the rule of law , and that the rule of law requires a judiciary that can act as a constraint on the government . 
Having gone to university in western countries , we were inspired by the American system of check and balances . 
So it is a shock to us that the US State Department keeps talking about free and fair elections and abolishing the state of emergency , but without mentioning the reinstatement of the judges - including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - that Musharraf illegally dismissed . 
If the judges are not reinstated , how can there be free and fair elections ? 
Who decides what is free and fair ? 
Musharraf ? 
This is where the battle lines are now drawn , and where the future of the country will be decided . 
If the Chief Justice and the judges are reinstated , we can move toward a genuine democratic system . 
But if Musharraf manages to get his own PCO judges established in the country , then we will head toward a period of turmoil . 
After all , how can the party of a man who has less than 5 % support win the election now without rigging it ? 
Unfortunately , most of the political parties have failed to stand up for the democratic process . 
Major parties like the Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) have decided to participate , following the lead of the late Benazir Bhutto &apos;s People &apos;s Party . 
And , of all the major parties that are contesting the election , only the PMLN is demanding the reinstatement of the judges . 
Fortunately , the people of Pakistan - students , opinion makers , and , above all , lawyers - are standing up for the judges , doing the work that should have been done by political parties . 
We see lawyers marching , getting beaten up , filling the jails , and yet remaining resolute . 
They are suffering huge financial losses by boycotting the courts , and yet they are determined that the Chief Justice must be reinstated . 
So the dividing line in Pakistan is not between liberals and extremists , but between those who support the status quo and those who oppose it . 
Parties that call themselves democratic are not only going along with Musharraf in this fraudulent election , but are also helping to restore the status quo . 
The solution to dysfunctional democracy is not military dictatorship , but more democracy . 
Pakistanis understand democracy , because we have a democratic culture . 
Our founder was a great constitutionalist , and Pakistan came into being through the vote . 
The problem has been that because we have lacked an independent judiciary , we have not had an independent election commission . 
So all our elections , except for one in 1970 , have been rigged . 
India , with which Pakistan shares a similar background , went through 40 years of dysfunctional democracy with a one-party system . 
But in the last 16 years it has begun to reap the fruits of genuine democratic competition , because an independent judiciary and electoral commission gives people confidence that their vote can make a difference . 
Until we have the same in Pakistan , no election can be free and fair . 
For two and a half years , I supported Musharraf and believed his promises to bring genuine democracy to Pakistan . 
I &apos;ve learned my lesson about Musharraf . 
But , more importantly , no military dictator can succeed where Musharraf has so clearly failed . 
Winston Churchill once said , &quot; War is too serious a business for generals . &quot; 
The same is true of democracy .
