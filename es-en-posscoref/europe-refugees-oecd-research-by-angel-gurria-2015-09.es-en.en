We Should Not Be Afraid 
PARIS - Europe is facing an historic moment . 
The human cost of this refugee crisis is appalling . 
Yet , in all but a handful of cases , the response of Europe &apos;s governments has been tentative , at best : acknowledging the need to do more , while fearing the implications . 
Some politicians fear the burden that migrants will impose on local communities and taxpayers . 
Others fear extremists masquerading as genuine refugees . 
Above all , many are scared of public opinion , which - for all the heart-warming scenes of welcome and support for asylum-seekers - remains hesitant and even hostile to the prospect of still more migrants from war-torn , troubled countries , especially if they practice a different religion . 
European leaders cannot afford to be afraid . 
The refugee crisis is not one from which they can opt out . 
No magic wand will empower leaders to transport more than a million people back across the Aegean and the Bosphorus to Mosul and Aleppo , or across the Mediterranean to Eritrea , Somalia , and Sudan . 
The reintroduction of border controls and the construction of fences may buy time for over-stretched countries , but no one can seriously expect to keep out people who are so desperate to move . 
Given the dire conditions in the countries from which they are fleeing , perhaps half of the asylum-seekers will qualify for residency under even the strictest rules . 
So , whatever the sensitivity or ambivalence of public opinion , European leaders will have to find a bold , coordinated , and unified response . 
There are three challenges . 
The first is to agree on a fair allocation of refugees within Europe ; despite their vast numbers , these desperate people must be provided with shelter , food , and support . 
This will be difficult enough . 
The second challenge is to start the process of integrating refugees into Europe &apos;s societies and economies . 
Some refugees will find it relatively easy to find jobs . 
A university-educated Syrian civil engineer arriving in Munich will need to learn some German ; but , once this is done , he or she is unlikely to have to wait too long before employers come knocking . 
Other asylum-seekers have lower levels of education , and many may well be traumatized by their experience of war and exodus . 
It will take time and effort to integrate them - and many voters will be skeptical of the process , especially given that successful integration or assimilation will not come cheap . 
However , paying the price to accept and integrate today &apos;s asylum-seekers could reap significant benefits for the Europe of tomorrow . 
Our work at the OECD shows that migration , if well managed , can spur growth and innovation . 
Unfortunately , in the past , migration has not always been well managed : migrants have been concentrated in ghetto-like conditions , with few public services or employment prospects . 
Even so , the evidence from the OECD &apos;s 34 member countries is that immigrants generally pay more in taxes and social security contributions than they receive in individual benefits . 
Today , we &apos;ve released a policy brief on the current refugee crisis . 
Put simply , Europe needs migrants and the new skills they can bring . 
Otherwise , as its population falls , it will struggle to pay pensions and health-care costs in the future ( already in the decade to 2010 , immigration accounted for 65 % of the increase in the EU workforce ) . 
Many will argue that refugees who lack the skills that the economy demands will be harder to integrate than other newcomers . 
But , because we now know a great deal about what has worked in resettling migrants , we can hope to avoid the mistakes of the past - not least by documenting and sharing the experiences of the countries that have managed migration well . 
This brings us to the third , and greatest , challenge that European leaders have to overcome : the fear of migrants . 
Integration is a precondition for the public acceptance of future legal flows . 
The presumption is that &quot; we &quot; are integrated , whereas &quot; they &quot; are not . 
And yet almost everyone has a migrant somewhere in their family tree , often not many generations back . 
The distinction between &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them &quot; is not as sharp as we might assume . 
None of today &apos;s leaders expected to face a human tragedy on the scale of what we now see in the Mediterranean and across Europe . 
But how they respond will determine how they are judged by their citizens and by history . 
This is not a numbers game . 
Leaders should shift their attention from questions concerning &quot; how many &quot; and &quot; where &quot; to the &quot; what &quot; of the crisis - namely , what they should be doing to integrate these newcomers into their societies and economies . 
They must exercise their leadership to convince the public that migrants - above all , those most in need of protection - give more than they take . 
In this moment of crisis , we should all heed the words of the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes : &quot; Recognize yourself in he and she who are not like you and me . &quot;
