Unpopular Populism 
BOGOTÁ - In 2005 , during the fourth Summit of the Americas , the host , Argentine President Néstor Kirchner , along with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , scuppered US President George W. Bush &apos;s hopes for a free-trade area in the Americas . 
Though a free-trade area is no longer on the agenda when Latin America &apos;s current heads of state meet again in Panama on October 17-18 , the mood will undoubtedly be less hostile . 
But regional understanding will still be hard to achieve . 
Latin America in the first decade of this century was fertile ground for left-wing populism , especially in the eight member states of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA ) . 
ALBA leaders were typically authoritarians who raged against foreign imperialists , suppressed opposition at home , controlled or intimidated the media , overspent , and generally distrusted free markets and free trade . 
Today , with both Kirchner and Chávez out of the picture , that period of leftist populism is drawing to a close . 
Chávez &apos;s successor , Nicolás Maduro , lacks experience and influence in foreign affairs . 
Kirchner &apos;s successor , his widow Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , is struggling . 
She recently suffered a heavy defeat in her Peronist party &apos;s recent primaries , weakening its chances in the upcoming mid-term Congressional elections and undermining her authority during her remaining two years in office . 
In addition , she is now facing a legislative election in poor health , following surgery to remove a subdural hematoma in her brain . 
None of Latin America &apos;s other leftist leaders - including Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa , Bolivian President Evo Morales , and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega - has the charisma or international influence to fill the void . 
Moreover , weaker economic conditions , in the region and globally , will limit the scope for crowd-pleasing spending plans . 
After nearly a decade of rapid , export-led expansion , fueled by high commodity prices and foreign investment , average GDP growth in the region fell from more than 5 % annually during the boom years to 3.6 % in 2012 . 
As Guillermo Perry , former chief economist of the World Bank , succinctly put it : &quot; The party is over . &quot; 
Hopes that a US economic recovery will boost demand and investment in Latin America are likely to be dashed ; 
China &apos;s economic slowdown will also dampen prices for exports , including commodities . 
All of this implies that Latin American governments can no longer spend with little regard for the domestic saving rate . 
But the decline of the populist left does not necessarily mean the rise of the free-market right . Over the next 14 months , new governments will be elected in eight Latin American countries , starting with a probable victory for the center-left Michelle Bachelet in Chile &apos;s presidential election . 
Public-opinion polls show center-left parties leading in most of the region &apos;s other campaigns as well . Furthermore , a recent wave of social protest in Brazil , Chile , Mexico , and Colombia has been fueled by a new middle class whose members fear for their living standards , all but ruling out the implementation of fiscal discipline or policies that might lead to job losses in the short term . 
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos have already lost considerable popular support ; their re-election in 2014 is now far from certain . 
Public opinion will not be sympathetic to fiscal discipline or neoliberal orthodoxy . 
Latin American governments have been unimpressed with Barack Obama &apos;s failure to pass an immigration bill that would create a pathway to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US , many of whom are from Latin America . 
Meanwhile , Rousseff canceled a state visit to Washington in protest over the US National Security Agency &apos;s alleged spying on Brazilian political and business leaders , including Rousseff herself . 
Latin America in the twenty-first century is no longer the backyard of the US . 
Tensions have also risen following moves by Latin American governments to soften their anti-drug policies . 
Last July , for example , Uruguay &apos;s lower house of parliament passed a bill that would legalize the production , sale , and consumption of marijuana . 
If , as expected , the bill passes the Senate and is signed into law , it could derail the US-led decades-long effort to present a common front in support of prohibition . 
A return to neoliberal economics and a pro-US foreign policy in Latin America seems a long way off . 
But the region &apos;s conservatives can find consolation in the likelihood that the socialist demagogy of Chávez has lost both strength and popular sympathy .
