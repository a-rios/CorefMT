After the Millennium Development Goals 
CAMBRIDGE - In 2000 , 189 countries collectively adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration , which evolved into a set of concrete targets called the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
These ambitious targets - ranging from halving extreme poverty and reducing maternal mortality by three-quarters to achieving universal primary schooling and halting ( and beginning to reverse ) the spread of HIV / AIDS - are supposed to be met by the end of 2015 . 
As the deadline approaches , development experts are debating a new question : What comes next ? 
It is virtually certain that many of the MDGs will not have been met by the end of 2015 , but there have been striking successes in some areas . 
For example , the goal of halving extreme poverty ( measured by the number of people living on less than $ 1.25 a day ) will likely be achieved ahead of time , largely thanks to China &apos;s phenomenal growth . 
At the same time , there is little evidence to suggest that those successes were the result of the MDGs themselves . 
China implemented the policies that engineered history &apos;s greatest poverty eradication program prior to , and independently from , the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs . 
Clearly , however , the MDGs were a public-relations triumph , which is not to belittle their contribution . 
Like all worthwhile PR efforts , the MDGs served to raise awareness , galvanize attention , and mobilize action - all for a good cause . 
They amplified the global conversation about development and defined its terms . 
Indeed , the MDGs possibly had their clearest impact on aid flows from rich to poor countries . 
A study by Charles Kenny and Andy Sumner for the Center for Global Development in Washington , DC , suggests that the MDGs not only boosted aid flows , but also redirected them toward smaller , poorer countries , and toward targeted areas like education and public health . 
However , aid was not directly linked to performance and results , and it is much more difficult to know whether it had the desired impact overall . 
The MDGs encompass eight goals , 21 targets , and 60 indicators . 
Much criticism has focused on the use of these numerical targets and indicators , which , skeptics argue , are misspecified , mismeasured , and divert attention from equally important areas . 
But these complaints miss the point . 
Still , a central paradox plagues the MDGs . 
The Millennium Declaration was meant to be a compact between the world &apos;s rich and poor countries . 
But , oddly , of the eight goals , only the last one deals with &quot; global partnership , &quot; or what rich countries can and should do . 
Even here , the MDGs contain no numerical target for financial aid or any other aspect of rich countries &quot; assistance , in contrast to the highly specific poverty-related targets set for developing countries . 
It is perhaps telling that the &quot; progress charts &quot; prepared by the United Nations Development Program , the agency charged with reporting on progress toward achieving the MDGs , track only Internet usage under that goal . 
Why we need a global effort to convince developing countries to do what is good for them is not clear . 
Poverty reduction and human development should be the first order of business for governments in these countries , with or without the MDGs . 
It is true , of course , that these governments often pursue different goals , for political , military , and other reasons . 
But it is wishful thinking to believe that they can be persuaded to act otherwise by international declarations that lack enforcement mechanisms . 
If we have learned one thing in the development business , it is that real reform cannot be bought with donors &quot; money , let alone with vague promises of money . 
Equally problematic , the MDGs implicitly assume that we know how to achieve development targets , and that only resources and political will are missing . 
But it is doubtful that even well-intentioned policymakers have a good handle on , say , how to raise secondary-school completion rates sustainably or reduce maternal mortality . 
Many development economists would argue that significant improvements in governance and political institutions are required before such goals can be achieved . 
These considerations suggest an obvious direction for the next iteration of the MDGs . 
First , a new global compact should focus more directly on rich countries &quot; responsibilities . 
Second , it should emphasize policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal , if not greater , impact on poor countries &quot; development prospects . 
A short list of such policies would include : carbon taxes and other measures to ameliorate climate change ; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries ; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations ; reduced support for repressive regimes ; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoidance . 
Notice that most of these measures are actually aimed at reducing damage - for example , climate change , military conflict , and financial crime - that otherwise results from rich countries &quot; conduct . 
&quot; Do no harm &quot; is as good a principle here as it is in medicine . 
This kind of reorientation will not be easy . 
But most of these measures do not cost money , and , as the MDGs have shown , setting targets can be used to mobilize action from rich-country governments . 
If the international community is going to invest in a bold new public-relations initiative , it might as well focus on areas where the potential payoffs are the greatest .
