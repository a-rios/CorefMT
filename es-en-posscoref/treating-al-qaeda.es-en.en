Treating Al-Qaeda 
PRINCETON - Although Al-Qaeda &apos;s leadership , beliefs , and ideology are rooted in Saudi Arabia , the organization has been all but crushed in the Kingdom by a government policy that combines a big carrot and an even bigger stick . 
The attempted assassination in Jeddah last month of Prince Muhammad bin Nayef , the deputy interior minister for security affairs , demonstrates both elements of the Saudi strategy , and how a bold attempt by Al-Qaeda to revive its fortunes has failed . 
The bomber was Abdullah Asiri , a Saudi citizen and Al-Qaeda member who had returned from Yemen , claiming to have renounced terrorism and wishing to surrender directly to Prince Muhammad in his palace . 
Earlier that day , the prince had the bomber flown in on his private jet from the Yemeni-Saudi border and reportedly ordered that he not be carefully searched . 
Yet , Asiri had indeed hidden a bomb inside his body , a one-pound explosive that he detonated near the prince . 
However , the bomb was not encased in metal and the terrorist was the only person killed . 
To an outsider , the episode looks like a colossal security failure , as if the head of the FBI personally greeted one of Bin Laden &apos;s lieutenants at a garden party . 
But it is just this highly personalized form of politics that the Saudi royals have adopted with defecting Al-Qaeda &apos;s members . 
Indeed , this policy , even with its risks , partly explains Al-Qaeda &apos;s defeat in Saudi Arabia . 
Highly personalized politics form part of what might be called Saudi Arabia &apos;s theatre of state , which keeps the royals firmly in power . 
Since 2003 , Prince Muhammad has been in charge of a successful campaign against violent Islamism in the Kingdom . 
In terms of armed security action , he has developed a strong domestic intelligence and police service that is both efficient and brutal in its tactics . 
At the same time , the prince has cannily used deeply rooted cultural and religions norms to pressure Al-Qaeda &apos;s recruits to give up violence . 
For example , he offers significant financial inducements to individual jihadis , as well as their families , in return for political obedience . 
In effect , by not accepting Saudi largesse the militant will be keeping food off his own family &apos;s table - a powerful restraint in a culture and religion in which parents are highly regarded and respected . 
Prince Muhammad has also established a rehabilitation program that seeks to de-program the jihadis from their radical beliefs through a course of study that teaches that Islam requires obedience to a Muslim ruler . 
Repentant jihadis are taught that violence undertaken by individuals - not by the legitimate ruler - is sinful and will be punished by God . 
These lessons do not rule out all violence , focusing instead on Al-Qaeda &apos;s justifications for its attacks and the forms that the violence takes . 
As such , both fighting without the ruler &apos;s explicit permission and suicide bombing are unlawful . 
Entry into the program often involves a personal audience with the Saudi prince , in a ceremony that emphasizes the paternalistic and personal nature of governance in the Kingdom , where all subjects are regarded as well-cared-for children of the royals . 
Finally , Prince Muhammad has launched an Internet monitoring and disinformation campaign that keeps close tabs on jihadi Web sites and online forums . 
As a result , the Saudi security services have a feel for the pulse of jihadi debates , as well as for the radicals &quot; recruitment strategies . 
Al-Qaeda has also damaged itself with the Saudi public , which has been repeatedly victimized by terrorist attacks . 
Suicide bombings of public buildings and attacks on oil and other government installations have alienated many Saudis . 
With at least 80 % of the population dependent on government salaries or grants , the attacks have proved very unpopular . 
In addition , ordinary Saudis see the chaos next door in Iraq and do not want the same turmoil at home . 
For most people , stability , even if imposed by authoritarian means , trumps disorder . 
In the last two years , Al-Qaeda &apos;s increasing failures in the Kingdom have forced the surviving members to regroup across the border in Yemen . 
The rugged mountain terrain , a religiously conservative population , and a weak government with a history of collaboration with Al-Qaeda have created a relatively sheltered haven . 
As a result , Al-Qaeda has had a respite to try to rebuild itself and to organize attacks in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere . 
With two ongoing domestic rebellions , a large population , and the rapid disappearance of oil and water resources , Yemen is quickly emerging as a Western policymaker &apos;s nightmare . 
For now , however , the Saudi royals have a prince who is seen as a courageous hero for having survived an assassination attempt while offering the hand of generosity to an unrepentant zealot . 
Saudi King Abdullah chastised Prince Muhammad for recklessness , but the King must also be thankful that his family has produced a security chief who has broken the back of Al-Qaeda , at least inside the Kingdom .
