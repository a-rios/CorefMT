American Gulag 
Recently , the United States achieved the dubious honor of boasting the largest prison and jail population on earth . 
It reached this zenith by surpassing cash-strapped Russia - long its only rival as a mass imprisonment society - after Russia released thousands of inmates so as to save money . 
A few years earlier , as America rushed to lock up ever more of its population for ever-pettier offenses , the absolute size of its incarcerated population surpassed that of China - despite China &apos;s population being more than four times that of America . 
According to research conducted by the British Home Office , America now incarcerates over one fifth of the world &apos;s total prisoners . 
There is something bitterly ironic in this . 
For America really is a land of liberty , a place where lives , often scarred by injustice elsewhere , can be remade . 
How tragic , therefore , that over the past twenty years , the country &apos;s political leaders have so often decided to deal with many of the most noxious side-effects of poverty - from chronic drug use and the establishment of street drug markets , to hustling , to gang membership and the spraying of graffiti on public buildings - through a vast over-reliance on incarceration . 
How doubly tragic that this has occurred in tandem with a political assault on the Great Society anti-poverty programs put in place during the 1960s ; that the investments in infrastructure , public education , public healthcare and job training which might curtail crime more effectively are , instead , being replaced by massive public expenditures on building new prisons to incarcerate hundreds of thousands of low-level offenders . 
With such vicious cycles of crime , punishment and dis-investment in poor communities it is no surprise that the prison population has expanded to such an extent . 
The numbers buttressing this sprawling prison system are extraordinary . 
Approximately two million Americans are now serving either prison or jail time , over one million of them for non-violent offenses ( a preponderance of these either for drug use or low-level drug sales ) . 
Per hundred thousand residents , the US has an incarceration rate over five times that of England , six times that of Canada , and seven times that of Germany . 
Somewhere in the region of 10 % of African American men in their twenties live behind bars . 
In some states , where a single felony conviction is enough to bar the offender from ever being able to vote again , over one quarter of African American males are disenfranchised . 
High levels of disenfranchisement in Florida likely played a critical role in the much-disputed electoral victory of President Bush . 
Since 1980 , a virtual &quot; prison industrial complex &quot; has arisen , with phenomenal rates of new-prison construction abetted by lucrative construction and prison-guard union lobbies . 
Several states , including California , now spend more on prisons than they do on higher education . 
Despite dramatically falling crime rates over the last ten years ( which most criminologists attribute more to demography - there have simply been fewer young men of late - than incarceration ) , prison populations have continued to soar . 
Much of that increase has more to do with public perceptions about supposed crime waves and ham-handed public and political responses to occasional headline-capturing murders , than any actual underlying crime rate . 
As the actual number of truly heinous crimes has in fact fallen , increasingly it is small-time hoodlums , drug users , and mentally ill people who have been drawing long spells behind bars . 
America today has five times as many prisoners as it did in 1980 . 
One of the most dismaying developments is the spread of so-called &quot; three-strikes-and-you &apos;re out &quot; laws . California &apos;s version , passed by citizen referendum in 1993 and ratcheted into place by state legislators in 1994 , provides for the life imprisonment of any criminal with two previous serious convictions who is found guilty of any third felony . By the end of last year there were about 7,000 people serving life sentences in California under this law . 
Many thousands of them are serving life for small-time &quot; Third Strikes &quot; : minor drug crimes , car theft , petty fraud , burglary , and drunk driving ( even graffiti spraying , to the tune of $ 400 damage , which has now been reclassified as a felony ) . One such man is fifty-eight year old heroin addict Billy Ochoa , who is serving a staggering 326 years in a supermax ( super maximum security ) prison for $ 2,100 of welfare fraud . 
Because he had been convicted of several burglaries over the previous decades , when Ochoa was caught making fraudulent applications for food stamps and emergency housing vouchers in Los Angeles , he was tried under the Three Strikes law and given sentences on thirteen separate counts to be served in one of the toughest , most secure prisons in America . 
Ochoa &apos;s sentence , apart from its extravagant cruelty , may ultimately cost taxpayers as much as a million dollars . 
How can things have come to this America ? 
Now is the time - with the world watching America fight to defend its values - for the worst excesses of its criminal justice system to be addressed . 
It is a tragedy that a great democracy should have so ugly and vast a prison system corroding both its reputation and its polity .
