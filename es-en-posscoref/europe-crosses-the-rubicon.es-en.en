Europe Crosses the Rubicon 
The so-called &quot; European Neighborhood Policy &quot; has , so far , been a curious thing . 
There is much talk about it in the European Union , but little practical effect . 
It was meant as an alternative to the ever-increasing number of accession rounds , say , involving the countries in the southern Caucasus . 
But the war in Lebanon and its consequences have caused a sudden and fundamental change in the leisurely pursuit of this policy . 
The Lebanon War has served as a harsh reminder to the European Union that it has &quot; strategic interests &quot; - security interests first and foremost - and that , should it choose to ignore them , the price will be high . 
Moreover , the division of labor between the US and Europe isn &apos;t functioning in the time-tested manner of old : the ongoing war in Iraq is gnawing at America &apos;s military capabilities and resulted in a crisis of moral and political legitimacy of the US across the Arabic / Islamic world . 
With the decision of its member states to send several thousand soldiers to Lebanon to implement the UN cease-fire resolution 1701 , the European Union has taken the most significant decision yet within its Neighborhood Policy . 
Can the EU in fact be able to emerge as a stabilizing political force in the most dangerous area of conflict within Europe &apos;s immediate geopolitical neighborhood ? 
After the Balkan Wars of the 1990 &quot; s , the Near and Middle East is at once the most dangerous and also - given security considerations - the most important neighboring region for the EU today . 
Why ? 
Because the main threats to European security at the beginning of the 21st century stem from that region . 
The threats concentrated in the Middle East are diverse : regional conflicts , totalitarian religious ideologies , terrorism , nuclear armament programs , blockades to modernization , unstable regimes and hegemonic ambitions . 
If one asks what interests the EU and its member states have in this crisis-riddled region , the answer is , that certainly European energy and economic interests are at stake , as well as the vital interests of Europe &apos;s partners and allies ( Israel in particular ) . 
But first and foremost on the list are Europe &apos;s . 
How the Middle East develops will determine the extent of the risks for , or even probable challenges to , Europe &apos;s security . 
Success in containing , or indeed resolving , the conflict there will have overwhelmingly positive consequences for Europe &apos;s security . 
The Middle East today is defined by three central conflicts : the Israeli-Arab conflict , Iraq , and Iran . 
The fusion of Iran &apos;s nuclear program ( and Iran &apos;s hegemonic ambitions ) with the situation in Iraq and with Hezbollah in Lebanon will lead to a &quot; New Middle East &quot; which , in all likelihood , will provoke a major confrontation . 
This will involve far more than just the usual regional actors and conflicts . 
The war in Lebanon has made it abundantly clear how far this dangerous process has already progressed . 
The mission in Lebanon is a high-risk one for the UN force , and for Europe in particular . 
The war did not bring forth a real decision . 
Neither Hezbollah nor Syria , let alone Iran , have any interest in the UN mission &apos;s success . 
The Security Council resolution presupposes - in addition to separating the combatants - the enforcement of the internal and external sovereignty of Lebanon &apos;s elected government of Lebanon , without saying how this is to be accomplished with a politically strengthened Hezbollah , militarily superior to the Lebanese forces . 
Any attempt at disarming Hezbollah by the UN force would mean a war with Hezbollah ( and with Syria and Iran in the background )  -  a task the UN force cannot accomplish . 
But were it to resign itself to mere observer status in Lebanon , the UN and Europe would lose all credibility . 
Moreover , it is likely that , within a few months , UN soldiers would once again find themselves between the firing lines of the conflicting parties . 
The mission therefore will have to walk the thin and risky line in pursuit of its robust mandate to stabilize the country . 
Failure will be a constant danger and the military risk will be high . 
Yet , in light of the situation there is no better alternative . 
In view of the risk to its troops , Europe will be compelled to influence and even proactively bring about strategic changes to the political environment in the entire Middle East . 
With its decision in favor of the mission in Lebanon , the EU crossed a military Rubicon . 
It must now back up its growing weight in the Middle East with political initiative . 
This common understanding will be the pivotal challenge for the future of the transatlantic relationship . 
For Europe and its troops , the stakes in Lebanon are very high . 
But this is about vital European interests . 
War and chaos in the Middle East or just a moral or political vacuum will directly affect and upset the security of the EU and all its member states . 
Europe therefore had to act , though that decision was obviously difficult . 
The key question in the near future will be whether Europe actually has the military and political capabilities , the political staying power , and the common will to act in accordance with its core interests in the Middle East . 
We will see . 
In any case , one thing can already be said : Welcome to the real world .
