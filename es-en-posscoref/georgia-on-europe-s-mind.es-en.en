Georgia on Europe &apos;s Mind 
The era in which Europe could rely on America to wage war , make peace , and establish democracy in its own backyard is over . 
With European Union enlargement , and as the recent Russian gas crisis demonstrated , that backyard now includes not just Ukraine , but Georgia as well . 
Indeed , as in Ukraine , Georgia is undergoing a test of democracy that Europe cannot afford to ignore . 
Georgia was the first post-Soviet country to stage a &quot; color revolution , &quot; and thus to demonstrate , with dignity and maturity , its people &apos;s choice for democracy and European values . 
The European Union flags that have flown on all Georgian public buildings since then signal a natural attachment , as old as the history of a country that , for the ancient Greeks , was an integral part of the world as it was then known . 
Prometheus , Medea , the Amazons and , in neighboring Armenia , Noah &apos;s Ark - the Europe of our myths starts here . 
With its history , culture , and traditions - including its critical , independent , and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union - Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization . 
So it is all the more worrisome that democratization there is foundering . 
Everything seemed to have started well enough . 
Political reforms , privatization , anti-corruption measures , a search for new leaders untainted by compromise with the former regime , and implementation of a pro-European foreign policy met no resistance . 
But the totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced in leaders who , with their claim to represent the will of the majority , appropriate more and more power . 
Like the ancient Greeks &quot; Hydra , Georgia &apos;s political elite never ceases to die and be reborn . 
The same people and governing methods that the &quot; Rose Revolution &quot; of November 2003 sought to defeat have reemerged at the center of power by using their personal networks , which extend outside Georgia &apos;s borders , as well as their tremendous wealth and finely honed skills at political scheming and manipulation . 
This bears little in common with the essence of democracy , which consists not merely in ballot boxes , but in the separation of powers . 
The government meddles in the affairs of the parliament , which in turn seeks to micro-manage the government - including , in my case , the nomination of ambassadors and their daily routines ! 
Finally , and more seriously , the judiciary is not yet independent , undermining the rule of law and thus deterring badly needed private investment . 
Georgia &apos;s democracy exists in its head , but not yet in its body : citizens still spurn politics as a dirty pursuit , abandoning the ground to those who should have been retired long ago . 
But the hope of democracy remains strongly rooted in Georgia &apos;s people , civic organizations , and media . 
Now is the time for Europe to ensure that this hope is not extinguished . 
The US has already done as much as it can to support political stability in Georgia since independence . 
To be sure , stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze , the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution . 
But Americans invested generously in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders . 
Although the foundation backed by the financier George Soros did not fabricate the Rose Revolution , as Russian nationalists claim , it certainly nurtured , encouraged , and supported democracy &apos;s preconditions . 
But , to help consolidate its democracy , Georgia now requires support of a different nature , which Europe is better equipped to offer . 
The models for the balance of powers , the functioning of the judiciary , and local democracy must be inspired by European forms , which are closer to Georgian reality than Anglo-Saxon models of the American type . 
Europe &apos;s rejection of this challenge would betray its fundamental duties in a place - small , Mediterranean , flexible , with old historical traditions - where democracy stands a much greater chance of success than in Ukraine , which is both huge and still very Soviet-minded , not to mention Central Asia . 
Indeed , refusal to support Georgia &apos;s struggling democracy would most likely postpone democratic progress in Ukraine , Belarus , even in Russia itself . 
This clearly raises the stakes . 
Russia , while never renouncing its imperial dreams and instruments of domination , was nonetheless coming to terms with the inevitability of democracy , at least on its margins . 
But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia &apos;s famously irrational &quot; derzhava &quot; - an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness . 
This is the key to understanding the recent Russian gas crisis . 
Just as surely , any sign of a retreat from democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will merely fuel Russia &apos;s neo-imperial ambitions . 
It is Europe &apos;s responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past . 
Europe must assume this role not only to ensure the future independence of its energy supply , but also to demonstrate that European values of freedom , democracy , and justice between peoples have real force . 
To succeed , Europe must equip itself with the necessary instruments : a large semi-public foundation to promote Europe and support political reform , a university to train future executives of nascent democracies , a police force , and an army of judges and magistrates to breathe life into the models that we want to emulate . 
Above all , Europe needs conviction . 
If Europe today cannot convince itself that it has a vital interest in its neighbors &quot; future , who will believe in Europe tomorrow ?
