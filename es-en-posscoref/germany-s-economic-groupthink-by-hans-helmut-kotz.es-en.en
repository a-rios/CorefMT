Europe &apos;s Economic Groupthink 
FRANKFURT - During the recent hearing on the constitutionality of the European Central Bank &apos;s measures to prevent the eurozone from falling apart , Andreas Vosskuhle , President of Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , raised an important question : Do non-German economists condemn the ECB &apos;s outright monetary transactions ( OMT ) as unequivocally as all but one of the German experts testifying ? 
Of course , there are German economists ( not to mention Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government ) who support ECB President Mario Draghi &apos;s policies . 
Still , an overwhelming majority of German ( and possibly Dutch and Finnish ) economists seem to favor keeping the ECB on the sidelines in the eurozone crisis . 
It &apos;s a fiscal issue , the typical German economist says , and monetary policy will not help ; on the contrary , activating it will only make matters worse . 
Of course , everyone would prefer it if the line between monetary and fiscal policy had not become blurred as a result of the crisis . 
It would have meant accepting in 2012 what has been called &quot; redenomination risk &quot; - economic newspeak for a eurozone breakup . 
Nonetheless , by launching its OMT scheme , the ECB has committed German ( and other northern European ) taxpayers , without their parliaments &quot; approval , to a potential obligation to bail out - well , whom , exactly ? 
Indeed , it appears that the typical northern European taxpayer supports the typical stakeholder in northern European banks that are over-exposed to southern European debtors . 
Likewise , German legal scholars interpret the ECB &apos;s activities as being incompatible with European treaty provisions that prohibit bailouts and monetary financing of the debt of eurozone members . 
Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , of course , does not write the rules . 
Nonetheless , the ECB is right that it is faced with very different monetary conditions in different member states ; indeed , the eurozone is akin to a badly working fixed-exchange-rate system , with all of the attendant risks . 
Ultimately , limiting the ECB to its conventional tool kit amounts to accepting the risk of a eurozone collapse . 
Against this backdrop , institutional investors self-insured - quite rationally - against a eurozone breakup by withdrawing behind safer borders . 
With fiscal policy incapable of responding , the ECB was stuck with a second intermediation role : mitigating with its Target2 system the effects of European financial markets re-segmenting along national lines . 
This is fiscal dominance in its purest form . 
It is here that Vosskuhle &apos;s question matters the most . 
Debates within eurozone member states typically converge on what legal scholars call herrschende Meinung ( &quot; dominant opinion &quot; ) , which , in turn , appears to reflect their countries &quot; status as creditors or debtors . 
Reinforcing this , the typical career-conscious economist has little incentive to deviate . 
The media are no remedy , as competition for ratings forces them to favor oversimplification over differentiation , complexity , and nuance . 
In terms of substance - which the German Constitutional Court explicitly and intentionally avoids - the case for OMT has always been about preventing a liquidity crisis from morphing into a solvency problem , especially on the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
From an investor &apos;s perspective , the mechanics of this are simple : all are reluctant to hold private or public debt from a country that is vulnerable to redenomination . 
This by itself creates a rollover risk , which is why , for example , a small firm in Bozen ( Bolzano , in Italy &apos;s South Tyrol ) is subject to higher financing costs than its competitor in Innsbruck ( in Austria &apos;s northern Tyrol ) . 
The OMT scheme &apos;s success depends on an unlimited capacity to intervene - to do &quot; whatever it takes , &quot; as Draghi famously put it . 
Legally constraining this capacity would be self-defeating . 
So , if the OMT scheme is not feasible under current treaty provisions , these provisions - which , after all , are of human , not divine , origin - must be amended . 
But a treaty change would require engaging the European public - and , in several member states , submitting the proposed revisions to popular referenda . 
Given how often such referenda have been defeated in recent years - for example , in France , the Netherlands , and Ireland - that is a scenario that everyone wants to avoid . 
What is dispiriting is that we ponder these arguments so infrequently . 
In fact , the minimal prerequisites for a working monetary union are not discussed upfront and transparently anywhere . 
With politicians focused on the median voter , and a groupthink-generating media , the eurozone muddles through , just barely surviving . 
But , if the eurozone is to be a sensible long-term proposition , mere survival is not enough . 
The main justification for a monetary union cannot be the possibly disastrous consequences of its falling apart . 
Even less convincing is the neo-mercantilist point that the eurozone would allow for indefinite current-account surpluses ( it does not ) . 
Originally , Europe &apos;s monetary union was supposed to provide a stable framework for its deeply integrated economies to enhance living standards sustainably . 
But this requires acknowledging what the crisis has revealed : the eurozone &apos;s institutional flaws . 
Remedying them calls for a minimum of federalism and commensurate democratic legitimacy - and thus for greater openness to institutional adaptation .
