Iran Confronts Reality 
MADRID - Who has not seen what looks like water on a highway on a hot summer &apos;s day ? 
Or a three-dimensional image that was actually a picture on a flat surface ? 
The nature of illusion is that we mistake what we perceive for reality . 
That is true whether an illusion is cognitive or political . 
Depending on how a particular event develops , it can lead us to formulate erroneous interpretations of what is actually happening . 
Such perceptions are often mediated by ideas and previous experiences . 
And , as Robert Jervis argued in Perception and Misperception in International Politics , published during the Cold War , the illusions that we create have an enormous influence on decision-making - even becoming a fundamental cause of conflict . 
To a certain extent , this is what has happened with analysis of the recent 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) , held at the end of August in Tehran - the first time Iran has hosted the meeting . 
The summit took place against a background of scant progress in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program and growing pressure from Israel for the international community to establish a &quot; trigger &quot; - a line that the Islamic Republic must not cross . 
Moreover , regional tensions heightened the perception of the NAM summit &apos;s importance and that of its host . 
In the Middle East , only Iran and Hezbollah support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime in a civil war that is nearing the point of no return and destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan . 
The NAM played an important role during the Cold War . 
But the reality that united NAM in the past has changed . 
The Cold War &apos;s bipolar governance structures and a subsequent period of American unilateralism - to which the non-aligned states attempted to act as a counterbalance - have given way to a much more complex and interdependent multi-polar world . 
While the United States and Europe are still struggling to overcome a serious economic crisis , many NAM members , such as India , Chile , and Singapore , have maintained relative strong growth and form a part of new global governance structures , such as the G-20 . 
Likewise , many of the problems that we now face - whether climate change , financial crisis , development challenges , terrorism , or nuclear proliferation - reflect growing global interdependence . 
Managing them effectively obliges us to rethink the concept of sovereignty . 
These changes have transformed not only the traditional structures of power , but also the leitmotif of NAM and the fate of its members . 
Globalization has fueled ever-widening disparities among its members - just compare Colombia with Afghanistan , or Chile with Sudan - that make it difficult to transform sheer numbers into coherent influence . 
The impact of the Tehran summit , and whom it may have benefited , is not entirely clear . 
Iran certainly regarded the meeting as a propaganda opportunity , promising wide media coverage at a time when it was in the eye of a diplomatic hurricane . 
But the participants &quot; inability to reach a common position on their hosts &quot; nuclear program or the violence in Syria - two of the fundamental questions that confronted the summit - obviously undermined Iran &apos;s effort to demonstrate that , despite facing severe economic and diplomatic sanctions , it remains an effective international player . 
Indeed , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Iran for not assuring the world that it is not seeking nuclear arms at a time when the International Atomic Energy Agency has published a new report suggesting that it is . 
And , in a speech of great depth , Mohamed Morsi , the first Egyptian president to visit Iran since the Islamic Republic &apos;s birth in 1979 , firmly rejected the Syrian regime , as he did in a subsequent appearance before the Arab League as well . 
Moreover , Morsi urged Iran to join Egypt , Turkey , and Saudi Arabia - all Sunni-majority countries - in pressing for political transition in Syria ( a role that the Syrian opposition rejected before Iran could even say no ) . 
In other words , reality betrayed the perception that Iran sought to create in hosting the NAM summit . 
Instead , Morsi &apos;s speech provided the occasion &apos;s most memorable moment . 
And Iran &apos;s nuclear quest remains a reality that must not be ignored during the next key three years , when the Islamic Republic will lead NAM while itself remaining one of the most serious problems on the international agenda .
