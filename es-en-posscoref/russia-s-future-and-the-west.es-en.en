Russia &apos;s Future and the West 
Russia is again seeking a role as a global power and is therefore flexing its muscles . 
Signs of change in Russian foreign policy have been mounting ever since President Vladimir Putin delivered a confrontational speech in Munich last February . 
Since then Russia planted its flag on the seabed below the North Pole to demonstrate its claims to the Arctic and its natural resources ; announced its intention to build its own missile defense system and issued repeated threats against Europe because of the planned deployment of a small American defense system ; exploded a &quot; stray &quot; missile or bomb in Georgia as a warning signal to the government in Tbilisi and its Western friends ; buzzed America &apos;s military base on the Pacific island of Guam with surveillance aircraft ; blocked a decision on the final status of Kosovo in the UN Security Council ; and launched a hacker attack against computer systems in Estonia . 
In addition , each winter there is a repeated threat of &quot; problems &quot; with oil and gas deliveries to Europe . 
High oil and gas prices , America &apos;s self-inflicted global weakening due to its misadventure in Iraq , and the rise of China and India obviously have prompted Moscow to change its foreign policy . 
Yet none of this amounts to a fundamental change in Russia &apos;s strategy , because Russia continues to adhere to its fundamental decision , made in the early 1990 &quot; s , to open itself to the West . 
Still , the style of Russian politics has changed from cooperation to confrontation . 
And , as history has shown , a change of style in foreign policy may quickly lead to a change in strategy . 
Currently , Russia is undergoing a restoration . 
Such periods always follow revolutions and times of far-reaching change . 
The power of the center is being restored , following its partial disintegration after the end of the Soviet Union . 
But , ever since the sixteenth century , the center has played the main role in shaping Russian history , and now looks to be no different . 
The restoration of central authority has been going on for some time . 
Indeed , today the center almost completely dictates Russian internal politics and economics , though not within a totalitarian or autocratic framework , but in a democratic and market-based fashion . 
Democracy has , of course , degenerated into what is sometimes called &quot; managed democracy . &quot; 
Theoretically , there remain different parties , elections , a pluralistic society , an independent judiciary , and a market economy . 
But in practice , the entire system is subject to control by the president . 
The people will still be allowed to vote for the president , but the real decision about who he will be will have been made beforehand . 
Even if its annual GDP approximates that of Italy , Russia still is a global power and too important to isolate , or even forget about . 
It retains enormous strategic weight . 
Russia &apos;s future will be determined by whether it is successful in comprehensively modernizing its economy , which today is largely based on exports of oil , gas , and other natural resources . 
If Russia remains dependent on a natural-resource economy , it will again become a colossus with feet of clay . 
Indeed , it will not be nearly as powerful as the old Soviet Union . 
Only if Russia succeeds in productively reinvesting the gains from its petro-economy will it achieve sustainable modernization . 
But this also will require successful political modernization , which means nothing less than constraining the power of the center . 
The most important aspect of this will be to secure real judicial independence . 
Moreover , Russia needs a system of checks and balances compatible with its own culture and tradition , because this , together with the rule of law , is an indispensable precondition of a functioning democracy . 
Finally , Russia will need to build a functioning party system , capable of sustaining Russian democracy . 
Considering the country &apos;s vast size , a two-party system seems to be the most appropriate . 
All these transformations will take time , and they will not come easily or be free of conflict . 
So , for the foreseeable future , the West will have to deal with a Russia that yearns for its lost imperial power and shapes its foreign policy to this end . 
In international politics , one side &apos;s strength often reflects the other side &apos;s weakness . 
The weakness of the US and Europe today is an open invitation for Russia to return to its old imperial politics . 
This development is anything but safe , particularly for Europe . 
Europe thus has a strategic interest in Russia &apos;s successful modernization and in good bilateral relations . 
Above all , the European Union and its member states cannot allow Russia to recapture its imperial spheres of influence without severely damaging its own central interests . 
It is for this reason that securing the independence of Ukraine is so important , as is assuring Turkey &apos;s European orientation . 
So , while Russia &apos;s modernization and democratization are in Europe &apos;s interest , its return to an imperial foreign policy and barely veiled authoritarianism at home is not . 
Most Russians look westward . 
In the next few years , Russia will offer Europe a great opportunity for closer cooperation , but it will also pose a risk of increased intrusion in European affairs . 
The right responses to these opportunities and risks require a united , strong Europe . 
Indeed , a strong and united Europe will also make an important contribution to Russia &apos;s sustainable modernization . 
A weak and divided Europe will tempt Russia to pursue dangerous paths into the future .
