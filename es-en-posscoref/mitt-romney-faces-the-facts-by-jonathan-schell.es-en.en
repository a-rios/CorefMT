Mitt Romney &apos;s Reality Check 
NEW YORK - There is a kind of war underway in the United States nowadays between fact and fantasy . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s re-election marked a victory , limited but unmistakable , for the cause of fact . 
Events in the days leading up to America &apos;s presidential election provided a stark illustration of the struggle . 
Among senior aides to Republican challenger Mitt Romney , a belief developed that he was on the cusp of victory . 
Their conviction had no basis in poll results . 
Nevertheless , the feeling grew so strong that aides began to address Romney as &quot; Mr. President . &quot; 
But wanting that to be true was not enough for them to make it true . 
It would be as close to becoming President as Romney would get , and he apparently wanted to enjoy it while he could , however prematurely . 
Then , on election night , when the television networks projected Romney &apos;s defeat in Ohio and therefore Barack Obama &apos;s re-election , the Romney campaign , in a further denial of fact , refused to accept the result . 
A very awkward hour passed before he accepted reality and made a gracious concession speech . 
The same disregard for reality has been the hallmark not only of the Republican campaign but of the entire Republican Party in recent times . 
When the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report in October showing that the national unemployment rate remained &quot; essentially unchanged at 7.9 % , &quot; Republican operatives sought to discredit the highly respected BLS . 
When polls showed that Romney was falling behind President Barack Obama , they sought to discredit the polls . 
When the non-partisan Congressional Research Service reported that a Republican tax plan would do nothing to foster economic growth , Republican Senators muscled the CRS into withdrawing its report . 
These refusals to accept matters of plain fact reflect a still wider pattern . 
Increasingly , the Republican Party , once a fairly normal political party , has granted itself a license to live in an alternate reality - a world in which George W. Bush did find the weapons of mass destruction that he had thought were in Iraq ; tax cuts eliminate budget deficits ; 
Obama is not only a Muslim but was born in Kenya and thus should be disqualified from the presidency ; and global warming is a hoax concocted by a cabal of socialist scientists . 
( The Democrats , for their part , have had one foot in the camp of unreality as well . ) 
Of all of the Republicans &quot; unreal beliefs , their full-throated denial of human-induced climate change was surely the most consequential . 
After all , if left unchecked , global warming has the potential to degrade and destroy the climactic conditions that underlay and made possible the rise of human civilization over the last ten millennia . 
Romney , as governor of Massachusetts , had expressed belief in the reality of global warming . 
As a presidential candidate , however , he joined the deniers - a switch made clear when he accepted the party &apos;s nomination in Tampa , Florida , in August . 
&quot; President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans , &quot; Romney told the Republican convention , and then paused , with the expectant smile of a comedian waiting for the audience to catch on to the joke . 
It did . 
Laughter broke and built . 
Romney let it grow , then delivered the punch line : 
The crowd cracked up . 
It was perhaps the most memorable and lamentable moment in a lamentable campaign - a moment that , in the history now to be written of humanity &apos;s effort to preserve a livable planet , is destined for immortal notoriety . 
There was an astonishing sequel . 
Eight weeks later , Hurricane Sandy struck the New Jersey shore and New York City . 
Its 14-foot surge of seawater was backed by the sea-level rise already caused by a century of global warming , and the storm &apos;s sweep and intensity was fueled by a warming planet &apos;s warmer ocean waters . 
That tide of reality - what Alexander Solzhenitsyn once called &quot; the pitiless crowbar of events &quot; - burst the closed bubble of Romney &apos;s campaign , its walls breached as decisively as those of lower Manhattan and Far Rockaway . 
In the contest between fact and fantasy , fact suddenly had a powerful ally . 
The political map was subtly but consequentially redrawn . 
Obama swung into action , now not just a suspect candidate but a trusted president whose services were sorely needed by the battered population of the East Coast . 
Eight of ten voters , as polls showed , viewed his performance favorably , and many declared that the impression influenced their vote . 
In a surprising , politically potent twist , New Jersey &apos;s governor , Chris Christie , who had been the keynote speaker at the Republican convention at which Romney had mocked the dangers of global warming , turned out to be one of those impressed with Obama &apos;s performance , and said so publicly . 
The American political world - not only Republicans , but also Democrats ( albeit to a lesser extent ) - had fenced out huge , ominous realities . 
But those realities , as if listening and responding , entered the fray . 
They voted early , and they may very well have swayed the outcome . 
Earth spoke , and Americans , for once , listened .
