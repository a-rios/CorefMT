India &apos;s Dalai Dilemma 
As the world reacts to China &apos;s crackdown in Tibet , one country is conspicuous by both its centrality to the drama and its reticence over it . 
India , the land of asylum for the Dalai Lama and the angry young hotheads of the Tibetan Youth Congress , finds itself on the horns of a dilemma . 
On one hand , India is a democracy with a long tradition of allowing peaceful protest , including against foreign countries when their leaders come visiting . 
It provided refuge to the Dalai Lama when he fled Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959 , granted asylum ( and eventually Indian citizenship ) to more than 110,000 Tibetan refugees , and permitted them to create a government-in-exile ( albeit one that India does not recognize ) in the picturesque Himalayan hill town of Dharamsala . 
On the other hand , India has been cultivating better relations with China , which humiliated India in a brief border war in 1962 . 
Though their bitter border dispute remains unresolved , and China has been a vital ally and military supplier to India &apos;s enemies in Pakistan , bilateral relations have grown warmer in recent years . 
Trade has doubled in each of the last three years , to an estimated $ 40 billion this year ; 
China has now overtaken the US as India &apos;s largest single trading partner . 
Tourism , particularly by Indian pilgrims to a major Hindu holy site in Tibet , is thriving . 
Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai , and Infosys &apos;s headquarters in Bangalore recruited nine Chinese this year . 
India has no desire to jeopardize any of this . 
India &apos;s government has attempted to draw a distinction between its humanitarian obligations as an asylum country and its political responsibilities as a friend of China . 
The Dalai Lama and his followers are given a respected place but told not to conduct &quot; political activities &quot; on Indian soil . 
When young Tibetan radicals staged a march to Lhasa from Indian soil , the Indian police stopped them well before they got to the Tibetan border , detaining 100 . 
When Tibetan demonstrators outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi attacked the premises , the Indian government stepped up its protection for the Chinese diplomats . 
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee - who was noticeably less forthcoming on Tibet than his American counterpart during a press conference with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice - has publicly warned the Dalai Lama against doing anything that could have a &quot; negative impact on Indo-Sino relations . &quot; 
The Dalai Lama &apos;s curious position has complicated India &apos;s diplomatic dance with China . 
He is simultaneously the most visible spiritual leader of a worldwide community of believers , a role that India honors , and a political leader , a role that India permits but rejects in its own dealings with him . 
As a Buddhist , the Dalai Lama preaches non-attachment , self-realization , inner actualization , and non-violence ; as a Tibetan he is admired by a people fiercely attached to their homeland , with most seeking its independence from China and many determined to fight for it . 
He is the most recognized worldwide symbol of a country that he has not seen for nearly five decades . 
The Dalai Lama &apos;s message of peace , love , and reconciliation has found adherents among Hollywood movie stars , pony-tailed hippies , Irish rock musicians , and Indian politicians . 
But he has made no headway at all with the regime that rules his homeland , and he has been unable to prevent Tibet &apos;s inexorable transformation into a Chinese province . 
His sermons fill football stadiums and he has won a Nobel Prize , but political leaders around the world shirk from meeting him openly , for fear of offending China . 
Indians are acutely conscious that , on this subject , the Chinese are easily offended . 
While India facilitated the highly publicized visit by Nancy Pelosi , Speaker of the US House of Representatives , to the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala last month , it almost simultaneously canceled a scheduled meeting between him and Indian Vice-President Mohammed Hamid Ansari . 
When China summoned India &apos;s ambassador in Beijing to the foreign ministry at 2 a.m. for a dressing-down over the Tibetan protests in New Delhi , India meekly acquiesced in the insult . 
Though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has publicly declared the Dalai Lama to be the &quot; personification of nonviolence , &quot; India has let it be known that it does not support his political objectives . 
Tibet , India &apos;s government says , is an integral part of China , and India lends no support to those who would challenge that status . 
That position is not without detractors . 
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP , which led the previous government ) has criticized the current administration for not &quot; expressing concern over the use of force by the Chinese government &quot; and instead &quot; adopting a policy of appeasement towards China with scant regard to the country &apos;s national honor and foreign policy independence . &quot; 
But few observers believe that the BJP would have conducted itself differently . 
The stark truth is that India has no choice in the matter . 
It cannot undermine its own democratic principles and abridge the freedom of speech of Tibetans on its soil . 
Nor can it afford to alienate its largest trading partner , a neighbor and an emerging global superpower , which is known to be prickly over any presumed slights to its sovereignty over Tibet . 
India will continue to balance delicately on its Tibetan tightrope .
