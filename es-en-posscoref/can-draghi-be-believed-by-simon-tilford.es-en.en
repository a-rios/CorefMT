Can Draghi Be Believed ? 
LONDON - Mario Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank , has repeatedly claimed that the ECB will do everything necessary to save the euro . 
Nothing has been formally agreed yet , but the ECB is expected to announce a new government bond-buying program following next week &apos;s meeting of its Governing Council . 
Will it work ? 
To have a significant impact on Italian and Spanish borrowing costs , the latest effort must be big enough to dispel the convertibility risk that underlies the extreme polarization of government bond yields across the eurozone : investors are loathe to hold Spanish and Italian debt , because they fear that both countries might be forced to leave the currency union . 
Unfortunately , it is highly unlikely that the ECB will do enough to persuade investors that membership is unequivocally forever , not least because Germany &apos;s Bundesbank opposes any open-ended commitment to capping borrowing costs . 
Spain , Italy , and the eurozone periphery face unprecedentedly high real borrowing costs , which are preventing a recovery in investment and hence economic growth . 
Without a return to growth , they cannot quell investors &quot; doubts about their fiscal sustainability and their banks &quot; solvency . 
The Italian and Spanish governments argue that their high borrowing costs largely reflect convertibility risks , and that the ECB should do as much as necessary to address them . 
But eurozone members that currently benefit from exceptionally low borrowing costs - Germany , Austria , Finland , the Netherlands , and , to a lesser extent , France - maintain that Italian and Spanish borrowing costs largely reflect these countries &quot; failure to reform their economies and strengthen their public finances . 
There is merit in both positions - but much more in the Spanish and Italian argument . 
Opponents of open-ended ECB action argue that Italian and Spanish borrowing costs are not actually that high : interest rates have merely returned to levels seen in the run-up to the introduction of the euro , when investors distinguished properly between the countries that now share the euro . 
High borrowing costs are needed to focus minds and instill discipline . 
Were the ECB to take aggressive action to bring them down , moral hazard would result : countries would face no punishment for delaying reforms . 
In nominal terms , Italian and Spanish borrowing costs are indeed comparable to the levels of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
But it is the real ( inflation-adjusted ) cost of capital that is crucial , and for both countries it is much higher now than it was in the run-up to their adoption of the euro . 
Moreover , it is erroneous to compare the present with the late 1990 &quot; s . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s , both economies were growing ( rapidly in the Spanish case ) , whereas now they face hard times and a mounting risk of deflation . 
And countries facing depressions and rapidly weakening inflation typically face very low borrowing costs : investors purchase government bonds for want of profitable alternatives . 
This is what we see in the United Kingdom and the United States , where borrowing costs remain at all-time lows , despite both countries &quot; weak public finances and poor growth prospects . 
To be sure , investors must differentiate between eurozone governments , in order to ensure that risk is correctly priced . 
But the current spread between the yield on German sovereign debt and that of the Italian and Spanish governments far exceeds what is required to ensure that investors differentiate appropriately . 
The polarization of borrowing costs has politically explosive distributional effects : Germany is borrowing and refinancing its existing debt at artificially low interest rates . 
According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy , investor flight from the government debt markets of the eurozone &apos;s struggling members to Germany has already saved the German government almost â‚¬ 70 billion ( $ 88 billion ) . 
Other countries , by contrast , face ruinously high borrowing costs , which are simultaneously increasing the scale of their reform challenges and narrowing their political scope to address them . 
The longer Italian and Spanish borrowing costs remain at such elevated levels , the greater the damage to those economies , and the harder it will become to marshal the necessary political support for further reforms . 
The Italians and Spaniards are right : the principal reason for the size of the spread between the periphery and Germany is convertibility risk . 
Investors are demanding a hefty premium to insure against the chance that Italy and Spain are ultimately forced out of the eurozone - thus bringing that day closer by weakening countries &quot; fiscal positions and raising their private-sector borrowing costs ( which are set by government bond yields ) . 
With private and public consumption in both Italy and Spain set to remain depressed for years to come , economic recovery requires stronger investment and exports . 
But the steep fall in the value of Italian and Spanish banks &quot; holdings of government debt , combined with mounting bad loans as a result of recessions exacerbated by punitive borrowing costs , is forcing the banks to rein in business lending further . 
The ECB &apos;s latest program of bond purchases will be big enough to ensure that Draghi does not lose face . 
And it is the ECB &apos;s credibility problem , not that of member states , that is the principal reason for unsustainably high borrowing costs in Italy , Spain , and other distressed eurozone countries .
