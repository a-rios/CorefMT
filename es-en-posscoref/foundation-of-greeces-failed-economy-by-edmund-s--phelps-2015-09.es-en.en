The Foundations of Greece &apos;s Failed Economy 
NEW YORK - Too many politicians and economists blame austerity - urged by Greece &apos;s creditors - for the collapse of the Greek economy . 
But the data show neither marked austerity by historical standards nor government cutbacks severe enough to explain the huge job losses . 
What the data do show are economic ills rooted in the values and beliefs of Greek society . 
Greece &apos;s public sector is rife with clientelism ( to gain votes ) and cronyism ( to gain favors ) - far more so than in other parts of Europe . 
Maximum pensions for public employees relative to wages are nearly twice as high as in Spain ; the government favors business elites with tax-free status ; and some state employees draw their salaries without actually turning up for work . 
There are serious ills in the private sector , too - notably , the pervasive influence of vested interests and the country &apos;s business and political elites . 
Profits as a share of business income in Greece are a whopping 46 % , according to the latest available data . 
( Germany &apos;s share is 39 % ; the United States , &quot; 35 % ; and the United Kingdom &apos;s , 32 % . ) 
Insiders receive subsidies and contracts , and outsiders find it hard to break in . Astoundingly , young Greek entrepreneurs reportedly fear to incorporate their firms in Greece , lest others use false documents to take away their companies . 
According to the World Bank , Greece is one of the hardest places in Europe to start a business . 
The result is that competition for market share is weak and there are few firms with new ideas . 
This stunted system springs from Greece &apos;s corporatist values , which emphasize social protection , solidarity instead of competition , and discomfort with uncontrolled change . 
These values may well be beneficial for family life ; but , even with the best of intentions , they are a recipe for a static economy and stultified careers . 
Indeed , Greece &apos;s labor productivity ( GDP per worker ) is only 72 % of the level in the UK and Italy , and a mere 57.7 % of that in Germany . 
And surveys indicate that mean life satisfaction in Greece is far below that found in the wealthiest EU countries ( the EU15 ) . 
Contrary to claims by the Greek government , corporatism impoverishes the less advantaged . 
EU data on poverty rates in 2010 put Greece at 21.4 % - far higher than the mean EU15 rate of 16.7 % . 
To be sure , Greece saw productivity gains after World War II - but mostly from increases in education and capital per worker , which can go only so far . 
Two important sources of broad prosperity are blocked by Greece &apos;s system . 
One is an abundance of entrepreneurs engaged in detecting and exploiting new economic opportunities . 
Without them , Greece does a poor job of adjusting to changing circumstances ( an imperative emphasized by Friedrich Hayek ) . 
Greece &apos;s much-lauded shipowners , for example , were too slow to adapt to containerization , and thus lost their market share . 
The other source of broad prosperity is an abundance of business people engaged in conceiving and creating new products and processes - often termed &quot; indigenous innovation . &quot; 
Here , Greece lacks the necessary dynamism : venture capital investment flows are smaller , relative to GDP , in Greece than in any other EU country . 
So Greece &apos;s economy has scant ability to create sustained productivity growth and high human satisfaction . 
Some economists believe that these structural considerations have nothing to do with Greece &apos;s current crisis . 
In fact , a structuralist perspective illuminates what went wrong - and why . 
For several years , Greece drew on the EU &apos;s aptly named &quot; structural funds &quot; and on loans from German and French banks to finance a wide array of highly labor-intensive projects . 
Employment and incomes soared , and savings piled up . 
When that capital inflow stopped , asset prices in Greece fell , and so did demand for labor in the capital-goods sector . 
Moreover , with household wealth having far outstripped wage rates , the supply of labor diminished . 
Thus , Greece went from boom to outright slump . 
The structuralist perspective also explains why recovery has been slow . 
With competition weak , entrepreneurs did not rush to hire the unemployed . 
When recovery began , political unrest last fall nipped confidence in the bud . 
The truth is that Greece needs more than just debt restructuring or even debt relief . 
If young Greeks are to have a future in their own country , they and their elders need to develop the attitudes and institutions that constitute an inclusive modern economy - which means shedding their corporatist values . 
Europe , for its part , must think beyond the necessary reforms of Greece &apos;s pension system , tax regime , and collective-bargaining arrangements . 
While Greece has reached the heights of corporatism , Italy and France are not far behind - and not far behind them is Germany . 
All of Europe , not just Greece , must rethink its economic philosophy .
