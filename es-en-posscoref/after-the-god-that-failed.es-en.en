After the God that Failed 
Discussing morality and politics , it is said , is like discussing vegetarianism with cannibals . 
Much of the public , it seems , thinks this way - for good reason . 
Moral principles and moral obligations in today &apos;s political / economical realm have undoubtedly gone astray , unashamedly displaced by the interests of profit and power . 
The implications are clear . 
In today &apos;s world , &quot; order &quot; reflects a balance of interests that is maintained mainly by force - be it military or financial . 
But something other than this &quot; order of the barracks &quot; is possible . 
Think of it as the order of the church choir , where individual members cooperate on the basis of a shared culture and values . 
One reason for the complete absence of values in &quot; power politics &quot; nowadays is that leaders get away with speaking words whose true meaning they leave out of their policies . 
Moreover , secular spiritual leaders like Gandhi , Schweitzer , and King have vanished , annihilated it seems by our new fetishes - success , expediency , gain , and special interests . 
Of course , the so-called civilized world never managed to create a living utopia . 
Efforts to do so usually ended disastrously . 
As someone born in the old Soviet Union , I know firsthand the despair and brutality of such attempts . 
This does not mean that all efforts to build a more moral world are doomed . 
Having survived an age of extreme ideologies , such as capitalism , communism , and , recently , market fundamentalism , most people no longer seek answers in ideological clich√©s and the driving , purifying force of political certainty . 
Forced harmonization is dead , which opens the door to making new voluntary forms of social harmony possible . 
Let me suggest five steps necessary to begin to bring this about . 
The first calls for the world to deem as utterly unacceptable state violence that seeks to impose conformity and discipline . 
Such violence is unjust on its face because it suppresses and intimidates both body and spirit . 
To achieve this end , however , the state must be stripped of its ability to impose divisive dogmas , traditions , and stereotypes . 
That can happen only if a carefully crafted system of &quot; checks and balances &quot; is established , in which powerful organized interests - states , above all - are restrained in their efforts at dominance . 
Not only political forces need to be checked . 
In the rush to concentrate wealth , for example , majority owners of corporations must not be allowed to harm the interests of minority shareholders , who as a rule are honest common citizens . 
This leads me to my second reform priority : a systemic separation of state power and capital . 
Even in long-established democracies , candidates for elective office are not evaluated according to their wisdom and leadership , but according to the size of their campaign war chests . 
Acquiring government power through possession of capital - and converting it into unjust economic rents - must be curtailed . 
Can such a boundary between power and capital be set ? 
Yes . 
I say this as someone who created significant capital and , having done so , changed her occupation in order to cultivate morality in politics . 
Laws can make the separation of capital and political power transparent for all to see . 
But the will to achieve this division is , sadly , absent among most people in power . 
Related to this , it is necessary to separate mass media from both power and the interests of capital . 
In Europe , America , and Japan , media ownership is increasingly concentrated , which rightly worries citizens in these countries , particularly when media owners move from forming opinion to forming governments . 
How much more worrying , then , is such concentrated ownership in new democracies and developing countries , where the check of civil society is mostly absent ? 
All these reforms presuppose an independent judiciary . 
The autonomy of judges must be assured , which requires that their character is such that people trust their decisions . 
In states where justice is bought by the rich and powerful , this may impossible , but individual judges can and do stand up to power . 
All citizens should support such judicial stalwarts , for their example can refashion an entire justice system . 
In essence , creating a more moral political order requires the removal of money as 
Of course my proposed &quot; transformations &quot; may sound too good to be possible . 
In defense I wish to cite the great Harvard philosopher John Rawls , who died recently . 
Theory , no matter how elegant , Rawls argued , should be dismissed or revised when proven untrue . 
The corollary to this is that institutions and even world orders - no matter how efficient and successful - must be reformed if they are unjust . 
Perhaps only someone who comes from one of the post-Soviet states can conceive of politics in terms of original principles in the manner of Rawls . 
Our newborn states were given the opportunity to create moral political systems on the ruins of a &quot; god that failed . &quot; 
The struggle to do so has been mighty , but despite our travails - and our poverty - I believe that my country has the strength to contribute creatively to this endeavour .
