The Myth of &quot; Eurabia &quot; 
LONDON - There is a powerful narrative today about how many young European Muslims are susceptible to terrorism , how Islam leads to radicalization , and how Muslims , because of their creed , choose to live in ghettos and therefore create swamps that breed terrorists . 
This narrative &apos;s most extreme form is the idea of &quot; Eurabia , &quot; an incendiary term that purportedly describes a phenomenon by which Muslim hordes are now contaminating Europe &apos;s very DNA . 
From this narrative , fear of homegrown terrorism resonates the most , as does the impetus to deal with Muslims as a foreign foe . 
A false dichotomy is created in which Muslims must choose between a Western and European identity or a supposedly separate Islamic identity . 
But the relationship between European Muslims &quot; faith and identification with European nations seldom conforms to the &quot; Eurabia &quot; stereotype . 
A wide-ranging global Gallup study that culminated in the book Who Speaks for Islam : What a Billion Muslims Really Think , by John L. Esposito and Dalia Mogahed , includes detailed and sophisticated analysis of European Muslims &quot; attitudes . 
The results suggest that religious and national identities are complementary , not competing , concepts . 
Muslims living in Paris , London , and Berlin are more religious than the general public , but they are just as likely as anyone else to identify with their nation and its democratic institutions , and just as likely to reject violence . 
The prevailing narrative often regards mosques and Islamic associations as spaces for radicalization , but I contend that some young people are actively turning away from these peaceful institutions . 
This may be because mosques and Islamic associations find it difficult to compete with the promises of solace available through the Internet , where voices can address political issues , feed off injustices around the world , and launch calls to arms that can ultimately be murderous . 
The Internet is where some young Muslims succumb to the alluring narrative of Islam constructed by those behind the terror attacks of our age . 
We also know that the Internet &apos;s devastating impact on handfuls of young people is not confined to the Muslim community , as evidenced by the tragic events in Bridgend in the United Kingdom , where 17 young people , seemingly connected through the Internet , committed suicide . 
For some young Muslims , the paramount sub-culture is virtual , and it operates on the fringes of Muslim communities , whether in Europe or in the Islamic world . 
The story it presents is of a world beset by real injustices , for which the only solution is violent action that will supposedly lead to the victory of a monolithic Muslim world . 
Never mind the inconvenient truth that the acts may be theologically impermissible ; the ends justify the means , and there really is no alternative . 
Such a narrative is appealing because it feeds into the alienation that many young Muslims feel . 
Some may look to unpopular and unjust foreign adventures in Iraq as examples of the futility of lawful political action . 
Others feel suffocated by the prevailing toxic discourse that casts European Muslims as foreign , alien , and suspect . 
Laws enacted to single out and &quot; persecute &quot; Muslims , and statements that affirm the Islamophobia of our media , buttress the absurd notion that what we are really witnessing is a &quot; war on Islam . &quot; 
In Muslim communities everywhere , there is a need to challenge this narrative by making known Islam &apos;s theological repudiation of violence . 
We must redouble our efforts to reach out in local communities and demonstrate the realities of our faith . 
Thus , one should pay tribute to the resilience of Dutch Muslims as they resist the provocations of the right-wing politician Geert Wilders , who is bent on releasing a film that can only inflame public prejudice against Islam . 
Muslims in The Netherlands are responding by opening up their mosques and reaching out to neighbors . 
There is a collective responsibility to treat such problems not as Muslim issues , but as problems whose solutions will enhance the values on which European society is based . 
Addressing the sense of injustice , siege , and alienation faced by young Muslims is not a victory for the extremists . 
Rather , it is a victory for European liberal values because it demonstrates that every individual and every minority is of equal worth . 
Indeed , we should view neither homegrown terrorism nor the presence of Muslims as new to Europe . 
Islam &apos;s interaction with European society sparked a flowering of knowledge , and large numbers of Muslims have inhabited the Balkans and eastern and central Europe for hundreds of years . 
They helped rebuild the economies of war-torn Europe in the 1950 &quot; s , arriving as immigrants and then making Europe their home . 
In almost every field of life , Muslims have been an integral part of the European tapestry . 
All Europeans , including those who are Muslim , are right to worry about the issue of homegrown terrorism . 
Our right to security and life is paramount , as is the need to inhabit a space free of prejudice and suspicion . 
The 7 / 7 bombings in 2005 in my home city of London brought this into sharp relief . 
The victims were of all faiths and races , including Muslims , as were the heroes who helped London get back on its feet so quickly . 
Londoners &quot; collective message after 7 / 7 was decisive , and it must be Europe &apos;s message as well : we will not allow such atrocities to divide us .
