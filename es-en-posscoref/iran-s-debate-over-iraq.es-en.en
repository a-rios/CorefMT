Iran \ u0027s Debate Over Iraq 
No country in the Middle East is monitoring postwar events in Iraq more closely than Iran . 
Geographical proximity , an intense and bloody history of conflict with Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq , religious and emotional connections to Shi &apos;a Iraq , and concerns about the United States and its policies in the region are all threads that tie Iran to its western neighbor . 
Given ongoing tensions with America , Iran is particularly concerned with the likelihood of a continuing US presence next door , as well as with America &apos;s dominant role in shaping Iraq &apos;s post-Saddam future . 
Outsiders may find it difficult to follow internal Iranian debates , but they do exist , and they are intense , even if they are not always visible to the wider international public . 
Three general approaches are recognizable in the evolving Iranian debate on post-Saddam Iraq . 
Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the US in post-Saddam Iraq , if only to ensure the rights of Iraq &apos;s Shi &apos;a population . 
For this reason , Iran should win assurances that a new leadership in Iraq will not be hostile to it , and will seek friendly bilateral relations . 
Other vital considerations for the pragmatists include preserving Iraq &apos;s territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran . 
These moderates think that Iran &apos;s government should press America for extradition of Iraq-based members of the Mujahdin-e Khalq Organization ( MKO ) , as well as its total dismantling . 
In exchange , Iran &apos;s government should give its support to ensuring peace , stability , and security in Iraq . 
In sum , the pragmatists would limit Iranian-American dealings , keeping them focused on an agenda that largely reflects Iran &apos;s domestic concerns . 
By and large , conservative forces in Iran support this approach . 
Another approach envisions a more active , cooperative Iranian role in reconstructing Iraq . 
Advocates of this view argue that Iran is well positioned to make rebuilding easier , owing to its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional ties in Iraq . 
Eventually , it is argued , the US and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation . 
Iranian cooperation should be repaid with the dismantling of the MKO infrastructure in Iraq , perhaps linked to an Iranian commitment to crack down further on any al-Qaida activities , as well as expel al-Qaida members from Iran . 
Most importantly , Iran ought to press for an American assurance that its cooperation will be reciprocated by an American guarantee that Iran will not be a target of American military action in the future . 
In short , advocates of cooperation call for an open and explicit bargain : Iran &apos;s support for stability during the current transitional phase in Iraq , as well as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with whatever permanent government emerges in Iraq , in exchange for an improvement in Iran &apos;s regional and international position . 
This view is widely held among Iran &apos;s reformers - both inside and outside government - and the more internationally minded technocratic and business class . 
Finally , for Iran &apos;s radicals , the possibility of cooperative relations with the US is pure fantasy . 
They believe that America is bent on undermining Iran &apos;s security and compromising its national interests . 
In the radicals &apos; view , the US will at the very least seek to dictate major changes in Iranian foreign policy . 
At most , they argue , America will actively push for regime change in Iran . 
It will actively work against Iran &apos;s acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy , and may yet attempt to weaken Iran &apos;s military capability altogether . 
These radicals view the US invasion of Iraq as reflecting America &apos;s desire to encircle Iran . 
In response , they believe that Iran must be aggressive in defending its interests , forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers , and using Iran &apos;s influence in Iraq to prevent a pro-American , anti-Iran government from emerging in Baghdad . 
Hardliners of all factions support this approach . 
Overthrowing Saddam &apos;s regime was the easy part of the Iraqi crisis . 
Now comes the hard part : establishing peace and security , winning the war on terrorism , and convincing the Muslim masses that America is not intent on occupying Iraq , siphoning off its oil , and reshaping the Middle East in its image . 
In the meantime , opposition to the US , expressed as suicide bombing and other forms of terrorism , will very likely increase . 
Iran is destined to remain a major regional player because its political dynamism and Muslim identity resonate widely in the Muslim world . 
What happens in Iraq has major implications for Iran , and the US is well advised to find ways of recognizing this fact . 
American threats , or talk of another war , fuel the fires of resentment and frustration in Iran , strengthening the most radical forces . 
If the US wishes to avoid this outcome , it must consider limiting the influence of its own radicals , recognizing that America &apos;s interests in Iraq are best served by greater cooperation with Iran .
