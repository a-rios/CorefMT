Why Are Savings Patterns So Different ? 
BEIJING - Ever since the integration of emerging markets into the global economy began in the early 1990 &quot; s , three striking trends have emerged : a divergence in private savings rates between the industrialized core and the emerging periphery ( the former experiencing a sharp rise , and the latter a steady decline ) ; large global imbalances between the two regions ; and a drop in interest rates worldwide . 
But , while global imbalances have preoccupied many observers , few have sought to explain the divergence in world savings behavior . 
In 1988 , the household savings rate in China and the United States was roughly equal , at about 5 % . 
Yet , by 2007 , China &apos;s household savings rate had risen to a staggering 30 % , compared to just 2.5 % in the US . 
The pattern is not uncharacteristic of other industrialized countries relative to emerging markets over the last two decades ( Figure 1 ) . 
Savings behavior invariably reacts to changes in interest rates , which have fallen steadily over the last two decades to today &apos;s record-low levels . 
But how can savings patterns be so different - often opposite - in globalized economies that are well integrated into world capital markets ? 
The answer may be that credit markets are more developed in advanced economies than they are in emerging countries , particularly in terms of the degree to which households are able to borrow . 
Of course , one might argue that Asian thrift and American profligacy merely reflect asymmetric demands for credit : Asians are intrinsically more reluctant to borrow . 
In that case , however , the vast differences in household debt ( Figure 2 ) - ranging from 25 % of GDP in emerging Asia ( Southeast Asia , China , India , Hong Kong , and South Korea ) to more than 90 % in the US and other Anglo-Saxon economies ( including Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom ) - would reflect only a dissimilarity in taste . 
A more plausible explanation is that institutional differences in the ability to borrow dictate to some extent the disparity in savings rates across countries . 
The argument is simple : All economies have both borrowers and savers , and changes in the cost of borrowing ( or the return to saving ) affect them differently . 
When interest rates decline , borrowers are able to borrow more . 
Savers , on the other hand , may be compelled to save more in the face of shrinking interest income . 
At the macro level , a less credit-constrained economy ( with a large mass of effective borrowers ) could then experience a fall in the savings rate as borrowing rose . 
However , in a country with a large mass of effective savers , the savings rate can rise , rather than fall . 
This asymmetry in savings patterns might thus reflect the simple fact that credit-constrained economies are less sensitive to drops in the cost of borrowing relative to less constrained economies . 
In joint research with Nicolas Coeurdacier and St√©phane Guibaud , we show that economic data supports this view . 
Borrowers and savers are naturally grouped by age . 
The young normally face low , current wage income , but faster growth in future income , and would ideally borrow against future income to augment consumption today and to invest in education . 
The middle-aged , preparing for retirement , are likely to be the economy &apos;s savers . 
If asymmetric credit constraints are indeed important , young borrowers and middle-aged savers will display distinct patterns in constrained versus less-constrained economies . 
In fact , there was a remarkable contrast in savings behavior across age groups in China and the US in the period 1992-2009 . 
For young Americans ( those under 25 ) , the borrowing rate rose by ten percentage pointsmore than the borrowing rate of young Chinese , while the savings rate of the Chinese working-age population ( ages 35-54 ) rose by about 17 percentage points more than the savings rate of their American counterparts . 
Another implication of this view is that the steep rise in savings in China is largely driven by a rise in the savings rate of middle-aged Chinese ( rather than a fall in the borrowing rate of the young ) . 
Conversely , the fall in savings in the US is largely due to higher borrowing by the young ( rather than a fall in middle-aged Americans &quot; savings rate ) . 
Indeed , of the 20.2-percentage-point increase in aggregate household savings ( as a share of GDP ) in China from 1992 to 2009 , the middle-aged cohort accounted for more than 60 % ( the remainder was largely attributable to the elderly ) . 
In the US , which experienced a 1.8-percentage-point decline in aggregate savings as a share of GDP , the savings-to-GDP ratio among the young declined by 1.25 percentage points , whereas the figure for middle-aged savers actually increased by about 1.5 percentage points . 
Apart from accounting for the global divergence in savings rates , tight credit constraints in China might explain the country &apos;s high , and rising , savings rate - especially as the large rise in national savings is attributable mostly to household savings . 
This would mean that China &apos;s much-publicized effort to boost domestic consumption might in fact call for appropriate credit-market reforms . 
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s notion of a &quot; global savings glut &quot; is a commonly cited explanation for falling world interest rates . 
Credit constraints in fast-growing developing economies may be the reason why the glut emerged in the first place .
