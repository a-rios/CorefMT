PISA &apos;s Promise 
PARIS - By assessing the capabilities and knowledge of students in the highest-performing and most rapidly improving education systems , the OECD &apos;s Program for International Student Assessment provides valuable options for reform and information on how to achieve it . 
PISA brings together policymakers , educators , and researchers from around the world to discuss what knowledge students need to become successful and responsible citizens in today &apos;s world , and how to develop more effective , inclusive education systems . 
Some claim that the PISA results are based on too wide a range of factors to be relevant , while others point out the challenges inherent in testing students in various languages and with different cultural backgrounds . 
Of course , comparing education across countries is not easy , but PISA remains the most useful tool yet developed for policymakers attempting to improve their national education systems . 
Before PISA , many governments claimed that they oversaw the world &apos;s most successful education systems , and insisted that they had already taken the steps needed to address any shortcomings . 
By exposing weaknesses in a particular country &apos;s system , PISA assessments help to ensure that policymakers recognize - and , it is hoped , address - remaining deficiencies . 
The sense of accountability that PISA fosters among governments and education ministers has helped to spur them into action . 
The OECD established PISA as a global assessment , because in today &apos;s globalized world students must be able to collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds and appreciate different ideas , perspectives , and values . 
To give students the best possible chance to succeed , education must prepare them to handle issues that transcend national boundaries . 
But PISA &apos;s most important outcomes lie at the national level , because it inspires innovation and broadens educational perspectives within countries . 
Education systems as diverse as those in Finland , Japan , China , and Canada - which seldom registered on policymakers &quot; radars before - have become global reference points for excellence in education , helping other countries to design effective reforms . 
When Brazil emerged as the lowest-performing education system in the first PISA assessment , released in 2000 , many people rightly questioned the fairness of comparing an emerging economy to advanced countries like Finland and Japan . 
But Brazil rose to the challenge , making massive investments in improving the quality of teaching . 
The country now boasts one of the world &apos;s most rapidly improving education systems . 
Germany also featured in PISA 2000 , recording below-average performance and large social inequalities in education - an outcome that stunned Germans and initiated a months-long public debate . 
Spurred into action , the government launched initiatives to support disadvantaged and immigrant students , and made the notion of early childhood education a driving force in German education policy . 
Today , PISA reports confirm that the quality and fairness of Germany &apos;s education system have improved considerably . 
Even in the world &apos;s best-performing education systems , PISA helps to pinpoint areas for improvement . 
For example , PISA assessments have revealed that , while Japanese students excel at reproducing what they have learned , they often struggle when asked to extrapolate from that knowledge and apply it creatively . 
The effort that this has inspired to create more innovative learning environments was apparent last April , during a visit to the Tohoku schools destroyed by the 2011 tsunami . 
This experience offers yet another lesson : even in cases where social and cultural factors seem to be the main force shaping a country &apos;s education style , improvements are possible . 
Countries like Japan do not have to change their cultures to address their educational shortcomings ; they simply have to adjust their policies and practices . 
Creating a global platform for collaboration in education research and innovation has been the PISA initiative &apos;s aspiration from its conception in the late 1990s . 
Since then , policymakers , researchers , and experts have built the world &apos;s largest professional network dedicated to the development of robust , reliable , and internationally comparable information on student learning outcomes . 
At the same time , PISA measures students &quot; social and emotional skills and attitudes toward learning , as well as educational equity and parental support - all of which provides indispensable context for understanding scores on international assessments . 
Of course , assessments do not cover every important skill or attitude . 
But there is convincing evidence that the knowledge and skills that the PISA system assesses are essential to students &quot; future success , and the OECD works continuously to broaden the range of cognitive and social skills that PISA measures . 
PISA has already prompted important advances in education worldwide . 
The OECD will continue to work with the 80 participating countries to develop the program further , so that it can continue to help policymakers and educators design and implement better education policies - and give their citizens access to the tools that they need to build better lives .
