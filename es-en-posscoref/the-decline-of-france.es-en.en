The Decline of France ? 
The French are notoriously sensitive - if not defensive - about France &apos;s stature in the world . 
The French state spends vast amounts of money to propagate the French language and French culture , yet the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it once was . 
No surprise , then , that during the last presidential election , the publication of a European Commission report claiming France &apos;s economic rank among European countries had fallen from 3 rd to 10 th place in the span of ten years caused soul searching and controversy . 
Soon , President Jacques Chirac was accusing his rival , Lionel Jospin , of causing the &quot; French decline . &quot; 
The OECD and Eurostat , the European body in charge of such data , thought they put an end to this aspect of the debate by showing that France , Germany , Italy , and Great Britain all enjoy roughly equal per capita living standards . 
But the broader controversy wouldn &apos;t go away . 
Worried talk about &quot; French decline &quot; reappeared with this year &apos;s street protests against pension reform , mounting disputes over fiscal policy with the European Commission , and bickering with America over the war in Iraq . 
Today &apos;s best-selling non-fiction book in France is a polemic by Nicolas Baverez , La France qui tombe ( Falling France ) . 
Baverez &apos;s book is filled with quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon . 
According to the author , France &apos;s last great achievements were in the 1970 &apos;s , when the fast train , the TGV , and Airbus were launched . 
He castigates both Mitterrand and Chirac for their &quot; common talent to win elections and turn France into a loser . &quot; 
The book &apos;s success is itself a sign of a kind of &quot; malaise . &quot; 
But of which kind ? 
Baverez &apos;s evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes . 
For example , he cites the draining away of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of France &apos;s decline . 
But deindustrialization is common to all advanced countries . 
Indeed , France does actually better than most of its rich country rivals and , unlike Germany , the UK , or the US , has retained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970 &apos;s . 
Moreover , according to a better measure of comptetitiveness , foreign investment , France does very well . 
According to a recent report by the Economic Analysis Council , direct investment in France grew to 60 billion euros in 2001 , almost twice that of Germany . 
French cost competitiveness also improved ( by 20 % ) in the last three decades , with higher productivity offsetting rapid wage growth . 
But the core of France &apos;s long-run economic problems is precisely the fear of losing industrial jobs . 
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional areas such as automobile and aerospace industries , but it is falling behind in innovative markets , where smaller companies spread new technologies . 
France , for instance , spends only $ 30 billion annually on high tech R D , compared with $ 51 billion in Germany , $ 98 billion in Japan , and $ 265 billion in the US . 
In short , Baverez &apos;s analysis points in the wrong direction . 
France has undergone a set of critically important reforms over the past two decades : economic and financial liberalization , elimination of price and foreign exchange controls , the end of credit restrictions , European liberalization , reduced inflation and trade deficits , the advent of the euro and the forced globalization of the country &apos;s firms . 
The French malaise has nothing to do with any of them . 
France &apos;s problem is that it fails to recognize the new world of which it already is a part . 
French state capitalism is dead , and France is finding it hard to come to terms with its passing . 
Indeed , France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister , Lionel Jospin , feels obliged to apologize the day after for saying on TV that &quot; the state is not omnipotent . &quot; 
There are many reasons for this French schyzophrenia , but a critical one has to do with the political game of the past 20 years . 
Until 1981 , France had a clear division between right and left . 
Since then , both the Mitterand and Chirac administrations blunted their ideological edge in order to carry the difficult process of adjustment towards Europe and globalization . 
A round of &quot; shock therapy &quot; Ã  la Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago might have forged a new political consciousness . 
This is a key reason for the political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign , when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential election , ahead of the incumbent Prime Minister , Lionel Jospin . 
The rise of the extreme left , which gathered 10 % of the vote during that presidential campaign , also attests to this political failure . 
France needs a political revolution more than an economic one if it is to come to terms with reality , part of which is that &quot; French decline &quot; is a fear of the French people &apos;s own making .
