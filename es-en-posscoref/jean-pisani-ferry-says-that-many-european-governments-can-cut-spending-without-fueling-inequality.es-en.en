Cut the Spending , Spare the Poor 
PARIS - Why do some governments spend more than others ? 
The question is more complicated than it appears , especially in the case of European governments . 
The answer may look obvious when comparing , say , Denmark ( where public spending , excluding interest payments on debt , amounted to 58 % of GDP in 2012 ) and the United States ( where the same number was 35 % ) . 
Extensive public services and a comprehensive welfare state appear to be the indisputable explanation . 
The data seem to vindicate German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s famous statement that Europe &apos;s problem is that it accounts for 7 % of the world &apos;s population , 25 % of its GDP , and 50 % of its social spending . 
From this perspective , European governments face an uncomfortable choice . 
Most are seeking ways to contain public indebtedness , trim deficits , and cut spending without making their poorer citizens worse off . 
But , judging by the experience of the US and other non-European countries , they may have to choose between insolvency and inequality . 
Having reached the point at which taxes can scarcely be increased further , these governments cannot both repay their debts and keep welfare spending at current levels . 
The answer , however , is less obvious when comparing European countries to one another . 
Most share a preference for socializing risk and an aversion to inequality - the pillars of the &quot; European social model . &quot; 
Yet their public-spending levels differ significantly . 
The highest spender is Denmark , with its 58 % -of-GDP mark , which is a whopping 13 percentage points higher than in Spain . 
Even more striking perhaps , French public bodies spend 12 percentage points of GDP more than those in Germany , with no significant difference in outcomes in terms of health , education , or poverty . 
This suggests that some countries are more efficient at social welfare than others . 
Furthermore , some countries have succeeded in reducing their public spending significantly without changing their social model altogether . 
Swedish public spending is nine percentage points lower than it was in 1995 . 
There were welfare-spending cuts along the road , yet the country still ranks at or near the top of most development indicators and continues to be perceived as a social-democratic role model . 
This is not to say that all European countries provide the same social safety net . 
Unemployment benefits or public pensions are not identical in , say , Ireland and Finland . 
But differences in public-spending levels are not matched one for one by differences in social outcomes . 
There are several explanations for that . 
Some health-care systems are simply better managed than others , because expensive equipment is used more intensively , patients are provided with generics instead of premium drugs , and timely prevention helps contain treatment costs . 
More efficient health care does not presuppose higher inequality ; on the contrary , it may reduce inequality . 
A second reason for the significant differences in European countries &quot; spending levels is that public and private expenditure can be highly substitutable . 
Contributions to a public pay-as-you-go pension system are very similar to those made to a mandatory private insurance system . 
For example , one reason why France spends a lot on public pensions is that there are virtually no private pension schemes in the country . 
If employees were mandated to subscribe to a company or industry fund , public spending would mechanically drop , but not much would change . 
True , public pension schemes generally involve some degree of redistribution . 
But they mostly take money from employees when they are active to redistribute it to them when they retire . 
The difficult question is whether employees in fact regard these contributions as their own savings or merely as taxes - in which case they may discourage labor or create incentives to work in the black economy . 
In any case , if desired , substitution of private for public pension schemes may help reduce government spending without major distributive effects . 
A third reason for the disparities in European public-spending levels is that governments often aim at alleviating the consequences of market inefficiencies - and miss the mark . 
Consider housing . 
But they often do much more : they provide unnecessary support to middle-class households - or , worse , subsidize landlords indirectly by helping tenants pay the rent . 
The same applies to labor-market or enterprise policies . 
Public spending in these cases does not serve its stated aims ; rather , it finances middle-class welfare or even capital owners &quot; welfare . 
Cutting such spending may be difficult in the short term , but it can be achieved without adverse social consequences in the medium term . 
In the end , it is difficult to disentangle the various causes of higher public spending in some countries relative to others . 
Clearly , some social models are more generous than others , and some are more efficient than others . 
But , though some governments have no choice but to cut inequality-reducing programs , and others may find it more politically expedient to change the distribution of income than to enforce efficiency , much can be done to improve the cost-effectiveness of public spending before reneging on a social contract . 
Europe &apos;s governments can still trim public spending without undermining the European social model .
