After the Iran Deal 
BERLIN - After 12 years of tedious negotiations , Iran and the &quot; P5 + 1 &quot; countries ( China , France , Russia , the United States , and the United Kingdom , plus Germany ) have reached a comprehensive agreement that will limit Iran &apos;s development of its nuclear capabilities to non-military objectives . 
In exchange for its cooperation , Iran will eventually be relieved of the punishing sanctions that the United Nations , the European Union , and the US have imposed upon it for years . 
This is a huge diplomatic success . 
Of course , the negotiations have attracted plenty of critics , including in the US Congress and Iran &apos;s parliament , as well as in Saudi Arabia , Israel , and even France . 
But the agreement &apos;s potential benefits cannot be denied . 
For starters , the deal proves that world leaders - despite being divided on a multitude of issues , such as the conflict in Ukraine and territorial disputes in the South China Sea - can still come together to resolve a shared problem . 
It will also make nuclear proliferation in the Middle East less likely , while strengthening the global nuclear non-proliferation regime . 
And it will allow for the normalization of Iran &apos;s relations with the West . 
Of course , Iran &apos;s neighbors have legitimate concerns about the impact the deal will have on the regional balance of power . 
As sanctions are lifted , Iran will become stronger , challenging the influence of the Gulf States . 
Anticipating this , these states have already sought reassurances from the US , while following a more hard-nosed policy in Yemen or Syria , where they consider themselves to be containing Iran &apos;s hegemonic ambitions . 
Ultimately , however , the impact of the nuclear agreement will depend on political dynamics in Iran . 
Many - indeed , probably a majority - in the Iranian establishment support the resolution of the nuclear confrontation , and agree that Iran does not need to be perpetually at odds with the rest of the world . 
This post-agreement dynamic thus could play out in two ways . 
In the first scenario , events unfold according to the hopes of the P5 + 1 and the Iranian negotiators , with the agreement amplifying the voices of those in Iran who advocate regional and international accommodation . 
In this case , Iran reaches out to Saudi Arabia with a convincing indication that it does not intend to bolster its influence at the expense of the Saudis or their allies . 
This allows Saudi Arabia to join Iran in using its influence in Syria to bring about a ceasefire agreement between regime forces and rebels , paving the way for the formation of a credible transition government capable of pushing back the Islamic State . 
Likewise , Saudi Arabia and Iran bring an end to the fighting in Yemen by backing a power-sharing agreement there . 
Meanwhile , relief from sanctions , together with the gradual return of international companies , kick-starts Iran &apos;s ailing economy . 
Increased openness toward Europe and , more cautiously , the US encourages reform-minded members of Iran &apos;s middle class to seek their future inside the country , rather than emigrating . 
Finally , under this scenario , President Hassan Rouhani &apos;s strong international standing helps him to overcome conservative resistance to pursue much-needed domestic reforms . 
On this basis , Rouhani &apos;s coalition of reformists and pragmatists easily wins a majority when Iran &apos;s next parliament is elected in 2016 , with Rouhani himself re-elected in 2017 . 
The second scenario is far less benign . 
In this case , it soon becomes clear that domestic support for the nuclear agreement was broad but thin . 
Whereas Rouhani &apos;s reformist camp wants to improve Iran &apos;s foreign relations , the conservative and nationalist forces surrounding Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei view the agreement as a necessary tool to eliminate economic sanctions and strengthen Iran &apos;s conventional military capabilities . 
The hardline clerics then undermine whatever confidence Rouhani is building with Iran &apos;s neighbors by declaring repeatedly that the agreement represents an implicit acknowledgement of Iran &apos;s might by the world &apos;s major powers . 
This stance vindicates the skeptics , spurring Saudi Arabia to continue its efforts to build a &quot; Sunni coalition &quot; to contain Iranian influence and uphold the fight against what it views as Iranian proxies in countries like Syria and Yemen . 
Furthermore , with regional tensions high , the economic impact of the removal of sanctions turns out to be negligible , while conservatives gain ground in resisting reform . 
Rouhani and his allies are unable to offer ordinary Iranians economic hope - a failure that causes them to lose both the legislative and presidential elections . 
Paradoxically , in the pessimistic scenario , Iran &apos;s new government , controlled by conservatives and hardliners , actually fits into the region better than the current one . 
After all , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and many other Arab states are also ruled by authoritarian hardliners with little interest in de-escalating regional conflicts . 
This would make the resurgence of reform-oriented leadership in Iran extremely difficult . 
Of course , the most likely scenario is a combination of both dynamics . 
But , given that it is in everyone &apos;s interest to ensure that developments hew more closely to the reform-oriented path , it should be clear to all that the diplomatic work with regard to Iran is far from complete .
