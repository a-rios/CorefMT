The ECB &apos;s Secret Bailout Strategy 
MUNICH - Why did Greece , Ireland , and Portugal have to seek shelter under the European Union &apos;s rescue umbrella , and why is Spain a potential candidate ? 
For many , the answer is obvious : international markets no longer want to finance the &quot; GIPS . &quot; 
But that is only half true . 
In fact , international markets have not financed any of them to a considerable extent for the past three years ; the European Central Bank has . 
The so-called &quot; Target &quot; accounts , hitherto ignored by the media , show that the ECB has been much more involved in rescue operations than is commonly known . 
But now the ECB no longer wants to do it , and is urging eurozone members to step in . 
Normally , a country &apos;s current-account deficit ( trade deficit minus transfers from other countries ) is financed with foreign private capital . 
In a currency union , however , central-bank credit may play this role if private capital flows are insufficient . 
This is what happened in the eurozone when the interbank market first broke down in mid-2007 . 
The GIPS &quot; own central banks started to lend newly printed money to their private banks , and this money was then used to finance the current account deficit . 
These funds went to the exporting countries , where they circulated as part of normal transactions . 
The exporting countries &quot; central banks responded by reducing their emissions of fresh money to be lent to the domestic economy . 
In effect , central-bank money lending in exporting countries , above all in Germany , was diverted to the GIPS . 
The ECB &apos;s policy was not inflationary , because the aggregate stock of central-bank money in the eurozone was unaffected . 
But , as GIPS &quot; central-bank lending came at the expense of central-bank lending within the eurozone &apos;s exporting countries , the policy amounted to a forced capital export from these countries to the GIPS . 
The amount of the ECB &apos;s &quot; replacement lending &quot; is shown by the so-called Target2 account , which measures the deficit or surplus of a country &apos;s financial transactions with other countries . 
As the account includes international payments for both trade in goods and financial claims , a deficit in a country &apos;s Target account indicates foreign borrowing via the ECB , whereas a surplus denotes foreign lending via the ECB . 
The balance is not reported on the ECB &apos;s balance sheet , since it is zero in the aggregate , but it does show up on the respective balance sheets of the national central banks as interest-bearing claims against , and liabilities to , the ECB system . 
Until mid-2007 , the Target accounts were close to zero , but since then , they have grown by about € 100 billion per year . 
For example , the Bundesbank &apos;s Target claims ballooned from € 5 billion in 2006 to € 323 billion by March 2011 . 
The counterpart to these claims were the GIPS &quot; liabilities , which had grown to about € 340 billion by the end of last year . 
Interestingly , the GIPS &quot; cumulative current-account deficits from 2008 through 2010 were of roughly the same order of magnitude - € 365 billion , to be precise . 
Had the ECB failed to finance these deficits , the GIPS would have had a hard time finding the money to pay for their net imports . 
If they succeeded at all , high interest rates would have induced them to tighten their belts , and their current-account deficits , which in the case of Greece and Portugal exceeded 10 % of GDP , would have diminished . 
One should not criticize the ECB for propping up the GIPS &quot; current accounts during the global crisis . 
Unconventional measures were necessary to prevent their economies from collapsing . 
But it should be clear that this was not a sui generis monetary policy ; it was a bailout . 
Now that the world economy has largely recovered from the crisis , it is time to end this policy - not least because the ECB is running out of ammunition . 
By the end of last year , the aggregate stock of central-bank money in the euro area was € 1.07 trillion euros , and € 380 billion euros was already absorbed by ECB credit to the GIPS . 
So financing a continued GIPS current-account deficit of about € 100 billion a year would consume the entire stock of base money within another six or seven years . 
To exit this policy , the ECB wants the EU &apos;s Luxembourg rescue facility , EFSF or ESM to take over , and some countries even call for the issuance of eurobonds . 
But this would simply prolong community financing of the GIPS &quot; current-account deficits , now in its fourth year , for another couple of years . 
In the end , either the euro will collapse , or a transfer union will be established in Europe , in which the current-account deficits will be financed with inter-country donations . 
It would be better if the EU kept the Luxembourg fund for real emergency measures , and if the ECB instructed its member institutions in the GIPS to demand significantly better collateral for their lending operations . 
Tight national caps on Target balances could provide the right incentive to comply . 
Such a cap would not eliminate current-account deficits , but it would reduce deficits to the flow of private capital willing to finance them . 
Setting a cap on Target accounts is a fundamentally more appropriate policy to keep current-account deficits in check than the wage policies contemplated by the new Pact for the Euro . 
Wage policies are appropriate only for centrally planned economies . 
Perhaps the GIPS should ponder how Italy handled itself . 
Even though it had to pay interest premiums and was running a current-account deficit , Mario Draghi ( the leading contender to take over the ECB this autumn ) kept his central bank &apos;s lending under tight control throughout the crisis . 
Although it must have been sorely tempted , Italy did not accumulate Target deficits . 
It opted for virtuous abstention .
