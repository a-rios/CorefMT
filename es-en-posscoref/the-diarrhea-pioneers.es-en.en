The Diarrhea Pioneers 
PALO ALTO - On top of the devastation caused in Haiti by the January earthquake , Hurricane Tomas this month , and the subsequent dislocations , exposure , and malnutrition , the country is now experiencing an accelerating cholera outbreak . 
At least 8,000 people are currently in hospital , and the death toll is near 600 from this waterborne bacterial disease . 
And , given the widespread unavailability of clean water , basic sanitation , and medical facilities , those numbers are sure to increase . 
Even in the absence of natural disasters , diarrhea is the number-two infectious killer of children under the age of five in developing countries ( surpassed only by respiratory diseases ) , accounting for roughly two million deaths a year . 
However , thanks to a simple but ingenious innovation by an emerging bioscience company , those numbers could become a relic of the past , like mortality from smallpox and bubonic plague . 
Since the 1960 &quot; s , the standard of care for childhood diarrhea in the developing world has been the World Health Organization &apos;s formulation of rehydration solution , a glucose-based , high-sodium liquid that is administered orally . 
This low-tech product was revolutionary . 
It saved countless lives and reduced the need for costly ( and often unavailable ) hospital stays and intravenous rehydration . 
However , this product did nothing to lessen the severity or duration of the condition , which over time leads to malnutrition , anemia , and other chronic health risks . 
Other approaches to treatments and preventative measures - including changes in public-health policy , improvement of water treatment , and development of vaccines - have not yielded significant , cost-effective results . 
The solution ( literally and figuratively ) may be an ingenious , affordable innovation from Ventria Bioscience that combines high- and low-tech components to deliver what could be a veritable Holy Grail : two proteins produced inexpensively in rice that radically improve the effectiveness of rehydration solutions . 
It has been known for decades that breast-fed children get sick with diarrhea and other infections less often than those fed with formula . 
Research in Peru has shown that fortifying oral rehydration solution with two of the primary protective proteins in breast milk , lactoferrin and lysozyme , lessens the duration of diarrhea and reduces the rate of recurrence . 
The availability of such an oral rehydration solution to people in the developing world would be a near-miraculous advance . 
Ventria joined with researchers at the University of California , Davis , and at a leading children &apos;s hospital and a nutrition institute in Lima , Peru , to test the effects of adding lactoferrin and lysozyme to a rice-based oral rehydration solution . 
The new brew provides more nutrition than glucose-based oral rehydration solution and tastes better to kids , so they are more likely to drink it . 
The researchers found that when lactoferrin and lysozyme are added to solution , the children &apos;s illness is cut from more than five days to 3.7 . 
This improvement is thought to be caused by the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin and lysozyme , long known to be the primary protective proteins in breast milk . 
Moreover , over the twelve-month follow-up period , the children who had received the rice-based solution had less than half the recurrence rate of diarrhea ( 8 % versus 18 % in the control sample ) . 
This effect is probably caused by the lactoferrin , which promotes repair of the diarrhea-damaged cells of the intestinal mucosa . 
What makes this approach to managing diarrhea feasible is Ventria &apos;s invention of a genetic-engineering method that uses rice to produce lactoferrin and lysozyme . 
This process , dubbed &quot; biopharming , &quot; is an inexpensive and ingenious way to synthesize the large quantities of the proteins that will be necessary . 
In effect , the rice plants &quot; inputs are carbon dioxide , water , soil , and the sun &apos;s energy , and its output is a rice kernel containing large amounts of the proteins . 
The kernel is processed to extract and purify the proteins , which are then used to formulate the improved rehydration solution . 
Rice is self-pollinating , so out-crossing - interbreeding with other rice varieties - is virtually impossible . 
However , to ameliorate even such hypothetical concerns , Ventria has chosen to grow its rice in Kansas , where there are no other rice growers . 
The proteins used to supplement the oral rehydration solution have the same structure and functional properties as those in natural breast milk , and the process is analogous to that used routinely for the production of proteins from other organisms , such as bacteria and yeast . 
The proteins were judged by a regulatory panel of experts to be &quot; Generally Recognized As Safe &quot; ( GRAS ) for inclusion in food products like oral rehydration solution . 
The typical approach prior to commercialization would be a notification to the United States Food 
Then , the regulators &quot; review would take no more than six months . 
But , while the first GRAS notification was submitted to FDA in 2004 and was followed by further notifications , the FDA took no action ; eventually , Ventria withdrew the notifications in March of this year . 
Although the company could market the product without the FDA &apos;s approval , the financial risks would be prohibitive . 
Researchers at the University of California , Davis , have faced similar regulatory obstacles in attempting to produce lysozyme in the milk of genetically engineered goats . 
Their solution was to move the project to Brazil , where it is progressing . 
Biopharming has brought us to the verge of a safe , affordable solution to one of the developing world &apos;s most pressing health problems . 
But , thanks to bureaucratic obstructionism , it will come too late for the many who will be stricken with diarrheal diseases in Haiti and other poor countries in the coming weeks and months . 
Regulators and public-health authorities should be beating down doors and demanding life-saving products like lactoferrin and lysozyme . 
Instead , all we hear from them is a deafening silence - and , in Haiti and elsewhere , the silence of the grave .
