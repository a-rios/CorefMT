Populists Are Sometimes Right 
Developing countries are often advised ( or instructed ) to undertake reforms recommended by &quot; experts &quot; who are called &quot; technocrats &quot; and are often backed by the IMF . 
Opposition to the reforms they propose is usually dismissed as &quot; populist . &quot; 
Countries that fail to undertake these reforms are dismissed as craven or lacking political will , and soon suffer the consequences : higher interest rates when borrowing abroad . 
But look closely at some of these &quot; technocratic &quot; proposals : many are more often based on ideology than economic science . 
Technocrats can of course reliably make an electricity plant work better . 
The goal is simple : to produce electricity at as low a price as possible . 
This is mostly a matter of engineering , not politics . 
Economic policies are usually not technocratic in this sense . 
They involve tradeoffs : some may lead to higher inflation but lower unemployment ; some help investors , others workers . 
Economists call policies where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off Pareto efficient . 
If a single policy is better than all others for everyone , i.e. , has no Pareto-efficient alternatives , it is said to be Pareto dominant . 
If choices among policies were purely Paretian , i.e. , if no one was made worse off by choosing one policy , as against another , the choices involved would indeed be purely &quot; technical . &quot; 
But in reality , few policy choices are Paretian . 
Instead , some policies are better for some groups , but worse for others . 
Different policies benefit and hurt different groups . 
In East Asia , for example , IMF bailouts helped international lenders , but hit workers and domestic firms hard . 
Different policies might have imposed more risk on international lenders , and less on workers and domestic firms . 
Deciding which policy to choose involves choices among values , not just technical questions about which policy is in some morally uncontroversial sense &quot; better . &quot; 
These value choices are political choices , which cannot be left to technocrats . 
Of course , there is scope for technical analysis even when political choices are at the crux of the decision . 
Technocrats can sometimes help avoid Pareto inferior policies , that is , policies that make everyone worse off . 
Sometimes there are policies that can promote both growth and equality , and the job of good economists is to search for them . 
The problem is that many policies advanced by technocrats as if they were Pareto efficient are in fact flawed and make many people - sometimes entire countries - worse off . 
Look at the litany of technocratically inspired examples of privatization and deregulation in the 1990 &apos;s . 
Banking &quot; reform , &quot; for example , frequently soon required government bail-outs , leaving a few people much richer , but the country much poorer . 
These failures suggest that we should have less confidence in the supposed professional skills of technocrats - or at least less confidence than they have in themselves . 
But there is also a more fundamental point here . 
Democratic processes are likely to be more sensitive to the real consequences of policies , to the real tradeoffs involved . 
Of course , some criticisms of technocratic remedies may be populist posturing , but sometimes they contain insights that ivory-towered ( and usually US-trained ) technocrats miss . 
Consider the case of Mexico , where a proposal to raise revenue by taxing food and medicines consumed by the poor was , unsurprisingly , rejected by a democratically accountable legislature . 
Rejecting this proposal was not a matter of unbridled populism . 
The problem was with the proposal . 
Its advocates argued that efficiency required adopting a comprehensive Value Added Tax . 
Advanced industrial countries in Europe use such a tax . 
Developing countries , the technocrats said , should do likewise . 
But there is a fundamental difference between developed European countries and emerging markets : the size of the informal sector , from which VAT is not collected . 
This vast &quot; black economy &quot; makes VAT inefficient in most developing countries . 
Indeed , because VAT is a tax on the formal sector - the new factories , banks , and so forth that pay regular salaries and whose incomes and expenditures can easily be traced ( as distinct from those of the cash-based street vendors , village enterprises , and poor farmers )  - VAT impedes development . 
The logic is simple . 
Developing countries that impose a VAT perversely encourage production to remain in the informal sector , which often produces the goods that are consumed domestically or used as inputs in the developed world . 
But it is the formal sector that produces higher value-added manufactured goods that compete with developed countries . 
There are other sources of tax revenue in many developing countries that are both more equitable and distort economic incentives far less than VAT . 
Many developing countries lack a corporate income tax : the huge profits of the telecom , cement , and other monopoly sectors escape taxation . 
It may also be possible to impose taxes on luxury goods ( many of which are imported ) , thereby promoting equity without stifling growth . 
Economic theory supports a VAT only if one does not care about distribution and if one can impose a tax on all commodities . 
You don &apos;t need an economics doctorate to recognize that , in developing countries , you can &apos;t impose a tax on all commodities . 
Moreover , you should care about equity . 
So the next time you hear rumblings in the legislature of an emerging democratic country against this or that &quot; technocratic &quot; proposal , think twice before dismissing the deputies &apos; doubts as populist rants . 
Perhaps the populists are popular because they know something that the technocrats don &apos;t .
