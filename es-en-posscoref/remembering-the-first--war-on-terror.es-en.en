Remembering the First \ 
In June , NATO &apos;s leaders commemorated the 60th anniversary of D-Day , the allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France . 
This August , they passed up the opportunity to mark the 90th anniversary of the start of World War I , which led to calamities that echoed until the twentieth century &apos;s end . 
But the lessons of the Great War are no less important today , particularly for the United States . 
The causes of World War I have long baffled the public and historians . 
Europe was at the peak of its economic power relative to the rest of the world . 
Peace among the major European countries had reigned more or less continuously for decades . 
A technology boom was revolutionizing , indeed globalizing , the world economy . 
For increasingly rich Europeans , the summer of 1914 seemed a peaceful , lazy time . 
It turned out to be their last real peace for decades . 
That July , terrorists in Bosnia assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Habsburg Empire . 
Austria responded by invading Serbia , Bosnia &apos;s neighbor and an &quot; upstart &quot; Slavic power . 
Russia mobilized to support Serbia , while Germany launched a &quot; pre-emptive &quot; war against France and Russia , invading France via Belgium . 
Great Britain came to the defense of Belgium and France . 
By September &apos;s end , a general conflagration was underway . 
But why did the pieces of the puzzle fall into place as they did ? 
Was it bad luck , miscalculation , or bureaucratic error ? 
It turns out that the German Army Chief of Staff Helmuth von Moltke was eager for war in the summer of 1914 . 
As historian David Fromkin shows in his recent book Europe &apos;s Last Summer , von Moltke feared that Russia was gaining too much industrial strength , and that in a few years Russia could withstand a war with Germany . 
Moltke wanted to invade and defeat Russia before it was &quot; too late &quot; for Germany to triumph . 
The Archduke &apos;s assassination provided a perfect pretext . 
The Germans encouraged their ally Austria to respond by invading Serbia , under the clear expectation that this would trigger war , but in a way that Germany would not be blamed . 
Fromkin shows that the assassination of Ferdinand merely provided Germany an excuse to fight a European War while it still had , according to its calculations , a chance of winning . 
Every calculation proved to be disastrously wrong . 
Imperial Germany was not threatened by Russian industrial dominance in the way von Moltke feared , and its military calculations also failed . 
Germany did not knock out France and then conquer Russia . 
Eventually , Czarist Russia collapsed , opening the way to the Bolshevik Revolution . 
Germany &apos;s launch of WWI ninety years ago this month had a more devastating effect on the world economy than any single event in human history . 
The war bled Europe of a generation of youth , and set the stage for a second war a generation later . 
It opened the way for 75 years of Soviet communism , and set in motion the financial instability that led to the Great Depression as well as the collapse of the international trading system . 
All of this matters now because last year America launched a war in which a terrorist attack was also an excuse , not the real cause . 
The Bush administration wanted to fight Saddam Hussein well before the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11 , 2001 , but it could not have gained public support . 
Just as Fromkin shows with regard to Germany in 1914 , the Bush administration manipulated US public opinion to support the Iraq War as a war on terror , even though Iraq had nothing to do with any terrorist attack against the US . 
We know from a long trail of documents , memoirs , and interviews that the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 were a pretext . 
Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and Paul Wolfowitz wanted war with Saddam all through the 1990 &apos;s , and urged &quot; regime change &quot; as a policy for President Clinton , who wisely rejected such irresponsible advice . 
Their eagerness for war had several causes . 
They wanted to seize control of Iraq &apos;s oil . 
They wanted a new &quot; home base &quot; in the Middle East if Saudi Arabia soured . 
They wanted to protect Israel from Saddam . 
They also had exaggerated fears about American weaknesses , just as von Moltke had exaggerated fears about German weaknesses vis-Ã -vis Russia . 
As we know from WWI , wars founded on lies are likely to produce a series of disastrous unforeseen consequences . 
The ricochet effects of the Iraq War have combined to yield a mounting threat to stability and security . 
Perhaps the aggressive actions of the US and a resulting backlash in the Islamic world will contribute to nuclear proliferation in Iran , or to nuclear Pakistan someday falling into the hands of extremists . 
World leaders should still gather to commemorate WWI , in the hope that they might learn enough to avoid repeating its disaster in our time . 
The Iraq War is not WWI . 
We still have time to avoid further devastating mistakes , but only if we are honest about motives , means , and ends - and only if we are honest in the pursuit of peace .
