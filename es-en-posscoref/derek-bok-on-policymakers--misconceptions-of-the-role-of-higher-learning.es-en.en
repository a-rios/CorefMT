Higher Education Misconceived 
CAMBRIDGE - Ever since economists revealed how much universities contribute to economic growth , politicians have paid close attention to higher education . 
In doing so , however , they often misconceive universities &quot; role in ways that undermine their policies . 
For example , US President Barack Obama has repeatedly stressed the need to increase the percentage of young Americans earning a college degree . 
This is undoubtedly a worthwhile aim that can contribute to national prosperity and help young people realize the American Dream . 
Yet economists who have studied the relationship between education and economic growth confirm what common sense suggests : the number of college degrees is not nearly as important as how well students develop cognitive skills , such as critical thinking and problem-solving ability . 
Failure to recognize this point can have significant consequences . 
As countries embrace mass higher education , the cost of maintaining universities increases dramatically relative to an elite system . 
Given that governments have many other programs to support - and that people resist higher taxes - finding the money to pay for such an effort becomes increasingly difficult . 
Universities must therefore try to provide a quality education to more students while spending as little money as possible . 
Accomplishing all three objectives - quality , quantity , and cost efficiency - simultaneously is difficult , and the likelihood of compromise is great . 
With graduation rates and government spending easy to calculate , educational quality , which is difficult to measure , is likely to be the objective that slips . 
No one need know - and thus no one can be held accountable - when graduation rates rise but the hoped-for economic benefits fail to materialize . 
A second misconception by policymakers is that the only important benefit from a college education is the opportunity that it gives graduates to find a middle-class job and contribute to economic growth and prosperity . 
But , while this contribution is important , it is not the only one that matters . 
Apart from finding a first job , college graduates seem to adapt more easily than those with only a high school degree as the economy evolves and labor-market needs change . 
They also tend to vote at higher rates , engage in more civic activities , commit fewer crimes , educate their children better , and get sick less frequently by adopting healthier lifestyles . 
Researchers estimate that these additional benefits are worth even more than the added lifetime income from a college degree . 
If policymakers overlook them , they run the risk of encouraging quicker , cheaper forms of education that will do far less to serve either students or society . 
These misconceptions are clearly evident in government leaders &quot; speeches over the past two decades . 
As former President Bill Clinton remarked in his State of the Union address in 1994 : &quot; &#91; W &#93; e measure every school by one high standard : Are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy ? &quot; 
Since then , George W. Bush and Obama have echoed similar sentiments when speaking about their educational-policy goals . 
The same attitudes are manifest in other countries as well . 
A telling example is the shift in jurisdiction over British universities since 1992 from the Department of Education and Science to the Department for Education and Employment , and , in 2009 , to a new Department for Business , Innovation , and Skills . 
This shrunken conception of the role of higher learning is unprecedented . 
It ignores what were long regarded as the most essential aims of education : strengthening students &quot; moral character and preparing them to be active , informed citizens . 
In light of this tradition , the recent shift to material objectives comes as something of a surprise . 
John Maynard Keynes prophesied in the 1920 &quot; s that as countries grew wealthier , people &apos;s preoccupation with money and possessions would diminish . 
Instead , just the opposite has occurred . 
Granted , democratic political leaders must be responsive to the people , and money and jobs are clearly on people &apos;s minds . 
According to a recent survey , among first-year university students in the United States in 2012 , 88 % cited getting a better job as an important reason for attending college , and 81 % listed &quot; being very well off financially &quot; as an &quot; essential &quot; or &quot; very important &quot; goal . 
But it is also true that 82.5 % of these freshmen sought &quot; to learn more about things that interest me &quot; as an important reason for attending college , and 73 % wanted &quot; to gain a general education and appreciation of ideas . &quot; 
Among the objectives they considered &quot; essential &quot; or &quot; very important , &quot; 51 % mentioned &quot; improving my understanding of other countries and cultures , &quot; 45.6 % cited &quot; developing a meaningful philosophy of life , &quot; and substantial fractions listed such goals as &quot; becoming a community leader , &quot; &quot; helping to promote racial understanding , &quot; and &quot; becoming involved in programs to clean up the environment . &quot; 
In the end , surveys suggest that what people want most is not wealth so much as happiness and the satisfaction that comes from a full and meaningful life . 
Money helps , but so do other things , such as close human relationships , acts of kindness , absorbing interests , and the chance to live in a free , ethical , and well-governed democratic society . 
A stagnant economy and lack of opportunity are undoubtedly problems , but so are low voting rates , civic apathy , widespread disregard for ethical standards , and indifference to art , music , literature , and ideas . 
It is the responsibility of educators to help their students live satisfying , responsible lives . 
However well or badly universities perform this task , their efforts to succeed at it are worth fighting for and deserve their governments &quot; recognition and encouragement . 
After all , as Louis Brandeis observed : For good or ill , &quot; our government is the potent , the omnipresent teacher . &quot; 
If our leaders regard education merely as a means to jobs and money , no one should be surprised if young people eventually come to think of it that way , too .
