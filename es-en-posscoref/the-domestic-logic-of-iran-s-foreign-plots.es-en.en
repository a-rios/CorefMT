The Domestic Logic of Iran &apos;s Foreign Plots 
WASHINGTON , DC - Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington , the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded - if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir , but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s foreign policy . 
The history of the Islamic Republic is filled with cases of factions exploiting foreign policy to gain power against their domestic rivals . 
It is common for competing groups to sacrifice national interests - such as Iran &apos;s international credibility - to achieve their own goals . 
During the Iran-Iraq war , Ronald Reagan &apos;s national security adviser , Robert McFarlane , paid a clandestine visit to Iran with the approval of the country &apos;s highest authorities , to pursue a deal that would have been to Iran &apos;s advantage . 
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the former prime minister who now leads the opposition , spelled out the problem more than 20 years ago . 
On September 5 , 1988 , he resigned in protest against then-president Ali Khamenei &apos;s interference in his duties . 
In his resignation letter , Mousavi complained that the &quot; government &apos;s authority on foreign policy was taken away . &quot; 
He charged that 
&quot; &#91; military and intelligence &#93; operations outside the country are taking place without the government &apos;s knowledge or orders .... Only after an airplane is hijacked are we made aware of it . 
Only after a machine gun opens fire in one of Lebanon &apos;s streets and its noise echoes everywhere do we find out . 
Only after &#91; Saudi police &#93; find explosive material in Iranian pilgrims &quot; baggage am I informed . &quot; 
Iranian intelligence has assassinated more than 400 Iranian dissidents outside of Iran , including the last prime minister under the Shah , Shapour Bakhtiar , and four Kurds in Berlin &apos;s Mikonos restaurant in 1992 ( a German judge later officially named Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader as one of the senior officials involved in the terrorist attack ) . 
Similarly , the Quds Force of Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Guard has carried out hundreds of operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , and elsewhere . 
By contrast , the plot targeting al-Jubeir seems to have been highly unprofessional , almost unconcerned with success . 
So unlikely are the details that only a power struggle within Iran could justify it . 
If so , the plot &apos;s target likely was not al-Jubeir himself , but rather those elements in the regime that seek a diplomatic opening to the US - namely , Ahmadinejad and his circle . 
When news about the assassination plot first appeared , the Supreme Leader , Ali Khamenei , was on his way to the western province of Kermanshah . 
In his first speech after the story broke , he made no reference to it , most likely expecting the president to make a statement . 
After two days of Ahmadinejad &apos;s meaningful silence , Khamenei felt forced to reject the US allegations publicly . 
It is ironic to see Iran &apos;s radical Islamist president portray himself as open to resuming US-Iran relations and suffer for it at the hands of a supposedly pragmatic Supreme Leader . 
In the Islamic Republic , those interested in opening up to the West are typically those with little authority . 
Ahmadinejad and his faction face a two-edged problem : Khamenei has boxed them in politically , while rampant economic corruption and failed efforts at reform have disillusioned many of the president &apos;s supporters . 
As a result , Ahmadinejad , in a further ironic twist , is seeking to glorify Iran &apos;s pre-Islamic history in order to stir nationalist sentiment in his favor and accomplish what he is sure that Khamenei does not want : greater openness to the West , particularly to the US . 
He has repeatedly expressed his willingness to meet with US President Barack Obama - even sending him a congratulatory letter on his inauguration - and has traveled to New York to be interviewed by the American media much more often than his predecessors . 
Ahmadinejad is well aware that if he succeeds in portraying himself as someone who - in opposition to the Supreme Leader &apos;s will - wants to solve major issues between Iran and the US , that could partly compensate for his economic failures and gain him some new supporters . 
For that plan to work , Ahmadinejad needs to survive through the next parliamentary election in March 2012 and the presidential election in June 2013 , despite Khamenei &apos;s determination to marginalize him . 
Regardless of whether Khamenei was aware of the plot against al-Jubeir , its purpose was to delegitimize Ahmadinejad &apos;s foreign-policy agenda . 
So , if Khamenei really was unaware of the plot , it means that some elements in the government or the Revolutionary Guards are acting on their own , which is deeply troubling in its own right . 
If there are elements powerful enough to plan such a plot - even an unsuccessful one - they could do it again in the future . 
That raises an even more troubling question : If such &quot; independent &quot; decision-makers exist , are they able to affect Iran &apos;s nuclear policy , too ?
