Indonesia \ u0027s Democratic Miracle 
JAKARTA - Modern miracles do happen . 
Ten years ago , as the Asian financial crisis savaged Indonesia &apos;s economy , many experts predicted that the country would become unstable , if not splinter . 
Instead , Indonesia , the world &apos;s most populous Islamic country , has emerged as a beacon of freedom and democracy for the Muslim world . 
What happened ? 
And why hasn &apos;t the world taken note ? 
The story is as complex as Indonesia itself . 
One leading expert on Indonesia , Benedict Anderson , roots Indonesia &apos;s nature in its core Javanese culture , particularly the wayang religious tradition . 
According to Anderson , &quot; In contrast to the great religions of the Near East ... the religion of wayang has no prophet , no message , no Bible , no Redeemer .... The endless variety and sharp individuality of its dramatis personae indicate that wayang reflects the variegation of human life as it is felt by the Javanese ... &quot; 
There is also a strong Indonesian tradition of resolving disagreements through &quot; musyawarah dan mufakat &quot; ( consultation and consensus ) . 
Of course , this tradition has not always prevented violence , most notoriously in the killings that followed the 1966 coup against President Sukarno . 
And ten years ago , during the financial crisis , violent anti-Chinese riots erupted again , causing many Chinese to flee the country . 
Today , however , many of those Chinese have returned . 
In a remarkable development , Chinese language and culture , which had been suppressed for decades , is allowed free expression . 
By contrast , imagine Turkey , a more advanced member state of the Organization of the Islamic Conference , allowing free expression of Kurdish language and culture . 
Indonesia &apos;s record looks even more remarkable when compared to the United States . 
Americans explain their country &apos;s democratic backsliding by pointing to the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks . 
But Indonesia was attacked , too , with the bombing in Bali coming little more than a year later , on October 12 , 2002 . 
Despite this , Indonesia has consolidated its democracy . 
Indeed , in 2005 Freedom House declared that Indonesia had moved from &quot; partly free &quot; to &quot; free . &quot; 
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono deserves great credit for this remarkable success . 
Under his leadership , the long-standing and painful Aceh conflict was peacefully resolved . 
Some credit the 2004 tsunami , which killed hundreds of thousands of Acehnese , for this breakthrough . 
But Sri Lanka was hit equally hard by the tsunami , and since then the Sinhalese-Tamil conflict has worsened . 
Today , the biggest threat to Indonesia &apos;s democracy comes from America , even though most Americans want Indonesia &apos;s democracy to succeed . 
With modern technology , Indonesian Muslims can see clearly the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza , the disastrous results of the American invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan , and America &apos;s silence when Lebanon was bombed in July 2006 . 
Many senior Americans were puzzled that Turkey , a long-standing NATO ally and a secular state , refused to allow American forces to use Turkey as a base to invade Iraq . 
If relatively secular Turkish society could be swept by a surge of anti-American sentiment , so , too , can Indonesia society . 
Indeed , a major struggle is underway between those who want Indonesia to become more fundamentalist and those who want to preserve the traditionally open and tolerant nature of Javanese culture . 
Curiously , while many Americans and Europeans want moderate Muslim voices to succeed in Indonesia ( and Southeast Asia ) , they often undermine moderates with policies that are perceived as anti-Islamic . 
America &apos;s stance on military aid to Indonesia is but one example . 
For several years , some members of the US Senate have maintained a punitive policy towards Indonesia by cutting off military assistance and curtailing Indonesian military training in the US . 
These punitive policies are self-defeating . 
In recent years , the Indonesian military has provided a model for other Third World military forces on how to accept a transition to a full democracy . 
There are no threats of a coup d &quot; Ã©tat , and senior generals , such as Bambang , who studied in American military colleges , returned to Indonesia as convinced democrats . 
It is a tragedy that ignorance of how much Indonesia has changed is being allowed to endanger its democratic development - and its role as a beacon of freedom and hope in the Islamic world . 
It is to be hoped that Barack Obama , should he win America &apos;s presidency , will recall the tolerant Indonesia where he grew up and shape policies toward it accordingly .
