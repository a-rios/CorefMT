Justice Comes to Chad 
N &apos;DJAMENA , CHAD : &quot; Since when has justice come all the way to Chad ? &quot; a former political prisoner asked as a group of torture victims discussed the idea of prosecuting the country &apos;s exiled ex-dictator Hissène Habré . 
Habré , who brutalized this impoverished country from 1982 to 1990 , was then living safely in a seaside villa across the continent in Senegal , enjoying the $ 14 million he reportedly looted from the treasury on his way into exile . 
But justice did come to Chad . 
When news of the group &apos;s arrival was announced on Chad &apos;s radio , former victims began to line up at the courthouse to tell their stories . 
Habré , once backed by the United States and France as a bulwark against Libya &apos;s Moammar Quadafi , allegedly killed tens of thousands of real and suspected opponents before he was deposed by his former army chief . 
Many of Habré &apos;s most brutal henchmen still occupy key security posts in the new administration , however , and coming forward remains a risky business . 
The judge &apos;s visit - and the Chad government &apos;s full cooperation - seemed to give the victims courage , however . 
The judge and his team visited the five N &apos;Djamena jails , including one in the presidential compound , where Habré &apos;s American-trained political police systematically tortured prisoners . 
Ismael Hachim , president of the victims &apos; association , described how he was subjected to the &quot; arbatachar , &quot; a common form of torture in which a victim &apos;s four limbs were tied tightly behind his back until blood circulation stopped and paralysis resulted . 
Souleymane Abdoulaye showed the judge the sweltering underground cell where , as a boy of fourteen , he was crowded in with 72 other prisoners , only eleven of whom survived the near-starvation regimen . 
Those left alive rested their heads on the cool stomachs of the newly dead for some relief from the heat . 
Sabadet Totodet took the judge to a clearing on the outskirts of town where he was forced to dig graves for more than 500 fellow prisoners who died in custody . 
The judge spent a day examining the newly unearthed files of Habré &apos; s dreaded political police , the Documentation and Security Directorate ( DDS ) , including their reports to Habré on massacres of rival ethnic groups and daily lists of prison deaths . 
The judge also took the testimony of a number of Habré &apos;s DDS directors , and even allowed former victims to confront their torturers face to face . 
The Belgian judge , everyone here now hopes , will shortly seek Habré &apos;s extradition from Senegal , where Habré &apos;s victims began their quest two years ago . 
Inspired by the London arrest of Chile &apos;s ex-dictator August Pinochet , they filed complaints in Habrè &apos;s place of exile . 
To everyone &apos;s astonishment , a Senegalese judge indicted Habré on charges of crimes against humanity and torture , and placed him under house arrest . 
But Senegal &apos;s highest court later ruled that Habré could not be tried for crimes allegedly committed in Chad because Senegal did not have a long-arm law like Belgium &apos;s . 
Responding to a plea by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , Senegal &apos;s president Abdoulaye Wade announced that he would hold Habré pending his extradition to a country where he could get a fair trial . 
No one yet thinks that Chad is that country . 
Indeed , after a group of victims , emboldened by Habré &apos;s arrest in Senegal , filed criminal complaints in Chad last year against a number of alleged Habré -era torturers , the office of the prosecutor handling the file was ransacked and the victims &apos; lawyer , Jacqueline Moudeïna , was badly injured when a police squad commanded by an ex-DDS defendant threw a grenade at her . 
Belgium thus looks like the only place where Habré &apos;s victims may get their day in court . 
Ironically , the judge &apos;s visit comes as Belgium &apos;s anti-atrocity law is under legal and political attack . 
Last year , in a widely acclaimed trial , four Rwandans were convicted by a Belgian jury of involvement in the 1994 genocide in their country . 
Since then , however , Belgian politicians have grumbled as cases have piled up against leaders such as Ariel Sharon , Yasser Arafat and Fidel Castro . 
In February , after the Democratic Republic of Congo challenged an arrest warrant against its foreign minister , the International Court of Justice said Belgium had gone too far by not respecting the immunity of sitting office holders . 
The Habré case poses no such problems , because Habré is no longer in office and because Chad , where the crimes were committed , and Senegal , where Habré resides , are both ready to see him tried in Belgium . 
Rather , the case shows that long-arm laws like Belgium &apos;s , properly applied , can be an important tool to curtail the impunity of the perpetrators of atrocities as well as provide a forum for their victims .
