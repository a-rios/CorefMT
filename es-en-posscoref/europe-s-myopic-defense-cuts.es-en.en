Europe &apos;s Myopic Defense Cuts 
COPENHAGEN - All over Europe , budgets are being pared as a new age of austerity takes hold . 
Defense expenditures are proving to be the easiest of targets . 
Even Britain under the Tory David Cameron has joined the rush to slash defense spending . 
These cuts are coming at a time when European efforts to shoulder a fair share of the Western defense burden have been cast in doubt - not least in Afghanistan , where most European countries have limited their participation by insisting on a myriad of &quot; caveats &quot; that usually serve to keep their troops far from the most dangerous zones . 
Defense cuts are also happening at a time when Europe , for the first time in modern history , has been overtaken by Asia in terms of total defense spending . 
Western Europe &apos;s long-held position as the world &apos;s most important concentration of military power after the United States and Russia appears to be over . 
The US faces no serious challenge ( not yet , at least ) as the world &apos;s dominant military power . 
After all , the US spends almost as much on its armed forced as the rest of the world combined . 
The official growth rate of China &apos;s military expenditure - 15 % per year over the last decade - has increased substantially , and there is much hidden military spending as well . 
Growing anxiety among China &apos;s neighbors , particularly India , has led to remarkable increases in defense spending by other Asian powers as well . 
Cuts in European defense spending , moreover , are starting to cause serious tensions within the Atlantic Alliance . 
NATO is often described as a construction with two pillars and an architrave symbolizing the common values that form the basis of the alliance . 
But even during the Cold War , Americans often pointed out that the European pillar was lacking . 
Greater &quot; burden-sharing &quot; was a rote American demand . 
This debate may soon heat up again , now that the US , no less than Europe , is faced with grave budgetary problems . 
Indeed , in a time of austerity , US politicians might find it difficult to understand Europe &apos;s willingness to cut defense budgets that already total far less than NATO &apos;s official 2 % -of-GDP target . 
Europe &apos;s problem is not only a lack of military spending , but also poor effectiveness when it comes to the purpose of that spending : the use of force when and where necessary . 
Europe &apos;s capability of deploying combat forces is simply too small relative to the number of men and women in uniform . 
It is often half-jokingly pointed out that the number of generals and admirals in some European countries ( none mentioned , none forgotten ) is glaringly disproportionate to the number of fighting troops . 
European military effectiveness is also curbed by different procurement policies , as those countries that produce military hardware prefer to keep orders at home . 
This is true of weaponry as well as logistical capabilities , where , despite immense efforts over the years to get more out of the shrinking funds , there is still great potential for integration and standardization . 
The defense treaties concluded recently by France and the United Kingdom appear to be a good example of what can be obtained through greater cooperation and integration - even though it is a strictly bilateral affair with no direct links to either NATO or the European Union . 
But the value of the new &quot; Paris-London Entente &quot; will be limited if both countries cut their defense expenditures so much that their combined strength remains at best unchanged . That Britain plans to fund construction of a new aircraft carrier , but not the planes to fly off of it , suggests that resources for the new entente will be sorely lacking . 
Still , French-British cooperation if it does take on real substance could be an inspiration to others , though the challenges to making the agreement viable are formidable . 
British &quot; Tommies &quot; have to learn to speak French , and French legionnaires will have to learn English - and the limits on the spirit of cooperation will no doubt be found at the entrance to every army , navy , and air force canteen . 
After all , can anyone imagine French sailors eating &quot; spotted dick &quot; or any other culinary peculiarity of the Royal Navy ? 
Somewhat more promising is the possible invitation to India to participate in developing , alongside France , Germany , and Britain , the new joint Euro-fighter . 
India &apos;s commitment to defense spending , and its desire to acquire advanced military production processes , may provide the kind of energy that Europe has been lacking . 
The kind of energy and commitment to defense spending that India represents needs to be injected into Europe , because European rhetoric about playing a strategic global role remains in high gear . 
If Europeans want their ambitions to be taken seriously , they must find ways to deal with the decline in Europe &apos;s military power . 
Political leaders will have to tell their constituents that there are limits to how much military budgets can be cut , as the &quot; peace dividend &quot; from the Cold War &apos;s end was digested long ago . 
Europeans may have to embrace new modes of cooperation among their national armed forces in order to put them to effective use . 
Otherwise , not only will Europe &apos;s global political ambitions become untenable , but its allies on the other side of the Atlantic will lose patience with Europeans &quot; refusal to shoulder their share of the security burden .
