Recession Insurance 
NEW HAVEN - The Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund , Olivier Blanchard , and several IMF economists have proposed in a recent paper that governments should offer what they call &quot; recession insurance . &quot; 
Companies and / or individuals would buy insurance policies , pay a regular premium for them , and receive a benefit if some measure of the economy , such as GDP growth , dropped below a specified level . 
Such insurance , they argue , would help firms and people deal with the &quot; extreme uncertainty &quot; of the current economic environment . 
Recession insurance might , indeed , help alleviate the economic crisis by reducing uncertainty . 
After all , the real problem that we are currently facing is one of paralysis : uncertainty has placed many spending decisions - by businesses ( on higher output ) and by consumers ( on the items that businesses produce ) - on hold . 
Reducing uncertainty might augment , or even be superior to , fiscal stimulus programs , for it would address the root cause of the unwillingness to spend . 
Moreover , recession insurance might , in contrast to fiscal policy , impose no costs on the government , for if it stimulates confidence , then the risk being insured against is prevented . 
The government &apos;s ability to offer such insurance on a scale sufficient to make it costless is one reason to favor a public scheme over private insurers . 
Blanchard and his colleagues point out that banks might condition loans to firms on their purchase of recession insurance , which might help credit markets function better , addressing a serious problem underlying the current crisis . 
Tantalizingly , they say that doing this would create &quot; a market-based view of future output and the likelihood of severe shocks , &quot; although they do not explain how this market would be structured . 
Indeed , there is no market for other kinds of recession-related insurance provided by the government , such as unemployment insurance , old age insurance , or disability insurance . 
Instead , the government merely sets an insurance premium and forces everyone to pay it . 
The IMF authors are not saying that governments should do this with recession insurance , so perhaps they mean that governments would auction off the policies , which would create a market price . 
Governments are in a good position to create new risk-management policies , and they can then set an example for private insurers to follow . 
Such insurance already exists on a small scale in the form of credit insurance against unemployment . 
A New York-based firm , the Assura Group , has been working for four years on a plan to launch privately issued supplemental unemployment insurance to anyone . 
Their policies would piggyback on US state unemployment insurance programs , allowing Assura to avoid getting into the monitoring business . 
One problem with market-based policies is strategic adoption and cancellation . 
GDP risk is a long-term risk . 
The price of the insurance would have to be adjusted regularly to adjust for varying public knowledge of the likelihood of a recession , and people could not be allowed to cancel their policies , and stop making payments , whenever the economic outlook became rosier . 
The Assura Group had to get permission from the New York State Department of Insurance to have a dynamic rate filing , meaning that they will set prices by a formula , rather than using a fixed rate , so that their prices vary in rapid response to changing economic conditions . 
In a recent paper , Mark Kamstra and I proposed that governments issue shares in their GDP , with each share amounting to a trillionth of GDP . 
These &quot; trills &quot; would help individual countries manage their GDP risks . 
We thought that the issuers of such securities would have , in effect , a form of recession insurance . 
Another way to create a market price for recession risk is to offer the MacroShares that my firm MacroMarkets pioneered . 
These securities are offered in pairs -one long and one short - and , unlike in a government-run scheme , in whatever quantity the market demands . 
Once we have a market price for recession insurance or similar products , the question then arises : will it be so high that few people want to buy ? 
We know that we are probably in a recession right now , and may be for some time , so the expected losses currently are enormous . 
As a result , people may balk at the price and not want to buy the insurance . 
The only insurance that people might think they can afford could carry a large deductible , and if the deductible is very large , people might not feel so reassured by this insurance . 
There are uncertainties with any really new proposal . 
We should not look askance at such a policy because of its potential shortfalls . 
The current global economic crisis is an opportunity for some new experimentation that might not only lead to its resolution , but might also set in place institutions that help to prevent future crises . 
Recession insurance is one such idea .
