End Austerity Now 
EDINBURGH - In recent weeks , talk about a budding recovery in the eurozone has gained traction , with key indices pointing to expansion in the core countries - data that many are citing as evidence that austerity is finally working . 
Money-market funds from the United States are returning , albeit cautiously , to resume funding of European bank debt . 
Even Goldman Sachs is now bullishly piling into European equities . 
But is a recovery really underway ? 
Cynics recall that a European recovery was supposed to take hold as early as the fourth quarter of 2010 , and that every International Monetary Fund projection since then has predicted recovery &quot; by the end of the year . &quot; 
Instead , GDP has collapsed , with the Spanish and Italian economies expected to contract by close to 2 % this year . 
Portugal &apos;s economy is set to shrink by more than 2 % , and Greece &apos;s output will fall by more than 4 % . 
Moreover , unemployment in the eurozone has skyrocketed to an average rate of roughly 12 % , with more than 50 % youth unemployment in the periphery countries implying a long-term loss of talent and erosion of the tax base . 
And , despite the spike in unemployment , productivity growth in the eurozone is decidedly negative . 
More significant , over the last year , the public debt / GDP ratio rose by seven percentage points in Italy , 11 in Ireland , and 15 in Portugal and Spain . 
If the sine qua non of recovery via austerity is the stabilization and reduction of debt , the cynics &quot; case appears to have been made . 
Against this background , the return of US investors to provide short-term dollar funding for European bank debt smacks of a desperate hunt for yield that relies on European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s promise to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro . 
As for Goldman &apos;s equity play , as bond-market guru Bill Blain put it , &quot; the words &quot; buy cheap , sell a bit dearer on the up , and then dump and run &quot; spring to mind . &quot; 
In fact , any talk of recovery is premature until the losses incurred by austerity are recouped . 
As it stands , every country that has implemented an austerity program without imposing losses on private creditors has more debt now than when it started . 
For example , according to official estimates , Spain &apos;s public debt , which amounted to only about 36 % of GDP when the crisis began , has almost tripled - and the actual figure may be much higher . 
More telling , the countries that cut expenditure the most experienced the largest bond-yield spikes and the most significant debt growth . 
The explanation for this is simple . 
When a country gives up its monetary sovereignty , its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency , making them exceptionally vulnerable to liquidity shocks , like that which sparked turmoil in Europe &apos;s banking system in 2010-2011 . 
The government , unable to print money to bail out the banks or increase export competitiveness through currency devaluation , is left with only two options : default or deflation ( austerity ) . 
Austerity &apos;s underlying logic is that budget cuts , by reducing the debt burden and restoring confidence , ultimately enhance stability and support growth . 
But , when countries pursue austerity simultaneously with their main trading partners , overall demand plummets , causing all of their economies to contract and , in turn , increasing their debt / GDP ratios . 
But the problem with austerity in the eurozone is more fundamental : policymakers are attempting to address a sovereign-debt crisis , though the real problem is a banking crisis . 
With Europe &apos;s banking system triple the size and twice as leveraged as its US counterpart , and the ECB lacking genuine lender-of-last-resort authority , the sudden halt in capital flows to peripheral countries in 2009 created a liquidity-starved system that was too big to bail out . 
As holders of euro-denominated assets recognized this situation , they turned to the ECB for insurance ( which the ECB could not deliver under its previous president , Jean-Claude Trichet , whose leadership was defined by his commitment to maintaining price stability ) . 
Investors &quot; subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup - not the volume of sovereign debt - caused bond yields to spike . 
But the financial-market turmoil fueled a panic among eurozone leaders , leading them to misdiagnose the malady and prescribe the wrong medicine , which has served only to generate new symptoms . 
While Draghi &apos;s promise , embodied by the ECB &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program - as well as its long-term refinancing operation and emergency liquidity assistance program - has bought time and lowered yields , the eurozone &apos;s banking crisis persists . 
Eurozone leaders must recognize that spending cuts will do nothing to stabilize the balance sheets of core-country banks that are over-exposed to peripheral countries &quot; sovereign debt . 
Until Europe rejects austerity in favor of a growth-oriented approach , all signs of recovery will prove illusory .
