Healthy People , Healthy Cities , Healthy Economies 
OXFORD - The forces that drove the growth of European and North American cities in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are now driving urbanization in Brazil , China , India , Mexico , Russia , and other emerging-market countries . 
Because the growth of these cities has been accelerated and magnified by productive technologies , rapid internal migration , and high net reproduction rates , many have reached unprecedented sizes at breathless speed . 
Indeed , all but three of the world &apos;s 20 largest cities are in emerging markets . 
Many forecasts suggest that by 2030 , the four largest emerging-market economies will have overtaken the G-7 in combined size , and that by 2050 , today &apos;s emerging-market economies will represent more than half the global economy and an even larger share of the world &apos;s population . 
These forecasts all assume that economic growth will be generated in cities . 
But will emerging-market cities be healthy enough to drive rapid economic growth ? 
The issues that preoccupy health policymakers and practitioners in Lima , Cairo , Kolkata , and Jakarta reflect contrasting climates , geographies , histories , and cultures . 
Each city is ultimately a special case . 
But they share some generic features . 
One is that the urban disease burden is shifting from infectious to chronic diseases - the so-called &quot; diseases of affluence . &quot; 
But the urban poor , faced with bad housing , limited infrastructure , and meager services , are vulnerable to epidemics , malnutrition-based childhood diseases , HIV / AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis , and mental disorders . 
They are also likely to be hardest hit by natural disasters , such as the floods and mudslides that devastated parts of Rio de Janeiro in January . 
A second generic feature of emerging-market cities is that dense concentrations of poverty help create fragile environments that spawn civil disorders , resulting in death and injuries . 
But a recent symposium at Oxford University concluded that emerging-market cities could improve and maintain urban health by capturing the inherent advantages of concentration , coordinating health policies and programs , adopting successful innovations , reforming health education and training , and developing improved planning processes . 
Indeed , many potential solutions stem from opportunities for innovation created by the physical concentration of people and economic activity . 
It is invariably more efficient to build and maintain health-related infrastructure , such as water supply and sanitation systems , clinics , and hospitals , and deliver specialized health care , where population densities are highest - and to create affordable-care networks of community health workers using low-cost technology . 
It is invariably easier to capture economies of scale and operation in public-health programs where those economies are greatest . 
Moreover , while the health of urban populations is directly or indirectly affected by actions taken ( or not taken ) in almost every branch of government , few emerging markets have acted to improve horizontal coordination within national or city administrations . 
Fewer still have addressed the need for vertical coordination betweennational and city governments . 
Tailored solutions are required - what works in one city might not work in others - but , because problems arising from weak or absent coordination are widespread , emerging markets should consider governance models that vest accountability for urban health outcomes - together with the authority to shape them - in city governments . 
But such innovation does not always begin at home , which is why city governments need to know about potentially applicable ideas and lessons from other cities and countries . 
Unfortunately , the diffusion and dissemination of innovative ideas in the fields of public health and health care is generally a random , haphazard , and inefficient process . 
So emerging markets should collaborate to develop health-knowledge networks aimed at facilitating mutual learning . 
There is also an urgent need to address the fact that public health and medical education in emerging markets is rarely integrated . 
Having received different training and developed different mindsets , public-health officers and medical doctors ( and their subordinates ) often operate in silo-like environments - to the detriment of the people they serve . 
Moreover , there are few opportunities for doctors to specialize in urban health . 
To overcome this challenge , emerging-market governments should consider radical reforms in education and training in urban public health and health care . 
Urban growth in emerging-market countries - and the corresponding concentration of poverty - has challenged and sometimes overwhelmed the capacity of their governments to provide sustainable and affordable housing , water supply and sanitation , solid-waste management services , and education - all of which directly affect urban health - as well as basic health-care services . 
To address these issues emerging-market cities should practice anticipatory planning , based on realistic demographic forecasts ; develop city and nationwide patient registers and health-information systems ; and seek to integrate health and health-care planning with overall city planning . 
If cities are to drive emerging-market countries towards a better future , their governments must ensure that urban housing , infrastructure , and services stay abreast of demand . 
After all , an investment-friendly business environment requires adults who are fit to work and children who are fit to learn . 
Ultimately , the economic health of emerging-market countries will depend on the reinvention of urban public health .
