India Takes the Lead 
A decisive blow against poverty was struck when India &apos;s new Finance Minister Chidambaram tabled the 2004 / 2005 budget . 
India is a country on the move , with rapid economic development and dazzling dynamism in the information technology sector . 
Yet it is also home to 300 million of the world &apos;s poorest people . 
In last May &apos;s national elections , India &apos;s rural voters unseated the ruling coalition . 
The lesson was clear : attend to rural poverty . 
The new government has listened , putting forward a program that is dazzling in its implications , for India and the developing world . 
India &apos;s new government is led by a veritable &quot; dream team &quot; of international development . 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is one of the world &apos;s leading development economists . 
It was Singh , serving in mid-1991 as India &apos;s Finance Minister , who began India &apos;s market reforms . 
He dismantled decades of inefficient and ineffective government restraints on trade , investment , and entrepreneurship , unleashing more than a decade of the fastest economic growth in India &apos;s history . 
Upon returning to office this spring as Prime Minister , Singh brought into government an experienced and internationally renowned team , including Finance Minister Chidambaram , who served successfully as Finance Minister in the mid-1990 &apos;s , and Dr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia , who heads the Planning Commission , the key body assessing India &apos;s medium-term public investment strategies . 
When the former government lost the vote this past May , and Singh &apos;s government came into office , there were fears that Singh would be hamstrung by left-wing coalition partners , who would demand that market reforms be dismantled as the price of their participation in the new ruling coalition . 
Chidambaram &apos;s 2004 / 2005 budget puts those fears to rest . 
The document is a brilliant lesson in development economics : it shows how to combine a full-speed ahead approach to market reforms with urgently needed attention to poverty . 
In short , the budget is a model for all developing countries . 
At the heart of the budget is the realization that reducing poverty requires both rapid economic growth and targeted investments aimed at the poorest of the poor . 
Rapid economic growth is to be based on the private sector , including foreign direct investment . 
Thus , the budget supports critical areas of market reform and growth promotion , including measures aimed at deepening the financial sector , promoting exports , and liberalizing foreign direct investment . 
The key , however , is that the budget does not rely simply on &quot; trickle-down &quot; economics to raise living standards . 
The second pillar of poverty reduction is targeted investments for the poor , particularly for the rural poor . 
This approach commits India &apos;s national government and state governments to ensuring that all Indians , including the poorest , have access to basic social investments , including health , nutrition , and schooling , and to basic infrastructure , including electricity , information and communications technology , safe drinking water , and inputs for modern agriculture . 
Every village is to be lifted up in the next few years , empowered with the basic tools to become economically productive . 
The scale of the challenge is immense . 
There are an estimated 600,000 villages in this vast country of one billion citizens . 
Villages that are far from major ports and cities tend to be poorer and less invigorated by the recent economic growth . 
The government proposes to equip these villages with the basic infrastructure and services they need to take off economically . 
The government &apos;s programs are not mere populist promises . 
They reflect sensible investments that the government intends to pursue . 
The budget calls for a surtax on incomes to help pay for increased social expenditures . 
The lesson for other developing countries is that spending on the poor for health , education , safe drinking water , electricity , and the like , is not simply pandering ; it is a serious and productive investment . 
It may be expensive to educate a child , but it is far more expensive to a society to leave a child without education . 
Uneducated children will be burdens on their societies for decades to come . 
It is far more rational to spend a little extra income now for a few years of schooling than face decades of social costs resulting from masses of uneducated adult workers ! 
But even India , with its growing economy , cannot afford to make these investments out of national resources . 
India will need some help , at least temporarily , from richer countries and international institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank . 
The rich world should not be grudging in its help to India . 
By providing a few billion dollars per year in assistance now , the donor world would ensure a prosperous , democratic , and stable partner in India for decades to come . 
In other words , it is time for donors to step up to help reform-minded yet poor countries like India , and , even more urgently , those in Africa that are similarly committed to economic development .
