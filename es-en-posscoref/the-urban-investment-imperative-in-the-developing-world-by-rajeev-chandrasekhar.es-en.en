Civilizing the City 
BANGALORE - Half of humanity - 3.5 billion people - live in urban areas today . 
Our metropolises are the engines of growth for a global economy emerging from the shadow of financial crisis . 
In Bangalore , my home , investment is pouring into a city at the forefront of the Indian economy &apos;s transformation - home to companies like Infosys and Wipro , and named by Forbes Magazine as one of the &quot; Fastest Growing Cities of the Next Decade . &quot; 
But , as Bangalore &apos;s citizens prepare to go to the polls in state elections , their concerns are not merely economic . 
The city &apos;s financial success stories mask a darker reality - quality of life for many city-dwellers has deteriorated over recent years . 
The movement of the rural poor to large cities is one of the exemplary narratives of the modern era . 
And governments , which typically focus on crude measures of economic performance , encourage rapid urbanization . 
In China , for example , the relaxation of migration controls in the 1980 &quot; s and the opening of the economy led to the spectacular growth of the country &apos;s eastern cities . 
More than 50 % of Chinese live in urban areas today , up from 25 % in 1990 , and the proportion is expected to reach 70 % by 2035 . 
While the majority of Indians still live in rural areas , this , too , is changing fast . 
From 1970 to 2010 , India &apos;s urban population grew by 250 million . 
The next quarter-billion will be added in half that time . 
By 2030 , 70 % of India &apos;s GDP will come from its cities . 
But cities are simply unable to cope with the influx of migrants on the current scale . 
The fast-growing metropolises of India , China , Brazil , and other major emerging economies offer plenty of jobs , but basic amenities are lacking ; as a result , many of the urban poor live in slums , without adequate health care , water supplies , or electricity . 
The problems are legion . 
Municipalities , often owing to corruption or poor management , are unable or unwilling to impose rigorous planning regulations . 
Infrastructure spending is either inadequate or poorly targeted . 
Workers come home from their jobs to homes that are dark , dank , and depressing . 
They feel unsafe on poorly-lit streets , and have little access to parks or recreational facilities . 
Mornings and evenings are lost to long commutes on polluted highways . 
The novelty of the rapid economic improvements seen by many city-dwellers in India , China , and elsewhere over the past ten years has insulated governments from the repercussions of poor urban planning . 
As I take my morning strolls through Bangalore , though , I sense growing resentment of the inadequacies , and frustration at insufficient improvements in citizens &quot; quality of life . 
Democracy exists precisely to remedy the kinds of injustices I hear from the hardworking Bangaloreans I encounter on the street and online . 
Bangalore is a modern city , and its citizens are expressing their displeasure in modern ways - on Facebook , in chat rooms , and on Twitter . 
Governments would do well to heed these complaints ( indeed , to engage with them in these hi-tech incarnations of a town-hall meeting ) , because civil unrest could disrupt the positive momentum , not only in cities , but in the entire global economy . 
That threat might seem far-off while growth continues at relatively high rates ; but , unless workers see the benefit of their labors in the form of improved living conditions , protests could ensue . 
Already , there have been major strikes at factories across China - Motorola , Honda , and Foxconn , among others . 
That would have been unheard of several years ago , as would today &apos;s growing trend among China &apos;s urban middle classes for de-urbanization - a brain drain whereby educated city dwellers give up on the rat race and return to the countryside in pursuit of cleaner air , open spaces , and better accommodation . 
Our cities risk becoming literally uninhabitable . 
Of the world &apos;s ten most densely populated cities , seven are in India . 
The urban sprawl of Delhi , Mumbai , Chennai , and Bangalore has continued unchecked , unplanned , and with under-investment in infrastructure for far too long . 
Urban pollution contributed to 620,000 needless deaths in India last year , mainly among the very poor . 
The number of people living in our slums has doubled over the past decade , and is now greater than the population of the United Kingdom . 
The consultancy McKinsey argues in a recent report that India needs to invest at least $ 1.2 trillion in its urban infrastructure over the next two decades , or $ 134 per capita annually . 
It currently invests only $ 17 per capita , compared to $ 116 in China and $ 292 in the United States . 
India spends less on health care and education per capita than China , Brazil , South Africa , or Mexico . 
If India is to maintain its competitiveness , a focus on dramatically improving the nation &apos;s urban areas is imperative . 
McKinsey calculates that the country requires between 700-900 million square meters of new residential and commercial space each year ; 350-400 kilometers ( 217-248 miles ) of metros and subways ( 20 times what has been achieved in the past decade ) ; and 19,000-25,000 kilometers of annual road construction ( equivalent to all the roads built over the past ten years ) . 
The task is daunting . 
But , despite the grumbling , India &apos;s city dwellers - like those elsewhere - do not want to sacrifice the enormous gains of the past few decades to ineffective or corrupt governance . 
They want to work toward a future in which their quality of life is among the best in the world , with green spaces , sustainable public transport , clean air , well-built houses , and safe streets . 
This is why I have set up the Nammu Bengaluru ( &quot; Our Bangalore &quot; ) Awards . 
It is important to recognize those who are contributing to the vision of a city that is feted not just for its economic successes , but also for its quality of life . 
Their example is one that emerging-country urbanites everywhere should seek to emulate .
