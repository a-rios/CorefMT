Toxic Tests 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States government is now permitting ten of America &apos;s biggest banks to repay about $ 70 billion of the capital injected into them last fall . 
This decision followed the banks having passed the so-called &quot; stress tests &quot; of their financial viability , which the US Treasury demanded , and the success of some of them in raising the additional capital that the tests suggested they needed . 
Many people have inferred from this sequence of events that US banks - which are critical to both the American and world economies - are now out of trouble . 
But that inference is seriously mistaken . 
In fact , the US stress tests didn &apos;t attempt to estimate the losses that banks have suffered on many of the &quot; toxic assets &quot; that have been at the heart of the financial crisis . 
Nevertheless , the US model is catching on . 
In a meeting this month , finance ministers of G-8 countries agreed to follow the US and perform stress tests on their banks . 
But , if the results of such tests are to be reliable , they should avoid the US tests &quot; fundamental flaw . 
Until recently , much of the US government &apos;s focus has been on the toxic assets clogging banks &quot; balance sheets . 
Although accounting rules often permit banks to price these assets at face value , it is generally believed that the fundamental value of many toxic assets has fallen significantly below face value . 
The Obama administration came out with a plan to spend up to $ 1 trillion dollars to buy banks &quot; toxic assets , but the plan has been put on hold . 
It might have been hoped that the bank supervisors who stress-tested the banks would try to estimate the size of the banks &quot; losses on toxic assets . 
Instead , supervisors estimated only losses that banks can be expected to incur on loans ( and other assets ) that will come to maturity by the end of 2010 . 
They chose to ignore any losses that banks will suffer on loans that will mature after 2010 . 
Thus , the tests did not take into account a big part of the economic damage that the crisis imposed on banks . 
Although we don &apos;t yet have an estimate of the economic losses the stress tests have chosen to ignore , they may be substantial . 
According to a recent report by Deutsche Bank , for example , borrowers will have difficulty refinancing hundreds of billions of dollars of commercial real estate loans that will mature after 2010 . 
Rather than estimate the economic value of banks &quot; assets - what the assets would fetch in a well-functioning market - and the extent to which they exceed liabilities , the stress tests merely sought to verify that the banks &quot; accounting losses over the next two years will not exhaust their capital as recorded in their books . 
As long as banks are permitted to operate this way , the banks &quot; supervisors are betting on the banks &quot; ability to earn their way out of their current problems - even if the value of their assets doesn &apos;t now significantly exceed their liabilities . 
But doesn &apos;t the banks &quot; ability to raise new equity capital indicate that , regardless of whether the stress tests are reliable , investors believe that their assets &quot; value does significantly exceed their liabilities ? 
Not at all . 
Consider a bank with liabilities of $ 1 billion . 
Suppose that the bank has assets with long maturity and a face value of $ 1.2 billion but whose current economic value is only $ 1 billion . 
Although the value of the bank &apos;s assets doesn &apos;t exceed its liabilities , depositors won &apos;t flee as long as the government backs the bank by guaranteeing its deposits . 
If in two years the bank &apos;s assets have a 50-50 chance of appreciating to $ 1.2 billion or declining to $ 0.8 billion , the bank will be able to raise new equity capital : new investors will be willing to pay for the prospect of sharing in the excess of the value of assets over obligations if things turn out well . 
To get a good picture of banks &quot; financial health , estimating the value of their toxic assets is unavoidable . 
Regulators could encourage each bank to sell part of its toxic portfolio and extrapolate the portfolio &apos;s value from the price obtained in such a sale , or they could attempt to estimate the portfolio &apos;s value as well as they can on their own . 
Either way , the true value of banks &quot; toxic assets must be estimated before concluding that banks are armed with sufficient capital to carry out their critical roles . 
The kind of stress tests that the US conducted , and that other countries are being urged to emulate - and the ability of banks to raise additional equity capital - cannot provide a basis for such a conclusion .
