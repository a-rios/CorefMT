The Structure of Institutional Reforms 
FRANKFURT - Despite abundant talk in Europe nowadays , there is no crisis of the euro . 
Some countries , instead , are dealing with a sovereign-debt crisis and the consequences of inadequate economic reform . 
The challenges are characteristic not only for the euro area . 
Most advanced economies around the globe are facing similar problems . 
All countries need to draw firm conclusions from the current crisis . 
In the euro area , instead of continuing to deny that monetary union limits national fiscal sovereignty , they must come to terms with economic reality and follow stricter budgetary rules . 
When the global financial crisis erupted , the euro shielded countries that in comparable circumstances would have been plunged into a deep currency crisis . 
This shield may , perhaps , have worked too well because the more weakly performing countries faced no discipline from financial markets . 
Indeed , despite massive imbalances and huge disparities in the level of private and public debt across the euro area , interest-rate spreads on government bonds disappeared in the run-up to the crisis . 
Market participants - including ratings agencies - either flagrantly misapprehended risk or never took the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s no-bailout clause seriously . 
Meanwhile , the institutional mechanisms implemented for coordination of economic and fiscal policies remained idle . 
On the fiscal side , the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were even weakened , and the decisions on adjustment measures and possible sanctions became dependent on short-sighted political considerations . 
As long as Europe &apos;s potential sinners continue to judge its de facto sinners , peer pressure will not work . 
Indeed , deficit-reduction programs were all too often founded on overly optimistic growth assumptions , and in times of robust economic growth , debt reduction was neglected . 
Reliable statistics were not available in all countries , and for years there was no political will to protect public budgets from the impact of rapidly aging populations on pension and health-care costs . 
All of these failures became fully manifest in 2005 , when European governments watered down the Stability and Growth Pact &apos;s rules to a degree that effectively made them optional . 
The European Central Bank was critical of that decision , whose dramatic consequences have exceeded our greatest fears . 
The financial crisis hit fragile public budgets with full force . 
The effect of automatic stabilizers in the economic downturn , state support for banks , and the fiscal stimulus packages adopted by governments all undermine fiscal sustainability . 
Financial markets &quot; sudden reappraisal of sovereign risk has now put euro-area governments under considerable pressure to reduce their deficits . 
But there is a risk that fiscal consolidation will wane as soon as a degree of deficit reduction has calmed the markets . 
To minimize that risk , euro-area countries must fundamentally re-work and strengthen the institutional architecture for coordinating long overdue structural reforms and for safeguarding public finances . 
These efforts will require far-reaching reforms . 
What is required is de-politicized fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance , stricter and more binding budgetary rules , smoother recourse to sanctions for breaching them , and close co-ordination of economic policies . 
De-politicization of surveillance is best achieved by creating an independent body , whether formal or informal , while stricter and more binding rules must include a stronger link between deficit and debt criteria . 
Indeed , reducing the current high debt levels in the euro area will require substantial consolidation . 
First , governments should bring fiscal deficits down to below 3 % of GDP , in line with what has been agreed by the European Council . 
Second , to set high debt ratios on a diminishing path , governments will have to aim at reducing deficits further in line with their medium-term budgetary objectives . 
Sanctions , to be credible , must come into play long before a country falls into economic difficulties ; therefore , they should not be purely financial in character , but should include other measures as well . 
Such sanctions should begin to be imposed when governments fail to meet minimum requirements for attaining medium-term objectives . 
They should then become incrementally more severe the longer and the more seriously the rules are breached . 
Where structural policy is concerned , we need a better architecture for overseeing and safeguarding individual countries &quot; competitiveness , and for eliminating imbalances . 
This calls for competitiveness to be monitored , and made subject to surveillance . 
Countries should be assigned to a risk group in line with their economic vulnerability . 
The higher the risk , the more binding the recommendations for the reduction of imbalances , the stricter the surveillance of how well appropriate measures are implemented , and the harsher the possible sanctions for continued rule violations . 
Some have proposed establishing a new institution for crisis management , which would most likely require a treaty change . 
But , if the reforms in the realm of fiscal policy and coordination of economic policy are successful , such an institution would never need to act , and would thus be redundant . 
Structural reforms and fiscal consolidation are , incidentally , tasks not only for countries with a current-account deficit . 
Of course , the pressure on these countries to act is particularly high , but there is no country in the euro area whose budgetary situation can be described as enduringly sound . 
Surplus countries , too , must adopt measures to strengthen the domestic economy by creating incentives for investment and employment . 
These adjustment measures are painful but necessary . 
Without structural reforms to strengthen employment and growth , even the most earnest efforts to foster recovery will come to nothing both economically and politically .
