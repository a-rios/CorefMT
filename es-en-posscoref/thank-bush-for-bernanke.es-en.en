Thank Bush for Bernanke 
The world may not know it , but we all dodged a bullet when George W. Bush nominated Ben Bernanke to succeed the all-powerful US Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
There were some positively scary names for potential Fed chairman floating out of the White House , and I , for one , had no confidence in the outcome . 
Instead , almost miraculously , we got an absolutely first-rate economist , a safe pair of hands to guide the global economy . 
Those of us who know Bernanke view him as someone who has the experience , intellect , and personality to sparkle in the position that he will assume next February . 
Why is the job so important ? 
Alan Greenspan is a great man , but it is a curious set of circumstances that has elevated the job of Fed chairman to Mount Olympus . 
Consider , first , that the other two major central banks in the world ( the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan ) simply are not fully functional . 
While the Fed agilely changes policy interest rates to stabilize inflation and output , neither the BOJ nor the ECB has changed its key policy rates for years now , with the ECB stuck at 2 % and the BOJ at 0 % . 
While failure to adjust interest rates is not prima facie evidence of dysfunction - after all , even a broken clock is right twice a day - frozen interest rates really do give the appearance of paralysis . 
Thus , with the world &apos;s other two major central banks missing in action , the Fed has the global economic stage all to itself . 
Normally , the United States Treasury Secretary or some other leader in the administration would play a counterbalancing role . 
But in the Bush administration , these officials simply don &apos;t have the political support to be effective , particularly opposite Greenspan . 
President Bush has clearly decided that he himself should be the administration &apos;s main economic spokesperson . 
Inevitably , however , Bush comes across as a cheerleader , while the more objective Fed chairman just ran circles around him . 
Of course , Greenspan never had to compromise his credibility on economic issues by pontificating on Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution ( which many Bush supporters deny ) , or buzzing on about how wonderfully things are supposedly going for US forces in Iraq . 
Against Bush &apos;s vapid boosterism was set Greenspan &apos;s vast knowledge and experience . 
Besides , there is just no way that a US president busy with dozens of other pressing problems can compete with a Fed chairman who has the luxury of focusing full time on economic issues . 
So we should give Bush credit for being willing to pick someone who can maintain Greenspan &apos;s role as the chief economist of the US , by default . 
Mind you , it may be quite awhile before Ben Bernanke &apos;s name becomes the global household word that Greenspan &apos;s has become . 
People who could care less about economics and finance often still know the name of the current US Fed chairman . 
It has certainly made my life easier in explaining to people that I am a professor of economics . 
Of course , some people , such as an accomplished young musician I recently met , have never heard of Alan Greenspan - or of the US Federal Reserve , for that matter ( within half an hour he was mesmerized by the idea that there might be someone who could essentially print a billion dollars on a whim ) . 
This brings us back to the ECB and the BOJ , because their real problem is not simply interest-rate paralysis , but rather that each feels enormously constrained in addressing key economic issues outside monetary policy . 
As the premier pan-European Union institution , the ECB is uniquely positioned to play a leadership role in Europe &apos;s discussion of fiscal policy , trade policy , and demographic transition . 
This is an unfortunate limitation of the ECB &apos;s design by a group of nation states that have not yet decided whether they prefer greater unity or greater devolution . 
For the BOJ , the fundamental problem is its deep institutional fear of rocking the boat politically , and thus its inability to play the role of chief economist . 
As a result , America &apos;s Fed chairman today commands super-normal influence . 
Perhaps some day this unbridled power will be reined in by a resurgent ECB and BOJ . 
In the meantime , we can only be relieved that by chance or by fate , President Bush has actually appointed a worthy replacement for Greenspan . 
It could have been a disaster .
