Seven More Years of Hard Times ? 
NEW HAVEN - Much of the talk emerging from the August 2010 Jackson Hole Economic Symposium , attended by many of the world &apos;s central bankers and economists , has been about a paper presented there that gave a dire long-runassessment of the future of the world &apos;s economies . 
The paper , &quot; After the Fall , &quot; was written by economists Carmen Reinhart and Vincent Reinhart . 
Their work draws upon a recent book that Carmen Reinhart co-authored with Kenneth Rogoff , entitled This Time Is Different : Eight Centuries of Financial Folly . 
According to the Reinharts &quot; paper , when compared to the decade that precedes financial crises like the one that started three years ago , &quot; GDP growth and housing prices are significantly lower and unemployment higher &quot; in the subsequent &quot; ten-year window . &quot; 
Thus , one might infer that we face another seven years or so of bad times . 
Economic theory is not sufficiently developed to predict major turning points based on first principles or mathematical models . 
So we have to be historically oriented in our method . 
History may be a &quot; soft &quot; social science , but we have to look at it , even distant history , if we are to grasp other examples of major crises . 
Moreover , we have to look at the entire world . 
Most economists study the recent history of their own country , which is easiest to do , and their results sound superficially important to most of their countrymen . 
But major financial crises are rare by the standards of any one country , and we have to range widely through history to get enough information about how such crises play out . 
The research by the Reinharts and Rogoff is an expansion and generalization of many people &apos;s informal economic thinking , which often compares the present with stories of major past episodes . 
Ever since the current crisis began in 2007 , many people have been wondering if the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock-market crash and the banking crises of the early 1930 &quot; s is relevant to our experience today . 
The troubling fact about the Great Depression is that it was severe , global , and lasted over a decade - and that it followed the collapse of an equity and real-estate boom , roughly as happened before the current crisis . 
Likewise , many people have been wondering if the weakness that followed the equity and real-estate crash in Japan at the beginning of the 1990 &quot; s is relevant to our experience today . 
They used to refer to Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decade . &quot; 
Now it is more appropriate to describe that experience as the &quot; lost decades . &quot; 
Are these examples models for our future ? 
They certainly make one stop and think . 
But they do not stand as convincing evidence about what will happen - after all , two observations are hardly enough to prove the point . 
But now the Reinharts and Rogoff have systematically studied many more examples in modern financial history . 
There is also the world financial crisis that attended the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 , and there are the country-specific financial crises in Spain in 1977 , Chile in 1981 , Norway in 1987 , Finland and Sweden in 1991 , Mexico in 1994 , Indonesia , Korea , Malaysia , the Philippines , and Thailand in 1997 , Colombia in 1998 , and Argentina and Turkey in 2001 . 
So , there are many more than just two modern cases ( though they are not all entirely independent , because they are somewhat bunched in time ) . 
From them , the Reinharts and Rogoff found , for example , that median annual growth rates of real per capita GDP for advanced countries were one percentage point lower in the decade following a crisis , while median unemployment rates were five percentage points higher . 
How did this happen ? 
They note that , in general , debt levels and leverage rose during the decade preceding these crises , propelling increases in asset prices for a long time . 
Reinhart and Rogoff describe a &quot; this time is different syndrome &quot; during the pre-crisis boom , whereby these bubbles are allowed to continue for far too long , because people think that past episodes are irrelevant . 
There seems to be the germ of a new economic theory in the work of the Reinharts and Rogoff , but it remains ill defined . 
It seems to have a behavioral-economics component , since the &quot; this time is different syndrome &quot; seems psychological rather than rational . 
But it is still not so sharp a theory that we can really rely on it for making confident forecasts . 
Moreover , there are reasons to suggest that this time really might be different . 
I hate to say so , not wanting to commit the sin defined by their &quot; syndrome , &quot; but this time might be different because all of the modern examples of past crises came during a time when many economists worldwide were extolling the virtues of the &quot; rational expectations &quot; model of the economy . 
This model suggested that a market economy should be left alone as much as possible , so that is what governments tended to do . 
According to &quot; rational expectations , &quot; bubbles simply did not exist - which meant that actual bubbles were allowed to grow . 
But that mindset is waning , and government and business leaders now routinely warn of bubbles and adopt policies to counter them . 
So , this time really is at least a little different . 
In that case perhaps all of those crisis-induced bad decades are no longer relevant . 
But any such hopes that the aftermath of the current crisis will turn out better are still in the category of thoughts , theories , and dreams , not science . 
It is not true that if you break a mirror , you will have seven years &quot; bad luck . 
That is a superstition . 
But if you allow a financial market to spin wildly until it breaks down , it really does seem that you run the risk of years of economic malaise . 
That is a historical pattern .
