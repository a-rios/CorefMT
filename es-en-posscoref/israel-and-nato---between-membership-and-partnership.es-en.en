Israel and NATO - Between Membership and Partnership 
MADRID - The idea of integrating Israel into NATO has frequently been advanced as bait to encourage the Jewish state to make the necessary concessions for an Arab-Israeli peace settlement . 
And some Israeli leaders - Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman , for example - are convinced that joining NATO would act as a vital deterrent against Iran . 
But it is highly unlikely that Israel &apos;s full integration into the Alliance is feasible from NATO &apos;s standpoint . 
The Alliance would not be happy to apply Article 5 of the NATO charter , which would oblige its members to fight for Israel if it were attacked by any of its many potential enemies in an endemically dangerous region . 
Nor is it clear that membership would be in the best interest of Israel , a country whose defense doctrine has been always based on self-reliance and freedom of maneuver in security matters . 
Israel &apos;s unwritten alliance with the United States is a more convenient alternative . 
Cooperation and even partnership with NATO - an interim stage potentially leading to membership - is another matter . 
Notwithstanding the stalled peace process and the adverse effect that Israel &apos;s conflict with the Palestinians is having on its international standing , NATO and Israel have been incrementally strengthening their cooperation in recent years . 
This serves the interests of both sides . 
For the Israelis , cooperation with NATO is a major component of legitimacy in its frequently troubled relations with the West ; for NATO , cooperation serves its capacity to work in new theaters of operation and 
In recent years , NATO has been undergoing major changes in both its deployment and objectives . 
Two landmarks define these changes : the end of the Cold War , which rendered NATO &apos;s defensive strategy against the Soviet Union obsolete , and the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the US , which changed the profile of the enemy and the nature of the battlefield . 
It also changed the theater of operation , and forced the Alliance to shift its attention from Europe to the Mediterranean , the Middle East , and beyond . 
NATO &apos;s Mediterranean emphasis was inaugurated in 1994 through the Mediterranean Dialogue , which linked countries like Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Morocco , Mauritania , Algeria , and Tunisia in security discussions with the Alliance . 
The Dialogue was not exactly an edifying success , however . 
The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative of 2004 , triggered by the trauma of the 9 / 11 attacks , holds far greater potential , for it transforms NATO &apos;s relations with friendly states in the Middle East from dialogue to partnership - a level comparable to the Partnership for Peace program used to promote Central and Eastern European countries to full membership . 
Under this framework , multilateral cooperation in combating terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction was offered to the region &apos;s main actors . 
The Initiative also envisages the promotion of regional defense reforms and the improvement of interoperability among military forces in the region . 
Nevertheless , both the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Initiative suffer from the lack of a real multilateral culture of cooperation in security matters among the main regional players . 
The Arab-Israeli conflict is a major political obstacle , but by no means the only one . 
Morocco , Algeria , and Libya are hardly partners for such regional cooperation , which is also the case for most Arab countries in the Middle East . 
Not surprisingly , then , of all the states in the region , it is Israel that has established the closest links with NATO . 
This reflects the benefits that NATO believes can be drawn from Israel &apos;s unique military experience . 
Israel recently became the first country to conclude an Individual Cooperation Program with NATO , through which it conducts an ongoing strategic dialogue with the Alliance covering a wide array of areas , including terrorism , intelligence sharing , nuclear proliferation , 
Both sides seem eager to expand the scope of their partnership , with the objective of 
The options for further cooperation are many , ranging from intelligence and procurement to the development of an updated anti-terrorism doctrine ( including cyber-terrorism ) , a domain to which NATO is a newcomer . 
David Ben-Gurion &apos;s dream of Israel becoming a NATO member might not materialize , but the developing partnership reflects the Alliance &apos;s unequivocal recognition that Israel shares the challenges facing the West and is a vital partner in developing responses to them .
