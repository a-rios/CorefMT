Turkey &apos;s Iran Strategy 
ISTANBUL - Following Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif &apos;s recent visit to the Gulf states , the Islamic Republic &apos;s charm offensive is set to continue with President Hassan Rouhani &apos;s trip to Turkey early next month . 
Unlike the majority of Iran &apos;s Arab neighbors , Turkey unequivocally welcomed the interim nuclear deal concluded last month between Iran and the P5 + 1 ( the United Nations Security Council &apos;s five permanent members and Germany ) . 
But Turkish policymakers are keenly aware that the agreement may upend the Middle East &apos;s fragile balance of power . 
From Turkey &apos;s perspective , the nuclear deal , if successfully implemented and made permanent after six months , is set to eliminate a major security concern . 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan &apos;s government does not want to be faced with a nuclear Iran , fearing the emergence of an asymmetric power relationship with the Islamic Republic after centuries of balanced ties . 
But Turkey also did not want a military intervention in Iran , led by the United States . 
It was believed that a military strike would create even more problems in terms of regional stability and security . 
That is why Turkish policymakers have consistently championed a diplomatic solution to the Iranian conundrum , which is what they got with the latest deal . 
There are other reasons why Turkish officials have welcomed the interim agreement so warmly . 
First , they interpret the deal as vindication of their ill-fated effort in May 2010 ( together with Brazil ) to reach an agreement with Iran on the disposition of Iran &apos;s nuclear fuel . 
Turkish authorities continue to highlight that earlier tripartite agreement with Iran . 
The foreign ministry , for example , released a statement noting that , &quot; The agreement ... constitutes the first concrete positive development concerning Iran &apos;s nuclear program since the Tehran Declaration of 2010 . &quot; 
Turkey is also satisfied that the deal does not weaken its position on sovereign rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
Turkey has consistently defended the interpretation that states have the right to establish domestic uranium-enrichment programs under the NPT , provided that they comply with their treaty commitments . 
Even at the peak of diplomatic tensions with Iran , Turkey refrained from adopting America &apos;s more maximalist position , which challenged the validity of Iran &apos;s right to enrich uranium . 
So the tacit and conditional acceptance of this right is a satisfactory outcome for Turkey . 
Though Turkey currently has no plans to develop a fuel cycle of its own , its ambitious agenda for developing nuclear power has made policymakers intent on safeguarding the rights recognized by the NPT , including the right to enrich uranium . 
There are also significant economic considerations for Turkey , which relies on Iran for a substantial share of its energy imports . 
Equally important , as a neighboring country , Iran has been a traditional trading partner - a relationship worth more than $ 15 billion per year . 
As a result , Turkey &apos;s export potential has been negatively affected by the rising stringency of the sanctions regime against Iran , with trade losses estimated at $ 6 billion for the first nine months of 2013 . 
The gradual easing of the sanctions is expected to benefit Turkey &apos;s export industries , which hope to satisfy pent-up Iranian demand for consumer and investment goods . 
Finally , in contrast to Arab states like Saudi Arabia , Turkey is generally comfortable with the deal &apos;s geopolitical ramifications . 
The improvement of Iran &apos;s relationship with the West and the easing of diplomatic pressure on the Islamic Republic is not a major concern . 
But , for the Gulf states - and also possibly for Israel - this scenario is viewed as opening the door to stronger Iranian influence throughout the region . 
These countries believe that , following the interim agreement , the US will fail to demonstrate sufficiently strong resolve to deter Iran from seeking regional hegemony . 
In that case , tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran will become more acute in the years ahead , emerging as the main destabilizing factor in the region . 
It is in this context that Turkey &apos;s role as a secular power , one capable of transcending the sectarian divide , will become more important than ever . 
Turkish policymakers would be well advised to seize this opportunity to consolidate the country &apos;s effectiveness as a regional actor , one that is uniquely positioned to stem the danger of a widening - and potentially extremely dangerous - rift .
