Lessons From the North 
Fewer debates over economics would be needed if the world spent more time examining what actually works and what does not . 
Almost everywhere , debate has raged about how to combine market forces and social security . 
The left calls for an expansion of social protection ; the right says that doing so would undermine economic growth and widen fiscal deficits . 
But the debate can be moved forward by examining the successful economies of Denmark , Finland , Iceland , the Netherlands , Norway , and Sweden . 
While no regional experience is directly transferable , the Nordic countries have successfully combined social welfare with high income levels , solid economic growth , and macroeconomic stability . 
They have also achieved high standards of governance . 
To be sure , there are also differences among the Nordic states , with social welfare spending the highest in Denmark , the Netherlands , Norway , and Sweden , and a bit lower in Finland and Iceland . 
Nevertheless , whereas the taxes at the national level in the United States are equal to around 20 % of GNP , in the Nordic countries the ratio is more than 30 % . 
High taxation supports comprehensive national health care , education , pensions , and other social services , resulting in low levels of poverty and a relatively narrow income gap between the richest and poorest households . 
In the US , the poorest 20 % of households receive just 5 % of total income , putting their income at around one-fourth of the national average . 
In the Nordic countries , by contrast , the poorest 20 % of households receive nearly 10 % of total income , putting them at roughly one-half of the national average . 
American conservatives argue that a large public sector is subject to inefficiency and mismanagement , corruption , and bureaucratic abuse , while the taxation needed to support it blunts economic efficiency . 
But each of these propositions is refuted by the Nordic experience . 
Consider the claims of inefficiency and waste . As a result of government-funded national health insurance , the Nordic countries have a higher life expectancy and a lower infant mortality rate than the US . 
Ironically , the heavy reliance on the private sector in the US system is so inefficient that Americans pay a larger share of GNP for health ( 14 % ) than do the Nordic countries ( 11 % ) , but get less . 
Similarly , although social welfare spending is lower in the US than in the Nordic countries , its budget deficit as a share of national income is much larger . 
The US spends less in the public sector , but it taxes even less than it spends . 
Nor has high taxation in the Nordic countries impeded economic performance . 
Rather than relying mainly on income taxation , as in the US , the Nordic countries rely on value-added taxation , which provides a relatively high amount of revenue with relatively low rates of evasion and few distortions to the economy . 
The Nordic experience also belies conservatives &quot; claim that a large social welfare state weakens incentives to work and save . 
National saving in the Nordic countries averages more than 20 % of national income , compared to around 10 % in the US . 
Moreover , economic growth in the Nordic countries has been similar to that in the US in recent years . 
Income levels are higher on average in the US , but mainly because the Nordic countries work fewer hours per week . 
In any case , all of the Nordic countries have very high incomes , and Norway &apos;s per capita income actually exceeds the US . 
Several factors appear to explain the Nordic countries &quot; economic success . 
Taxation is broad-based and relatively non-distorting , while open international trade , market forces , and private ownership of industry are relied on to maintain incentives . 
The Nordic countries are not &quot; socialist &quot; economies , based on state ownership and planning , but &quot; social welfare &quot; economies , based on private ownership and markets , with public provision of social protection . 
Importantly , they invest heavily in higher education and in science and technology , so they remain at the cutting edge of high-technology industries . 
Half a century ago , the free-market economist Friedrich von Hayek argued that a large public sector would threaten democracy itself , putting European countries on a &quot; road to serfdom . &quot; 
Yet the Nordic states have thrived , not suffered , from a large social welfare state , with much less public-sector corruption and far higher levels of voter participation than in the US . 
But how replicable are the Nordic successes ? 
These countries have small populations , easy access to international trade , natural resources , and peaceful neighbors . 
Most notably , they are ethnically homogeneous , so that social divisions are more amenable to compromise . 
However , this means that the challenge of maintaining a strong social welfare state in ethnically and racially diverse societies such as the US is not economic , but one of promoting respect and inclusiveness .
