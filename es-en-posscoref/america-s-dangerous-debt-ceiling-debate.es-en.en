America &apos;s Dangerous Debt Ceiling Debate 
NEWPORT BEACH - It has been raised more than 70 times in the last 50 years , mostly without commotion . 
It must be raised again this summer if the United States government is to continue paying its bills on time . 
And , obviously , the outcome has implications that go well beyond the US . 
Beyond this ceiling , the government can spend only from current revenues . 
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently informed members of Congress that the government will be in this situation on or around August 2 . 
Having already officially hit the ceiling , the Treasury is moving money around and tapping various pots of unused funds to pay its bills . 
In a few weeks , this &quot; flexibility &quot; will be used up . 
With the US government now borrowing around 40 % of every dollar it spends , a truly binding debt ceiling would immediately force the government to reduce spending radically and in a disorderly fashion . 
Politicians across the political spectrum know that such a situation would unsettle an already fragile US economy , severely weaken the dollar , and raise serious concerns about the country &apos;s ability to meet its debt-service obligations , including to the many foreign creditors that the US will need in the future . 
Yet , in today &apos;s polarized environment in Washington , Republicans and Democrats are unwilling to compromise - or at least to compromise &quot; too early . &quot; 
By holding out , Republicans wish to force President Barack Obama &apos;s administration into massive spending cuts . 
Democrats respond that such a one-sided approach would be economically harmful and socially unjust . 
In the meantime , both sides risk disrupting transfer payments ( including to the elderly ) and the provision of public services , as well as eroding further America &apos;s global credit standing . 
The overwhelming - and sensible - expectation is that the two parties will compromise and raise the debt ceiling before inflicting serious economic and financial dislocations . 
The most recent precedent was the bipartisan agreement reached earlier this year on another fiscal issue that threatened to disrupt the normal functioning of government : the absence of a formally approved budget for this year . 
A compromise would allow both parties to declare partial victory , for it would likely entail commitments to cut spending and some steps to make taxation more socially just . 
In effect , the political system would again be kicking the can down the road , with real progress on necessary fiscal reforms expected only after the November 2012 presidential election . 
Two scenarios for the timing of an interim compromise are possible , depending on whether it is a one- or two-step process . 
Most observers expect a one-step process for bipartisan agreement before August 2 . 
In the meantime , the Treasury would temporarily re-prioritize and slow outgoing payments . 
This two-step process would be similar to what happened in 2008 , when Congress was confronted with another cliffhanger : the Bush administration &apos;s request for $ 700 billion to prevent a financial-market collapse and an economic depression . 
Congress initially rejected the measure , but a dramatic 770-point drop in the stock market focused politicians &quot; minds , bringing them back to the table - and to agreement . 
But the two-step scenario involves incremental risks to the US economy , and to its standing in the global system . 
This brings us to a third , and even more unsettling possibility : a longer and more protracted negotiation , resulting in greater disruptions to government entitlement payments , other contractual obligations , and public services . 
Creditors would then ask many more questions before adding to their already-considerable holdings of US government debt , generating still more headwinds in a US economy that already faces an unemployment crisis and uneven growth . 
The next few weeks will provide plenty of political drama . 
The baseline expectation , albeit subject to risk , is that Democrats and Republicans will find a way to avoid disruptions that would damage the fragile US economy , but that the compromise will not meaningfully address the need for sensible medium-term fiscal reforms . 
Such political paralysis on key economic issues is increasingly unsettling for the US private sector , and for other countries that rely on a strong US at the core of the global economy . 
This helps to explain why so many companies continue to hoard cash , rather than investing domestically , and why a growing number of countries want to diversify gradually away from dependence on the dollar as the reserve currency and on US financial markets for intermediation of their hard-earned savings . 
The world economy is hard-wired to the assumption of a strong America , and Americans benefit from this .
