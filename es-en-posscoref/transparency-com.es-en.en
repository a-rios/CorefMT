MOSCOW - I have just returned to Star City ( Russia &apos;s spaceflight training center ) from a long weekend in Moscow , and it struck me how much - and how little - has changed since I first came here 20 years ago , in the spring of 1989 . 
As I passed an ad in the Moscow metro promoting advertising space for sale , I remembered hurtling down one of those same long , fast escalators sometime in the mid-1990 &quot; s with a pioneering advertising man . 
&quot; Look at all those empty walls ! &quot; he marveled . 
&quot; Some day they could be full of ads . &quot; 
Today , they are , indeed , crammed with ads , fulfilling his wildest dreams . 
A few years ago , I would be thrilled to see a Web site listed within any of those ads . 
Now URLs are routine . 
In fact , a couple of years ago , the Russian search-engine company Yandex ( I &apos;m on its board ) , took out an ad gently poking fun at Russia &apos;s old regime of opacity . 
At the bottom of every escalator in the Moscow metro is a glass booth for the escalator monitor - usually a grumpy-looking woman whose sole job is to turn off the escalator in case of an emergency . 
There &apos;s a sign on the booth that says , &quot; The escalator monitor does not answer questions , &quot; in a Soviet-style formulation that &apos;s close to saying , &quot; The monitor does not give consultations . &quot; 
Yandex bought ads in about half the subway cars , saying , &quot; The operator does not give consultations ... so please address your questions to Yandex . &quot; 
Everyone immediately got the reference . 
Yandex &apos;s ads are gone , but those signs are , unfortunately , still there - not just in the metro , but in many other places where public servants do not want to talk to the public - police stations , ticket offices , and public buildings of many kinds . 
Information has been so scarce in Russia that Web sites such as tutu.ru ( train and plane schedules ) and banki.ru ( bank information for consumers ) seem like miracles . 
But , while governments may be unresponsive , everywhere commercially-driven enterprises are responding to user feedback . 
Elsewhere in the world , the same trends are already more developed . 
Both legislation and the forces of competition and consumer demand are driving companies to disclose more about their products and to respond to consumer queries . 
Ten years ago , you were lucky to find the phone number and address of the manufacturer on a tube of toothpaste . 
Now , you can usually find a Web site that will let you find out more and ask questions . 
But that &apos;s from the manufacturer &apos;s point of view . 
Even more interesting are sites and services such as Twitter and Viewpoints ( I &apos;m an adviser ) and many other blogs and rating services that offer independent views . 
And then there &apos;s Barcode Wikipedia ( http : / / www.sicamp.org / ? page _ id = 21 ) , a brilliant project still waiting to get off the ground . 
The idea is that you can scan in the barcode of any product , and get third-party information - where it was made , what was used to make it ( ingredients , components , and labor ) , how much CO2 it created , etc . 
Of course , there will be arguments about the data , just as there are arguments about Wikipedia &apos;s accuracy . 
But having a central place to argue about facts , one easily linked from any product , would be a huge step forward for practical transparency . 
Meanwhile , consumers are applying that same curiosity to their governments . If we know how sausages are made , shouldn &apos;t we also be able to find out how laws are made and enforced , and what the government officials whose salaries we pay do with their time ? 
That &apos;s starting to happen , too . 
I &apos;m a member of the board of the Sunlight Foundation , a nonprofit devoted to government transparency in the United States . 
Our first initiative was to get the members of the US Congress to post their own schedules online . 
If some legislator wants to post that an hour is private , that &apos;s fine . 
People deserve their privacy . 
But if that hour was really a lunch with a lobbyist , then they ( and their aides ) would have to lie deliberately to conceal it . 
Of course , there is no way to enforce full disclosure , but by creating explicit processes and expectations , we hope to reset norms . 
If an official meets with a lobbyist and is not ashamed of it , he can simply say so . 
Voters can make their own judgments . 
And if an official meets mostly with lobbyists , at the expense of other types of meetings , voters can make judgments about that , too . 
Sunlight is not alone . 
It is funding and collaborating with a variety of start-ups devoted to collecting , manipulating , and visualizing data from all kinds of public records and other sources . 
Their tools can be used by anyone , in any country - as long as they can get the data . With luck , the tools will foster demand for the data . 
We want people to expect to see such information , just as they now expect information about a food product or an item of clothing . 
If normal people had asked more questions , and had expected to understand the answers they were getting , we might not have gotten ourselves into the financial crisis currently gripping the world . 
If people had really understood what was going on , they might have had the sense to stop borrowing money they couldn &apos;t pay back and buying things they couldn &apos;t afford . 
But this crisis may have one good outcome : people will be less likely to listen to authorities , and more interested in finding out for themselves what is going on .
