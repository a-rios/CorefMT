A New Asian Security Constellation 
NEW DELHI - Leading members of the governments of India and South Korea recently met to begin a new &quot; strategic partnership . &quot; 
They are not alone in doing so , for across Asia , a new security architecture is being constructed , seemingly piecemeal . 
How Asia &apos;s geopolitical landscape will evolve over the coming decades is not easy to foresee . 
But it is apparent that an increasingly assertive China is unwittingly reinforcing America &apos;s role in Asia , restoring US primacy as the implicit guarantor of security and stability in the region . 
There are at least four possible Asian security scenarios for the years and decades ahead . 
The first is the rise of a Sino-centric Asia . 
China seeks a multipolar world but a unipolar Asia . 
By contrast , the US desires a unipolar world but a multipolar Asia . 
A second scenario is that the US remains Asia &apos;s principal security anchor , with or without a third possibility : the emergence of a constellation of Asian states with common interests working together to ensure that Asia is not unipolar . 
Finally , Asia could come to be characterized by several resurgent powers , including Japan , India , Vietnam , Indonesia , and a reunified Korea . 
Of the four scenarios , the first has caused the greatest unease . 
China &apos;s neighbors are increasingly anxious about its growing power and assertiveness . 
While China &apos;s rulers aspire to shape a Sino-centric Asia , their efforts to intimidate smaller neighbors hardly make China a credible candidate for Asian leadership . 
After all , genuine leadership cannot come from raw power , but only from other states &quot; consent or tacit acceptance . 
If leadership could be built on brute force , schoolyard bullies would be class presidents . 
In any event , China &apos;s power may be vast and rapidly growing , but it lacks the ability to compel . 
In other words , China does not have the capability to rout any rival militarily , let alone enforce its will on Asia . 
That fact has , however , done little to allay fears in the region . 
With its defense spending having grown almost twice as fast as its GDP , China is now beginning to take the gloves off , confident that it has acquired the necessary muscle . 
For example , China now includes the South China Sea in its &quot; core &quot; national interests , on a par with Taiwan and Tibet , in order to stake a virtually exclusive claim to military operations there . 
China also has increasingly questioned India &apos;s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh , the northeastern Indian state that China &apos;s rulers call &quot; Southern Tibet &quot; and claim largely as their own . 
Indian defense officials have reported a rising number of Chinese military incursions across the 4,057-kilometer Himalayan border . 
As China seeks to translate its economic clout into major geopolitical advantages in Asia , a country that once boasted of &quot; having friends everywhere &quot; finds that its growing power may be inspiring awe , but that its actions are spurring new concerns and fears . 
Which states will accept China as Asia &apos;s leader ? 
Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang , as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested . 
Leadership entails more than the possession of enormous economic and military power . 
It demands the power of ideas that can galvanize others . 
Such power also serves as the moral veneer to the assertiveness often involved in the pursuit of any particular cause or interest . 
The US and its allies won the Cold War , for example , not so much by military means as by spreading the ideas of political freedom and market capitalism to other regions . 
In the words of the strategic analyst Stanley A. Weiss , this &quot; helped suck the lifeblood out of communism &apos;s global appeal , &quot; making it incapable of meeting the widespread yearning for a better and more open life . 
China has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interests and playing classical balance-of-power geopolitics . 
But , in order to displace the US and assume the mantle of leadership in Asia , China must do more than pursue its own interests or contain potential rivals . 
Most fundamentally , what does China represent in terms of values and ideas ? 
In the absence of an answer to that question , China &apos;s overly assertive policies have proven a diplomatic boon for the US in strengthening and expanding American security arrangements in Asia . 
South Korea has tightened its military alliance with the US , Japan has backed away from a move to get the US to move its Marine airbase out of Okinawa , and India , Vietnam , Indonesia , and the Philippines , among others , have drawn closer to the US . 
In terms of power-projection force capabilities or the range of military bases and security allies in Asia , no power or combination of powers is likely to match the US in the next quarter-century . 
But , while America &apos;s continued central role in Asia is safe , the long-term viability of its security arrangements boils down to the credibility of its security assurances to allies and partners . 
America &apos;s readiness to stand by them when the game gets rough will determine the strength and size of its security-alliance system in Asia in the years ahead . 
The third and fourth scenarios can unfold even if the US remains the principal security anchor for Asia . 
A number of Asian countries have already started building mutually beneficial security cooperation on a bilateral basis , thereby laying the groundwork for a potential web of interlocking strategic partnerships . 
A constellation of Asian states linked by strategic cooperation , in fact , has become critical to help institute power stability in the region .
