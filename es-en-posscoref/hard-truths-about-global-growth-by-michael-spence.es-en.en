Hard Truths About Global Growth 
NEW YORK - The world &apos;s high-income countries are in economic trouble , mostly related to growth and employment , and now their distress is spilling over to developing economies . 
What factors underlie today &apos;s problems , and how appropriate are the likely policy responses ? 
The first key factor is deleveraging and the resulting shortfall in aggregate demand . 
Since the financial crisis began in 2008 , several developed countries , having sustained demand with excessive leverage and consumption , have had to repair both private and public balance sheets , which takes time - and has left them impaired in terms of growth and employment . 
The non-tradable side of any advanced economy is large ( roughly two-thirds of total activity ) . 
For this large sector , there is no substitute for domestic demand . 
The tradable side could make up some of the deficit , but it is not large enough to compensate fully . 
In principle , governments could bridge the gap , but high ( and rising ) debt constrains their capacity to do so ( though how constrained is a matter of heated debate ) . 
The bottom line is that deleveraging will ensure that growth will be modest at best in the short and medium term . 
If Europe deteriorates , or there is gridlock in dealing with America &apos;s &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; at the beginning of 2013 ( when tax cuts expire and automatic spending cuts kick in ) , a major downturn will become far more likely . 
The second factor underlying today &apos;s problems relates to investment . 
Shortfalls in investment eventually diminish growth and employment opportunities . 
The hard truth is that the flip side of the consumption-led growth model that prevailed prior to the crisis has been deficient investment , particularly on the public-sector side . 
If fiscal rebalancing is accomplished in part by cutting investment , medium- and longer-term growth will suffer , resulting in fewer employment opportunities for younger labor-market entrants . 
Sustaining investment , on the other hand , has an immediate cost : it means deferring consumption . 
But whose consumption ? 
If almost everyone agrees that more investment is needed to elevate and sustain growth , but most believe that someone else should pay for it , investment will fall victim to a burden-sharing impasse - reflected in the political process , electoral choices , and the formulation of fiscal-stabilization measures . 
The core issue is taxes . 
If public-sector investment were to be increased with no rise in taxation , the budget cuts required elsewhere to avoid unsustainable debt growth would bein implausibly large . 
The most difficult challenge concerns inclusiveness - how the benefits of growth are to be distributed . 
This is a longstanding challenge that , particularly in the United States , goes back at least two decades before the crisis ; left unaddressed , it now threatens social cohesion . 
Income growth for the middle class in most advanced countries has been stagnant , and employment opportunities have been declining , especially in the tradable part of the economy . 
The share of income going to capital has been rising , at the expense of labor . 
Particularly in the US , employment generation has been disproportionately in the non-tradable sector . 
These trends reflect a combination of technological and global market forces that have been operating over the last two decades . 
On the technology side , labor-saving innovations in network-based information processing and transactions automation have helped to drive a wedge between growth and employment generation in both the tradable and non-tradable sectors . 
In the tradable part of advanced economies , manufacturing automation - including expanding robotic capabilities and , prospectively , 3D printing - has combined with the integration of millions of new entrants into rapidly evolving global supply chains to limit employment growth . 
Multinational companies &quot; growing ability to decompose these global supply chains by function and geography , and then to reintegrate them at ever lower transaction costs , removes the labor-market protection that used to come from local competition for workers . 
This challenge is particularly difficult , because economic policy has not focused primarily on the adverse distributional trends arising from shifting global market outcomes . 
And yet the income distributions across advanced economies , presumably subject to similar technological and global market forces , are , in fact , startlingly different , suggesting that a combination of social policies and differing social norms does have a distributional impact . 
Although the theory of optimal income taxation directly addresses the tradeoffs between efficiency incentives and distributional consequences , the appropriate equilibrium remains a long way off . 
A healthy state balance sheet could help , because part of the income flowing to capital would go to the state . 
But , with the exception of China , fiscal positions around the world are currently weak . 
As a result , deleveraging remains a clear priority in a range of countries , reducing growth , with fiscal countermeasures limited by high or rising government debt and deficits . 
Thus far , there is little evidence of willingness on the part of politicians , policymakers , and perhaps the public to reduce current consumption further via taxation in order to create room for expanded growth-oriented investment . 
In fact , under fiscal pressure , the opposite is more likely . 
In the US , few practical measures that address the distributional challenge appear to be part of either major party &apos;s electoral agenda , notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary . 
To the extent that this is true of other advanced economies , the global economy faces an extended multi-year period of low growth , with residual downside risk coming from policy gridlock and mistakes in Europe , the US , and elsewhere . 
That scenario implies slower growth - possibly 1-1.5 percentage points slower - in developing countries , including China , again with a preponderance of downside risk .
