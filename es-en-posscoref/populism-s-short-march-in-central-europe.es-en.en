Populism &apos;s Short March in Central Europe 
A specter is haunting the European Union &apos;s new members in Central Europe ­ - the specter of populist nationalism . 
The Law and Justice Party ( PiS ) has just won Poland &apos;s parliamentary and presidential elections , while populist and nationalist political forces could gain the upper hand in elections in Hungary , the Czech Republic , and Slovakia next year . 
These are momentous developments . 
For 15 years , Central Europe has been a model student of democratization . 
Now , according to former Czech President Václav Havel , the region could become trapped in a &quot; suffocating atmosphere . &quot; 
Even Havel &apos;s own successor , Václav Klaus , rails against multiculturalism and the decline of the traditional European nation-state . 
What happened ? 
Paradoxically , the EU - seen as a guarantee of stability and progress - is itself part of the problem . 
Attracted by the promise of membership , the countries that joined the EU last year underwent 15 years of social , economic , legal , and political changes whose scope was unprecedented in modern European history . 
Public institutions were rapidly modernized , political democracy adopted , and a standard market economy created . 
But ordinary people were put under tremendous pressure to adjust quickly , and sometimes painfully . 
As long as EU membership remained only a goal , it had a disciplining effect on the region &apos;s political elites . 
In fact , the promise of EU membership now seems to have been a more effective means of promoting reform than membership itself : aspiration , unlike membership , gave the EU far greater political leverage . 
To be sure , Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Slovakia have rightly viewed EU accession as an act of political emancipation , and have begun asserting themselves as political equals . 
At the same time , the political parties that led their countries into the EU all came under pressure , because they were associated with painful reforms . 
This cleared the way for politicians with a simple message : our countries have had enough of Western tutelage and belt-tightening ; the time has come to return to our national values and interests . 
Some warned even before EU accession that their nations could lose their identity . 
As President Klaus put it , the Czech Republic could &quot; dissolve in the EU like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . &quot; 
Tomas G. Masaryk , Czechoslovakia &apos;s first president after its establishment in 1918 , used to say that his country was a democracy , but &quot; so far , without democrats . &quot; 
Havel reasons along similar lines when he warns of the emerging dangers of nationalism and populism in the region . 
In his opinion , the underlying &quot; old &quot; patterns of political behavior ( some a legacy of the pre-communist era ) were temporarily pushed to the background by the wave of pro-Western civic liberalism that followed the collapse of communism in the region . 
Now the old patterns of political behavior are returning to the fore . 
But there is also evidence that Havel is right to argue that the re-emergence of these patterns represents a mere &quot; hangover &quot; from 15 years of sustained - and often traumatic - reform . 
Unlike before World War II , when democratization efforts were undermined by the rise of authoritarianism in Germany , the region &apos;s countries are now fully integrated into a network of highly stable Western democracies . 
Attempts by political parties to thrive on nationalism , xenophobia and populism will soon be confronted with the limits set by the EU and other international organizations . 
For example , the PiS &apos;s promises to reintroduce the death penalty and return Poland to its conservative Christian roots violate EU and Council of Europe standards . 
One can predict with a high degree of confidence that the Polish &quot; Fourth Republic &quot; that the PiS would like to build will have to come to terms with the limited space in Europe for messianic visions and &quot; Christian fundamentalism . &quot; 
The same is true of Klaus &apos;s nationalism ; it may appeal to a popular streak of Czech provincialism , but even if the conservative Civic Democratic Party , which Klaus founded , wins the parliamentary election next year , EU membership will temper nationalist ambitions . 
Leftist populists in Slovakia , represented by Robert Fico &apos;s Smer ( Direction ) party , which is leading in opinion polls ahead of the next year &apos;s elections , will most likely reach a similar conclusion . 
Viktor Orban &apos;s Fidesz party , which could win Hungary &apos;s elections next spring , provides a particularly instructive example . 
In the mid-1990 &quot; s , before becoming the governing party , it pandered openly to nationalist and populist sentiment in order to win votes . 
But by the time its government was replaced in 2002 , by the current Socialist-led administration , Fidesz &apos;s record was rather pro-European . 
In other words , while populist-nationalist forces could well make further gains next year - even allying themselves , like the PiS , with far-right parties to win support for their policies - Central Europe is unlikely to revert to the virulent nationalism for which it was once infamous . 
Havel is right that the region will sober up after its political hangover . 
But , as with real hangovers , it won &apos;t be pretty to watch .
