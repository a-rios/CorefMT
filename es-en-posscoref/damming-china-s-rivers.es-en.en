Damming China &apos;s Rivers 
Of all China &apos;s problems , none will be more critical over the long run than how it resolves the tension between economic development and environmental protection . 
Nowhere are consequences of this struggle clearer than in the Himalayan foothills of the southwestern province of Yunnan . 
Yunnan is home to three great Asian rivers : the Mekong , the Salween ( or Nu ) , and the Jinsha . 
All start on the great Tibetan Plateau and flow in parallel through the northwest corner of the province into Southeast Asia . 
They are China &apos;s last pristine rivers , but are now slated for sacrifice to satisfy the country &apos;s insatiable thirst for power . 
Plans call for dozens of dams to be placed along their serpentine courses through the mountains of Yunnan . 
I had the chance to see one of these rivers - and the proposed site of one of the country &apos;s most controversial dams - on a recent trek through the stunning Tiger Leaping Gorge , north of the town of Lijiang in northern Yunnan . 
On its descent from the roof of the world , the Jinsha River , tributary of the mighty Yangtze , cascades through this ten-mile gorge on its way to Shanghai and the East China Sea . 
If , or rather when , the river is dammed , it will help power the cities and factories of coastal China . 
The sun was high above white-crowned Jade Dragon Snow Mountain when my guide pointed down the gorge at the brown waters churning thousands of feet below . 
&quot; That &apos;s where they will build the dam , &quot; Xiao Chun , a 17-year-old Naxi , one of Yunnan &apos;s 22 ethnic minorities , said . 
&quot; It will be very bad for us . 
There will be a lot of pollution . 
I hope it doesn &apos;t happen . &quot; 
The dam will have its uses . 
Dianchi Lake near the provincial capital , Kunming , is so shrunken and polluted that the city faces a serious water shortage . 
Water from the Tiger Leaping Gorge will be diverted to flush out Dianchi Lake , without which Kunming will not prosper . 
As China seeks to keep its economic engine running , dams and hyrdopower do represent a cleaner alternative to coal . 
China plans to double its hydropower capacity to over 120 GW by 2010 and to build more hydropower-projects for at least another 20 years . 
Experts reckon that only a quarter of China &apos;s hydropower has yet been tapped . 
Yet the costs may outweigh the benefits . 
Northwestern Yunnan is one of the world &apos;s most biologically diverse areas , home to half of China &apos;s animal species and a quarter of its plant species . 
Whatever portions of this ecosystem that the dams don &apos;t submerge are certain to be disrupted in potentially disastrous ways . 
A more immediate concern is the immense number of people who will need to be resettled when reservoirs inundate the region &apos;s densely populated valleys . 
Since 1949 , 16 million people have been displaced by reservoirs . 
Some 10 million of them still live in poverty . 
At Tiger Leaping Gorge , where a mere 100,000 residents will have to be relocated , residents fear that they will be ordered to move up the steep mountainsides to open marginal land at 6,000 to 9,000 feet . 
Dam opponents , including vocal indigenous environmental groups , have waged a seemingly successful battle to protect Tiger Leaping Gorge and the Salween ( the Nu River ) . 
In early 2005 , three years after a new law on environmental impact assessments ( EIA &apos;s ) was passed , the State Environmental Protection Bureau ( SEPA ) , ordered the halt of 30 large projects , including 26 hydropower plants that had failed to submit proper EIA &apos;s . 
Among the suspended projects was the first dam across the Nu / Salween . 
These efforts appear to have catalyzed greater environmental sensitivity among the country &apos;s leaders . 
The government recently called for more balanced development , even proposing a &quot; green index &quot; to measure growth . 
Indeed , Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has declared that he wants to see more &quot; scientific development &quot; in China &apos;s approach to its problems , and even called for a temporary halt of the Salween ( Nu ) River dam . 
Environmentalists were even permitted to take part in a public hearing on the Tiger Leaping Gorge project , a first for China . 
Unfortunately , the Communist Party &apos;s tolerance of such civic activity blows hot and cold . 
The Party , alarmed by the &quot; color revolutions &quot; that toppled post-Soviet leaders in Georgia , Ukraine , and Kyrgyzstan , is cracking down on domestic non-government organizations for fear that they , too , might become catalysts for popular uprisings . 
Support for &quot; green development &quot; inside central government organizations like SEPA offers little assurance of an effective countervailing force . 
&quot; We must sharpen our teeth , &quot; Pan Yue , SEPA &apos;s deputy director , said when the agency halted the dam projects . 
Indeed , local governments appear less afraid of Beijing &apos;s bite than before . 
When boundaries were negotiated for Three Parallel Rivers Park - designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003 - local authorities won a fight to exclude Tiger Leaping Gorge , knowing that a dam there would triple tax revenues . 
China urgently needs to maintain an annual growth rate of over 9 % as a bulwark against social disorder . 
As a result , however , China is slowly consuming itself , and no major part of China may remain pristine .
