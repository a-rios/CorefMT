Safeguarding Asia &apos;s Growth 
SEOUL - Emerging Asian countries should be proud of their economic resilience . 
Despite a global economy plagued by weak growth , persistently high unemployment , and heavy debt loads , the region &apos;s emerging and developing economies grew at an average annual rate of 6.8 % from 2000-2010 , propping up global output and buttressing recovery efforts . 
The region &apos;s success has been underpinned by dynamic growth in China and India , which account for almost 60 % of the continent &apos;s total GDP in purchasing power parity terms . 
Furthermore , economic-policy changes and structural reforms that were enacted in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis significantly reduced the region &apos;s vulnerability to financial shocks over the past decade . 
But Asia cannot be complacent : financial systems remain fragile ; economies are burdened with high fiscal and current-account deficits ; and Asia remains too heavily dependent on North American and European export markets , increasing its vulnerability to external shocks . 
Moreover , if conditions in the eurozone continue to deteriorate , Asia could be more severely affected . 
Already , spillover effects from trade and financial transmission channels are beginning to take their toll : China &apos;s GDP growth rate in the second quarter of 2012 averaged 7.6 % , reflecting a significant slowdown , and India &apos;s growth rate is expected to decline to roughly 6 % this year . 
China &apos;s potentially strong domestic-demand base and ample room for policy maneuvers can help it to avoid a hard landing . 
It has already aggressively loosened monetary policy , and it can employ further fiscal stimulus . 
But policy mismanagement and structural weaknesses in the financial sector and local governments could undermine efforts to safeguard growth . 
Meanwhile , India , constrained by a high fiscal deficit and persistent inflationary pressure , has less scope for expansionary policies and faces significant challenges in pursuing credible structural reform . 
This has serious implications for the rest of Asia . 
Over the last three decades , increased economic and trade integration has bolstered the region &apos;s growth . 
For example , segmented production for global supply chains has stimulated trade in intermediate goods and promoted foreign direct investment . 
Now , however , closer economic integration means that sluggish growth in China and India will reduce job opportunities and slow the rate of poverty reduction throughout the region . 
Faced with weak demand in advanced countries , Asian economies are working to rebalance their sources of growth by shifting toward domestic and regional markets . 
As a result , growth in intra-regional trade has outpaced overall trade growth , with intra-Asian trade now accounting for more than half of the continent &apos;s total trade turnover . 
But China &apos;s established role as the assembly hub for the region &apos;s production-sharing networks means that it is becoming a source of autonomous shocks - with a large and persistent impact on business-cycle fluctuations . 
So , what policies must emerging Asian economies pursue to reduce their vulnerability to regional and global volatility ? 
The most immediate challenge is to safeguard the financial system &apos;s stability against external shocks . 
Policy reform should aim to promote market transparency , improve risk management , and strengthen effective supervision and regulations . 
Second , emerging countries must develop more effective macroeconomic frameworks , including better macro-prudential regulation and a broader monetary-policy framework that takes into account asset prices and financial-market stability . 
A wide range of official measures could be employed to support domestic demand while protecting medium-term fiscal sustainability . 
And , to address volatile capital flows , countries should increase exchange-rate flexibility , maintain adequate international reserves , and implement carefully designed capital controls . 
Third , emerging economies must further rebalance their sources of growth . 
Reducing dependence on external demand - for example , by promoting private-sector investment and encouraging household expenditure - is crucial . 
Supply-side policies that promote small and medium-size enterprises and service industries accommodating domestic demand are also critical to ensuring more inclusive and sustainable growth . 
Finally , enhanced regional and global financial cooperation - including closer policy coordination at the G-20 and International Monetary Fund - would help countries to respond more effectively to shocks and crises . 
A key regional initiative is the $ 240 billion multilateral reserve pool of the ASEAN + 3 ( the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China , Japan , and South Korea ) , which can provide short-term liquidity to members when needed . 
Institutional arrangements in regional liquidity provision and economic surveillance must be enhanced . 
Asians need not be pessimistic ; the perfect storm of a hard landing in China , a double-dip recession in the United States , and a collapse of the eurozone is unlikely . 
But they cannot rule out the downside risk of a synchronized global downturn . 
Only with preemptive policies designed to manage risk better can emerging Asian countries protect economic growth from the threat of current and future crises .
