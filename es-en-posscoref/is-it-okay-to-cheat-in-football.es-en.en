Is it Okay to Cheat in Football ? 
MELBOURNE - Shortly before half-time in the World Cup elimination match between England and Germany on June 27 , the English midfielder Frank Lampard had a shot at goal that struck the crossbar and bounced down onto the ground , clearly over the goal line . 
The goalkeeper , Manuel Neuer , grabbed the ball and put it back into play . 
Neither the referee nor the linesman , both of whom were still coming down the field - and thus were poorly positioned to judge - signaled a goal , and play continued . 
After the match , Neuer gave this account of his actions : &quot; I tried not to react to the referee and just concentrate on what was happening . 
I realized it was over the line and I think the way I carried on so quickly fooled the referee into thinking it was not over . &quot; 
To put it bluntly : Neuer cheated , and then boasted about it . 
By any normal ethical standards , what Neuer did was wrong . 
In soccer , that does seem to be the prevailing ethic . 
The most famous of these incidents was Diego Maradona &apos;s goal in Argentina &apos;s 1986 World Cup match against England , which he later described as having been scored &quot; a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God . &quot; 
Replays left no doubt that it was the hand of Maradona that scored the goal . 
Twenty years later , he admitted in a BBC interview that he had intentionally acted as if it were a goal , in order to deceive the referee . 
Something similar happened last November , in a game between France and Ireland that decided which of the two nations went to the World Cup . 
The French striker Thierry Henry used his hand to control the ball and pass to a teammate , who scored the decisive goal . 
Asked about the incident after the match , Henry said : &quot; I will be honest , it was a handball . 
I played it , the ref allowed it . 
That &apos;s a question you should ask him . &quot; 
But is it ? 
Why should the fact that you can get away with cheating mean that you are not culpable ? 
Players should not be exempt from ethical criticism for what they do on the field , any more than they are exempt from ethical criticism for cheating off the field - for example , by taking performance-enhancing drugs . 
Sports today are highly competitive , with huge amounts of money at stake , but that does not mean it is impossible to be honest . 
In cricket , if a batsman hits the ball and one of the fielders catches it , the batsman is out . 
Sometimes when the ball is caught the umpire cannot be sure if the ball has touched the edge of the bat . 
The batsman usually knows and traditionally should &quot; walk &quot; - leave the ground - if he knows that he is out . 
Some still do . 
The Australian batsman Adam Gilchrist &quot; walked &quot; in the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka , although the umpire had already declared him not out . 
His decision surprised some of his teammates but won applause from many cricket fans . 
An Internet search brought me just one clear-cut case of a footballer doing something equivalent to a batsman walking . 
In 1996 , Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler was awarded a penalty for being fouled by the Arsenal goalkeeper . 
He told the referee that he had not been fouled , but the referee insisted that he take the penalty kick . 
Fowler did so , but in a manner that enabled the goalkeeper to save it . 
Why are there so few examples of such behavior from professional footballers ? 
Perhaps a culture of excessive partisanship has trumped ethical values . 
Fans don &apos;t seem to mind if members of their own team cheat successfully ; they only object when the other side cheats . 
That is not an ethical attitude . 
( Though , to their credit , many French football followers , from President Nicolas Sarkozy down , expressed their sympathy for Ireland after Henry &apos;s handball . ) 
Yes , we can deal with the problem to some extent by using modern technology or video replays to review controversial refereeing decisions . 
We should not make excuses for intentional cheating in sports . 
In one important way , it is much worse than cheating in one &apos;s private life . 
When what you do will be seen by millions , revisited on endless video replays , and dissected on television sports programs , it is especially important to do what is right . 
How would football fans have reacted if Neuer had stopped play and told the referee that the ball was a goal ? 
Given the rarity of such behavior in football , the initial reaction would no doubt have been surprise . 
Some German fans might have been disappointed . 
Neuer missed a rare opportunity to do something noble in front of millions of people . 
He could have set a positive ethical example to people watching all over the world , including the many millions who are young and impressionable . 
Who knows what difference that example might have made to the lives of many of those watching ? 
Neuer could have been a hero , standing up for what is right . 
Instead , he is just another footballer who is very skillful at cheating .
