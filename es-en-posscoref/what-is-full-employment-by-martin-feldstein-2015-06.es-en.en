What is Full Employment ? 
CAMBRIDGE - In an important sense , the US economy is now at full employment . 
The relatively tight labor market is causing wages to rise at an accelerating rate , because employers must pay more to attract and retain employees . 
This has important implications for policymakers - and not just at the Federal Reserve . 
Consider this : Average hourly earnings in May were 2.3 % higher than in May 2014 ; but , since the beginning of this year , hourly earnings are up 3.3 % , and in May alone rose at a 3.8 % rate - a clear sign of full employment . 
The acceleration began in 2013 as labor markets started to tighten . 
Average compensation per hour rose just 1.1 % from 2012 to 2013 , but then increased at a 2.6 % rate from 2013 to 2014 , and at 3.3 % in the first quarter of 2015 . 
These wage increases will soon show up in higher price inflation . 
The link between wages and prices is currently being offset by the sharp decline in the price of oil and gasoline relative to a year ago , and by the strengthening of the dollar relative to other currencies . 
But , as these factors &quot; impact on the overall price level diminishes , the inflation rate will rise more rapidly . 
Accelerating wage growth implies that the economy is now at a point at which increases in demand created by easier monetary policy or expansionary fiscal policy would not achieve a sustained rise in output and employment . 
There are of course other definitions of full employment . 
There are millions more who would like to work but are not actively looking , because they believe that there are no available jobs for people like themselves . 
And an additional 6.7 million are working part-time but would like to work more hours per week . 
In many cases , these unemployed and underemployed individuals are experiencing real hardship . 
By that indicator , the US economy is not at full employment . 
But , for the Fed , it is , in the sense that excessively easy monetary policy can no longer achieve a sustained increase in employment . 
At the same time , other types of policies that change incentives or remove barriers can lead to increased employment and higher real incomes , without raising wage and price inflation . 
Consider , for example , the high rate of non-employment among men aged 25 to 54 , a group too old to be in school and too young to retire . 
More than 15 % of men in this age group are not employed . 
Among those in this age range who have less than a high school education , 35 % are not employed . 
Programs to provide market-relevant education and training should be able to raise employment among this group . 
Or consider the employment experience of men and women over age 65 . 
This group is eligible for Social Security ( pensions ) and Medicare ( health insurance ) , and the majority are retired . 
But experience shows that the decision to retire or to work fewer hours is influenced by the compensation that members of this group receive . 
The payroll tax paid by employees is 6.65 % ( employers pay the same rate ) , and is in addition to the personal income tax . 
Moreover , because of the complex rules that govern the level of Social Security benefits , the older worker who pays this payroll tax is likely to receive no extra benefits . 
For many older workers , the choice is not whether to work , but how much . 
We now have less than full employment in the sense that the payroll tax encourages older workers to work fewer hours than they otherwise would . 
The Affordable Care Act ( &quot; Obamacare &quot; ) also reduces hours worked , in two different ways . 
First , for some individuals , working fewer hours reduces incomes enough to entitle them to a larger government subsidy for health insurance . 
Second , some employers are being incented to reduce the number of working hours for individual employees , because , above a specified number , Obamacare imposes a larger burden on them . 
Or consider minimum-wage legislation , which reduces employers &quot; willingness to hire low-skilled workers . 
As the minimum wage is increased , employers &quot; incentive to substitute equipment or more skilled employees strengthens . 
This reduction in the demand for low-skilled workers could be offset by taking into account the hourly equivalent of transfer payments when calculating the minimum wage . 
For example , someone who receives $ 8,000 a year in transfer payments ( such as food stamps , housing assistance , and the Earned Income Tax Credit ) might be deemed to have received the equivalent of $ 4 an hour toward meeting the minimum wage . 
That individual &apos;s combined income would be achieved with a lower cost to the employer , increasing the individual &apos;s ability to find employment . 
I could easily extend this list . 
The basic point is that employment can be increased , and unemployment decreased , by removing barriers to job creation and reducing marginal tax rates . 
By contrast , increasing demand by prolonging easy monetary policy or expanding fiscal spending is likely to result in rising inflation rather than rising employment .
