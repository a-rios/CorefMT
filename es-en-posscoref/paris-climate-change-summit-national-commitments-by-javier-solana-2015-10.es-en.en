The Climate &apos;s Point of No Return 
MADRID - When it comes to climate change , the world has reached a point of no return . 
That may sound ominous , but it is precisely where we need to be : unable to continue retreading old ground , we must resolutely set our future path . 
An important first step will come at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris in November and December , where world leaders will agree on the most important international agreement on climate governance in more than 20 years . 
Yet important decisions remain to be made in charting a course toward a new and dynamic low-carbon economy , one capable of supporting a fast-growing and increasingly prosperous global population in the long term . 
With citizens , business , and governments worldwide finally recognizing the universal nature of climate change , the outlook for this year &apos;s conference is substantially more positive than it was prior to the last attempt to reach a comprehensive global agreement , at the 2009 Copenhagen summit ( COP 15 ) . 
To be sure , the challenge ahead is as broad as it is complex ; but it is becoming increasingly clear that making the transition to a low-carbon economy will bring considerable economic benefits . 
Consider urbanization . 
In the next 15 years , the world &apos;s cities are set to grow dramatically , becoming home to 60 % of the world &apos;s 8.5 billion people . 
How those cities are designed will matter for both the environment and the economy . 
The difference between Atlanta and Barcelona is a case in point . 
The two cities have a similar number of residents , but Atlanta &apos;s transport-related carbon-dioxide emissions exceed Barcelona &apos;s by a factor of six . 
A key reason for this is urban sprawl : with a built-up area nearly 12 times larger than Barcelona , Atlanta implicitly encourages widespread private-vehicle use , boosting emissions , congestion , and air pollution . 
Compact , well-connected cities that feature efficient public transportation systems - cities like Barcelona - are healthier and more sustainable . 
Moreover , the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimates that such cities could reduce capital requirements for urban infrastructure by more than $ 3 trillion over the next 15 years . 
Cutting-edge technological developments - in renewable energy and hybrid or electric vehicles , for example - will be indispensable in building these cities ( and , more broadly , a clean and efficient economy ) . 
Although much research remains to be done , such technologies are increasingly accessible . 
In bringing about change , however , vested interests are a formidable sparring partner . 
Upending the status quo will be no easy feat . 
As Bank of England Governor Mark Carney recently warned , when the world takes serious action to stop climate change - as it is expected to do this December - vast fossil-fuel assets will be left stranded . 
The fact that those assets are a key tranche of many investment portfolios is an unavoidable reality , not a reason to reconsider . 
Fortunately , public awareness of the effects of fossil-fuel consumption is growing . 
On a macro level , the World Health Organization recently revised its estimate of the number of premature deaths due to air pollution to seven million annually . 
On a micro level , the masks commonly worn in heavily polluted cities , such as in China , are a visible sign of the need for change . 
Another challenge stems from the global nature of climate change . 
It is a classic public-goods problem : in principle , it is in individual countries &quot; self-interest not to take action , while the rest of the world does . 
Compounding the challenge further is the fact that the benefits of actions taken today accrue in the distant future . 
Here , too , changing perceptions of climate change offer renewed hope for progress . 
Spurred by increased public awareness and mounting evidence that national economies can reap net benefits from policies to mitigate climate change , governments worldwide are pledging to do so - and taking to multilateral forums to display those commitments . 
So far , 155 countries - including large emitters - have submitted to the UN plans describing their &quot; intended nationally determined contributions &quot; ( INDCs ) to the fight against climate change . 
India , the world &apos;s third-largest emitter , has pledged to reduce emissions intensity by 33-35 % from 2005 levels , and generate 40 % of its power from non-fossil-fuel sources , by 2030 . 
Brazil promises that its greenhouse-gas emissions in 2025 will be 37 % lower than in 2005 , and 43 % lower by 2030 . 
And the European Union has committed to a minimum emissions reduction of 40 % from 1990 levels . 
Perhaps most important , the United States and China - the world &apos;s top two emitters , which together account for more than one-third of global greenhouse-gas emissions - have finally stepped up , announcing concrete climate commitments in a joint statement last year . 
This injected significant momentum into global climate efforts . 
Last month , Chinese President Xi Jinping went a step further , pledging to establish by 2017 a national market to set prices for CO2 emissions . 
The document signed in Paris will be the first treaty of a new era . 
Its hybrid governance structure - which combines top-down elements ( primarily in monitoring and verification ) with bottom-up commitments ( the voluntary INDCs ) - is revolutionary , as it enables us to avoid the deadlock that often characterizes large-scale multilateral governance processes . 
Already , this new model has helped to encourage national participation and enhance transparency , with national policies being published openly on the UNFCCC website . 
But one critical question remains unresolved : How can we ensure that these voluntary individual pledges add up to a collective solution to a global problem ? 
Current calculations indicate that if the submitted INDCs , covering nearly 90 % of global emissions , are implemented , global warming will probably still exceed 2 ° Celsius ( 3.6 ° Fahrenheit ) - the threshold beyond which climate change &apos;s most disastrous consequences would be triggered . 
It is therefore vital that negotiators in Paris work together to determine how to boost policy ambition . 
At this point of no return , we must link national plans to global goals - and thereby ensure that we move in the right direction .
