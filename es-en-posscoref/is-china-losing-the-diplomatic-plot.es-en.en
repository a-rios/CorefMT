Is China Losing the Diplomatic Plot ? 
SINGAPORE - In 2016 , China &apos;s share of the global economy will be larger than America &apos;s in purchasing-price-parity terms . 
This is an earth-shaking development ; in 1980 , when the United States accounted for 25 % of world output , China &apos;s share of the global economy was only 2.2 % . 
And yet , after 30 years of geopolitical competence , the Chinese seem to be on the verge of losing it just when they need it most . 
China &apos;s leaders would be naïve and foolish to bank on their country &apos;s peaceful and quiet rise to global preeminence . 
At some point , America will awaken from its geopolitical slumber ; there are already signs that it has opened one eye . 
But China has begun to make serious mistakes . 
After Japan acceded to Chinese pressure and released a captured Chinese trawler in September 2010 , China went overboard and demanded an apology from Japan , rattling the Japanese establishment . 
Similarly , after North Korean shells killed innocent South Korean civilians in November 2010 , China remained essentially silent . 
In a carefully calibrated response , South Korea sent its ambassador to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for the imprisoned Chinese human-rights activist Liu Xiaobo in December 2010 . 
China has also ruffled many Indian feathers by arbitrarily denying visas to senior officials . 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao subsequently calmed the waters in meetings with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , but such unnecessary provocations left a residue of mistrust in India . 
But all of these mistakes pale in comparison with what China did to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in July . 
For the first time in 45 years , the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting ( AMM ) failed to agree to a joint communiqué , ostensibly because ASEAN &apos;s current chair , Cambodia , did not want the communiqué to refer to bilateral disputes in the South China Sea . 
But the whole world , including most ASEAN countries , perceived Cambodia &apos;s stance as the result of enormous Chinese pressure . 
China &apos;s victory proved to be Pyrrhic . 
It won the battle of the comminiqué , but it may have lost 20 years of painstakingly accumulated goodwill , the result of efforts such as the ASEAN-China free-trade agreement , signed in November 2002 . 
More importantly , China &apos;s previous leaders had calculated that a strong and unified ASEAN provided a valuable buffer against any possible US containment strategy . 
Now , by dividing ASEAN , China has provided America with its best possible geopolitical opportunity in the region . 
If Deng Xiaoping were alive , he would be deeply concerned . 
It may be unfair to blame China &apos;s leaders for the ASEAN debacle . 
More likely than not , over-zealous junior officials pushed a hard line on the South China Sea , whereas no Chinese leader , if given the choice , would have opted to wreck the AMM Communiqué . 
But the fact that it happened reveals the scope of China &apos;s recent poor decision-making . 
The &quot; nine-dotted line &quot; that China has drawn over the South China Sea may prove to be nothing but a big geopolitical millstone around China &apos;s neck . 
It was unwise to attach the map in a note verbale responding to a joint submission by Vietnam and Malaysia to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in May 2009 . 
This was the first time that China had included the map in an official communication to the UN , and it caused great concern among some ASEAN members . 
The geopolitical opportunity implied by inclusion of the map has not been lost on America , which is why the US , somewhat unusually , has made another effort to ratify the Law of the Sea Convention . 
Having tabled the nine-dotted line at the UN , China walked into a no-win situation , owing to the difficulty of defending the map under international law . 
Indeed , as the eminent historian Wang Gungwu has pointed out , the first maps to claim the South China Sea were Japanese , and were inherited by Nationalist China . 
Domestically , too , the nine-dotted line may cause problems for the government by presenting critics with a useful weapon . 
Any hint of compromise will expose officials politically . 
In other words , a few rocks in the South China Sea have put China between a rock and a hard place . 
There is no doubt that China will have to find a way to compromise over the nine-dotted line . 
In private , it has begun to do so . 
Even though the line covers the waters northeast of the Indonesian-owned Natuna Islands , the Chinese government has given Indonesia categorical assurances that China does not claim the Natuna Islands or their Exclusive Economic Zone . 
These private assurances calmed relations with Indonesia . 
So why not make similar overtures to other ASEAN states ? 
The legacies of Deng and his predecessor , Mao Zedong , are very different . 
But the People &apos;s Republic &apos;s two most important leaders did agree in one area : both bent over backwards to make territorial concessions to resolve border disputes . 
This explains why China was so generous to Russia , for example , in its border settlements . 
Mao and Deng could do this because both provided China with strong leadership . 
The challenge for the world now is that China has become politically pluralistic : no leader is strong enough to make wise unilateral concessions . 
Nothing will happen in China until the leadership transition is completed in November . 
The new administration of Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang will need some time to settle in . 
But America is waking up . 
So , too , will the rest of the world in 2016 . 
The big question then will be : Is China as geopolitically competent as number one as it was when it was number two ?
