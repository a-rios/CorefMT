The Triumph of Politics in Europe 
MADRID - Economics , particularly economic theories , always yield in the end to political imperatives . 
That is why Europe &apos;s fast-changing political landscape , reshaped by electoral insurrections in France and Greece against German-backed fiscal austerity , is bound to affect Europe &apos;s economic policies as well . 
Such an imperative has been at work throughout Europe &apos;s postwar history . 
Indeed , Europe &apos;s shift from the modest customs union of the European Economic Community to the single market and common currency of today &apos;s European Monetary Union was itself a fundamentally political move , one with strategic implications , of course . 
France wanted to tame German power by harnessing it to the European project , and Germany was prepared to sacrifice the Deutsche Mark for the sake of France &apos;s acceptance of a united Germany , the nightmare of Europe &apos;s recent past . 
An economically robust Germany is , without doubt , vital to the European project , if only because history has shown how dangerous an unhappy Germany can be . 
Indeed , it was thanks to the euro - and the captive European market that goes with it - that Germany today is the world &apos;s second-leading exporter ( China surpassed it in 2009 ) . 
Europe , however , has always found it difficult to come to terms with an over-confident , let alone arrogant , Germany . 
The current political turmoil in Europe shows that , regardless of how sensible Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s austerity prescriptions for debt-ridden peripheral Europe might be in the abstract , they resemble a German Diktat . 
The concern for many is not just Europe &apos;s historic &quot; German problem , &quot; but also that Germany could end up exporting to the rest of Europe the same ghosts of radical politics and violent nationalism that its economic success has transcended at home . 
Once the crisis became a sad daily reality for millions of unemployed - particularly for what appears to be a lost generation of young , jobless Europeans - EU institutions also became a target of popular rage . 
Their inadequacies - embodied in a cumbersome system of governance , and in endless , inconclusive summitry - and their lack of democratic legitimacy are being repudiated by millions of voters throughout the continent . 
Europe &apos;s experience has shown that the subordination of society to economic theories is politically untenable . 
Social vulnerability and frustration at the political system &apos;s failure to provide solutions are the grounds upon which radical movements have always emerged to offer facile solutions . 
A concomitant of such Kurzschluss between mainstream leaders and voters has always been the politics of accentuated ethnic identity , ultra-nationalism , and outright bigotry . 
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy ended up trying desperately to appeal to those very sentiments in his last-ditch effort to avert his political demise . 
What we have seen across Europe of late is a rebellion of voters against mainstream politics . 
In the first round of French presidential elections , the extreme right and left received more than 30 % of the vote , with Martine Le Pen &apos;s anti-EU National Front threatening to supplant the center-right Union for a Popular Movement as the country &apos;s new mainstream rightist party . 
In Greece , the party system &apos;s dangerous fragmentation into a range of smaller groups , combined with the robust emergence of a new anti-austerity left , Alexis Tsipras &apos;s Syriza , and a neo-Nazi right , has plunged governance into to a state of total paralysis . 
Ironically , what the civilized protests of mainstream parties in peripheral Europe failed to achieve - a relaxation of the dogma of austerity - might come about as a result of the politics of brinkmanship proposed by the Greek radical left . 
By its blatant rebellion against German-dictated austerity , and by making Greek withdrawal from the euro a credible possibility , Syriza is bringing closer than ever the euro &apos;s chaotic collapse in Europe &apos;s periphery , if not beyond . 
By insisting that the choice is between new terms for the Greek bailout or a Doomsday scenario , Syriza could be creating the possibility for a quasi-Keynesian resolution of the European crisis . 
Tsipras might be &quot; impetuous , &quot; as his mainstream adversaries from the center-left Pasok and the center-right New Democracy would say , but he is not irrational . 
His is a rather sober reading of reality : the austerity plan has become a highway to social hell for his countrymen , and would likely condemn Greece to long years of ruinous depression within a permanent debt trap , and possibly to a breakdown of democracy . 
Merkel &apos;s now legendary obstinacy eventually might have to succumb to the imperatives of politics . 
It is one thing to ignore European Commission President José Manuel Barroso &apos;s call for a more flexible economic policy , and quite another to dismiss out of hand the powerful message coming from French and Greek voters . 
Nor is it a minor political headache for Merkel to have to face an anti-austerity alliance of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and the new French president , François Hollande . 
Spain &apos;s capacity to withstand an austerity &quot; cure &quot; that only sinks it deeper into recession must also have its limits . 
So now Germany &apos;s finance ministry , the guardian of fiscal rectitude , is considering measures such as using the European Investment Bank to foster growth , issuing EU &quot; project bonds &quot; to finance infrastructure investment , and allowing wages in Germany to rise at a faster pace than in the rest of Europe . 
The imminent - indeed , inevitable - victory of politics over recalcitrant economics may well be at hand .
