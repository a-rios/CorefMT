Kosovo and Kostunica 
PRISTINA : &quot; Everything must change so that nothing will change . &quot; 
That aphorism , from Prince Lampedusa &apos;s great novel The Leopard now seems applicable to Kosovo after Milosevic &apos;s fall . 
Will a democratically elected president in Belgrade mean that everything has changed for Serbia , but that nothing has changed in Serbia &apos;s relations with Kosovo ? 
Whether Serbia is a democracy or not , one thing is certain : in the next five years Kosovo has little hope of becoming a prosperous democratic country . 
The reason is simple : Kosovo has never been such . 
Today , it is a UN administered territory undergoing a transition from 50 years of communism , 10 years of apartheid-like Serb rule , and the ravages of war . 
Moreover , Kosovo &apos;s long-term status is undefined : although a UN protectorate it remains formally under the sovereignty of the disintegrating Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro . 
Becoming a democratic , economically prosperous state may , indeed , be beyond the reach of Kosovars for years to come , because Kosovo first needs to become its own state if prosperity and democracy are to take root . 
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 , the supreme law here , precludes this unless both sides - Serbia and Kosovo - agree to it in negotiations . 
But Resolution 1244 does not rule out Kosovo acquiring a de-facto government that functions like a true national government . 
Real possibilities exist for this to happen . 
The first democratic local elections in Kosovo &apos;s history - which began last weekend - will bring strong pressures from Kosovars to write a provisional constitution and hold general elections . 
Furthermore , there is also a wide consensus to pursue privatization at full speed . 
Indeed , there is a chance that economic reform here can be conducted in an unprecedented way in this region . 
Corruption , which blighted privatization elsewhere , should be minimized because of UN supervision . 
Effective privatization could change Kosovo &apos;s dynamics . 
But an improved economy is unlikely to satisfy the vast majority of Kosovo &apos;s people . 
Permanent status is what matters most , and will be determined largely by Kosovo &apos;s political and economic transformation . 
But a tolerant society living in peace with its neighboring states must also be created if international recognition is to be secured . 
Vast improvement is needed on the Kosovar side for tolerance to take root . 
Tolerance , however , is hard to come by when hindered by the UN &apos;s failure to contain the lawlessness that has plagued Kosovo since the end of NATO &apos;s bombing . 
Improved relations with most of Kosovo &apos;s neighbors should not be hard to achieve , save for one neighbor . 
Relations between Serbia and Kosovo , however , provide all the complications a diplomat could need . 
Here , Milosevic &apos;s fall raised hopes by offering the promise of open dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo . 
Those hopes are laced with skepticism . 
Kosovo &apos;s skepticism about Serbia &apos;s democratic credentials is derived , primarily , from knowing that conflict between Kosovo and Serbia is structural , not based on a single man . 
No matter how much Milosevic exacerbated tensions , his policies toward Kosovo &apos;s ethnic Albanians were genuinely popular among Serbs . 
Indeed , throughout the decade of Yugoslavia &apos;s wars , Serbia &apos;s attitude toward its minorities reflected a nationalist consensus , in which the bulk of what was then the opposition participated . 
Most Kosovars will find talking to Serbia about improved relations difficult if Serbia does not undergo some sort of &quot; de-nazification &quot; process . 
President Kostunica &apos;s refusal , so far , to even discuss putting internationally indicted war criminals on trial is not a hopeful omen here . 
But Kosovo is not alone in continuing to identify the state led from Belgrade with the atrocities of the past decade . 
So most of Serbia &apos;s neighbors are surprised at the West &apos;s euphoria at Milosevic &apos;s fall . 
Several Western diplomats , indeed , claim that the changes in Belgrade are so historic that everything in the region must be subordinated to them ; that today &apos;s Yugoslav Federation must quickly become a member of the OSCE , the UN , the IMF , and the World Bank . 
But overlooking history provides no incentive for President Kostunica to critically examine Serbian actions over the past decade . 
A warm international embrace may only undermine the chance for negotiated settlements between Serbia and its neighbors . 
Recently I suggested that what needs to develop is something like a &quot; Three Taiwan Scenario &quot; in which Kosovo , Montenegro , and Serbia experience a period of internal consolidation , focusing on how their states function rather than on how they are recognized internationally . 
Stripped of international recognition two decades ago , Taiwan turned inward and created a prosperous economy and new democracy . 
This process , somewhat clandestinely , is underway in Kosovo . 
It should begin in Serbia and Montenegro as well . 
If everything has now changed in Serbia , the events of a year ago also changed everything forever in Kosovo . 
Today , no politically relevant force in Kosovo is prepared to advocate or accept any solution that hinders the ability of Kosovo &apos;s people to decide their own fate .
