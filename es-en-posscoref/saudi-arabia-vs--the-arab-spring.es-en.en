Saudi Arabia vs. the Arab Spring 
PRINCETON - Saudi Arabia is widely perceived as leading the counter-revolution against the Arab Spring uprisings . 
In reality , the Kingdom &apos;s response is centered , as its foreign and domestic policy has long been , on &quot; stability . &quot; 
The Saudis don &apos;t want anti-Saudi forces , including such enemies as Iran and Al Qaeda , to increase their influence in the Middle East . 
Some of the older Saudi leaders have seen this movie before . 
The nationalist revolutions of the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , inspired and galvanized by Gamel Nasser &apos;s Egypt , nearly toppled the House of Saud . 
Nonetheless , today &apos;s Saudi princes appear to recognize that something has genuinely changed in the Middle East : The younger generation of Arabs is no longer prepared to accept unaccountable , corrupt , and brutal governments . 
Saudi Arabia , a self-proclaimed bulwark of Islamic conservatism , where popular democracy has never been considered a legitimate form of rule , has been more aggressive in some arenas than in others . 
Domestically , the royal family struck quickly , adopting a ban on public demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience . 
The Kingdom &apos;s traditional interpretation of Islam construes political legitimacy in terms of a ruler &apos;s proper application of Islamic law . 
In return , his subjects owe him obedience within the constraints of Sharia religious law . 
Dissent , should it arise , must always take the form of well-intentioned advice given to the ruler in a private setting . 
Public demonstrations of dissent are regarded as contrary to Islam , because they foster divisiveness and lead to civil strife . 
The highest council of Saudi religious scholars recently declared demonstrations to be categorically un-Islamic . 
Confronted with the possibility of mass demonstrations on March 11 - the so-called Day of Rage on a Facebook page - the Saudi rulers enforced that ruling by deploying massive numbers of security forces in the streets . 
They also played the Shia card , an effective trump in Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia . 
The rulers argued that public protests throughout the region were being orchestrated by Shia Iran , and were anti-Sunni and sectarian . 
The threat of chaos , evident now in Libya , Syria , and Yemen , also weighed in the royal family &apos;s favor . 
The House of Saud has a long historical claim on rule in Arabia , and its promise of stability remains key to its durability . 
A massive government subsidy package also accounted for domestic calm . 
Abruptly , some $ 130 billion was added to spending projections over the next five years . 
Salaries for all public servants , a majority of the national work force , were raised , as was the total number of public-sector jobs . 
King Abdullah pledged large numbers of new housing units , an important gesture in a country where young people , especially young married couples , cannot easily access the housing market . 
In neighboring Bahrain , the Saudis also moved quickly to bolster the Sunni-minority regime against a rising tide of protest led by the island kingdom &apos;s Shia majority . 
Saudi troops marched into Bahrain under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , and the Saudi rulers issued clear instructions to adopt an iron-fisted policy with the demonstrators , again arguing that Iran &apos;s nefarious hand was at play in subverting the country . 
No doubt , the Saudis believe that a Shia-led Bahrain would lead to Iranian dominance at their very doorstep . 
Here , too , the Kingdom employed its policy of largesse through the GCC , promising Bahrain $ 10 billion over the next decade . 
Other large-scale financial commitments were made to Oman and Jordan , both Saudi allies that have managed to silence early whispers of mass protest . 
Farther away , in Libya and Syria , the Saudis have said little , perhaps to avoid picking the losing side in uncertain circumstances . 
The Kingdom has no love for Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi , who tried to assassinate King Abdullah and has waged a concerted anti-Saudi propaganda campaign for at least a decade . 
The Saudis would surely like to see Qaddafi deposed , but they have no real stake in the Libyan uprising &apos;s outcome . 
Closer to home , the Kingdom despises Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for his alliance with Iran and duplicity in Lebanon . 
But his fall would present the Saudis with the risk of a country led by the Muslim Brotherhood . 
Even worse is the prospect of Syria falling into chaos , dragging Lebanon - and maybe the broader region - with it . The Assad regime &apos;s use of excessive force , especially the deliberate killing of thousands of mainly Sunni civilians , has nonetheless recently spurred a tougher stance . 
King Abdullah has called the killings unacceptable , and has withdrawn his ambassador from Damascus . 
The actual policy implications , however , remain to be determined . 
Neighboring Yemen is a much more immediate threat . 
The opposition is hopelessly divided , and the tribal and military leadership is utterly compromised . 
Ominously , the south is being taken over by hardcore Islamists , some allied with Al Qaeda . 
Throwing money around won &apos;t work in Yemen , which is too large and complex to be pacified . 
In fact , the country is on the verge of total collapse . 
Today , the Saudis see 24 million Yemenis - hungry , heavily armed , and envious of Saudi wealth - looking across the border . 
If civil war erupts , the Saudis will not be able to stop the waves of refugees . 
But the Kingdom remains paralyzed , still wavering on whether to allow President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who is convalescing in Riyadh from injuries sustained in a bomb attack , to return to Sana to resume his rule . 
For all of their wealth and planning , the Saudis remain vulnerable to the turmoil surrounding them . 
At home , the legacy of Saudi family rule , fear of chaos , increased public spending , and abundant security forces have produced calm . 
But a modest political opening and economic diversification away from state-owned industry have been sacrificed . 
In Bahrain , things are quiet now as well , but the chances of further radicalization of the country &apos;s Shia majority have increased , possibly benefiting Iran in the long run . 
Great change is coming to the Middle East .
