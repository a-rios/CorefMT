India &apos;s Change of Guard 
SINGAPORE - In August , Raghuram Rajan was appointed Governor of the Reserve Bank of India . 
On one level , this was a routine announcement that many had anticipated - after all , Rajan is arguably the best-known Indian economist of his generation . 
On another level , however , his appointment can be seen as part of a broader generational shift . 
Rajan , just 50 , will be the first RBI governor born after India became a republic in 1950 . 
Similar changes are taking place in all walks of Indian life , including politics , the arts , sports , and social development . 
And India will be better for it . 
Although the country is one of the youngest in the world , with an average age of just 26 years , until recently aging stalwarts incongruously dominated most fields , from politics to the arts and even business and sports . 
But now younger entrants are rising everywhere , bringing with them energy and new ideas . 
In politics , as the country prepares for next year &apos;s general election , the leading contenders to replace 81-year-old Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are the Bharatiya Janata Party &apos;s Narendra Modi , 62 , and Rahul Gandhi , who is just 43 . 
Either man would be the first prime minister who was not born in the British Raj . 
The arts were one of the first areas to witness this generational change . 
For a long time , Indian literature , especially in English , was dominated by a clique who wrote mainly for a niche audience and literary recognition . 
Then , a few years ago , a group of young writers - such as Chetan Bhagat and Amish Tripathi , both former bankers - changed the rules of the game by writing for the mass market . 
Rather than write for literary critics , they began to use a simpler language , including Indian turns of phrase . 
They also chose new themes : Tripathi dipped into ancient mythology to write a trilogy about the god Shiva , while Bhagat began to write about the lives of India &apos;s young , upwardly mobile middle class . 
Predictably , the purists pounced and the critics ridiculed . 
But people have bought their books in the millions , and film deals have followed . 
As a result , the market for books has dramatically expanded and publishers have been forced to change their entire business strategies . 
Something similar has happened in the music industry . 
Previously dominated by a small cabal of singers and music directors , the market has been transformed by TV talent contests , similar to American Idol , which provide a national showcase for the wealth of India &apos;s talent . 
The shows have made participants , some drawn from remote towns , into overnight stars , and many of them have gone on to sign lucrative careers . 
Thanks partly to this parade of new talent , the Indian music industry is experiencing a period of extraordinary innovation and expansion . 
Generational change has even come to India &apos;s most popular sport - cricket . 
Such was the adulation once heaped upon its aging stars that many of them remained on the national team long past their peak . 
But a mere two years after winning the World Cup in 2011 , several members of that victorious team have been replaced - a decision that until recently would have seemed unthinkable . 
India &apos;s social sector has also been transformed . 
Development policy used to be dominated by career activists wedded to socialist-era thinking . 
But the arrival of new faces from the world of business , such as Ashish Dhawan , Jayant Sinha , and Ramesh and Swati Ramanathan , has meant that development issues are at last being assessed according to the problem-solving approach of social entrepreneurs , rather than through the ideological lens of activists . 
Ironically , it is the world of business that remains slow to change . 
The growth of the IT sector in the 1990 &quot; s seemed to promise that change would be rapid and far-reaching , but the old business families still dominate . 
There is hope , though . 
Entrepreneurs like Manish Sabharwal of Teamlease , and Binny and Sachin Bansal of Flipkart , an online retailer , are fundamentally changing the way India does business . 
Similarly , Indian academia may be moribund , but new public intellectuals like Pratap Bhanu Mehta have emerged from outside the mainstream . 
Yes , India &apos;s economy has slowed sharply , the rupee has plunged , and scandals and protests dominate the headlines . 
But , behind the gloom , a new generation is taking over , bringing with it fresh ideas and visions for India .
