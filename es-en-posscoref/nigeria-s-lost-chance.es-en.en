Nigeria &apos;s Lost Chance 
Nigeria &apos;s first attempt since independence in 1960 to transfer power from one civilian government to another has just ended - farcically . 
Indeed , the presidential election degenerated into a crude exercise in ballot rigging and voter intimidation . 
As a result , the victory of Umaru Yar &apos;Adua , the candidate of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party and President Olusegun Obasanjo &apos;s hand-picked successor , is now hotly disputed . 
The major opposition candidates - Muhammadu Buhari of the All Nigeria Peoples Party ( ANPP ) , Patrick Utomi of the African Democratic Party ( ADP ) , Atiku Abubakar of the Action Congress ( AC ) , and Orji Uzor Kalu of the Progressive Peoples Alliance ( PPA ) - reject the results and are calling on Nigerians to protest peacefully . 
Both local and Western election monitors have said that the poll fell far below acceptable standards . 
Although American officials had said that the United States would not support Obasanjo if the election were flawed , it was an open secret long before polling began that the PDP would manipulate the outcome to remain in power . 
Obasanjo made it clear that he considered the election a &quot; do or die affair &quot; and would hand over power only to Yar &apos;Adua . 
Even so , the scale and brazenness of the fraud were unprecedented , indicating Obasanjo &apos;s desperation . 
Obasanjo is understandably anxious . 
Last May , the National Assembly slapped down his attempt to re-write the constitution in order to remain in office beyond the stipulated two terms . 
His effort to use corruption charges to exclude from the election his vice president , Atiku Abububar , with whom he had been feuding since 2004 , also failed when the Supreme Court ruled that Abububar &apos;s name had to be restored to the ballot . 
Moreover , Obasanjo has a long and sorry track record when it comes to elections . 
In his first incarnation as military head of state in the late 1970 &quot; s , he had a relatively free hand to shape the outcome of the 1979 elections . 
He gave power to Shehu Shagari , the presidential candidate of the National Party of Nigeria , who was widely viewed as incompetent and yoked to feudal interests in Nigeria &apos;s Muslim north . 
The Shagari government quickly became mired in corruption and inefficiency , plunging the country into debt and a vicious cycle of unemployment , declining productivity , and social unrest . 
So the military , which had terminated the First Republic in January 1966 with a bloody coup , returned to power in December 1983 and did not quit until 1999 , when pro-democracy forces , galvanized by economic decline and reports of military graft , forced the democratic elections that brought back Obasanjo to power . 
Obasanjo &apos;s eight years in office did not resolve Nigeria &apos;s economic and political problems - key among them a new political framework to fit the country &apos;s social diversity . 
And , given its past performance , it is unlikely that the PDP will allow for a new and cleaner vote . 
Buhari , the ANPP candidate , has asked the National Assembly to begin impeachment proceedings against Obasanjo . 
Some prominent Nigerians have also suggested that if the electoral crisis is not resolved before Obasanjo steps down on May 29 , the chief justice should take over as interim president and organize new elections . 
Buhari has wide support in the north and Abubakar has a formidable and well-resourced party machine ; but mutual distrust run deep in both camps . 
If they unite in their moment of adversity and take their grievance into the streets , they will have to confront the generals , notorious for their disregard of civil rights and liberties . 
Obasanjo retains the backing of the army , some of whose members openly participated in stuffing ballot boxes and intimidating the opposition . 
Any significant move to tackle the PDP machine will likely need to come from the Senate and its president , Ken Nnamani , who played a key role in thwarting Obasanjo &apos;s quest for a third term . 
Nnamani &apos;s sudden decision to recall the lawmakers in the wake of the vote may be the first step in this direction . 
But impeachment proceedings are not likely to be concluded before Obasanjo quits on May 29 . 
The Supreme Court has a new chief justice whose ruling in the Abubakar case demonstrated that he could be counted on to intervene on the side of fair play , but it is not clear what constitutional instrument could be used to resolve the election crisis before the hand-over date . 
So once again , democracy in Nigeria is at a knife &apos;s edge . 
Armed militias in the Niger Delta are becoming bolder . 
The price of Nigerian crude is rising , a sure sign that the world sees instability ahead . 
Only swift and firm intervention from impartial external parties working in concert with the National Assembly and the courts can avert a looming disaster .
