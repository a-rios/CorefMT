Asian Nationalism at Sea 
CAMBRIDGE - Will war break out in the seas of East Asia ? 
After Chinese and Japanese nationalists staged competing occupations of the barren landmasses that China refers to as the Diaoyu Islands and Japan calls the Senkaku Islands , angry demonstrators in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu chanted , &quot; We must kill all Japanese . &quot; 
Likewise , a standoff between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea led to protests in Manila . 
And a long planned step forward in cooperation between South Korea and Japan was torpedoed when the South Korean president visited the barren island that Korea calls Dokdo , Japan calls Takeshima , and the United States calls the Liancourt Rocks . 
One should not be too alarmist . 
The US has declared that the Senkaku Islands ( administered by the Okinawa Prefecture when it was returned to Japan in 1972 ) are covered by the US-Japan security treaty . 
Meanwhile , the standoff over the Scarborough Shoal has calmed down , and , while Japan recalled its ambassador from South Korea over the Dokdo incident , it is unlikely the two countries would come to blows . 
But it is worth recalling that China used lethal force to expel Vietnamese from the Paracel Islands in 1974 and 1988 . 
And China prevailed upon the Cambodian host of this year &apos;s ASEAN summit to block a final communiqué that would have called for a code of conduct in the South China Sea - the first time in the ten-member association &apos;s four-decade history that it failed to issue a communiqué . 
The revival of extreme nationalism in East Asia is both worrisome and understandable . 
In Europe , while Greeks may grumble about the terms of German backing for emergency financing , the period since World War II has seen enormous progress in knitting countries together . 
Nothing similar has happened in Asia , and issues dating back to the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s remain raw , a problem exacerbated by biased textbooks and government policies . 
The Chinese Communist Party is not very communist any more . 
Instead , it bases its legitimacy on rapid economic growth and ethnic Han nationalism . 
Memories of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and Japanese aggression in the 1930 &quot; s are politically useful and fit within a larger theme of Chinese victimization by imperialist forces . 
Some American defense analysts view China &apos;s maritime strategy as being clearly aggressive . 
They point to increasing defense expenditures and the development of missile and submarine technology designed to cordon off the seas extending from China &apos;s coast to &quot; the first island chain &quot; of Taiwan and Japan . 
Others , however , see a Chinese strategy that is confused , contradictory , and paralyzed by competing bureaucratic interests . 
They point to the negative results of China &apos;s more assertive policies since the economic crisis of 2008 . 
Indeed , China &apos;s policies have damaged its relations with nearly all of its neighbors . 
Consider the Senkaku incident in 2010 , when , after Japan arrested the crew of a Chinese trawler that had rammed a Japanese coast guard vessel , China escalated its economic reprisals . 
The result , as one Japanese analyst put it , was that &quot; China scored an own goal , &quot; immediately reversing what had been a favorable trend in bilateral relations under the ruling Democratic Party of Japan . 
More generally , while China spends billions of renminbi in efforts to increase its soft power in Asia , its behavior in the South China Sea contradicts its own message . 
I have asked Chinese friends and officials why China follows such a counterproductive strategy . 
The first and formal answer is that China inherited historical territorial claims , including a map from the Nationalist period that sketches a &quot; nine-dotted line &quot; encompassing virtually the entire South China Sea . 
Today , with technology making underwater as well as fisheries resources more exploitable in the area , it is impossible to abandon this patrimony . 
In 2009-2010 , some mid-ranking officials and commentators even referred to the South China Sea as a sovereign &quot; core interest &quot; like Taiwan or Tibet . 
But China &apos;s leaders have never been clear about the exact location of the &quot; nine-dotted line , &quot; or about whether their claims refer only to certain land features , or also to more extensive continental shelves and seas . 
When asked why they do not clarify their claims , my Chinese interlocutors sometimes say that to do so would require difficult political and bureaucratic compromises that would provoke domestic nationalists . 
Moreover , sometimes they say that they do not want to give away a bargaining chip prematurely . 
In 1995 , and again in 2010 , the US declared that the waters of the South China Sea should be governed by the 1982 United Nations Law of the Seas Treaty ( which , ironically , the US has not yet ratified ) , but that the US takes no position on the territorial claims . 
Instead , the US urged that competing claims be resolved through negotiation . 
In 2002 , China and ASEAN agreed on a legally non-binding code of conduct for managing such disputes , but , as a large power , China believes that it will gain more in bilateral rather than multilateral negotiations with small countries . 
That belief was behind China &apos;s pressure on Cambodia to block ASEAN &apos;s final communiqué this summer . 
But this is a mistaken strategy . 
As a large power , China will have great weight in any circumstance , and it can reduce its self-inflicted damage by agreeing to a code of conduct . 
As for the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands , the best proposal comes from The Economist . 
China should refrain from sending official vessels into Japanese waters , and use a hotline with Japan to manage crises generated by nationalist &quot; cowboys . &quot; 
At the same time , the two countries should revive a 2008 framework for joint development of disputed gas fields in the East China Sea , and Japan &apos;s central government should purchase the barren islands from their private owner and declare them an international maritime protected area . 
It is time for all countries in East Asia to remember Winston Churchill &apos;s famous advice : &quot; To jaw-jaw is always better than to war-war . &quot;
