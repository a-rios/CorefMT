Kidney for Sale 
NEW HAVEN - World Kidney Day , to be held on March 12 , is part of a global health campaign meant to alert us to the impact of kidney disease . 
Sadly , there is little to celebrate . 
According to the International Society of Nephrology , kidney disease affects more than 500 million people worldwide , or 10 % of the adult population . 
With more people developing high blood pressure and diabetes ( key risks for kidney disease ) , the picture will only worsen . 
There are 1.8 million new cases of the most serious form of kidney disease - renal failure - each year . 
Unless patients with renal failure receive a kidney transplant or undergo dialysis - an expensive life-long procedure that cleanses the blood of toxins - death is guaranteed within a few weeks . 
Last year , an Australian nephrologist , Gavin Carney , held a press conference in Canberra to urge that people be allowed to sell their kidneys . 
&quot; The current system isn &apos;t working , &quot; the Sydney Morning Herald quoted him as saying . 
&quot; We &apos;ve tried everything to drum up support &quot; for organ donation , but &quot; people just don &apos;t seem willing to give their organs away for free . &quot; 
Carney wants to keep patients from purchasing kidneys on the black market and in overseas organ bazaars . 
As an American recipient of a kidney who was once desperate enough to consider doing that myself ( fortunately , a friend ended up donating to me ) , I agree wholeheartedly that we should offer well-informed individuals a reward if they are willing to save a stranger &apos;s life . 
If not , we will continue to face a dual tragedy : on one side , the thousands of patients who die each year for want of a kidney ; on the other side , a human-rights disaster in which corrupt brokers deceive indigent donors about the nature of surgery , cheat them out of payment , and ignore their post-surgical needs . 
The World Health Organization estimates that 5 % to 10 % of all transplants performed annually - perhaps 63,000 in all - take place in the clinical netherworlds of China , Pakistan , Egypt , Colombia , and Eastern Europe . 
Unfortunately , much of the world transplant establishment - including the WHO , the international Transplantation Society , and the World Medical Association - advocates only a partial remedy . 
They � focus on ending organ trafficking but ignore the time-tested truth that trying to stamp out illicit markets either drives them further underground or causes corruption to � reappear elsewhere . 
For example , after China , India , and Pakistan began cracking down on illicit organ markets , many patients turned to the Philippines . 
Last spring , after the Philippines banned the sale of kidneys to foreigners , a headline in the Jerusalem Post read , &quot; Kidney Transplant Candidates in Limbo after Philippines Closes Gates . &quot; 
( Israel has one of the lowest donation rates in the world , so the government pays for transplant surgery performed outside the country . ) 
Similarly , patients from Qatar who traveled to Manila are &quot; looking for alternative solutions , &quot; according to The Peninsula . 
True , more countries must develop efficient systems for posthumous donation , a very important source of organs . 
The truth is that trafficking will stop only when the need for organs disappears . 
Opponents allege that a legal system of exchange will inevitably replicate the sins of the black market . 
This is utterly backward . 
The remedy to this corrupt and unregulated system of exchange is a regulated and transparent regime devoted to donor protection . 
My colleagues and I suggest a system in which compensation is provided by a third party ( government , a charity , or insurance ) with public oversight . 
Because bidding and private buying would not be permitted , available organs would be distributed to the next in line - not just to the wealthy . 
Donors would be carefully screened for physical and psychological problems , as is currently done for all volunteer living kidney donors . 
Moreover , they would be guaranteed follow-up � care for any complications . 
Many people are uneasy about offering lump-sum cash payments . 
A solution is to provide in-kind rewards - such as a down payment on a house , a contribution to a retirement fund , or lifetime health insurance - so that the program would not be attractive to people who might otherwise rush to donate on the promise of a large sum of instant cash . 
The only way to stop illicit markets is to create legal ones . 
Indeed , there is no better justification for testing legal modes of exchange than the very depredations of the underground market . 
Momentum is growing . 
In the British Medical Journal , a leading British transplant surgeon called for a controlled donor compensation program for unrelated live donors . 
Within the last year , the Israeli , Saudi , and Indian governments have decided to offer incentives ranging from lifelong health insurance for the donor to a cash benefit . 
In the United States , the American Medical Association has endorsed a draft bill that would make it easier for states to offer various non-cash incentives for donation . 
Until countries create legal means of rewarding donors , the fates of Third World donors and the patients who need their organs to survive will remain morbidly entwined . 
What better way to mark World Kidney Day than for global health leaders to take a bold step and urge countries to experiment with donor rewards ?
