Testing the Limits of Fossil Fuels 
MILAN - Most people recognize that human activity , primarily the use of fossil fuels , is contributing mightily to an increasing level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . 
These gases , particularly CO2 , increase the risk of damage to the world &apos;s climate . 
This means that limits on our consumption of fossil fuels cannot be measured only by the availability of supplies , but must also take account of the environmental costs . 
Yet considerable uncertainty remains about the magnitude of the impact of rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases on temperatures and climate . 
This uncertainty must be taken seriously when formulating strategies to combat climate change . 
The high-growth developing countries - Brazil , Russia , India , China , and others in the G-20 - now include more than half the world &apos;s population . 
If they continue their current strong growth trajectories , as seems likely , they will approach advanced-country levels of income by mid-century or shortly thereafter . 
At that point , the part of the world &apos;s population with advanced-country income levels ( $ 20,000 dollars or above in today &apos;s dollars ) would increase from 16 % to 66 % . 
And , if the newly affluent follow the patterns of consumption , energy use , and carbon emissions that accompany high income levels now , the climate change battle will have been lost . 
Emissions and natural processes that increase atmospheric carbon are known as &quot; flows . &quot; 
Mitigation attempts to reduce these flows and thus reduce the rate of increase of the stock of carbon in the atmosphere , with the ultimate goal of stabilizing or reducing it to safe levels . 
Without mitigation , and assuming that the high-growth developing countries reach current advanced-country levels of annual per capita CO2 emissions ( 10 to 11 tons , though much higher in North America ) , the current global average of 4.8 tons will almost double in 50 years , to 8.7 tons . 
This compares poorly with the most recent estimate of a reasonably safe level of CO2 emissions calculated by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . 
To prevent further climate change , the IPCC believes , emissions should be brought down to 2.3 tons per person globally , or roughly half the current per capita average , in the next 50 to 75 years . 
On our current course , without a significant mitigation effort , by mid-century we would be at around four times the safe level . 
Advanced countries have been the biggest sources of carbon emissions until relatively recently . 
But energy consumption - and thus carbon emissions - rise with per capita income . 
China and India , which account for 40 % of the world &apos;s population , were recording 9-10 % annual GDP growth before the financial crisis hit in 2008 and are likely to resume rapid growth in the post-crisis period , meaning that their economies will double in size every 7-10 years . 
Their contribution to total emissions will rise accordingly . 
Other economies are growing at relatively high rates , too . 
As a result , while many advanced and developing countries are pursuing far-reaching measures to increase energy efficiency and adopt clean-energy technologies , their existing technologies , incentives , regulations , and commitments imply a sharp rise in total carbon emissions in the coming decades . 
Despite the IPCC &apos;s target for annual per capita CO2 emissions , we still do not know how much warming various levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause . 
The estimated ranges vary widely , even after a quarter-century of scientific effort , owing to the complexity of the environment itself . 
This is one reason why successful mitigation at the global level faces stiff headwinds . 
Indeed , it is not reasonable to expect that any country , rich or poor , should set or agree to 50-year targets . 
Given the structure of the problem - sequential decision-making with uncertainty about all the relevant parameters ( including costs , the efficient pattern of mitigation , and technology ) - it would be wiser to adopt a more flexible strategy that provides incentives and regulations to achieve measurable intermediate progress , while generating a lot of useful information along the way . 
In other words , we should focus our efforts on a shorter time frame , say , the next 15 years . 
In the long run , success will require major technological advances and their broad adoption . 
As these are still unknown today , the initial challenge will be to jump-start the mitigation and learning processes , and create powerful incentives for technology that will increase energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions in the long run . 
Acting now can be thought of as buying what financiers call &quot; tail insurance &quot; - some protection against the most adverse among all the possible outcomes . 
The question is what 
This is why delaying the adoption of long-term targets is not a recipe for business as usual . 
On the contrary , as the possible outcomes become clearer , we will almost certainly face the need for serious and costly reductions in energy use , at least among the advanced countries , as well as costly technological advances designed to make energy use more efficient in both the advanced and developing world . 
This will surely involve sharp cuts in the consumption of fossil fuels , bolstered by taxes and other restrictions . 
No one should expect that the costs of combating climate change will be low . 
But those costs will have a significantly higher expected value if we do not adopt sensible global strategies that include adjusting our mitigation efforts in response to new information .
