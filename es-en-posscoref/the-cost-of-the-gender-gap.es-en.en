The Cost of the Gender Gap 
Working women throughout the world have long complained of the unfairness implied by lower pay than what men receive . 
But the wage disparity between men and women is more than unjust . 
It is also economically harmful . 
Economists at the International Monetary Fund have calculated that the &quot; gender gap &quot; costs the world billions of dollars in economic growth each year . 
A cross section of 40 poor and rich countries shows that there is a strong relationship between women &apos;s economic and social status and overall economic growth . 
Women &apos;s lack of education , health care , and economic and social opportunities - both absolutely and relative to men - inhibits economic growth . 
By contrast , economic growth ameliorates women &apos;s subordinated condition . 
In The State Of The World &apos;s Children 2007 , UNICEF reports that gender equality renders a double dividend : healthy , educated women rear healthy , educated children . 
According to UNICEF , women feel greater responsibility than men for the household , and they spend more money on food , medicine , and educating children . 
But what UNICEF suggests as the solution for developing nations - that women be made responsible for the household and childrearing - is in fact the cause of the problem . 
Indeed , the &quot; double dividend &quot; is a curse rather than a blessing , because it confines women to the home . 
Policy measures that cultivate traditional role patterns should be abolished . 
Instead , one must promote the economic empowerment of women to help generate economic growth . 
Evidence for this can be found in Western Europe . 
According to the Dutch historians Tine de Moor and Jan Luyten van Zanden , the early break with patriarchy in Europe in the late Middle-Ages ( 1200-1500 ) accounts for the rise of capitalism and growing prosperity in the Western World . 
Girls were no longer married off , but selected their own spouses . 
As a result , it became worthwhile for parents to invest in girls &quot; education and wellbeing . 
As a result , Europe &apos;s economy advanced much more than China &apos;s over the next five centuries . 
However , the tables have turned . 
As The Economist pointed out last year , women have become the engine of global growth , especially in China and other Asian countries . 
The Asian economies seem to make much better use of the resources that women have to offer than Europeans do . 
In Asia , more women work , they work more hours , and they advance on the corporate ladder much faster than European women . 
In the Philippines , 89 % of companies have women in senior management positions . 
China , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Taiwan , and Singapore follow closely in terms of women in top jobs . 
Even in India , where more than half of girls and women are illiterate , more women hold senior management positions than in countries like Germany and the Netherlands . 
In Europe , women long ago bridged the education gap with their male peers . 
Still , they occupy a mere 8.5 % of corporate boardroom seats . 
Except for Scandinavia , the number of women on Europe &apos;s top company boards is stagnating . 
In part , this is a classic insider-outsider tale . 
Male dominance in the marketplace works like a cartel , barring talented women from top jobs . 
On average , women &apos;s take-home pay is half that of men . 
But European women are to blame as well . 
In European countries like Germany and the Netherlands , college-educated women often choose to be stay-at-home mothers or work part-time . 
Only one of 10 female professionals with children works full-time in the Netherlands , compared to nine of 10 male professionals with children . 
So it should not come as a surprise that employers don &apos;t take women seriously . 
Women &apos;s contribution to the Dutch economy is around 27 % . 
A raw estimate shows that if women would work a bit more outside the home and thus increase their contribution to the Dutch economy to , say , 35 % , this would generate an additional 11 % in GDP growth , some â‚¬ 60 billion per year . 
Women would still be working only half as much as men outside the home . 
With the extra money women would generate , the government could take care of the aging population and still have billions to spend on education and childcare . 
What is true in the Netherlands and Europe is true all over the world : reducing the inequalities that exist between men and women is not only a matter of justice ; it also makes economic sense .
