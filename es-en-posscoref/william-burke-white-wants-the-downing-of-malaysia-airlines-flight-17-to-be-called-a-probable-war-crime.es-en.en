The Framing of MH-17 
PHILADELPHIA - US President Barack Obama called the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 an &quot; outrage of unspeakable proportions , &quot; whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin termed it an &quot; accident &quot; and a &quot; terrible tragedy . &quot; 
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko branded it an &quot; act of terrorism , &quot; and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called it an &quot; inhumane , uncivilized , violent , and irresponsible act . &quot; 
All of these descriptions may be accurate , but each carries different rhetorical weight and legal implications . 
The time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on MH17 a probable war crime . 
This rhetorical shift is needed , first and foremost , because framing the moral reprehensibility of this despicable act within a common language will help to align public perceptions of it . 
Russian media and officials portray the episode as , at best , a terrible mistake , and , at worst , an American plot to undermine support for the rebels . 
As a result , the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost - and , with it , whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation . 
But , by recognizing the downing of MH17 as a war crime , governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives . 
Whatever the perpetrators &quot; underlying motives , there is no denying the moral and legal wrongdoing that occurred . 
Calling the offense by its legal name acknowledges this , thereby preempting a rhetorical battle to frame the attack as terror , tragedy , or conspiracy . 
In fact , another important reason to characterize the downing of MH17 publicly as a war crime is that it may prove beneficial in apprehending the perpetrators . 
There is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button - and , perhaps , for ordering the launch - will disappear into the chaos of eastern Ukraine , the vast expanses of Russia , or elsewhere . 
There is also a danger that the perpetrators , if found , might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political , and thus exempt from normal extradition requirements . 
All of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes . 
The obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals , or extradite them to face prosecution elsewhere , becomes more compelling in accordance with the seriousness of the alleged crime . 
While the full details of the attack on MH17 remain unknown , shooting a surface-to-air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war - by which the Ukrainian government , the Russian government , and the rebels are all bound . 
Indeed , the conflict in eastern Ukraine constitutes a non-international armed conflict ( a war between a government and rebel movement ) governed by international humanitarian law , which categorically bans the intentional targeting of civilians . 
In other words , if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers aboard MH17 , the act was unmistakably a war crime . 
Even if the objective was to strike a Ukrainian transport aircraft , the act likely constitutes a war crime . 
Fundamental to the law of war , including the law applicable in non-international armed conflicts , is the principle of distinction - the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets . 
In the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross , that duty of care includes doing &quot; everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives . &quot; 
In this case , many steps could easily have been taken to differentiate MH17 from a military-transport plane , including visual identification ( perhaps with binoculars ) , radar-signature analysis , and a check of the civilian aircraft transponder-code broadcast . 
If , as seems likely , these basic steps were not taken , even an accidental strike on MH17 would constitute a war crime . 
A Dutch or Malaysian court , or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations ( like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing ) , will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17 . 
Framing the attack as a likely war crime now - as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has done - may help to reconcile the conflicting narratives that are emerging . 
And , perhaps more important , doing so can play a key role in securing the political , diplomatic , and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice .
