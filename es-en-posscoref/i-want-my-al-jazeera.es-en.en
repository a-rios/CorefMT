I Want My Al Jazeera 
NEW YORK - Al Jazeera correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin is on a victory lap in the United States - or rather , Al Jazeera is sending him on its own victory lap . 
After all , Mohyeldin is a modest guy , despite being one of Al Jazeera &apos;s best-known reporters - and clearly a rising international media star . 
Al Jazeera has good reason to gloat : it has new cachet in the US after millions of Americans , hungry for on-the-ground reporting from Egypt , turned to its online live stream and Mohyeldin &apos;s coverage from Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square . 
So now Mohyeldin is in the US for three weeks of media events - there will even be a GQ photo shoot - having become well known in a country where viewers are essentially prevented from seeing his station . 
The network has been targeted by the US government since 2003 , when former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described it as tantamount to an arm of Al Qaeda . 
Two of its reporters were later killed in Baghdad when a US tank fired on the Hotel Palestine , where , according to US officials , it was believed that a spotter directing fire at US troops was located . 
But , because Al Jazeera was known to have based its team in the hotel , the channel and others voiced suspicions that the channel &apos;s reporters had been deliberately targeted . 
And , to this day , Al Jazeera , which , together with BBC News , has become one of the premier global outlets for serious television news , is virtually impossible to find on televisions in the US . 
So Al Jazeera is sending its news team around the US in an effort to &quot; mainstream &quot; the faces of this once-demonized network . 
And Mohyeldin can sound like Robert F. Kennedy : when the cry rose up from Tahrir Square hailing Mubarak &apos;s abdication , he commented , &quot; One man stepped down and eighty million people stepped up . &quot; 
The station &apos;s US push could hardly be more necessary - to Americans . 
By being denied the right to watch Al Jazeera , Americans are being kept in a bubble , sealed off from the images and narratives that inform the rest of the world . 
Consider the recent scandal surrounding atrocity photos taken by US soldiers in Afghanistan , which are now available on news outlets , including Al Jazeera , around the globe . 
In America , there have been brief summaries of the fact that Der Spiegel has run the story . 
But the images themselves - even redacted to shield the identities of the victims - have not penetrated the US media stream . 
And the images are so extraordinarily shocking that failing to show them - along with graphic images of the bombardment of children in Gaza , say , or exit interviews with survivors of Guant√°namo - keeps Americans from understanding events that may be as traumatic to others as the trauma of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
For example , the leading US media outlets , including The New York Times , have not seen fit to mention that one of the photos shows a US soldier holding the head of a dead Afghan civilian as though it were a hunting trophy . 
So , for America &apos;s sake , I hope that Al Jazeera penetrates the US media market . 
Unless Americans see the images and narratives that shape how others see us , the US will not be able to overcome its reputation as the world &apos;s half-blind bully . 
Indeed , Egyptians are in some ways now better informed than Americans ( and , as Thomas Jefferson often repeated , liberty is not possible without an informed citizenry ) . 
Egypt has 30 newspapers and more than 200 television channels . 
America &apos;s newspapers are dying , foreign news coverage has been cut to three or four minutes , at most , at the end of one or two evening newscasts , and most of its TV channels are taken up with reality shows . 
I met Mohyeldin before a recent public appearance in Manhattan . 
His analysis of the Egyptian revolution , and others in the region , is that the kind of globalized media to which Americans do not have full access created the conditions in which people could rise up to claim democracy . 
He points out that , &quot; People are aware of their rights from the Internet , from satellite TV - people are watching movies and reading bloggers . 
This was a revolution of awareness , based on access to fast-traveling information . 
The farmers , the peasants in Tahrir Square , were aware of their rights . &quot; 
Americans have a hunger for international news ; it is a myth that we can &apos;t be bothered with the outside world . 
Maybe Americans will rise up and threaten to boycott their cable and satellite providers unless we get our Al Jazeera - and other carriers of international news . 
We would then come one step closer to being part of the larger world - a world that , otherwise , will eventually simply leave us behind .
