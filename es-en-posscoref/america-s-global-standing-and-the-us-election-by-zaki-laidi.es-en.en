Obama &apos;s Underachieving Foreign Policy 
PARIS - To evaluate an American president &apos;s foreign-policy performance after one term is challenging , given the complex diplomatic and strategic environment and significant domestic constraints that confront every US president . 
Nevertheless , in advance of November &apos;s presidential election , it is important to distinguish the forces that have shaped Barack Obama &apos;s foreign policy , and to assess his handling of them . 
Obama kept his promise to withdraw American forces from Iraq during his first term . 
Indeed , Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s government is becoming increasingly allied with Iran . 
Obama , who opposed the Iraq war , should not be blamed for current circumstances there . But he was unable to improve the situation or help Iraq &apos;s Shias and Sunnis reach a political compromise . 
But the US will begin to withdraw troops after 2014 , without having defined a political solution in line with its interests . 
Meanwhile , America &apos;s strategic partnership with Pakistan , where Obama won a significant symbolic victory by eliminating Osama bin Laden , is in tatters . 
US-Pakistan relations have regressed to their level before September 11 , 2001 , with mutual distrust minimizing cooperation . 
In fact , in all of the strategic challenges to US security that Obama inherited - Iran , North Korea , Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - he has made virtually no significant political gains . 
Notwithstanding Obama &apos;s skillful response to the Arab Spring - the only strategic surprise that he has faced as president - his credibility in the Muslim world has steadily declined . 
He has failed to deliver on the key promise of his Cairo speech in 2009 : &quot; to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world . &quot; 
Moreover , Obama &apos;s efforts to improve relations with Russia - embodied in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) - did not lead to a genuine &quot; reset &quot; in bilateral ties , largely because an increasingly Soviet-style Russian leadership distrusts a US establishment that still regards Russia as a foe . 
And the US-China relationship has deteriorated , with America seeking to manage China &apos;s rise strategically - for example , through regional trade agreements and an enhanced military presence in Asia . 
On multilateral issues , Obama &apos;s performance is equally unimpressive . 
After committing to a 17 % reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020 - and despite his declaration that he would not tolerate inaction in this area - he simply stopped raising the issue after the Republicans &quot; sweeping victory in the November 2010 mid-term elections . 
Likewise , domestic pressure has caused Obama to neglect trade issues . 
The US is largely responsible for the failure of the Doha Round of global trade talks . 
Obama &apos;s one significant foreign-policy breakthrough has been to release the US from the grip of the &quot; global war on terror . &quot; 
Jettisoning the Manichean rhetoric of that &quot; war &quot; allowed the US to regain the political legitimacy that former President George W. Bush had lost , without diminishing its strategic credibility . 
After the Vietnam War , Jimmy Carter hoped to make a break with established US policy . 
While Obama &apos;s policies have not weakened America &apos;s international standing , they also have not led to achievements comparable to Richard Nixon &apos;s rapprochement with China , largely owing to what might be described as the dogmatic pragmatism that underlies them - an emphasis on avoiding the worst , rather than on striving for the best . 
Moreover , Obama has been confronted with significant constraints , including the global economic crisis , domestic political polarization , a hostile Congress , and the rise of emerging powers that need the US but are unwilling to accept its dominance . 
As a result , he has failed to change strategic realities by , for example , reconciling America &apos;s broader interests with those of Iran ( a declared enemy ) , Pakistan ( a &quot; frenemy &quot; ) , and Israel ( a key ally ) . 
To be sure , Obama faces a more complex diplomatic and strategic environment than Nixon faced in the 1970 &quot; s . 
Unstable coalitions in Iran prevent any substantive negotiations between the two countries , while political fragmentation in Pakistan significantly hinders US policy there . 
And the fragility of Israel &apos;s ruling coalition , combined with strong congressional support for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , makes it difficult to influence the country &apos;s policies , despite Israel &apos;s significant impact on US strategy in the Arab world . 
But Obama has also struggled to define the terms of a possible grand bargain . 
Any agreement with Iran would require consent from Israel and the Gulf countries , which do not share the same objectives . 
And the US cannot reach an accord with Pakistan without India &apos;s consent , which America would be unable to force , especially given that it relies on India to counterbalance China &apos;s growing clout in Asia . 
With Israel , the terms are ostensibly simpler : in exchange for a stronger US security guarantee , Israel would accept the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders . 
But Israel is also a crucial domestic political topic in the US ; indeed , any distancing from Israel is unacceptable to most Americans . 
While Obama &apos;s first term could not be called a foreign-policy disappointment , his achievements - although not trivial - have been limited . 
If he wins a second term , he is likely to find it increasingly difficult to win by playing not to lose .
