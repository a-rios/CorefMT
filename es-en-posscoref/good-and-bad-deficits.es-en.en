Good and Bad Deficits 
LONDON - &quot; Deficits are always bad , &quot; thunder fiscal hawks . 
Not so , replies strategic investment analyst H. Wood Brock in an interesting new book , The American Gridlock . 
A proper assessment , Brock argues , depends on the &quot; composition and quality of total government spending . &quot; 
Government deficits incurred on current spending for services or transfers are bad , because they produce no revenue and add to the national debt . 
Deficits resulting from capital spending , by contrast , are - or can be - good . 
If wisely administered , such spending produces a revenue stream that services and eventually extinguishes the debt ; more importantly , it raises productivity , and thus improves a country &apos;s long-run growth potential . 
From this distinction follows an important fiscal rule : governments &quot; current spending should normally be balanced by taxation . 
To this extent , efforts nowadays to reduce deficits on current spending are justified , but only if they are fully replaced by capital-spending programs . 
Indeed , reducing current spending and increasing capital spending should be carried out in lock step . 
Brock &apos;s argument is that , given the state of its economy , the United States cannot return to full employment on the basis of current policy . 
The recovery is too feeble , and the country needs to invest an additional $ 1 trillion annually for ten years on transport facilities and education . 
The government should establish a National Infrastructure Bank to provide the finance by borrowing directly , attracting private-sector funds , or a mixture of the two . 
( I have proposed a similar institution in the United Kingdom . ) 
The distinction between capital and current spending ( and thus between &quot; good &quot; and &quot; bad &quot; deficits ) is old hat to any student of public finance . 
According to proposals agreed at an informal European Council meeting on January 30 , all EU members are to amend their constitutions to introduce a balanced-budget rule that caps annual structural deficits at 0.5 % of GDP . 
This ceiling can be raised only in a deep depression or other exceptional circumstances , allowing for counter-cyclical policy so long as it is agreed that the additional deficit is cyclical , rather than structural . 
The UK is one of two EU countries ( alongside the Czech Republic ) that refused to sign this &quot; fiscal compact , &quot; acceptance of which is required to gain access to European bailout funds . 
But Britain &apos;s government has the identical aim of reducing its current deficit of 10 % of GDP to near zero in five years . 
An argument commonly heard in support of such policies is that the &quot; bond vigilantes &quot; will demand nothing less . 
But that is not true of the US or the UK , which both have large fiscal deficits . 
At the same time , we should not attribute current enthusiasm for fiscal retrenchment to such contingencies . 
At its heart lies the belief that all government spending above a necessary minimum is wasteful . 
Europe has its own Tea Party crackpots who loathe the welfare state and want it abolished or radically pared , and who are convinced that all state-sponsored capital spending is a &quot; boondoggle &quot; - just so many roads , bridges , and railway lines to nowhere that soak up their money in corruption and inefficiency . 
Those who believe this are unfazed by the corruption and waste that characterizes much private-sector spending . 
One can criticize details of Brock &apos;s case : a deeper understanding of Keynes would have given him a more persuasive response to the objection that , if state-financed projects were worth doing , the private sector would be doing them . 
Before long , we will have to provide answers to these questions , because the pre-slump fiscal rules that the Europeans are vainly trying to strengthen were not up to the job . 
We are far from having worked out a post-recession theory of macroeconomic policy , but certain elements are clear . 
In the future , fiscal and monetary policy will have to work together : neither on its own can stabilize inherently unstable market economies . 
Monetary policy will have to do much more than it did before 2008 to restrain financial markets &quot; &quot; irrational exuberance . &quot; 
And we need a new , unambiguous system of fiscal accounting that distinguishes between tax-funded government spending and public spending that pays for itself . 
Above all , we need to recognize that the state &apos;s role goes beyond maintaining external security and domestic law and order . As Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations : 
&quot; The third and last duty of the sovereign .... is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works , which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society , are , however , of such a nature , that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual , or small number of individuals ; and which it , therefore , cannot be expected that any individual , or small number of individuals , should erect or maintain . &quot; 
Chief among these public works , for Smith , are those that &quot; facilitate the commerce of any country , such as good roads , bridges , navigable canals , harbors , etc . &quot; 
Another piece of forgotten knowledge that Smith also mentions is the importance of education . 
He is right to do so , however much today &apos;s deficit hawks seem , by their behavior , to prove the opposite .
