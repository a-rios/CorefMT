The Age of Epigenetics 
LONDON - Fifty-one years ago , James Watson , Maurice Wilkins , and Francis Crick were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of DNA &apos;s structure - a breakthrough that heralded the age of the gene . 
Since then , the field of genetics has advanced significantly , particularly as a result of the global Human Genome Project , which in 2003 identified all of the roughly 23,000 genes and three billion chemical base pairs in human DNA in order to screen for many rare diseases . 
But , despite evidence that most diseases have a clear genetic component , only a fraction of the genes that explain them have been found . 
And scientists in the field remain puzzled by the fact that most identical twins ( who share 100 % of their genes ) do not die from the same diseases . 
As a result , many in the scientific community are beginning to predict a decline in the role of the gene in pinpointing the root causes of diseases . 
It is too soon to discount genetics , however , because the science of &quot; epigenetics &quot; - the study of mechanisms for turning genes on and off , thus changing the way a cell develops without altering the genetic code - is gaining traction . 
Indeed , the 2012 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka for revolutionizing scientists &quot; understanding of how cells develop by reprogramming DNA and cells without altering their genetic structure . 
In 1962 , Gurdon &apos;s finding that almost any cell in the body contains the complete DNA code enabled him to create a tadpole by cloning an adult frog . 
More than four decades later , in 2006 , Yamanaka discovered a way to trick complex adult cells in mice into regressing to their immature state , forming stem cells . 
Before this , stem cells - which can potentially be reprogrammed to develop into replacements for lost or damaged tissue - could be taken only from early-stage embryos , a practice that fueled ethical controversy . 
The true promise of epigenetics has become apparent only in the last few years , as scientists &quot; ability to assess the epigenetic mechanisms in DNA - which can now be measured at roughly 30 million points across the human genome - has dramatically improved . 
Epigenetics can potentially be used to explain the root causes of many diseases that scientists have so far struggled to understand , from asthma to allergies to autism . 
Consider lung cancer . 
Six decades ago , when most men smoked , British doctors linked smoking to lung cancer , making it the first disease to be causally linked to smoking . 
( In fact , lung cancer kills one in ten smokers . ) 
But the incidence of certain kinds of lung cancer continues to rise - particularly in women - making it one of the most prolific killers worldwide , despite the general decline of smoking over the last 30 years . 
Indeed , nowadays , many lung cancer patients have no history of smoking . 
These &quot; blameless &quot; patients seem to develop a different kind of lung cancer from those who report a history of smoking - one that is more responsive to new medications and has better , albeit still poor , outcomes . 
Epigenetic processes that cause key anti-cancer genes , such as the tumor suppressor P16 , to be switched off could explain the increased prevalence of lung cancer . 
A recent study showed that a few years of smoking can have this effect , making smokers more susceptible to a variety of cancers . 
My team and I recently studied 36 pairs of identical twins , of which only one twin had breast cancer . 
These &quot; genetic clones &quot; had a few crucial differences . 
In the twin who developed the breast cancer , several hundred genes had been switched off . 
In a few genes , this had occurred five years before diagnosis . 
Such findings unlock the possibility of a diagnostic test well before the disease manifests itself , and of developing drugs that prevent - or even reverse - the cancer &apos;s development . 
Moreover , animal studies have shown that changes in stress or diet can alter the behavior and genes of future generations . 
As a result , it is likely that epigenetic changes can be inherited . 
For example , smoking could have caused epigenetic changes in a grandparent &apos;s DNA , effectively switching off certain anti-cancer genes . 
The genes would then be passed down to descendants in this switched-off state . 
Thus , the toxins that people ingest may not be the only relevant factor should cancer strike ; the toxins that their parents or grandparents ingested could also be to blame . 
Physical experiments revealing such trans-generational effects are impossible to conduct on humans , so historical or observational data must be used . 
One study of children in Bristol showed differences in growth depending on whether their grandfathers had smoked before the age of 11 . 
Their bodies probably reacted defensively , adapting in the short term by changing the genes for the next few generations , or until the &quot; danger &quot; had passed , a so-called &quot; soft inheritance &quot; running in parallel to slower-acting evolutionary forces . 
Fortunately , these epigenetic changes are potentially reversible . 
Four epigenetic leukemia drugs , which aim to switch the natural protective genes back on , are now on the market in the United States . 
More than 40 other epigenetic drugs are being developed , not only for cancer , but also for obesity and even dementia . 
In the future , regular epigenetic health check-ups could become standard practice . 
More than 50 years on , genes remain crucial to understanding complex diseases - especially given scientists &quot; ever-improving ability to alter them . 
The age of the gene is far from over ; it has simply progressed into the age of epigenetics .
