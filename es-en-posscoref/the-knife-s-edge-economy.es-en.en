The Knife &apos;s-Edge Economy 
Berkeley - Since 2003 , I have been saying that the global economy is badly unbalanced and vulnerable to a macroeconomic catastrophe that would yield one of the worst episodes of economic distress of modern times . 
Since 2004 , I have been saying that the situation , once it started , would probably become clear within a year : we would know whether the global economy would right itself or begin a downward spiral . 
In 2004-2007 , I considered that I might be wrong about a relatively rapid resolution to the world &apos;s economic distress : as the late Rudi Dornbusch put it , unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances can sustain themselves longer than economists ( with their touching faith in rational human decision making ) believe is possible . 
A year ago , however , with the subprime mortgage meltdown of August 2007 , I became certain . 
The situation had to resolve itself within a year - or else . 
The odds heavily favored the second outcome : global macroeconomic distress . 
But I was wrong . 
Here we are , fully a year later , and things are still balanced on the knife &apos;s edge . 
Let me stress that I have no complaints about the policies implemented by the United States Federal Reserve , which has had the main burden of responsibility for &quot; managing &quot; the crisis . 
I wish - as the Fed does - that some way could have been found to make financial-sector equity holders bear an even larger share of the losses that are coming down the road than they have borne so far or are likely to bear . 
The Fed &apos;s first priority is to try to keep the American economy from dropping too far below full employment , and to try and avoid a US meltdown contaminating other economies . 
If employment and incomes in America crash , US demand for imports crashes - and not just America but the whole world will slide into recession . 
Employment in construction and related industries is collapsing , as Americans and foreigners recover from their fit of irrational exuberance over housing prices . 
Less enthusiasm about housing means that manufacturing firms will no longer be squeezed when they seek capital to expand . 
It also means a lower value for the dollar , and thus more opportunities for US-located firms to export and supply the domestic market . 
Jobs are moving from construction ( and related occupations ) into tradable goods and services production ( and related occupations ) . 
But if the system of financial intermediation collapses in universal bankruptcy , producers of tradable goods will be unable to get financing to expand . 
That would not be good for America or the world . 
And so far , so good , at least on the real side of the US economy . 
On the financial side , however , the magnitude of the chaos is staggering : mammoth failures of risk management on the part of highly leveraged financial institutions that must be first-rate risk managers in order to survive . 
If you had asked me a year ago whether this degree of financial chaos was consistent with a domestic US economy not clearly in recession , I would have said no . 
If you had asked me a year ago whether a year could pass without either a restoration of confidence in financial institutions or widespread nationalizations and liquidations , I would have said no . 
Unstable and unsustainable configurations must come to an end . 
Rudi Dornbusch was right : imbalances can last for longer than economists believe possible .
