Free Tilly - and all Circus Animals 
MELBOURNE - Last month , at the Sea World amusement park in Florida , a whale grabbed a trainer , Dawn Brancheau , pulled her underwater , and thrashed about with her . 
By the time rescuers arrived , Brancheau was dead . 
The death of the trainer is a tragedy , and one can only have sympathy for her family . 
But the incident raises broader questions : was the attack deliberate ? 
Did the whale , an orca named Tilikum and nicknamed Tilly , act out of stress at being held captive in a sterile concrete tank ? 
Was he tired of being forced to perform to amuse the crowds ? 
Is it right to keep such large animals in close confinement ? 
Tilly had been involved in two previous human deaths . 
In one episode , a trainer fell into the pool and Tilly and two other whales drowned him . 
In another , a man who appears to have gotten into the enclosure at night , when Sea World was closed , was found dead in the pool with Tilly . 
An autopsy showed that he had a bite mark . 
One of Tilly &apos;s offspring , sold to an amusement park in Spain , has also killed a trainer , as have orcas in other parks . 
Richard Ellis , a marine conservationist at the American Museum of Natural History , believes that orcas are smart and would not do such a thing purely on impulse . 
&quot; This was premeditated , &quot; he told The Associated Press . 
We will never know exactly what was going on in Tilly &apos;s mind , but we do know that he has been in captivity since he was about two years old - he was captured off the coast of Iceland in 1983 . 
Orcas are social mammals , and he would have been living with his mother and other relatives in a pod . 
It is reasonable to suppose that the sudden separation was traumatic for Tilly . 
Moreover , the degree of confinement in an aquarium is extreme , for no tank , no matter how large , can come close to meeting the needs of animals who spend their lives in social groups swimming long distances in the ocean . 
Joyce Tischler , of the Animal Legal Defense Fund , described keeping a six-ton orca in Sea World &apos;s tanks as akin to keeping a human in a bathtub for his entire life . 
David Phillips , director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute , which led the efforts to rehabilitate the orca Keiko - made famous by the movie Free Willy - said &quot; Orcas deserve a better fate than living in cramped pools . &quot; 
But if we are pointing the finger at Sea World for what it does to its captive animals , we should also look more broadly at the way we confine performing animals . 
In most countries , it is possible to visit zoos and see bored animals pacing back and forth in cages , with nothing to do but wait for the next meal . 
Circuses are even worse places for animals . 
Their living conditions are deplorable , especially in traveling circuses where cages have to be small so that they can go on the road . 
Training animals to perform tricks often involves starvation and cruelty . 
Undercover investigations have repeatedly shown animals being beaten and given electric shocks . 
Several countries - among them Austria , Costa Rica , Denmark , Finland , India , Israel , and Sweden - ban or severely restrict the use of wild animals in circuses . 
In Brazil , a movement to ban wild animals from circuses started after hungry lions managed to grab and devour a small boy . 
Several major cities and many local governments around the world do not permit circuses with wild animals . 
Last year , Bolivia became the first country to ban all animals , wild or domestic , from circuses . 
That decision followed an undercover investigation by Animal Defenders International , which exposed shocking abuse of circus animals . 
Now the British government is holding a public online consultation on the use of animals in circuses . 
Many hope it will be a first step towards a ban . 
Attempts to defend amusement parks and circuses on the grounds that they &quot; educate &quot; people about animals should not be taken seriously . 
Such enterprises are part of the commercial entertainment industry . 
The most important lesson they teach impressionable young minds is that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity for human amusement . 
That is the opposite of the ethical attitude to animals that we should be seeking to impart to children . 
Nor should we be swayed by the argument that circuses provide employment . 
The human slave trade also provided employment , but that was no argument for perpetuating it . 
In any case , in many countries that have restrictions or bans on circuses with animals , human-only circuses have flourished . 
There is no excuse for keeping wild animals in amusement parks or circuses . 
Until our governments take action , we should avoid supporting places where captive wild animals perform for our amusement . 
If the public will not pay to see them , the businesses that profit from keeping animals captive will not be able to continue . 
When our children ask us to take them to the circus , we should find out if the circus uses wild animals . 
If it does , we should explain to our children why we will not take them there , and offer to take them to a circus that does not .
