Will Turkey Weather the Middle East Storm ? 
ISTANBUL - A cycle of terrible violence has taken over much of the Middle East . 
Farther east , Afghanistan is suffering its second decade of violent conflict , while Pakistan seems to be chronically on the brink of war , civil war , or social breakdown . 
The most worrisome underlying threat is the increase in fighting between Sunni and Shia Muslims . 
Likewise , pious conservatives and liberal and leftist secular youth , who joined forces in Cairo and Tunis in 2010-2011 to challenge the dictators , have now turned on each other : witness the Egyptian security forces &quot; appalling massacres of Islamist demonstrators in Cairo recently , following a military coup carried out with liberals &quot; support . 
The region &apos;s people are sliding into enemy camps , deepening their societies &quot; wounds in the process . 
I have often argued that Turkey should not intervene in the internal affairs of its neighbors or adopt a Middle East-centered policy . 
Both government and opposition should remain steadfastly focused on Europe , despite the obstacles that the European Union has placed in Turkey &apos;s way during membership negotiations . 
But Turkey cannot be indifferent to the tragedy engulfing its southern neighbors . 
The Arab world &apos;s pain is acutely felt , owing to Turkey &apos;s historical , religious , and emotional bonds with these countries . 
Moreover , economic ties and sheer proximity mean that Turkey &apos;s prosperity depends , to some degree at least , on that of the Middle East . 
In recent years , there was hope that Turkey could help by serving as a model of a successful economy and well-functioning democracy ; but recent events have raised doubts . 
In fact , Turkey must overcome four sources of internal tension if it is to continue to thrive economically , consolidate its democracy , and act as a compelling example to others . 
The first and most serious source of tension stems from the need to recognize Kurdish identity as a fully legitimate part of the Turkish Republic . 
Those who wish to express a Kurdish identity , as well as all other citizens , must be confident that , while all remain committed to national unity , Turkey is a country in which diversity can thrive . 
Second , there is an underlying historical tension between the large Sunni majority and the Alevi-Bektashi minority , loosely linked to Shia Islam . 
Third , there is the difference between those who adhere to the tradition of political Islam and those who uphold the strict secularism that came with the republic . 
Often this social &quot; divide &quot; intersects with the Sunni-Alevi cleavage , as the Alevis have increasingly aligned themselves with the political left . 
Finally , there is a growing perception of partisanship within the public administration . 
Building independent , non-partisan regulatory bodies was one of the key pillars of the 2001-2002 reform program . 
As the perception of non-partisanship in public administration has diminished , proximity to those in power has become another source of tension . 
Turkey benefits from republican reflexes and values that have been built over decades , as well as from humanist wisdom anchored in centuries of history . 
Yet , given the regional context , Turkey &apos;s internal tensions now represent a serious threat . 
All sides must manage these tensions with great care and caution . 
Respect for diversity and individual freedom , and concern for generating growth and jobs in an atmosphere of social peace , must be guiding principles . 
Healing the wounds to which all sides have at times contributed , and practicing forgiveness , should be the order of the day . 
A spiral of frustration and antagonism must not be allowed to develop . 
Turkey must look carefully at the catastrophe unfolding around it in the Middle East . 
Humanitarian help is necessary , and Turkey is providing it generously , in ways that should serve as an example for Western countries . 
But Turkey &apos;s political leaders , opinion shapers , and citizens must also recognize that the only protection against a similar disaster at home is a vibrant democracy , a fully professional public administration , and a tolerant society embodying pride and affection for the country &apos;s diversity . 
Others will not protect Turkey ; some may even promote strife within its borders ( historical examples of such tactics abound ) . 
Turkey alone can protect itself , and only by upholding truly democratic behavior at home and pursuing an external policy that promotes peace and democracy but does not take sides in the region &apos;s ongoing battles , particularly between Sunni and Shia . 
Fortunately , there is hope . 
The Gezi Park demonstrators who in June protested peacefully against the use of excessive police force by simply standing still also protested peacefully , years ago , against the ban on the headscarf then in effect in Turkey &apos;s universities . 
This kind of concern for the rights of all is a hallmark of Turkey &apos;s young generation . 
Similarly , when the outgoing governor of Van sent a farewell message last month to the largely Kurdish-speaking people in his southeastern province , he delivered it in Kurdish - and received warm wishes in return . 
A large majority of Turkey &apos;s citizens share such generosity of spirit . 
That is why , despite serious difficulties , Turkey has a good chance of overcoming its internal tensions and becoming the example that its Middle East neighbors ( and perhaps a few of its European neighbors as well ) so desperately need .
