A Step Closer to Brexit ? 
LONDON - The referendum on Scottish independence , due on September 18 , comes at a time of growing opposition in the United Kingdom to remaining in the European Union . 
This is significant , because Scotland is the strongest base of pro-European sentiment in the UK . 
For example , a poll conducted earlier this year determined that if a referendum on continued EU membership had been held in June in the UK as a whole , 47.1 % would have voted to leave , with 39.4 % voting to remain . 
Other polls have also shown a consistent and markedly more positive attitude toward the EU in Scotland than in England . 
Of course , it is premature to draw any firm conclusions from these figures . 
The referendum on exiting the EU that Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed may not take place , regardless of the success ( whatever that may mean ) of his promised &quot; renegotiation &quot; of the terms of British membership . 
For example , the proposal of the relatively unknown Jonathan Hill , the leader of the UK House of Lords , as the British member of the new European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker was just the latest in a long series of British EU errors . 
Cameron &apos;s spokesmen said in July that , at his first meeting with the new Commission president , Cameron would seek a prestigious portfolio , such as the internal market , for Hill . 
Juncker &apos;s office coldly replied that important portfolios in the new Commission would go to major political figures , and that Juncker &quot; does not owe &#91; Cameron &#93; anything . &quot; 
Given Cameron &apos;s opposition to Juncker &apos;s candidacy for the Commission presidency , the abuse to which Juncker has been subjected by the British press , and Hill &apos;s lack of centrality within British politics , Cameron may be justifiably nervous when Juncker announces his appointments to the new Commission . 
Juncker , after all , has many senior politicians to accommodate , and their approval by the European Parliament is no minor matter . 
And , though it was perhaps unsurprising that Cameron should be unenthusiastic about Juncker &apos;s candidacy , the vehemence of his opposition was extraordinary . 
Cameron no doubt wished to reassure those in his Conservative Party who doubt his euroskeptic zeal . 
Even so , Cameron &apos;s supposed remark that the UK was more likely to leave the EU if Juncker &apos;s candidacy succeeded was strange and disquieting , not least because any renegotiation of the terms of British membership will be carried out primarily with other member states , not with the Commission . 
Cameron &apos;s bid to thwart Juncker &apos;s candidacy mirrored his unsuccessful attempt to prevent the adoption of the EU &apos;s fiscal compact in 2012 . 
He overestimated German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s willingness and ability to support the British position . 
Many influential Germans are reluctant to help Cameron in what they regard as his self-created European problem . 
They will not allow Merkel much latitude here , even if she seeks it . 
If Cameron &apos;s advisers overestimated the support that they might have received from Merkel and others , they clearly underestimated the power and effectiveness of the European Parliament . 
For many months , the European Parliament had made it clear that it had specific ideas about how it would exercise its new powers , granted by the Treaty of Lisbon , over the Commission presidency . 
Far from enhancing British influence , threats of withdrawal have undermined the Cameron government &apos;s credibility and influence within the EU , as colleagues have become disinclined to engage in significant compromises with a UK that may not be a member in two years . 
Traditionally , EU heads of state and governments try to help one another with their domestic political problems . 
Thus , Cameron &apos;s claim that Juncker &apos;s election would make it more difficult to ensure the UK &apos;s continued EU membership risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
To present Juncker &apos;s candidacy as a matter of high political principle , with Cameron heroically but unsuccessfully standing alone against the dark forces of federalism and centralization , could have only reinforced English feelings of alienation from Europe . 
That is less likely to be the case in Scotland . 
If Cameron returns as prime minister after the general election in 2015 , he will face an uphill battle in renegotiating the terms of British EU membership , owing to resistance not only from his European partners , but also from his own Conservative Party , which is close to advocating British withdrawal . 
Indeed , it is difficult to see how a re-elected Cameron could maintain the Conservative Party &apos;s unity without endorsing a &quot; no &quot; vote in the referendum on the outcome of his own renegotiation . 
Britain &apos;s EU membership will be one of the major issues at stake in next year &apos;s election . 
It would be a tragedy if British voters cast their ballots without fully understanding the European implications of their choice . 
One thing , however , seems certain : If Scotland votes for independence in September , a referendum within the rump UK on continued EU membership would be even less likely to produce a victory for those who wish to remain .
