A New Cold War Order ? 
MOSCOW - As 2014 comes to a close , it is clear that the European and international political structures that have been in place since 1989 have failed the test of time . 
Indeed , the world has not witnessed such a tense and fraught environment since the Cold War &apos;s end , with bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East coming against the backdrop of a breakdown in dialogue between major powers . 
The world , it appears , is on the brink of Cold War II . 
Some even say that it has already begun . 
Meanwhile , the world &apos;s key international body - the United Nations Security Council - is scarcely playing a role or taking concrete action to stop the fires and the killing . 
Why has it not acted with determination to evaluate the situation and develop a program of joint action ? 
One primary reason , I believe , is that the trust created by hard work and mutual effort in ending the Cold War has collapsed . 
Without such trust , peaceful international relations in today &apos;s globalized world are inconceivable . 
But this trust was not undermined only yesterday ; it happened long before . 
The roots of the current situation lie in the events of the 1990s . 
The Cold War &apos;s end was supposed to mark the beginning of a path toward a new Europe and a safer world order . 
Euphoria and triumphalism went to Western leaders &quot; heads . 
Taking advantage of Russia &apos;s weaknesses and the lack of a counterweight , they refused to heed warnings against claiming a monopoly on global leadership . 
The events of the past few months are the consequences of shortsightedly seeking to impose one &apos;s will while ignoring the interests of one &apos;s partners . 
A shortlist of such faits accomplis would include NATO enlargement , the war in Yugoslavia ( particularly Kosovo ) , missile-defense plans , Iraq , Libya , and Syria . 
As a result , what was a blister has now turned into a festering wound . 
And it is Europe that suffers the most . 
Instead of leading change in a globalizing world , the continent has turned into an arena of political upheaval , competition for spheres of influence , and military conflict . 
The consequence , inevitably , is that Europe is weakening at a time when other centers of power and influence are strengthening . 
If this continues , Europe will lose its influence in world affairs and gradually become irrelevant . 
Fortunately , the experience of the 1980s suggests a way forward . 
The international situation at the time was no less dangerous than it is today . 
Yet we succeeded in ameliorating it - not just normalizing relations but ending the Cold War confrontation itself . 
This was achieved primarily through dialogue . 
Today , the foremost priority should be dialogue itself : a renewal of the ability to interact , listen to , and hear one another . 
Promising signs are now emerging , though initial efforts have yielded only modest and fragile results : the Minsk agreement on a ceasefire and military disengagement in Ukraine ; the trilateral gas agreement concluded by Russia , Ukraine , and the European Union ; and a halt to the escalation of mutual sanctions . 
We must continue to move from polemics and mutual accusations to a search for points of convergence and a gradual lifting of sanctions , which are damaging to both sides . 
As a first step , the so-called personal sanctions that affect political figures and parliamentarians should be lifted , so that they can rejoin the process of seeking mutually acceptable solutions . 
One area for interaction could be to help Ukraine overcome the consequences of fratricidal war and rebuild the affected regions . 
The same is true of global challenges and pan-European security . 
Today &apos;s key global problems - terrorism and extremism , poverty and inequality , climate change , migration , and epidemics - are worsening daily . 
Yet political mechanisms to solve these problems are lacking or dysfunctional , even as the continuing global crisis should persuade us to seek - without delay - a new model that can ensure political , economic , and environmental sustainability . 
As for Europe &apos;s security , only a pan-European solution is viable . 
Indeed , attempts to address the problem by enlarging NATO or through an EU defense policy are counterproductive . 
We need more inclusive institutions and mechanisms that provide assurances and guarantees to all . Here the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , to which a lot of hope was attached , has so far not been up to the task . 
That does not mean that the OSCE should be replaced with something new - especially since it has now assumed important control functions in Ukraine . 
But the OSCE is , I would say , an edifice that requires major repairs and some new construction . 
Years ago , former German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher , former US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft , and other policymakers proposed creating a Security Council , or Directorate , for Europe . 
I agreed with their approach . 
Along the same lines , during Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s presidency , he called for the creation of a mechanism for European preventive diplomacy and mandatory consultations in the event of a threat to any state &apos;s security . 
Had such a mechanism been established , the worst events in Ukraine could have been averted . 
Political leaders are , of course , to blame for filing away these and other &quot; European ideas &quot; in the archives . 
Though I am , by nature , an optimist , I have to admit that it is very difficult not to be pessimistic as 2014 comes to a close . 
Nonetheless , we must not submit to panic and despair , or allow ourselves to be drawn into a vortex of negative inertia . 
The bitter experience of the past few months must be transformed into the will to reengage in dialogue and cooperation . 
This is my appeal to our leaders , and to all of us , for 2015 : Let us think , propose , and act together .
