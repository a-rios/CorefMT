Today &apos;s Dark Lords of Finance 
LONDON - In his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book , Lords of Finance , the economist Liaquat Ahamad tells the story of how four central bankers , driven by staunch adherence to the gold standard , &quot; broke the world &quot; and triggered the Great Depression . 
Today &apos;s central bankers largely share a new conventional wisdom - about the benefits of loose monetary policy . 
Are monetary policymakers poised to break the world again ? 
Orthodox monetary policy no longer enshrines the gold standard , which caused the central bankers of the 1920s to mismanage interest rates , triggering a global economic meltdown that ultimately set the stage for World War II . 
But the unprecedented period of coordinated loose monetary policy since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008 could be just as problematic . 
Indeed , the discernible effect on financial markets has already been huge . 
The first-order impact is clear . 
Institutional investors have found it difficult to achieve positive real yields in any of the traditional safe-haven investments . 
Life insurers , for example , have struggled to meet their guaranteed rates of return . 
According to a recent report by Swiss Re , had government bonds been trading closer to their &quot; fair value , &quot; insurers in America and Europe would have earned some $ 40- $ 80 billion from 2008 to 2013 ( assuming a typical 50-60 % allocation to fixed income ) . 
For public pension funds , an additional 1 % yield during this period would have increased annual income by $ 40-50 billion . 
Investors have responded to near-zero interest rates with unprecedented adjustments in the way they allocate assets . 
In most cases , they have taken on more risk . 
For starters , they have moved into riskier credit instruments , resulting in a compression of corporate-bond spreads . 
Once returns on commercial paper had been driven to all-time lows , investors continued to push into equities . 
Approximately 63 % of global institutional investors increased allocations in developed-market equities in the six months prior to April 2015 , according to data from a recent State Street survey - even though some 60 % of them expect a market correction of 10-20 % . 
Even the world &apos;s most conservative investors have taken on unprecedented risk . 
Japan &apos;s public pension funds , which include the world &apos;s largest , have dumped local bonds at record rates . 
In addition to boosting investments in foreign stocks and bonds , they have now raised their holdings of domestic stocks for the fifth consecutive quarter . 
These allocation decisions are understandable , given the paltry yields available in fixed-income investments , but the resulting second-order impact could ultimately prove devastating . 
The equity bull market is now six years old . 
Even after the market volatility following the crisis in Greece and the Chinese stock market &apos;s plunge , valuations appear to be high . 
The S &amp; P 500 has surpassed pre-2008 levels , with companies &quot; shares trading at 18 times their earnings . 
As long as the tailwinds of global quantitative easing , cheap oil , and further institutional inflows keep blowing , equities could continue to rally . 
But at some point , a real market correction will arrive . 
And when it does , pension funds and insurance companies will be more exposed than ever before to volatility in the equity markets . 
This overexposure comes at a time when demographic trends are working against pension funds . 
Among emerging markets , rapidly rising life expectancy and plunging fertility are likely to double the share of China &apos;s over-60 population by 2050 - adding roughly a half-billion people who require support in their unproductive years . 
If the combined effect of steep losses in equity markets and rising dependency ratios cause pension funds to struggle to meet their obligations , it will be up to governments to provide safety nets - if they can . 
Government debt as a percentage of global GDP has increased at an annual rate of 9.3 % since 2007 . 
In Europe , for example , Greece is not the only country drowning in debt . 
In 2014 , debt levels throughout the eurozone continued to climb , reaching nearly 92 % of GDP - the highest since the single currency &apos;s introduction in 1999 . 
If pensions and governments both prove unable to provide for the elderly , countries across the continent could experience rising social instability - a broader version of the saga playing out in Greece . 
The new Lords of Finance have arguably been successful in many of their objectives since the financial crisis erupted seven years ago . 
For this , they deserve credit . 
Given recent market turmoil , the question now is whether the next crisis has already begun .
