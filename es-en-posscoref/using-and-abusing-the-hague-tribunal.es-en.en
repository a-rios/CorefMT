Using and Abusing the Hague Tribunal 
The International Tribunal in The Hague was intended as a Sword of Damocles for human rights violators in the Balkans . 
Within the Balkans , however , it has become a political tool that both nationalists and their opponents exploit in a never-ending game of divide and ( hope to ) rule . 
Croatia provides a textbook case of this . 
Snags and fissures now bedevil Croatia &apos;s infant democratic reforms . 
The reasons are connected to Premier Ivica Racan &apos;s unwillingness to tackle the centers of power left behind by the regime of the late President Franjo Tudjman , whose nationalist-minded party , the Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) , was voted out of office in January 2001 following Tudjman &apos;s death in December 1999 . 
Tudjman forged an authoritarian regime that blurred the distinctions between HDZ and state agencies , in particular the army and police . 
This muddied legacy remains at the heart of Croatia &apos;s current problems and its relations with the Hague Tribunal . 
In January 2001 the then new Premier Ivica Racan faced a sharp choice : swiftly purge state bureaucracies of Tudjman &apos;s partisans or yield to the obstructive ploys of HDZ loyalists . 
True to Racan &apos;s instinctive indecisiveness , the Prime Minister dallied . 
He preferred to concentrate on constitutional reforms that were largely interpreted as a bid to strip the new president , Stjepan Mesic ( himself a longtime opponent of Tudjman ) of the robust executive powers Tudjman wrote into the constitution for himself . 
Meanwhile , the new government failed to investigate numerous war crimes , miscarriages of justice , and the corruption of the Tudjman era . 
This failure emboldened HDZ loyalists to test the Racan government &apos;s resolve . 
One favorite trick was to create enormous obstacles to even minimal attempts at cracking down on war criminals . 
In September 2000 , following the assassination of a Hague Tribunal witness and the arrest of a Croatian commander accused of massacring Serbs in 1991 , twelve army generals published a letter calling for the defense of Croat veterans and a halt to &quot; the negative and historically unfounded representation &quot; of Croatia &apos;s record in the Balkan wars . 
In a rare show of state determination , President Mesic suspended and forced into retirement all twelve officers . 
Several went on to join and lead a new party - Croatian Integrity and Prosperity ( HIP ) , organized by Tudjman &apos;s eldest son Miroslav , the former chief of the Croatian intelligence service . 
Parrying with Tudjman loyalists continued into the spring of this year , with the arrest of Mirko Norac , one of the twelve generals , who was accused of massacring Serb civilians in 1991 . 
Various veterans &apos; organizations staged mass rallies against the &quot; treacherous &quot; government of Mesic and Racan . 
These pressures would not have been as damaging had they not met with approval in parts of Racan &apos;s ruling coalition , especially from Drazen Budisa &apos;s Croatian Social Liberal Party ( HSLS ) , and also among influential Catholic bishops . 
Weakened , the government became psychologically prepared for still greater concessions . 
In July , the Hague Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia charged two Croatian generals - Rahim Ademi and Ante Gotovina - with war crimes . 
Instead of turning them over to the tribunal , Racan used the opportunity for a power play , requesting a parliamentary vote of confidence for what was intended to be a soft-pedaling of the Hague Tribunal &apos;s warrants . 
This provoked the resignation of Budisa from the presidency of the Social Liberal Party , inciting a virtual split in this key coalition partner , the only party in the government coalition that wanted to resist the Hague Tribunal . 
Despite this , Racan won his vote of confidence and secured a modicum of stability within his cabinet . 
Still , the various factions that comprise the Tudjmanite opposition gained a chance to pull Budisa toward them , creating a new center of political gravity for the next crisis . 
The Hague Tribunal is often blamed for burdening fragile reform governments in Croatia and Serbia with unreasonable requests that play into the hands of nationalist politicians . 
This is true to the extent that the Tribunal is insensitive to the intricate balancing expected of officials in the countries of the former Yugoslavia . 
For example , the pre-trial release of Biljana Plavsic , one of the most culpable of Bosnian Serb leaders , in exchange for her evidently ample testimony would make more sense had the Tribunal been equally accommodating on less culpable non-Serb defendants . 
A reluctance to prosecute war criminals is an asset that Balkan governments use in order to pacify their nationalist audience and , indeed , to avoid the thorny problems of a thoroughgoing reform . 
Racan would not have had to deal with the Hague Tribunal had he the courage to begin his own housekeeping and investigations of Tudjman &apos;s cronies and the war criminals the deceased president protected . 
Now , Premier Racan is cashing in on his procrastination over Tudjman acolytes , hoping that they will be as generous with him should they return to government . 
A tiny elite is thus insulated from serious challenges and , ultimately , of responsibility for anything , even the most heinous of crimes .
