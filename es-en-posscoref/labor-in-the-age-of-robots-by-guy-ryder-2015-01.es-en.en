Labor in the Age of Robots 
DAVOS - Fears about the impact of technology on the labor market are nothing new . 
In the early nineteenth century , a group of English textile workers known as the Luddites worried that new technologies like power looms and spinning frames would cost them their jobs . 
They protested by smashing the machines . 
Today , anxiety that new technologies could destroy millions of jobs is as high as ever . 
In the midst of a major employment crisis , technology continues to reduce the labor needed for mass production , while the automation of routine legal and accounting tasks is hollowing out that sector of the job market as well . 
The science of robotics is revolutionizing manufacturing ; every year , an additional 200,000 industrial robots come into use . 
In 2015 , the total is expected to reach 1.5 million . 
Adapting the labor market to a world of increasingly automated workplaces will be one of the defining challenges of our era . 
Yet no country can afford to ignore the transformation . 
Globally , some 200 million people are unemployed , up 27 million since 2008 . 
There is a critical need to anticipate coming technological changes and provide the global workforce with the education and skills needed to participate in the modern labor market . 
Worldwide , one-third of employers surveyed complain that they are unable to find workers with the right skills for existing vacancies . 
Efficient paths from training and education programs to the world of work must be built , so that skills can be matched to market demand . 
Government programs must be strengthened , and employers and trade unions must assume greater responsibility for investing in skills . 
They also must consult more closely with educators and policymakers - discussions that should be informed by labor-market information , performance reviews , and the availability of employment services . 
Whatever a country &apos;s development level , investment in education and skills will increase the ability of its workforce to innovate and adapt to new technologies . 
Such investment can determine whether a country &apos;s economic growth is broadly inclusive or leaves large segments of society behind . 
An abundant supply of workers who have been appropriately trained and can continue to learn boosts investor confidence and thus job growth . 
In addition to training the labor force for an age of further automation , sustainable economies must offer protections for workers in good times and bad . 
The nature of a worker &apos;s relationship with his or her employer is changing . 
People entering the labor market are increasingly finding only short-term or temporary contracts ; often , they are forced to take informal work or emigrate for a job . 
These trends are exacerbating income inequality . 
As a result , mitigation policies are necessary . 
Along with a robust system of unemployment benefits , social protections such as healthcare and pensions are essential for overall worker security and to ensure a healthy economy . 
And yet only 20 % of the world &apos;s population has adequate social-security coverage ; more than half lack any coverage at all . 
That is why the work of the International Labor Organization , which was established in 1919 , is still relevant today . 
In a world of increasingly automated workplaces and eroding employee-employer relationships , the values encoded in the ILO &apos;s labor standards are more necessary than ever . 
The complex challenges facing workers worldwide will require complex solutions . 
In 2013 , the ILO launched its Future of Work initiative , which seeks to identify and analyze incipient trends and provide a forum for discussion about what must be done to adapt to rapidly changing labor-market conditions . 
Our world has changed vastly over the past century - and not only because of technology . 
By 2050 , the global population will surpass nine billion . 
The number of people aged 60 years and over will have tripled . 
Three-quarters of the elderly will be living in what are now developing countries , and the majority of them will be women . 
These demographic shifts will further revolutionize the labor market , social-security systems , economic development , and the world of employment . 
For all of the progress human society has made since the era of the Luddites , a simple truth persists : machines must strengthen , not weaken , our prospects for inclusive growth and broadly shared prosperity . 
We must ensure that the modern economy is a sustainable one , built on the principles of human dignity and the opportunity for decent work .
