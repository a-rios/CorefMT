The Other Poland 
Recently , the European Parliament condemned the Polish government &apos;s attempt to strip Bronislaw Geremek of his parliamentary mandate . 
A leader of Solidarity , a former political prisoner , and the foreign minister responsible for Poland &apos;s accession to NATO , Geremek had refused to sign yet another declaration that he had not been a communist secret police agent . 
The EU parliamentarians called the Polish government &apos;s actions a witch-hunt , and Geremek declared Poland &apos;s &quot; lustration &quot; law a threat to civil liberties . 
In response , Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski accused Geremek of &quot; damaging his fatherland &quot; and &quot; provoking an anti-Polish affair . &quot; 
The same phrases were used by Communists when Geremek criticized their misrule . 
A ruling by Poland &apos;s Constitutional Court issued on May 11 gutted much of the lustration law , and made Germek &apos;s position in the EU parliament safe - at least for now . 
But the lustration law was but one act among many in a systematic effort by Poland &apos;s current government to undermine the country &apos;s democratic institutions and fabric . 
What is happening in Poland , the country where communism &apos;s downfall began ? 
Every revolution has two phases . 
First comes a struggle for freedom , then a struggle for power . 
The first makes the human spirit soar and brings out the best in people . 
The second unleashes the worst : envy , intrigue , greed , suspicion , and the urge for revenge . 
The Polish Solidarity revolution followed an unusual course . 
Solidarity , pushed underground when martial law was declared in December 1981 , survived seven years of repression and then returned in 1989 on the wave of Gorbachov &apos;s &quot; perestroika . &quot; 
During the Round Table negotiations that brought about the end of communist rule , a compromise was reached between the reform wing of the communist government and Solidarity . 
This cleared a path to the peaceful dismantling of communist dictatorship throughout the entire Soviet bloc . 
Solidarity adopted a philosophy of compromise rather than revenge , and embraced the idea of a Poland for everyone rather than a state divided between omnipotent winners and oppressed losers . 
Since 1989 , governments changed , but the state remained stable ; even the postcommunists approved the rules of parliamentary democracy and a market economy . 
But not everyone accepted this path . 
Today , Poland is ruled by a coalition of post-Solidarity revanchists , postcommunist provincial trouble-makers , the heirs of pre-WWII chauvinists , xenophobic , and anti-Semitic groups , and the milieu of Radio Maryja , the spokesmen for ethno-clerical fundamentalism . 
Worrying signs are everywhere : the authority of the courts is undermined , the independence of the Constitutional Tribunal is attacked , the civil service corrupted , and prosecutors are politicized . 
Everyday social life is being repressively regulated . 
Why is this happening ? 
Every successful revolution creates winners and losers . 
Poland &apos;s revolution brought civil rights along with increased criminality , a market economy along with failed enterprises and high unemployment , and the formation of a dynamic middle class along with increased income inequality . 
It opened Poland to Europe , but also brought a fear of foreigners and an invasion of Western mass culture . 
For the losers of Poland &apos;s revolution of 1989 , freedom is a great uncertainty . 
The Solidarity workers at giant enterprises have become victims of the freedoms they won . 
In the prison world of communism , a person was the property of the state , but the state took care of one &apos;s existence . 
In the world of freedom , nobody provides care . 
It is in this anxious atmosphere that the current coalition rules , combining George W. Bush &apos;s conservative nostrums with the centralizing practices of Vladimir Putin . 
Solidarity veterans believed that the dictatorship &apos;s demise would be followed by their own reign . 
But guilty communists were not punished , and virtuous Solidarity activists were not rewarded . 
So feelings of injustice gave rise to resentment , envy , and a destructive energy focused on revenge against former enemies and old friends who seemed successful . 
The losers refused to admit that the achievement of freedom was Poland &apos;s greatest success in 300 years . 
For them , Poland remained a country ruled by the communist security apparatus . 
Such a Poland required a moral revolution in which crimes would be punished , virtue rewarded , and injustice redeemed . 
The means chosen by these losers &quot; parties after they won the general election of 2005 was a great purge . 
Lustration , according to early estimates , would affect 700,000 people and take 17 years to complete . 
A list of names found in the reports of the Security Services was to be prepared and made public . 
Moreover , was the duty of every one of the 700,000 people subjected to lustration to declare that he or she did not collaborate with the security services . 
Those who refused or filed a false declaration were to be fired and banned from working in their profession for ten years . 
The result of all this was a pervasive climate of fear . 
But not everyone fell silent . 
Cardinal Dziwisz of Cracow argued that there could be no place in Poland &quot; for retribution , revenge , lack of respect for human dignity , and reckless accusations . &quot; 
Never since the fall of communism had a Catholic Cardinal used such words of condemnation . 
The goal of Poland &apos;s peaceful revolution was freedom , sovereignty , and economic reform , not a hunt for suspected or real secret police agents . 
If a hunt for agents had been organized in 1990 when the democratic revolution began , neither Leszek Balcerowicz &apos;s economic reforms nor the establishment of a state governed by law would have been possible . 
Poland would not be in NATO or the European Union . 
Today , two Polands confront each other . 
A Poland of suspicion , fear , and revenge is fighting a Poland of hope , courage , and dialogue . 
This second Poland - of openness and tolerance , of John Paul II and Czeslaw Milosz , of my friends from the underground and from prison - must prevail . 
I believe that Poles will once again defend their right to be treated with dignity . 
The Constitutional Tribunal &apos;s decision gives hope that the second phase of the Polish revolution will not consume either its father , the will to freedom , or its child , the democratic state .
