Qaddafi &apos;s Long Shadow 
ANTALYA - The recent coup attempt in Libya , led by General Khalifa Hiftar , has finally pierced the illusion that the country &apos;s dysfunctional central government , whose power is limited to the capital , Tripoli , can rule effectively . 
But determining how to bring peace and stability to Libya &apos;s deeply fragmented society will require more than an assessment of this government &apos;s mistakes ; it will demand careful consideration of former leader Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s failures - and his successes . 
Hiftar believes that the key to solving Libya &apos;s myriad crises lies in establishing a strong national army capable of subduing the Islamists who are destabilizing the country . 
Others continue to advocate for national reconciliation . 
But neither solution addresses what is really driving events in Libya : the legacy of Qaddafism . 
Given that Qaddafi ruled Libya for more than four decades , his is a legacy that cannot simply be ignored . 
That means not only recognizing the vital link between his policies and today &apos;s problems , but also ensuring that what should be preserved is not sacrificed in the rush to efface his memory . 
Qaddafi used strong security services and paramilitary revolutionary committees to safeguard his rule , leaving state institutions dysfunctional and fragmented . 
Indeed , Qaddafi &apos;s belief that the bureaucracy impeded the transmission of his message to the masses spurred him to dismantle ministries periodically and place privileged personal relationships above institutional hierarchies . 
Lacking unified leadership , Libyans reverted to tribal and regional allegiances , at the expense of a shared national identity . 
This atomization of the state and society continues to impede Libya &apos;s ability to establish effective and credible government . 
With the right approach , however , there is hope . 
The problem is that Libya &apos;s leaders have so far done more to perpetuate fragmentation and dysfunction than to ameliorate it . 
In its two years in power , the parliament , known as the General National Congress ( GNC ) , has empowered non-state actors , with ministries bypassing the army to task militias with security operations . 
Hiftar recognizes the problem with this approach - indeed , it spurred him to initiate the coup ; but his proposed solution is equally flawed . 
After all , Libya &apos;s security forces have already proved to be more likely to facilitate than fight cronyism . 
Moreover , instead of eliminating Qaddafi &apos;s highly politicized judicial system - for example , separate courts , administered by the revolutionary committees , could try any Libyan without due process - his successors have embraced it . 
In 2012 , a United Nations report revealed that &quot; the vast majority &quot; of an estimated 8,000 conflict-related detainees were being held outside of the state &apos;s purview . 
Militias have taken advantage of this system to strong-arm prosecutors into issuing arrest warrants . 
And militias based in the city of Zintan continue to refuse to hand over Qaddafi &apos;s son , Saif al-Islam , to the central authorities . 
Finally , the corruption that was endemic in Qaddafi &apos;s regime endures , with ministry officials accepting bribes , for example , in exchange for contracts . 
For their part , the militias that overthrew Qaddafi have released prisoners in exchange for ransom payments . 
If Libya is to escape its current predicament , its leaders must transform the governance structures that Qaddafi built to create a fair and credible system based on the rule of law . 
That requires , first and foremost , efforts to strengthen and modernize institutions , guided by Western examples . 
At the same time , Libya &apos;s leaders must recognize and build upon the few positive aspects of Qaddafism . 
For starters , Qaddafi managed to unify a country that , since the Greek invasion in the seventh century BC , had been divided between a coastal strip linked to the larger Mediterranean basin and an isolated hinterland that even Benito Mussolini &apos;s brutal regime could not secure . 
Qaddafi thus took the first step - intentional or not - toward creating a modern nation-state . 
The challenge now is to overcome the divisions that remain within the population - no easy task in a vast country with a sparsely inhabited interior populated mostly by ethnic minorities and reclusive tribes . 
The most important positive component of Qaddafi &apos;s legacy , however , was the partial emancipation of women . 
As a modernizer seeking to mobilize his entire population , Qaddafi promoted women &apos;s social and economic inclusion by expanding education for girls , granting women the right to divorce , and appointing female judges and ministers . 
Though Qaddafi &apos;s female guards were mocked as the trappings of his eccentricity , they actually represented his desire to liberate women . 
Here , too , Qaddafi &apos;s successors have failed . 
Back in 2012 , for example , the head of the interim government , Mustafa Abdel-Jalil , declared his intention to lift restrictions against polygamy . 
Later , he ordered Sarah Elmesallati , the host of the ceremony at which power was transferred to the GNC , to leave the stage halfway through her presentation because she was not wearing a headscarf . 
Ordinary Libyans have also advocated keeping women on a short leash . 
A college-age Libyan woman &apos;s father recently denied her the opportunity to accept a scholarship from the US State Department to attend a training workshop in Washington , DC , because he could not accompany her overseas . 
Libya &apos;s leaders - and their Western benefactors - have no choice but to consider and address the effects of Qaddafi &apos;s legacy on public attitudes and official behavior . 
But they must also accept that only modernization of Libya &apos;s state and society - the agenda that Qaddafi pursued , albeit in a perverted form - will ensure the country &apos;s survival .
