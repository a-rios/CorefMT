When Technophobia Becomes Toxic 
STANFORD - During the late 1990 &quot; s , a singular phenomenon appeared in countries around the world . 
One after another , food and beverage companies capitulated to activists opposed to a promising new technology : the genetic engineering of plants to produce ingredients . 
They are still capitulating to this day . 
The Japanese brewer Kirin and the Danish brewer Carlsberg eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from their beers . 
In the United States , the fast-food giant McDonald &apos;s banned them from its menu ; food manufacturers Heinz and Gerber ( then a division of Switzerland-based Novartis ) dropped them from their baby-food lines ; and Frito-Lay demanded that its growers stop planting corn engineered to contain a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation . 
These measures were rationalized in various ways , but the reality is that by yielding to the demands of a minuscule number of disingenuous activists , the companies opted to offer less safe products to consumers , thereby exposing themselves to legal jeopardy . 
Every year , innumerable packaged-food products worldwide are withheld or recalled from the market due to the presence of &quot; all natural &quot; contaminants like insect parts , toxic molds , bacteria , and viruses . 
Because farming takes place outdoors and in dirt , such contamination is a fact of life . 
Over the centuries , the main culprit in mass food poisoning often has been contamination of unprocessed crops by fungal toxins - a risk that is exacerbated when insects attack food crops , opening wounds that allow fungi ( molds ) to get a foothold . 
For example , fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic , causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn . 
Fumonisin also interferes with the cellular uptake of folic acid , a vitamin that reduces the risk of neural tube defects in developing fetuses , and thus can cause folic acid deficiency - and defects such as spina bifida - even when one &apos;s diet contains what otherwise would be sufficient amounts of the vitamin . 
Many regulatory agencies have therefore established recommended maximum fumonisin levels permitted in food and feed products made from corn . 
The conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of fungal toxins is simply to test unprocessed and processed grains and discard those found to be contaminated - an approach that is both wasteful and failure-prone . 
But modern technology - specifically , the genetic engineering of plants using recombinant DNA technology ( also known as food biotechnology or genetic modification ) - offers a way to prevent the problem . 
Contrary to the claims of food-biotech critics , who insist that genetically modified crops pose risks ( none of which has actually occurred ) of new allergens or toxins in the food supply , such products offer the food industry a proven and practical means of tackling the fungal contamination at its source . 
An excellent example is corn that is crafted by splicing into commercial varieties a gene ( or genes ) from a harmless bacterium . 
The bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to corn-boring insects , but that are harmless to birds , fish , and mammals , including humans . 
As the modified corn fends off insect pests , it also reduces the levels of the mold Fusarium , thereby reducing the levels of fumonisin . 
Indeed , researchers at Iowa State University and the US Department of Agriculture have found that the level of fumonisin in the modified corn is reduced by as much as 80 % compared to conventional corn . 
Similarly , an Italian study of weaned piglets that were fed either conventional corn or the same variety modified to synthesize a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation found that the modified variety contained lower levels of fumonisin . 
More importantly , the piglets that consumed the modified corn achieved a greater final weight , a measure of overall health , despite no difference in feed intake between the two groups . 
Given the health benefits - to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields - governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops . 
In addition , one would expect public-health advocates to demand that such improved varieties be cultivated and used for food , not unlike requirements that drinking water be chlorinated and fluoridated . 
And food producers that are committed to offering the safest and best products to their customers should be competing to get genetically engineered products into the marketplace . 
Alas , none of this has come to pass . 
Activists continue to mount vocal and tenacious opposition to genetically engineered foods , despite almost 20 years of demonstrated , significant benefits , including reduced use of chemical pesticides ( and thus less chemical runoff into waterways ) , greater use of farming practices that prevent soil erosion , higher profits for farmers , and less fungal contamination . 
Responding to the bleating of activists , policymakers have subjected the testing and commercialization of genetically engineered crops to unscientific and draconian regulations , with dire consequences . 
A groundbreaking study of the political economy of agricultural biotechnology concluded that over-regulation causes &quot; delays in the global diffusion of proven technologies , resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices . &quot; 
Current policies also create &quot; disincentives for investing in further research and development , resulting in a slowdown in innovation of second-generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits . &quot; 
Everyone involved in food production and consumption has suffered : consumers ( especially in developing countries ) have been subjected to avoidable health risks , and food producers have placed themselves in legal jeopardy for selling products known to have &quot; design defects . &quot; 
Public policy that discriminates against and discourages vital innovations in food production is not policy that has the public &apos;s interest at heart .
