Systems at Risk 
GENEVA - Failure to adapt to climate change , persistent extreme weather , and major systemic financial failure are just three of 50 major risks monitored every year in the World Economic Forum &apos;s Global Risks Report . 
It seems natural to draw connections among them , especially after a &quot; superstorm &quot; shut down Wall Street this past October . 
Indeed , the report reminds us of the many ways in which systems inevitably affect one another in our interdependent world . 
More important , the report warns of the dangers of multiple systems failing . 
Two of the world &apos;s most fundamental systems , for example , are the economy and the environment ; their interplay underpins the first of three case studies of risk in this year &apos;s report . 
The 1,000 experts who responded to the WEF &apos;s annual Global Risks Perception Survey , on which the report is based , ranked climate-change adaptation as their top environmental concern in the coming decade . 
But we face these environmental challenges at a time of persistent economic weakness . 
Global growth remains slow ; and , with monetary and fiscal policies having a limited impact on economic recovery , governments have neither the resources nor the courage to push for major projects . 
Not surprisingly , our survey group ranked chronic fiscal imbalances second among 50 global risks that are most likely to manifest themselves over the next ten years . 
Strong economies provide the leeway to invest in climate adaptation , while environmental stability ensures the breathing space needed to attend to economic problems . 
Facing stresses on both systems simultaneously is like losing both engines on an airplane in mid-flight . 
The second case study takes another perspective on systems thinking . 
What happens if an apparently &quot; minor &quot; system - such as social media - sparks a &quot; major &quot; geopolitical crisis ? 
With the growing reach of social networks , information can spread worldwide almost instantaneously . 
The benefits of this are well documented , but the risks of misinformation are not . 
Consider the real-world case of someone shouting &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded theater . 
Could something similar happen digitally , with a spark of misinformation igniting a conflagration and wreaking havoc before the truth is revealed ? 
The report &apos;s third case study looks at what happens when we become complacent about a vital system . 
For example , constant innovation in medical science over the last 100 years has left us with the impression that our health-care systems can never regress . 
But experts are increasingly concerned about the potential for pandemics caused by bacteria resistant to all current antibiotics , while our intellectual-property system is failing to create adequate incentives for the development of new varieties . 
The director-general of the World Health Organization has warned that if the world falls back into a pre-antibiotic age , a scratch or throat infection could become lethal once again . 
Each case highlights the need to consider how to make systems more resilient , which means that systems cannot be considered in isolation . 
They are both plugged into larger systems and comprised of smaller subsystems . 
While , ideally , global risks would be met with global responses , the reality is that these risks manifest themselves mainly at the national level , and countries must address them largely on their own . 
So we need to assess national resilience by regularly evaluating critical subsystems within countries . 
The WEF currently is developing metrics that could evaluate national subsystems across five factors of resilience - redundancy , robustness , resourcefulness , response , and recovery - by combining perception-based data with publicly available statistical data . 
Initial perception-based data gathered by the Forum is pointing toward the importance of leadership ability , transparency , efficiency , and good relationships between public and private-sector stakeholders . 
While the development of these metrics is in its early stages , the ultimate aim is to develop a practical diagnostic tool that would function as an &quot; MRI &quot; for national decision-makers to assess their countries &quot; resilience to global risks . 
By revealing underlying weaknesses that more traditional risk-assessment methods may miss , we could pinpoint the structural reforms , behavioral changes , and strategic investments that increased resilience requires . 
The result would not only directly benefit each country willing to engage in this process .
