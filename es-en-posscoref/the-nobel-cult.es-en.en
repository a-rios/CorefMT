The Nobel Cult 
OSLO  -  
As icon , myth , and ritual , the Nobel Prize is well secured . 
But what do we actually know about the Nobel Prize ? 
Shrouded in secrecy and legend , the Nobel Prize first became an object for serious scholarly study after 1976 , when the Nobel Foundation opened its archives . 
Subsequent research by historians of science leaves little doubt : the Nobel medallion is etched with human frailties . 
Although many observers accept a degree of subjectivity in the literature and peace prizes , the science prizes have long been assumed to be an objective measure of excellence . 
But , from the start , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which awards the physics and chemistry prizes , and the Caroline Institute , which awards those for medicine / physiology , have based their decisions on the recommendations of their respective committees . 
And the committee members &quot; own understanding of science has been critical in determining outcomes . 
From the beginning , the inner world of those entrusted to make recommendations was marked by personal and principled discord over how to interpret Alfred Nobel &apos;s cryptic will and to whom prizes should be awarded . 
While committee members tried to be dispassionate , their own judgment , predilections , and interests necessarily entered into their work , and some championed their own agendas , whether openly or cunningly . 
Winning a Prize has never been an automatic process , a reward that comes for having attained a magical level of achievement . 
Designated nominators rarely provided committees with a clear consensus , and the committees often ignored the rare mandates when a single strongly nominated candidate did appear , such as Albert Einstein for his work on relativity theory . 
Academy physicists had no intention of recognizing this theoretical achievement &quot; even if the whole world demands it . &quot; 
The prize is a Swedish prerogative . 
Moreover , a simple change in the composition of the committee could decide a candidate &apos;s fate . 
Not until committee strongman C. W. Oseen died in 1944 could the theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli - one of the giants of quantum mechanics - receive a prize . 
Harboring a grudge , one chemist rallied the Academy to block the committee &apos;s recommendation for the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev , who created the periodic table . 
Even when all involved tried to rise above pettiness and partiality , selecting winners was always difficult- and remains so . 
Committee members occasionally confessed privately that often several candidates could be found who equally deserved a prize . 
Unambiguous , impartial criteria for selecting a winner were not at hand - and never will be . 
The confused situation faced by the Caroline Institute in 1950 reminds us that all prize committees face difficult choices : after four indecisive rounds of preliminary voting , three primary alternatives emerged , but the out-come was still uncertain . 
When urging a colleague to come to the meeting , one committee member noted that if somebody were to catch cold , a completely different decision might be reached . 
The image of science advancing through the efforts of individual genius is , of course , appealing . 
Yet , to a greater extent than the prizes allow , research progresses through the work of many . 
Brilliant minds do matter , but it is often inappropriate and unjust to limit recognition to so few , when so many extremely talented scientists may have contributed to a given breakthrough . 
The Nobel bylaws do not allow splitting a prize into more than three parts , thereby excluding discoveries that entailed work by more than three researchers , or omitting key persons who equally deserved to share in the honor . 
Moreover , it has become clear that many important branches of science are not addressed by Alfred Nobel &apos;s testament ( limited to physics , chemistry , physiology / medicine ) . 
Some of the past century &apos;s greatest intellectual triumphs , such as those related to the expanding universe and continental drift , have not been celebrated . 
Environmental sciences - surely of fundamental importance - also come up empty . 
There is nothing wrong with wanting heroes in science , but we should understand the criteria used to select those whom we are asked to revere . 
Why do people venerate the Nobel Prize ? 
There is no easy answer . 
The cult of the Prize began even before the first winners were announced . 
Media fascination whipped up speculation and interest . 
The creed of the Prize did not depend so much on the merit of the winners , as much as the understanding that the Prize was a powerful means to gain prestige , publicity , and advantage . 
Even scientists who frowned upon the Swedish committees &quot; limitations and sometimes odd choices nevertheless still nominated and lobbied for candidates , knowing that if successful , a winner can draw attention and money to a research specialty , institution , or national scientific community . 
Is science or society well served by a fixation on prizes and on nurturing a culture of extreme competition ? 
Perhaps once the mystery of the Nobel Prize is reduced , we might reflect on what is truly significant in science . 
The soul and heritage of science going back several centuries is far richer than the quest for prizes .
