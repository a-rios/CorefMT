The March of Folly in Afghanistan 
NEW DELHI - When the Wikileaks expos√© of raw United States intelligence data and reports from Afghanistan hit computers worldwide , commentators in Pakistan reacted with vitriolic broadsides . 
One spoke of &quot; Neocon vampires ... blood-thirsty Islamaphobes ... think tank irredentists ... ( Indian ) revanchists ... planning another dismemberment , so that they ( can ) continue their blood-fest in ... Afghanistan . &quot; 
Strong words , particularly when compared to US Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who was only &quot; mortified &quot; and &quot; appalled &quot; by the leaks . 
The leaks provoked such fiery debate because the US-led fight against &quot; jihadism &quot; had suddenly run into an unexpected adversary : truth . 
Indeed , it now seems clear to anyone with eyes that the invasion of Afghanistan was built upon a great miscalculation : that Afghanistan can be successfully invaded . 
Throughout history , such undertakings have always floundered . 
The country may , perhaps , be occupied for a time , but only temporarily ; it cannot be conquered . 
The realization of this historical truth , which the Wikileaks affair has brought home , is now troubling today &apos;s invaders . 
The great miscalculation that led to the Afghan invasion was based on a faulty response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
Of those who attacked the US , an overwhelming number were citizens of Saudi Arabia , aided by Pakistanis . 
How curious that in revenge , following the Afghan invasion , the US attacked Iraq , and then , even before that mission had been concluded , ratcheted up the Afghan war with the so-called &quot; surge &quot; of military force . 
So , almost a decade after the war began , we are back to asking a basic question : toward what goal is this endeavor directed ? 
If it is about countering terrorism , then why are the US and NATO not present in Yemen , Somalia , or Pakistan , which are increasingly terrorist havens ? 
Or is the war in Afghanistan really now about countering the insurgents fighting Hamid Karzai &apos;s government ? 
In attacking &quot; terrorism &quot; and simultaneously engaging in &quot; counter-insurgency , &quot; the US- led NATO forces in Afghanistan have , unfortunately , become a perpetrator of what they are fighting . 
Worse yet , a feeling of imperial revival has also become part of the picture , and not only among Afghans . 
This sense of imperial occupation has transformed the supposed solution to the problem of terror in Afghanistan into the problem itself . 
And if the muddle of motives in Afghanistan is not bad enough , there is Pakistan to add to the confusion . 
Without Pakistan as a strategic partner to provide land , resources , and military support , operations in Afghanistan would be stymied further . 
But Pakistani support clearly comes at a high price . 
The US &quot; buys &quot; an ally in Pakistan that dictates the terms of its collaboration , and simultaneously guards its flanks by keeping open its channels of communication to the Taliban . 
This , however , is an entirely understandable precaution by Pakistan , whose government , like every other government in the region , must be prepared for the day when the US and NATO withdraw from Afghanistan . 
It is , of course , good that the US no longer thinks that Afghanistan can be transformed into some Jeffersonian democracy on the Hindu Kush . 
But an even more fundamental reservation should have followed , because Afghanistan is more of a concept - a polyglot entity of various ethnic groups - than a functioning state . 
Yes , Afghans live in a shifting pattern of loyalty to Kabul , but this unity has historically been only episodic , with frequent periods of fragmentation as well . 
Only when the ruling &quot; emir &quot; in Kabul demonstrates understanding , tolerance , and strength do Afghan unity and a sort of peace prevail . 
Finding that type of Afghan leadership is the true challenge today . 
So it is vital to accept that Afghanistan cannot be governed centrally , only guided . 
Herein lies the crux of the many failures of the Western alliance : their demonstrated lack of a true understanding of Afghanistan &apos;s essence . 
As for other complicating factors , such as the support of some parts of Pakistan &apos;s military establishment for the Taliban and Al Qaeda , a three-decade-old reality must be kept in mind : the Taliban were born of a 1980 &quot; s confluence of national interests between the US and Pakistan . 
Moreover , any attempt to drive the Taliban out of Waziristan risks tearing Pakistan apart . 
In addition , Pakistan , in the words of chief military officer General Ashfaq Kayani , views the Taliban as &quot; a strategic asset &quot; in the struggle with India . 
The US and NATO do not seem to have begun to consider what will be needed to separate Pakistan &apos;s foreign-policy objectives from the requirements of domestic cohesion , since irredentist agitation against India is part of the glue that holds Pakistan together . 
In targeting the Taliban , the US has converted them into an insurgent &quot; army , &quot; an idea of resistance that the population is beginning , once again , to find acceptable . 
Of course , Al Qaeda is made up of unwelcome &quot; foreigners , &quot; but when US and NATO forces attack them , all unite - and Pakistan covertly backs that union . 
This dynamic is something that we in South Asia have known and lived with for ages . 
Wikileaks has now documented our hard-earned knowledge in a language that ordinary Americans and Europeans understand . 
The urgent task facing US President Barack Obama is to move American strategy away from the current cul de sac in which it is now stuck towards one that maintains a balance between its own national interests , and those of India , Pakistan , and a China that is looking on intently . 
An extraordinarily complex end game is underway . 
The longer it drags out , the more destructive the final outcome will be .
