A No-Fly Zone for Syria 
BRUSSELS - There is a saying , too often used in interpreting international relations , that my enemy &apos;s enemy is my friend . 
Sometimes it proves true ; often it does not . 
Thirty years ago , the Afghan mujahedin were mistaken for friends of the West when they fought their country &apos;s Soviet invaders . 
But how lazy that assumption seems now , given all that has since happened . 
Syria &apos;s deepening crisis , and the criminal use of chemical weapons there , has created a similar dynamic and dilemma . 
But the West need not risk making the same mistake and accepting the same false choices . 
Begin with first principles . 
A chemical-weapons attack on the scale just seen in Syria must be deemed a game changer . 
Although possessing these weapons of mass destruction is technically not illegal , most states are parties to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention , which Syria has refused to sign . 
So the answer to the question &quot; What happens next ? &quot; cannot be &quot; Nothing . &quot; 
Principles of international law - in particular , the emerging &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; doctrine and enforcement of the global ban on the use of chemical weapons - dictate that some form of military intervention must occur in order to deter others from using WMDs , particularly against civilians . 
But which measures are appropriate and genuinely useful ? 
What is more likely to strengthen the West &apos;s security , and what runs the risk of weakening it ? 
I believe that the fairest and simplest proportionate response would be to impose a no-fly zone on Syria . 
The proposal is particularly appropriate in the likely absence of any resolution under United Nations Chapter VII ( &quot; Action with Respect to Threats to the Peace &quot; ) , owing to the ( almost certain ) cynical use by Russia and China of their veto power in the Security Council . 
Of course , claims and counter-claims have been swirling in the aftermath of the appalling chemical-weapons attack on a rebel-controlled area east of Damascus . 
But , given the brutality of President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , no one can doubt the lengths to which it would go to hide its guilt . 
The five-day delay in allowing UN chemical-weapons experts to verify the attack gave Assad &apos;s government ample time to conceal incriminating evidence , allow it to degrade , or destroy it with further shelling . 
The United States , France , and the United Kingdom are adamant that all the intelligence and eyewitness evidence points to the Assad government as the perpetrator of the attack . 
There also is no doubt about the legitimacy of concerns about elements of the Syrian opposition . 
The Al Qaeda-led and Salafist extremist groups in the rebel forces , such a Al Nusra , have proved to be just as vicious as the government and its allies , the Iranian proxy Hezbollah and Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Guard . 
But the united view of Western intelligence services is that there is no evidence that these rebel groups launched the chemical-weapons attack . 
In these circumstances , a no-fly zone would not only clear the skies of Syrian warplanes and missiles , thereby reducing the scale of the slaughter ; it would also show Assad and his supporters that he truly is vulnerable . 
Generals ordered to use chemical weapons would have to reckon with the prospect that the regime could , actually , fall , and that they then might find themselves on trial for war crimes . 
It would be better , of course , if Russia and China would allow the Security Council to do the job for which it was intended - securing peace and preventing war crimes . 
By continuing to support Assad despite his use of chemical weapons , Russia &apos;s standing in the Arab world has gone from patron to pariah . 
What little moral and political standing Russian President Vladimir Putin has retained in the rest of the world is also evaporating , as he will soon discover at the upcoming G-20 Summit in Saint Petersburg . 
But the world cannot hold its breath waiting for a change of heart by Putin and China , which is why a no-fly zone should be examined as a military option . 
In the aftermath of the Gulf War in 1991 , a no-fly zone , initially proposed by British Prime Minister John Major , did not topple Saddam Hussein , but it did prevent him from carrying out further attacks from the air on Kurds in the north and Shia in the south . 
Likewise , a no-fly zone in Syria would immediately restrict the Syrian government &apos;s means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction . 
Some military experts may say that Syria &apos;s air-defense systems are too sophisticated to suppress , making a no-fly zone too dangerous to enforce . 
But Israel has managed to attack Syrian territory twice - destroying a North Korean-staffed nuclear reactor in 2007 and , more recently , striking a Hezbollah convoy - with no casualties or loss of planes . 
Mindful of this weakness , Russia has offered Syria its more modern S-300 missiles ; but there is no evidence that they have arrived , let alone been deployed . 
And once Syria &apos;s air-defense system is sufficiently degraded , it would be best if Arab countries - Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and other Gulf states - and Turkey used their air forces to police the zone . 
Any malicious wishful thinking on the part of Assad &apos;s regime would be dispelled with every glance at the sky .
