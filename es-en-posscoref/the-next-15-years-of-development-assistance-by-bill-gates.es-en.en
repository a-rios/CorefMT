The Measurement of Hope 
SEATTLE - The lives of the world &apos;s poorest people have improved more rapidly in the last 15 years than ever before , yet I am optimistic that we will do even better in the next 15 years . 
After all , human knowledge is increasing . 
We can see this concretely in the development and declining costs of new medicines like HIV drugs , and in the creation of new seeds that allow poor farmers to be more productive . 
Once such tools are invented , they are never un-invented - they just improve . 
Skeptics point out that we have a hard time delivering new tools to the people who need them . 
This is where innovation in the measurement of governmental and philanthropic performance is making a big difference . 
That process - setting clear goals , picking the right approach , and then measuring results to get feedback and refine the approach continually -helps us to deliver tools and services to everybody who will benefit . 
Innovation to reduce the delivery bottleneck is critical . 
Following the path of the steam engine long ago , progress is not &quot; doomed to be rare and erratic . &quot; 
We can , in fact , make it commonplace . 
Though I am an optimist , I am not blind to the problems that we face , or to the challenges that we must overcome to accelerate progress in the next 15 years . 
The two that worry me the most are the possibility that we will be unable to raise the funds needed to pay for health and development projects , and that we will fail to align around clear goals to help the poorest . 
The good news is that many developing countries have growing economies that allow them to devote more resources to helping their poorest people . 
India , for example , is becoming less dependent on aid , and eventually will not need it . 
Some countries , like the United Kingdom , Norway , Sweden , South Korea , and Australia , are increasing their foreign-aid budgets ; others , even traditionally generous donors like Japan and the Netherlands , have reduced theirs . 
The direction of many countries , including the United States , France , Germany , and Canada , is unclear . 
Still , aid is critical . 
It helps people in the poorest countries to meet their basic needs . 
It funds innovation in the creation of new tools and services , and in their delivery . 
Unfortunately , aid budgets are threatened by fiscal weakness in almost all of the advanced countries . 
Unless voters hear about the positive impact that their generosity is having , they will inevitably focus on issues closer to home . 
A single story , true or not , about a small amount of aid being misused can often cloud the entire field . 
Imagine how you would feel about investing if every article you read were only about stocks that did poorly , with no reporting on the big successes . 
Historically , aid was discussed largely in terms of the total amount of money invested . 
When framed this way , aid has a better chance of becoming a priority . 
But will the world align around a clear set of goals in the next 15 years ? 
The United Nations is starting to map out new goals for the years following the 2015 expiration of the current Millennium Development Goals . 
As with the MDGs , the next set of goals could help to align groups doing the work , remind voters what their generosity supports , and allow us to see where we are making progress in delivering solutions to the poor . 
The MDGs &quot; success means that there is a lot of interest in expanding them to include a broader set of issues . 
The MDGs were coherent because they focused on helping the poorest people in the world . 
The groups that needed to work together to attain them were easy to identify , and they could be held accountable for cooperation and progress . 
When the UN reaches agreement on other important goals like mitigating climate change , it should consider whether a different set of actors and a separate process might be best for those efforts . 
The progress that the world has made in helping the poorest in the last 15 years is the kind of good-news story that happens one life at a time , so it often does not have the same visibility as a big setback , such as the outbreak of a new epidemic . 
From time to time , we should step back and celebrate the achievements that come with having the right goals , the necessary political will , generous aid , and innovation in tools and their delivery . 
Doing so has certainly deepened my commitment to this work .
