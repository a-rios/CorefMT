Netanyahu the Palestinian 
PHILADELPHIA - In January , Israeli voters will go to the polls for an election that promises to hand Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu a renewed mandate . 
Few prospects are more loathsome to the Israeli left , US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration , most European leaders , or many American Jews . 
But no one regards the prospect of another Netanyahu government with more anguish than the Palestinians . 
In the Arab-Israeli conflict &apos;s long , tortured history , they have reviled no Israeli prime minister - with the possible exception of Ariel Sharon - more than Netanyahu . 
The reason is simple : he is one of them . 
Literally , of course , he is not . 
But , unlike previous Israeli prime ministers ( again , with the possible exception of Sharon ) , Netanyahu has emulated the Palestinian political strategy of sumud , or steadfastness . 
The philosophy of sumud is rooted in Palestinians &quot; implacable belief in the righteousness of their cause and the justness of their methods . 
It operates both passively and actively in Palestinian culture , demanding stubbornness and tolerating ruthlessness , violence , and duplicity . 
At sumud &apos;s core lies the unswerving , blinkered view that Israel is illegitimate and its duration limited . 
As a result , Palestinian leaders have for decades mobilized their society to outlast Israel . 
Indoctrination begins at a young age through family , education , and media , and later encourages more aggressive resistance , including terrorism . 
In other words , Palestinians are playing a long game . 
But plans for a functioning Palestinian state that do not depend on foreign aid have been conspicuously absent , save for the recent efforts of Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad . 
Netanyahu &apos;s version of sumud is evident in his policies and rhetoric , which focus on Israel &apos;s legitimacy , necessity , and permanence . 
Indeed , his speeches frequently offer lessons in Jewish history , while casting the &quot; Holy Land &quot; as both a Jewish right and an Israeli national symbol . 
Addressing the United Nations in September , Netanyahu highlighted his core message for all , especially Israelis : &quot; Three thousand years ago , King David reigned over the Jewish state in our eternal capital , Jerusalem . 
I say that to all those who proclaim that the Jewish state has no roots in our region , and that it will soon disappear . &quot; 
Such rhetoric compliments a long-term strategy of strengthening Israeli control over core areas , especially Jerusalem and its suburbs . 
Indeed , while settlement-building in the West Bank has slackened , it continues . 
Moreover , aggressive counter-terrorism activities and the separation barrier have decisively reduced cross-border attacks , containing mounting pressure in Palestine as the conflict remains on the back burner . 
And Netanyahu continues to oversee economic expansion and improved foreign relations , despite hostile rhetoric from Europe and elsewhere . 
The Palestinians seem to recognize Netanyahu &apos;s variety of sumud for what it is . 
His steadfastness - and declining international interest in their struggle , as the world &apos;s focus shifts to the Arab Spring &apos;s Islamist winter - stymies any advance toward an agreement . 
The US is , perhaps , equally frustrated . 
Israeli prime ministers are supposed to come in two varieties : heavily accented Eastern European men and grizzled military officers who talk a good game before acquiescing to the latest American or international demands for concessions , talks , and aid . 
While previous prime ministers like Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir were not averse to lecturing , they lacked strategic cunning . 
Netanyahu &apos;s unwillingness to compromise disconcerts , confuses , and often enrages Americans . 
His relentless disquisitions on Israel &apos;s strategic environment , security requirements , red lines , and Jewish history are offset only by conciliatory talk about reopening negotiations , which are immediately reject by the Palestinians , who , like him , fear showing weakness . 
Furthermore , Netanyahu &apos;s unsentimental assessment of the Middle East does not line up with that of the Obama administration - in thrall to its collapsing romance with moderate Islamists - and its devoted supporters among Jewish Americans . 
These groups do not understand Netanyahu , who proclaims Jewish rights , defends his country &apos;s interests , and hints at conciliation but gives up little - much like a traditional Arab leader . 
Despite considerable Israeli disgust with Netanyahu &apos;s party , allies , and policies , no credible rival exists . 
Israelis grudgingly accept that the country and its geopolitical situation are relatively stable , especially in view of its immediate neighborhood - a burning Syria , a smoldering Egypt , and a volatile Lebanon . 
Moreover , those variables that could upend Netanyahu &apos;s re-election - the situation in Gaza and Lebanon , for example , or deteriorating conditions in Sinai and Jordan , any of which could drag Israel into unwanted military operations - now appear unlikely to influence the outcome . 
As a result , Netanyahu &apos;s position is strong . 
The Palestinians initiated a zero-sum game that has given him the upper hand . 
By using the Palestinians &quot; own strategy , he has cornered them . 
After all , genuine peace efforts by the Palestinians - based on a two-state solution with no &quot; right of return &quot; for post-1948 refugees - would enrage Hamas and revive factional violence , adding another self-defeat to an already long list . 
With such help from the Palestinians - for example , Hamas bitterly castigated Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas recently after he inadvertently implied giving up the right of return - Netanyahu may well rule Israel and Palestine for the foreseeable future .
