Did Development Fail in Kenya ? 
Nairobi  -  
A month ago , Kenya fell prey to a sudden burst of post-electoral violence that has left over 1000 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . 
The intensity and scale of the violence have stunned the world . 
Of course , Kenya had lived through tense electoral periods before , and few people who know Africa were blind to the many difficulties the country continued to face . 
But things seemed to be going well recently . 
This year &apos;s campaign was exceptionally peaceful , and millions of citizens voted on December 27 - at times walking and queuing for hours to cast their ballot . 
Perhaps more fundamentally , Kenya was unanimously seen as the &quot; good student &quot; of development , sometimes referred to as a symbol of an African renaissance . 
The &quot; Kenya vision 2030 framework , &quot; a set of ambitious macroeconomic , legal , and constitutional reforms , was being implemented in close partnership with the World Bank . 
Cherished by the donor community , Kenya received almost $ 1 billion of official development assistance in 2006 - up by 250 % since 2002 . 
Its booming horticulture and tourist industries were hailed as models for other African states in their efforts to integrate into world trade . 
The country &apos;s economic expansion , which averaged 5.5 % in the last four years and fuelled the progress of neighboring economies , appeared to prove that vigorous growth is possible in Africa even without mineral or fossil resources . 
Today , this economic miracle is up in the air . 
All is not lost , and there are strong reasons to believe that Kenyans will surmount the current political crisis and put the country back on its promising track . 
Nevertheless , as we sit on the brink of the abyss , it is worth re-examining our assumptions that since poverty breeds conflict , socio-economic development must foster political stability and reduce recourse to violence . 
The first lesson we should draw from this month of civil strife is that development , however well-managed , cannot solve everything . 
Some tensions are deeply ingrained in societies , and peace requires more than any development agency can deliver . 
Parallel to the growth agenda , there is a specific role for bilateral and multilateral diplomacy to play in support of improved governance . 
In fact , development itself generates a number of strains on societies that lie at the very roots of conflict . 
Fast-paced changes of identity caused by urbanization , the empowerment of women or exposure to foreign media tend to weaken traditional norms and social networks . 
And , at least initially , economic growth tends to increase inequalities within a country , as some communities or individuals benefit from rising income and others don &apos;t . 
By displacing traditional centers of power , development can nurture collective resentment . 
Ethnic manipulation is a small step away , which many political leaders are disposed to take . 
None of this , however , disproves the link between development and peace , or inverts the correlation . 
At both the micro and the macro level , development projects and economic growth can do much to alleviate some of the structural causes of political violence . 
But development professionals , whose first duty is to &quot; do no harm , &quot; should be more conscious of the complex strains brought upon developing societies . 
In Kenya too , this sensitivity has not sufficiently infused our organizations and projects . 
Ultimately , the enhanced economic activity that development generates is the only way to reduce inequalities , particularly in a context of rapid demographic growth : it is easier to work on a fairer distribution of a growing pie than of a shrinking one . 
Moreover , fast-paced but ill-distributed economic growth can be accompanied by programs that focus on those who are left behind , thereby mitigating grievances . 
It is no coincidence that much of Kenya &apos;s ongoing violence is occurring in the slums of its large cities . 
Had more attention been given to the country &apos;s most glaring inequalities in access to water , shelter , or jobs , this population might not have chosen violence as an instrument of change . 
Let us draw the right lessons from Kenya : socio-economic progress remains our best tool to prevent conflict in the long run . 
But the relationship between growth and political stability is subtler and less linear than we like to believe . 
Development is no miracle solution to violence , and may create its own set of grievances - particularly when done without regard to the abrupt changes it brings to societies . 
Kenya isn &apos;t an illustration of development failing , but of development at work : complex , powerful , and yet fragile .
