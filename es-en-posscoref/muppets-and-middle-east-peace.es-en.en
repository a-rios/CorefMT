Muppets and Middle East Peace 
NEW YORK - Can furry puppets in Day-Glo colors provide the lessons we need to calm the fires of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ? 
The Muppet empire is now worldwide . 
Those who grew up with the children &apos;s educational TV show Sesame Street know that it gives five-year-olds easy-to-take lessons in literacy , numeracy , and social skills . 
But Sesame Street has a loftier agenda , finding partners in the developing world - including Saudi Arabia , South Africa , and Pakistan - to bring the fuzzy little creatures , with their message of peace and tolerance , to local audiences . 
A new documentary , &quot; When Muppets Dream of Peace , &quot; tracks the harrowing joint production of Sesame Street in Israel and Palestine , with a Jordanian production team brought in to help facilitate . 
This program , like so many educational or cultural Israeli-Palestinian partnerships , began in starry-eyed idealism . 
But , based on the film - and on a recent panel discussion with the filmmakers and a Muppets spokesman in New York City - it was undermined by a common flaw in such partnerships . 
The original plan - like with so many of these programs - was based on a notion of parity : Israeli and Palestinian production teams would work together . 
But the Palestinian partners vetoed that idea - &quot; We aren &apos;t there yet , &quot; they explained . 
Could they have a stand-alone Palestinian Sesame Street ? 
No funding for that , came the reply . 
The Palestinian team finally agreed to parallel productions with a major &quot; cultural exchange &quot; element - rather than creating segments together , they would produce a series with Palestinian Muppets and adults that also incorporated cartoons and mini-documentaries produced by the Israelis and Jordanians . The other two teams would do likewise . 
Some unifying characters - such as an Arab- Israeli girl who explains each &quot; side &quot; to the other - would create a measure of continuity . 
The New York-based management wanted the Palestinians and Israelis to portray each other in a humanizing way . 
Again , the Palestinians resisted . 
Rather than focus on creating scenarios that showed Israelis - even Israeli kids - in a positive light , they wanted to focus on showing Palestinian culture in a positive light , portraying Palestinian youths as role models , and providing images to kids that offered alternatives to violence . 
But then reality intervened again . 
A suicide bomber attacked in Israel , and , in retaliation , the Israel Defense Forces took over Ramallah , where the tiny Palestinian Sesame Street studio was located . 
Day after day , the talented Palestinian team of animators , puppeteers , designers , cameramen , and producers could not get to work - even as the Israeli team was churning out their own material in a brightly lit , well-funded studio in Tel Aviv . 
Then the IDF occupied the TV station itself and destroyed it , along with the team &apos;s computers and cameras . 
The documentary &apos;s footage of shot-out computer screens and piles of smashed printers and cameras - under graffiti reading &quot; Palestine Never &quot; - makes one despair . 
Meanwhile , New York was growing impatient , letting the Palestinian team know that their segments were late - and , under what was essentially a military occupation , the Palestinians began to rethink whether this was the right kind of project to which to devote their energies . 
The New York producer overseeing the project , a single mother , was reluctant initially to visit Ramallah - so the Palestinian team &apos;s inability to produce their segments on time was , like so many aspects of the Palestinian experience , hidden behind a barrier of fear , not fully witnessed , and thus not fully comprehended . 
But there is a Palestinian Sesame Street and an Israeli Sesame Street , and there are positive Arab-Israeli characters in the Israeli version . 
And the creators of these programs , together with the filmmakers behind &quot; When Muppets Dream of Peace , &quot; offer important lessons for all of us . 
One quote from a Palestinian TV production team member stayed with me : &quot; This is a shotgun wedding , &quot; he explained when he was advocating for a Palestine-only Sesame Street . 
&quot; And we want a divorce . &quot; 
But how often does the outside world - even the best-intentioned donors and program creators - reach out to Palestinian civil society on its own terms , without insisting on that &quot; shotgun wedding ? &quot; 
How often are resources invested in Palestinian films , books , newspapers , high schools , dance troupes , teachers , etc. without requiring the recipients to make friendly gestures to Israel ? 
Many civil-society elements in the Muslim world have turned their backs on possible partnerships with Israeli counterparts . 
One Egyptian actor was boycotted at home for merely appearing in Cannes with an Israeli actress . 
But I am certain that the more intently outsiders invest in Palestinian civil society on its own terms , the less exasperated the Palestinian intelligentsia - and the Muslim world - will become with the often-coerced terms of Palestine &apos;s creativity . 
A vibrant Palestinian civil society could become more flexible and open toward possible partnerships - including more natural , holistic Israeli-Palestinian joint ventures - thus benefiting the region as a whole . 
The Muppets have taught generations of kids worldwide how to count to ten and share cookies . 
In the 1970 &quot; s in the United States , they taught us about an interracial couple on Sesame Street . 
In South Africa , the creators asked for - and got - a puppet that was an HIV-positive child , since acceptance of such kids was a lesson that local educators told the New York team they needed to teach . 
In the Sesame Street of Palestine and Israel , the failure of the joint venture was really a success : the Muppets and their creators have given us another valuable lesson , this time in how - and how not - to help others .
