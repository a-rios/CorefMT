Ending Institutionalized Childhood 
BUDAPEST - In September of this year , the Bulgarian prosecutor launched a homicide investigation into the deaths of 238 children with disabilities , who had been living in state institutions in Bulgaria . 
The children died over the past decade from malnutrition and starvation , treatable infections , pneumonia , &quot; accidents , &quot; and neglect . 
Of the 238 cases , 149 children died in the institutions where they lived rather than in a hospital , raising alarm about why , on the brink of death , a child was not transferred immediately to a hospital intensive-care unit . 
Abuse and neglect are not unique to Bulgaria . 
Successive governments across central and eastern Europe are responsible for a systemic failure to provide adequate support to families with disabled children , often resulting in abandonment and institutionalization . 
Without a stimulating family or family-like setting , such children cannot develop their full potential . 
Institutions cause deterioration in a child , even where neglect and abuse are absent . 
The rate of institutionalization of children with disabilities has remained stable , but is set to be reversed . 
In November , representatives of member states of the World Health Organization &apos;s Europe region met in Bucharest , where they signed the &quot; European Declaration on the Health of Children and Young People with Intellectual Disabilities and their Families . &quot; 
The declaration commits governments to improving the health care of children with intellectual disabilities to enhance lifelong development , as well as inclusion and full participation in society , and sets out ten priorities for action , which include empowering children , protecting them against harm and abuse , and transferring care from institutions to the community . 
This is the first intergovernmental agreement to incorporate the 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ( CRPD ) , a legally-binding human-rights treaty . 
The declaration applies the CRPD in a specific geographic region ( Europe ) , for a specific target group ( children with intellectual disabilities ) , and for a cluster of specific rights ( the rights to health and to live in the community with appropriate support ) . 
There are 53 states in the WHO-Europe region , which stretches from Iceland to Uzbekistan , and 48 have signed or ratified the CRPD . 
Children with intellectual disabilities often experience syndrome-specific risks , sensory or physical impairments , and other health issues , including epilepsy , heart disease , and respiratory disease . 
Frequently , these conditions are not diagnosed , or are diagnosed late as a result of health-care professionals &quot; ignorance of what to look for , or their inability to communicate with non-verbal people . 
Head banging or screaming can , for example , be misinterpreted as being part of the intellectual disability rather than an expression of discomfort or depression - a phenomenon known as &quot; diagnostic overshadowing . &quot; 
Unfortunately , annual health checks that screen for physical and mental-health changes and epilepsy are not routine in many countries . 
There is no effective training for health-care and social-welfare professionals that covers the special health needs of people with intellectual disabilities , and no monitoring of health systems . 
People with intellectual disabilities are under-researched , their physical and mental health problems unarticulated and unidentified - and thus their special needs left unaddressed . 
Despite some efforts by governments in the 1990 &quot; s , institutions remain the default official response to children with disabilities and their families across Central and Eastern Europe . 
In 2005 , the last year for which we have statistics , UNICEF estimated that &quot; at least 317,000 children with disabilities in the region live in residential institutions , often for life . &quot; 
The majority of children in institutions have developmental delay or intellectual disabilities , which institutions themselves can cause or worsen . 
Institutionalization is often based on good intentions and carried out in the name of therapy , care , and protection . 
But children in institutions are denied education , despite evidence showing that every child can learn and develop . 
They are denied rehabilitation and recreational activities . 
Many spend their days lying in bed , where they develop major health problems including bedsores , muscle atrophy , spinal deformities , and breathing disorders . 
Living in the community with access to both specialized and mainstream services is not merely a policy goal ; the CRPD clarifies that this is a matter of fundamental human rights . 
In tough economic times , there is a tendency to sacrifice human rights , but preventing institutionalization of children or adults with disabilities is no longer open to negotiation . 
Lack of resources is no excuse , either . 
There is money floating around the system that needs to be redirected to community alternatives . 
Political will is also cost-free , and governments need to introduce management and financial incentives for modernizing services and shifting their focus from institutions to families and community-based care . 
Children and adults with disabilities , together with their advocates , should be involved in the planning , implementation , and monitoring of policies and services . 
Inclusion through support for families and community-based care will ensure that service delivery meets human needs and complies with the rule of law . 
Ultimately , it is government &apos;s responsibility to respect , protect , and fulfill human rights . 
In signing the Bucharest Declaration , governments have committed to stopping new admissions to institutions by developing community-based services . 
Empirical evidence supports this transition , and international human-rights obligations compel such a move . 
States are obliged to report on implementation of the Bucharest Declaration in 2015 . 
For children in institutions , five years is a long time to wait .
