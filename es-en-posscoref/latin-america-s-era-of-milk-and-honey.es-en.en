Latin America &apos;s Era of Milk and Honey 
Whenever signs of change appear in Latin America &apos;s economies , people ask if the change will be transitory or permanent . 
Driven mainly by the almost insatiable appetites of China and India , a profound burst of growth has come to Latin America . 
Over the past five years , Chile &apos;s GDP has been expanding 5 % annually , Argentina &apos;s by almost 9 % , Venezuela &apos;s by more than 10 % , and the Andean Community &apos;s by 6 % . 
The continent &apos;s aggregate growth , at 4.5 % , is expected to lag behind the world average of 5 % in 2007 , but only because the largest countries , Mexico and Brazil , are growing more slowly . 
One regular aspect of post-war Latin America has been that such bonanzas have been undermined by large current account deficits , and thus indebtedness . 
But that is not happening this time . 
Latin America will finish 2007 with a current account surplus and growing foreign-currency reserves , insulating them from financial crisis . 
On the one hand , world trade is growing , and so are Latin America &apos;s exports . 
On the other hand , the terms of trade have improved . 
High commodity prices have benefited producers of oil and gas ( such as Venezuela and Bolivia ) and minerals ( such as Chile ) . 
There is also a surprising phenomenon that favors everyone : prices of technology-based capital assets imported by Latin America have been falling throughout the past decade . 
Another phenomenon is linked to the first . 
Structural deflationary pressures in the developed countries - such as highly debated increments of productivity in the United States - help the central banks to maintain price stability , which means that growing exports and high terms of trade have been accompanied by reasonably low interest rates . 
As long as this combination of factors lasts , the governments of Latin America can maintain fiscal discipline , despite higher spending , as rapid growth translates into greater revenues . 
Whereas Chile , for example , recorded a slight fiscal deficit in 2003 , by 2006 it boasted an almost 8 % -of-GDP surplus . 
With different tools - including a profound restructuring of its foreign debt - and less discipline , Argentina accomplished a similar fiscal turnaround . 
Likewise , thanks to the discovery of gas , Bolivia turned its 8 % -of-GDP fiscal deficit in 2003 into a surplus of 1.2 of GDP in 2006 . 
Of eleven of the region &apos;s countries - the five MERCOSUR economies , the four Andean Community countries , plus Chile and Mexico - seven have had a fiscal surplus in 2006 and six will maintain it - less easily - in 2007 . 
Of course , skeptics warn against excessive optimism , arguing that something similar occurred in the early 1970 &quot; s , ending in a deep crisis . 
But there is a key difference : whereas the economic stagnation and world-wide inflation of the 1970 &quot; s originated in the supply cartel of hydrocarbons producers , now it is the Asian latecomers in the process of industrialization that are driving growth , and inflation is a constant threat that never materializes . 
Meanwhile , each government , with its own style and political discourse , seeks to associate the state with the benefits of a globalization that , for the past few years , has been showing its generosity . 
The result is surprisingly orthodox : a sharp decline in Latin America &apos;s average public and private foreign debt , from 44 % to 21 % of GDP between 2003 and 2007 , in part because of the exchange rate appreciation generated by the foreign bonanza itself . 
It seems that the region &apos;s popular left-wing nationalist governments have discovered that fiscal stability and reducing debt constitute the key to political autonomy and economic independence . 
If the neo-liberal Washington Consensus has been forgotten , perhaps it wasn &apos;t because its tenets were misguided , but because the world offered an opportunity to realize the most important of them without having to suffer the humiliation of a shrinking economy .
