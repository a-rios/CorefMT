It \ u0027s a Smaller World 
Imagine looking through a powerful microscope and discovering incredibly tiny machines taking apart the stuff around them , molecule by molecule , and reassembling the molecules to make exact replicas of themselves . 
The replicas , of course , will do the same thing . 
After 20 generations , each machine will have become more than a million . 
Can they be stopped , or will they take over the world ? 
This is not some futuristic science-fiction story about technology run amok . 
This is the world we live in today , where such machines are just about everywhere . 
Countless millions of them inhabit the gut of every human being . 
We call them bacteria , and they took over the world billions of years before we humans showed up . 
We treat them with respect , or they kill us . 
Evolutionists aren &apos;t sure about the progenitors of bacteria , and we can &apos;t repeat nature &apos;s experiment . 
Nature , after all , had the luxury of time , billions of years of it , whereas we mortals must demonstrate progress before our research grants run out . 
In any case , the simplest bacteria are marvelously complex , with strands of DNA carrying complete instructions for metabolism and reproduction . 
Nevertheless , some biologists believe that they are on the verge of creating a microbe in the laboratory . 
Long chains of DNA can now be manufactured to order , and scientists are identifying which genes are essential . 
If a new microbe is created in the lab , it will be because scientists have learned how to follow nature &apos;s recipe . 
But what if , instead of trying to mimic nature , a new kind of life could be invented from scratch ? 
What if this life were closer to the sort of mechanical devices humans know how to build , but on a very small scale . 
How small ? 
At a 1959 meeting of the American Physical Society , Richard Feynman , perhaps the most admired physicist of our time , gave a talk entitled , &quot; There &apos;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom . &quot; 
On the scale of atomic dimensions , Feynman pointed out , all 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica could fit on the head of a pin . 
He challenged his colleagues to develop the capability to manipulate and control things on that scale . 
Thirty years later , scientists at an IBM laboratory in California arranged 35 atoms of xenon on the surface of a nickel crystal , to spell &quot; IBM &quot; in block letters . 
This was accomplished with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope ( STM ) , a device developed at an IBM laboratory in Zurich whose inventors were awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in physics . 
It was hailed as the start of the nano revolution - the advent of technology on a scale a thousand times smaller than the world of microelectronics . 
At this point , however , &quot; revolution &quot; might seem to be an exaggeration . 
The IBM scientists had proven that it is possible to manipulate individual atoms , but doing so still had no practical use . 
Then , in 1996 , Richard Smalley of Rice University was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of fullerenes , beautiful nanometer-scale carbon structures with remarkable properties and many potential applications . 
There are still no nano-scale products on the market , but governments around the world are betting huge research budgets on the power of nanotechnology to transform the world as profoundly as the microelectronics revolution . 
Indeed , a 1986 book by a futurist named K. Eric Drexler , Engines of Creation : The Coming Era of Nanotechnology , argues that the way to manipulate things with atomic precision is with nano-scale machines . 
Drexler is the Chairman of the Foresight Institute , which is dedicated to preparing the world for the nanotechnology revolution . 
He sees a world in which incredibly tiny self-replicating robots , which he calls &quot; assemblers , &quot; will do all the work , guiding chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision . 
Supplied with raw materials , assemblers could be programmed to build whatever we need , including more assemblers . 
But is there a darker side to nano ? 
As Richard Smalley asks , what &apos;s to stop self-replicating nano-robots from continuing to munch and replicate &quot; until everything on earth becomes an undifferentiated mass of grey goo ? &quot; 
This worries enough people , including Prince Charles in the UK , that there have been calls for banning further research into nanotechnology . 
But to do so would be a serious mistake . 
In the first place , grey goo is a purely imaginary danger . 
There are no assemblers , and nobody really knows how to build one . 
And if there were assemblers , they would face the same limitation as the bacteria with which we started our story : they can &apos;t travel long distances without hitching a ride , and would simply run out of raw material . 
Moreover , assemblers aren &apos;t the only way to manipulate things on an atomic scale . 
None of the current government-funded research is going into assemblers . 
The scientists who invented the STM weren &apos;t trying to build assemblers , and they never heard of K. Eric Drexler . 
They were just trying to understand basic surface physics . 
Getting to the future , it seems , does not require the help of futurists .
