Made in China Remade 
SHANGHAI - &quot; It &apos;s a dying business , &quot; said the owner of a garment factory I met in Zhuhai , a city in Guangdong province . 
Like many in his line of business , he is packing up . 
Lured by abundant cheap labor , investors flooded to Zhuhai two decades ago . 
Gone , it seems , is the heyday of T-shirts , toys , plastic flowers , tiles , hooks , springs , and the like . 
Today , the costs of manufacturing such items are lower in countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam than in Guangdong . 
As labor costs continue to climb , is China set to lose its coveted spot as the world &apos;s workshop ? 
Rising labor costs are inevitable . 
China &apos;s government introduced tough labor laws and a minimum wage in 2008 . 
Recent policies to improve rural economic conditions have slowed the flow of migrants from the countryside . 
Workers are demanding higher compensation to match the fast-rising cost of living in China &apos;s cities , as manifested in an ongoing and high-profile labor strike at a Honda plant based in Guangdong . 
Salary was the major point of contention . 
Workers on strike demanded a raise in pay from the current 1500 renminbi ( $ 234.00 ) to 2000-2500 renminbi ( $ 373.13 ) per month . 
Clearly , Chinese factories can no longer offer dirt-cheap prices . 
Apparel production is a prime example of China &apos;s declining competiveness in markets dependent on low-cost labor . 
According to a study by the US consulting firm Jassin O &apos;Rourke , labor costs in China are higher than in seven other Asian countries . 
The average cost for a worker is $ 1.08 per hour in China &apos;s coastal provinces and $ 0.55-0.80 in the inland provinces . 
India was in seventh place , at $ 0.51 per hour . 
Bangladesh offers the lowest cost , only one-fifth the price of locations like Shanghai and Suzhou . 
Adding to China &apos;s labor woes , the financial crisis during the last two years had a disastrous effect on foreign demand . 
In 2009 , China &apos;s export value fell by 16 percent from 2008 . 
Labor intensive industries were especially hard hit . 
In the textiles industry , profits declined for the first time in ten years in 2008 . 
In March 2009 , exports of electronics and IT products tumbled nearly 25 % from the previous period . 
Although Chinese exports have begun to recover in 2010 , the impact of the financial crisis remains palpable . 
By January 2010 , the value of exports has returned to its previous level in the same period of 2008 . 
For Chinese manufacturers , a long-term trend of rising costs coupled with a short-term export slump were unprecedented challenges . 
These adverse conditions have inadvertently propelled a long-delayed restructuring of China &apos;s labor-intensive industries . 
As costs surge , Chinese producers are seeking higher value , new niches , and more influence over policymaking . 
Along China &apos;s dynamic coastal belt , local governments are drafting new economic blueprints to push their firms up the value-added chain . 
Consider the case of a textiles manufacturing center in Jiangsu province , dubbed the &quot; silk capital &quot; of China . 
Three-quarters of the city &apos;s GDP had been coming from textiles production . 
Last year , however , exports fell by about 15 % . 
For local planners , the export shock was a wake-up call for change . 
As a result , officials in Jiangsu are no longer content with sewing clothing . 
Leveraging a mixture of administrative guidance and monetary incentives , the city government plans to reduce the share of garments in the output of textiles products by 25 % in three years and to increase the industrial applications of chemical fibers , which promise much higher returns than apparel production . Already , according to local officials , the city &apos;s factories have acquired the ability to mass-produce super-thin fibers first designed in Japan . 
In fact , the global meltdown may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for industrial upgrading . 
Slumping orders devastated low-end producers , which barely survived on wafer-thin margins . 
Half of China &apos;s toy factories went bust by the end of 2008 . 
Though alarming in the short term , the eradication of small producers spells good news for those that survived the crisis . 
As firms consolidate market share , they gain economies of scale . 
Larger firms are more capable of pooling resources for research and development , which is the key to China &apos;s aspirations to climb the value ladder . 
Less fragmented industries also lobby better . 
Traditionally , contract manufacturers in China are scattered and fiercely competitive . 
They have little if any say over domestic and international regulations . 
Producers in Jiangsu , for example , were forced to adapt constantly to fickle product-safety and environmental standards in export markets . 
Compared to producers in the US and Europe , those in China are weakly organized and passive . 
This could change . 
As surviving firms gain in size , Chinese businesses may exercise more bargaining power vis-Ã -vis the Chinese government and foreign firms . 
Exercising a louder voice in politics at home and abroad could mean reduced uncertainty for Chinese exporters . 
Consider the strategy of Lenovo , China &apos;s largest computer manufacturer ; it has hired a lobbyist in Washington D.C. , reportedly the first Chinese company to do so . 
In decades to come , China can no longer sustain the cost advantages that defined its initial period of export success . 
Compared to many developing countries , China &apos;s government is stable and embraces foreign investment . 
Industrial clusters have been established in many parts of the country , where business connections can compensate for rising costs . 
Domestic consumption is growing . 
Further , as low-end , low-cost labor jobs morph towards higher-end , higher-cost jobs , China will move not only into more valuable manufactured goods , but also into the service industries , such as design . 
This change , too , could give the US a difficult new run-for-its-money . 
When China &apos;s labor-intensive industries emerge from their metamorphosis , we should expect to see firms that are larger , that invest more in product innovation and design , and that hold more sway over business and trade policies . 
So &quot; Made in China &quot; is not losing international dominance yet . 
It is merely taking on a new - and possibly more formidable - shape .
