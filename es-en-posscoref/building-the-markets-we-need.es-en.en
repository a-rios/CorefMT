Building the Markets We Need 
VIENNA - The greatest challenge of the current global financial crisis is the seeming impossibility of comprehending and managing its diversity . 
Indeed , the way problems are proliferating appears almost uncontrollable . 
Plans to meet the crisis , in country after country , have been revamped and restructured time and again . 
The old models about how to understand the economy have had their day . 
Across the globe , governments are facing fundamental decisions about the future nature of their economies and societies . 
The sub-prime crisis in the early summer of 2007 developed first into a financial crisis and ultimately into a recession . 
New economic problems soon rushed in to add to the existing ones : energy and food prices rose and then fell like a yo-yo ; the dangers of climate change became ever more clear ; and the mal-distribution of global political power demanded action . 
The recent social unrest in Greece , Latvia , and Lithuania has shown that political stability is now vulnerable even in the European Union . 
Indeed , around the world , from Mexico to Indonesia and even China , the social fabric is being stretched to the point of fraying . 
This anxiety is reinforced by the general lack of funds among large groups of people who had nothing to do with creating today &apos;s crisis but are bearing the pain of it . 
These social anxieties are not being addressed because financial-sector bailouts , stimulus packages , and help for distressed industries with strong lobbies are testing many governments &quot; financial limits . 
That the advocates of unconditional privatization are now crying out for state support would be cause for cynical laughter if the danger were not as big as it is . 
For the brutal question governments must now face is this : is there an alternative to the Icelandic crash course ? 
In the past , when state economic decision-making reached such an impasse , wars and / or revolutions were the inevitable result . 
As we face the type of turning-point decisions not seen since the darkest days of the 1930 &quot; s , can we avoid such an outcome ? 
If we are to avoid the worst , fundamental change is not only necessary , but unavoidable . 
So politicians everywhere must do their duty and exercise responsible leadership . 
A combination of steely calm and bold experimentation is the only way that political and social harmony will be preserved . 
To make the European Central Bank a lender of last resort for all of the euro-zone countries , for example , would give distressed European governments some added breathing space . 
But it will require global monetary reform of a fundamental order to right the imbalances between surplus and deficit countries , between happy savers and those who lived beyond their means , and between rich and poor . 
Achieving this will not come without suffering . 
Some of those who brought the world to this perilous point with their toxic financial instruments and unscrupulous speculation may even turn out to profit from these reforms . 
So be it : a moral , and perhaps legal , reckoning must await the return of economic growth . 
As governments move into uncharted territory , they will need to question themselves constantly . 
All assumptions will need to be assessed and reassessed , starting points found and re-found , and new tools developed and perfected . 
The mechanics of the welfare state will need to be strengthened ; public policy must stop deferring to the financial sector , regardless of the need for bailout packages . 
As governments embark on their necessary and bold experiments , they must remember to take their citizens with them . 
For , unless these experiments in economic rejuvenation are transparent , they will lead to domestic political fights . 
There is a wide difference between pragmatic and opportunistic politics , and governments had better keep this distinction in mind in the months and years ahead . 
That domestic transparency and pragmatism will need to be carried over into international economic diplomacy . 
For , unless today &apos;s global imbalances are redressed , the next crash will be upon us before we have recovered from this one . 
Today &apos;s globalized markets need rules that take into account the public good in every country and region of the world . 
That much is clear . 
But the decision we are actually faced with is much more fundamental : global monetary and economic reform , or war and revolution . 
Twenty years after the world supposedly reached &quot; the end of history , &quot; we are instead at another historical turning point . 
Either we will write this history ourselves , or we will suffer through a dark era that could have been avoided .
