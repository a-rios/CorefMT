The Fate of Abe &apos;s Japan 
TOKYO - As Shinzo Abe sits down this week in Seoul with South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang , he does so as the leader of a country that many people around the world now seriously underestimate . 
That dynamic certainly will be felt during the three Northeast Asian powers &quot; first summit since 2012 . 
Three decades ago , many erred in the opposite direction in their assessments of Japan . 
Many Americans feared being overtaken after Japanese per capita income surpassed that of the United States ; 
Such views extrapolated from Japan &apos;s impressive postwar economic growth ; today , after more than two decades of malaise , they simply remind us of the danger of linear projections . 
That danger remains with us . 
In response to China &apos;s rapid rise and the assertiveness of its Communist Party leadership , the current conventional wisdom portrays Japan as a country of secondary importance - which is equally mistaken . 
Despite its economic slowdown , Japan retains impressive power resources . 
It is a democracy that has been at peace for 70 years , with a stable society and a high standard of living . 
Its per capita income is five times that of China , and Beijing residents can only envy Tokyo &apos;s air quality and product safety standards . 
Its economy remains the world &apos;s third largest overall , sustained by highly sophisticated industry . 
While China has nuclear weapons and more soldiers , Japan &apos;s military is better equipped in some areas ( and obviously has the technological capacity to develop nuclear weapons very quickly ) . 
Moreover , Japan &apos;s culture ( both traditional and popular ) , overseas development assistance , and support of international institutions are impressive sources of soft power . 
Yes , Japan faces severe demographic problems , with the population projected to shrink from 127 million to below 100 million by 2050 . 
The current birth rate is 1.4 ( well below the replacement rate of 2.1 ) , and the Japanese are resistant to accepting large numbers of immigrants . 
When Abe became Prime Minister almost three years ago , he vowed to restore Japan &apos;s standing as a &quot; first-tier country &quot; by implementing an economic stimulus package , dubbed &quot; Abenomics , &quot; and reinterpreting Japan &apos;s constitution to stiffen the country &apos;s defense posture . 
But , whereas Abenomics was enacted quickly , the Diet enacted the defense legislation only recently - and after more than a year of effort . 
Many in Abe &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party would have preferred fundamental reform of Japan &apos;s defense doctrine , by removing the constitution &apos;s limits on the country &apos;s armed forces . 
But public opinion and Abe &apos;s coalition partner , Komeito , did not allow it . 
Nonetheless , Japan &apos;s interlocutors at the Seoul summit , China and South Korea , which suffered enormously from Japanese aggression in the last century , have protested loudly . 
Both are suspicious of Abe , who exacerbated tensions with nationalist rhetoric and a visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine early in his current administration . 
Indeed , Chinese President Xi Jinping has resisted meeting with Abe , as has Park , who will do so for the first time at the Seoul summit . 
On the other hand , Abe has repaired the strained relations with the US that Japan had under his predecessors , and President Barack Obama reiterated the strength of the bilateral alliance during Abe &apos;s state visit to the White House last April . 
Under the new defense guidelines , US and Japanese forces are able to plan and exercise more effectively , and the alliance is in its best condition in decades . 
Abe has thus been relatively successful in terms of foreign and defense policy . 
But the situation on the economic front is more mixed . 
Inflation and unemployment are low , but growth is largely flat , and few experts I spoke with in Tokyo recently expect it to accelerate significantly . 
The first two components ( or &quot; arrows &quot; ) of Abenomics - loose monetary and fiscal policies - helped to restore demand . 
But the third arrow of structural reform has remained in the quiver . 
Since his success in the Diet election last year , Abe has talked about liberalizing electricity markets , improving corporate governance , and undertaking tax reform . 
In addition , he hopes to use the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to force reform of the inefficient agriculture sector . 
One important constraint is labor supply . 
Abe has proposed relaxing visa conditions for expatriate workers ; but immigration on a scale that would make a major economic difference is unlikely , given the homogeneity and insularity of Japan &apos;s traditional culture . 
The difficulty of loosening limits on immigration will require Japan to mobilize its underused female human resources . 
But that effort , too , must overcome formidable cultural obstacles . 
Abe has spoken frequently ( including at the United Nations ) about opportunities for women , and has called for women to make up 30 % of Japan &apos;s managers . 
But today they account for less than 10 % of managers and about 1 % of senior executives . 
The World Economic Forum &apos;s index of gender inequality gives Japan a low rating . 
Unless it is addressed , the labor constraint implies that Japan will not reach its full potential economically - and thus in regional and global affairs as well . 
Japan is a successful , comfortable society , which has much to contribute to the world . 
The danger is that it is so comfortable that it will look inward and prove the conventional wisdom right .
