The Inflation Puzzle 
CAMBRIDGE - The low rate of inflation in the United States is a puzzle , especially to economists who focus on the relationship between inflation and changes in the monetary base . 
After all , in the past , increases and decreases in the growth rate of the monetary base ( currency in circulation plus commercial banks &quot; reserves held at the central bank ) produced - or at least were accompanied by - rises and falls in the inflation rate . 
And , because the monetary base is controlled directly by the central bank , and is not created by commercial banks , many believe that it is the best measure of the impact of monetary policy . 
For example , the US monetary base rose at an annual rate of 9 % from 1985 to 1995 , and then slowed to 6 % in the next decade . 
This decelerating monetary growth was accompanied by a slowdown in the pace of inflation . 
The consumer price index ( CPI ) rose at a 3.5 % rate from 1985 to 1995 , and then slowed to just 2.5 % in the decade to 2005 . 
But then the link between the monetary base and the rate of inflation was severed . 
From 2005 to 2015 , the monetary base soared at an annual rate of 17.8 % , whereas the CPI increased at an annual rate of just 1.9 % . 
To explain this abrupt and radical change requires examining more closely the relationship between the monetary base and inflation , and understanding the changing role of the reserves that commercial banks hold at the Federal Reserve . 
When banks make loans , they create deposits for borrowers , who draw on these funds to make purchases . 
That generally transfers the deposits from the lending bank to another bank . 
Banks are required by law to maintain reserves at the Fed in proportion to the checkable deposits on their books . 
So an increase in reserves allows commercial banks to create more of such deposits . 
That means they can make more loans , giving borrowers more funds to spend . 
The increased spending leads to higher employment , an increase in capacity utilization , and , eventually , upward pressure on wages and prices . 
To increase commercial banks &quot; reserves , the Fed historically used open-market operations , buying Treasury bills from them . 
The banks exchanged an interest-paying Treasury bill for a reserve deposit at the Fed that historically did not earn any interest . 
That made sense only if the bank used the reserves to back up expanded lending and deposits . 
A bank that that did not need the additional reserves could of course lend them to another bank that did , earning interest at the federal funds rate on that interbank loan . 
Essentially all of the increased reserves ended up being &quot; used &quot; to support increased commercial lending . 
All of this changed in 2008 , when a legislative reform allowed the Fed to pay interest on excess reserves . 
The commercial banks could sell Treasury bills and longer-term bonds to the Fed , receive reserves in exchange , and earn a small but very safe return on those reserves . 
That gave the Fed the ability in 2010 to begin its massive monthly purchases of long-term bonds and mortgage-backed securities . 
This quantitative easing ( QE ) allowed the Fed to drive down long-term interest rates directly , leading to a rise in the stock market and to a recovery in prices of owner-occupied homes . 
The resulting rise in household wealth boosted consumer spending and revived residential construction . 
And businesses responded to this by stepping up the pace of investment . 
Although a link between the Fed &apos;s creation of reserves and the subsequent increase in spending remained , its magnitude changed dramatically . 
The Fed increased its securities holdings from less than $ 1 trillion in 2007 to more than $ 4 trillion today . 
But , rather than being used to facilitate increased commercial bank lending and deposits , the additional reserves created in this process were held at the Fed - simply the by-product of the effort , via QE , to drive down long-term interest rates and increase household wealth . 
That brings us back to the apparent puzzle of low inflation . 
The overall CPI is actually slightly lower now than it was a year ago , implying a negative inflation rate . 
A major reason is the decline in gasoline and other energy prices . 
The so-called &quot; core &quot; CPI , which excludes volatile energy and food prices , rose ( though only by 1.8 % ) . 
Moreover , the dollar &apos;s appreciation relative to other currencies has reduced import costs , putting competitive pressure on domestic firms to reduce prices . 
That is clearly reflected in the difference between the -0.2 % annual inflation rate for goods and the 2.5 % rate for services ( over the past 12 months ) . 
Nonetheless , inflation will head higher in the year ahead . 
Labor markets have tightened significantly , with the overall unemployment rate down to 5.4 % . 
As a result , total compensation per hour is rising more rapidly , with the annual rate increasing to 3.1 % in the first quarter of 2015 , from 2.5 % in 2014 as a whole and 1.1 % in 2013 . 
These higher wage costs are not showing up yet in overall inflation because of the countervailing impact of energy prices and import costs . 
But , as these temporary influences fall away in the coming year , overall price inflation will begin to increase more rapidly . 
Indeed , the inflation risk is on the upside , especially if the Fed sticks to its plan to keep its real short-term interest rate negative until the end of 2016 and to raise it to one percentage point only by the end of 2017 . 
If inflation does rise faster than the Fed expects , it may be forced to increase interest rates rapidly , with adverse effects on financial markets and potentially on the broader economy .
