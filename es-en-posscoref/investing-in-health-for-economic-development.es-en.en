Investing in Health for Economic Development 
At the UN Millennium Summit in September 2000 , 180 world leaders pledged to achieve significant advances in the well-being of the world &apos;s poor by 2015 . 
Several of the key Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) relate to health , in particular controlling epidemic diseases and reducing the death rates of mothers in childbirth and young children . 
To further the Summit &apos;s goals , Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland asked me to head a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health with the aim of charting a path for the world to achieve those MDGs in health and poverty reduction . 
Our Commission released its findings on December 20th . 
Our Commission grappled with the challenge of burgeoning epidemic diseases that are ravaging the poorest countries of the world , especially in Sub-Saharan Africa . 
Despite a considerable diversity of views at the outset of the two-year investigation , the Commission reached a strong consensus after examining extensive evidence from around the world . 
The core findings are easily summarized . 
First , the disease burden in the poorest countries constitutes a fundamental barrier to their economic advance . 
Second , millions of impoverished people die tragic deaths each year from infectious diseases that are preventable and treatable simply because they lack access to the needed health services . 
Third , using existing technologies , it would be possible to save 8 million lives per year by the end of the decade , but only if rich countries help poor countries to obtain these technologies . 
Specifically , the Commission calls for rich countries to put aside one tenth of one percent of their gross national product - or just one penny out of every ten dollars of income - on behalf of health services for the world &apos;s poor . 
Since the combined income of rich countries is around $ 25 trillion per year , this would mobilize $ 25 billion per year which , when combined with the poor countries &apos; own increased contributions , would dramatically improve the health conditions of the world &apos;s low-income countries . 
This modest contribution would save 21,000 lives daily in the poor countries . 
Moreover , the contributions to health would translate into huge economic strides . 
Improved health conditions would help the poor countries to escape from the poverty trap in which they have been stuck for the past decade : poor health has led to poverty and economic stagnation , which in turn has led to poor health . 
If the program is adopted , countries with high fertility rates and rapid population growth will move towards lower fertility rates and slower population growth as households gain confidence that their children will survive to adulthood . 
Population pressures will ease , as will the strain on fragile tropical ecosystems . 
Foreign investors will be able to invest in an African labor force no longer shattered by disease . 
The economic benefits would be more than $ 360 billion per year from 2015-2020 , many times the annual costs of increased health outlays under the program presented in the Report . 
The substantial benefits of donor aid for health have already been demonstrated . 
Unlike some types of aid , where the assistance can be funneled to offshore bank accounts , assistance for health comes in the form of drugs , diagnostic tools , and salary support for doctors and nurses . 
Smallpox was eradicated even in the most remote impoverished countries ; polio is well is on its way to eradication . 
Immunization campaigns , when properly funded , have reached huge proportions of very poor children . 
Recent efforts against African River Blindness , leprosy , and trachoma , backed by industrial leaders such as Merck , Novartis , and Pfizer , have also performed wonders . 
The main problem is that the scale of worthy efforts has been a shadow of what is needed . 
The Commission notes that R &amp; D investments directed at the diseases of the poor are likely to have enormous social returns , not only because of recent breakthroughs in science ( such as the mapping of the malaria parasite genome ) , but also because so little is currently invested in these areas . 
Malaria accounts for roughly three percent of the world &apos;s disease burden but attracts just one-sixth of one percent of global R &amp; D outlays in biomedical research , largely because most malaria victims are impoverished and therefore ignored by private industry . 
The Commission advocates a series of measures to boost R &amp; D into diseases of the poor , including donor R &amp; D outlays of roughly $ 3 billion per year , or five percent of the global total . 
The new Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , which was initiated by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan earlier this year and will begin operation in 2002 , can be a critical mechanism here . 
Programs will be conceived at the country level and will be submitted to the new fund for financial backing . 
The Commission calls on each potential recipient country to establish national-level commissions to set long-term health priorities and strategies worthy of donor backing . 
The paradox of the global economy is that rich countries are now so rich and poor countries so poor that even small contributions from the rich can perform wonders . 
A penny on ten dollars would make historic breakthroughs in health ; another penny on ten dollars could address the critical needs in education as well . 
The idea of controlling epidemic disease and cutting absolute poverty sharply by 2015 is not na√Øve idealism , but hard-headed thinking amply supported by the best evidence . 
The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health launched its Report on December 20 optimistic that the great battle against disease and poverty will now be joined in earnest .
