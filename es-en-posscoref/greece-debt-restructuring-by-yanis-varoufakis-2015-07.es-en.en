The Lethal Deferral of Greek Debt Restructuring 
ATHENS - The point of restructuring debt is to reduce the volume of new loans needed to salvage an insolvent entity . 
Creditors offer debt relief to get more value back and to extend as little new finance to the insolvent entity as possible . 
Remarkably , Greece &apos;s creditors seem unable to appreciate this sound financial principle . 
Where Greek debt is concerned , a clear pattern has emerged over the past five years . 
It remains unbroken to this day . 
In 2010 , Europe and the International Monetary Fund extended loans to the insolvent Greek state equal to 44 % of the country &apos;s GDP . 
The very mention of debt restructuring was considered inadmissible and a cause for ridiculing those of us who dared suggest its inevitability . 
In 2012 , as the debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketed , Greece &apos;s private creditors were given a significant 34 % haircut . 
At the same time , however , new loans worth 63 % of GDP were added to Greece &apos;s national debt . 
A few months later , in November , the Eurogroup ( comprising eurozone members &quot; finance ministers ) indicated that debt relief would be finalized by December 2014 , once the 2012 program was &quot; successfully &quot; completed and the Greek government &apos;s budget had attained a primary surplus ( which excludes interest payments ) . 
In 2015 , however , with the primary surplus achieved , Greece &apos;s creditors refused even to discuss debt relief . 
For five months , negotiations remained at an impasse , culminating in the July 5 referendum in Greece , in which voters overwhelmingly rejected further austerity , and the Greek government &apos;s subsequent surrender , formalized in the July 12 Euro Summit agreement . 
That agreement , which is now the blueprint for Greece &apos;s relationship with the eurozone , perpetuates the five-year-long pattern of placing debt restructuring at the end of a sorry sequence of fiscal tightening , economic contraction , and program failure . 
Indeed , the sequence of the new &quot; bailout &quot; envisaged in the July 12 agreement predictably begins with the adoption - before the end of the month - of harsh tax measures and medium-term fiscal targets equivalent to another bout of stringent austerity . 
Then comes a mid-summer negotiation of another large loan , equivalent to 48 % of GDP ( the debt-to-GDP ratio is already above 180 % ) . 
Finally , in November , at the earliest , and after the first review of the new program is completed , &quot; the Eurogroup stands ready to consider , if necessary , possible additional measures ... aiming at ensuring that gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level . &quot; 
During the negotiations to which I was a party , from January 25 to July 5 , I repeatedly suggested to our creditors a series of smart debt swaps . 
The aim was to minimize the amount of new funding required from the European Stability Mechanism and the IMF to refinance Greek debt , and to ensure that Greece would become eligible within 2015 for the European Central Bank &apos;s asset-purchase program ( quantitative easing ) , effectively restoring Greece &apos;s access to capital markets . 
We estimated that no more than â‚¬ 30 billion ( $ 33 billion , or 17 % of GDP ) of new , ESM-sourced financing would be required , none of which would be needed for the Greek state &apos;s primary budget . 
Our proposals were not rejected . 
Although we had it on good authority that they were technically rigorous and legally sound , they simply were never discussed . 
The political will of the Eurogroup was to ignore our proposals , let the negotiations fail , impose an indefinite bank holiday , and force the Greek government to acquiesce on everything - including a massive new loan that is almost triple the size we had proposed . 
Once again , Greece &apos;s creditors put the cart before the horse , by insisting that the new loan be agreed before any discussion of debt relief . 
As a result , the new loan deemed necessary grew inexorably , as in 2010 and 2012 . 
Unsustainable debt is , sooner or later , written down . 
But the precise timing and nature of that write-down makes an enormous difference for a country &apos;s economic prospects . 
And Greece is in the throes of a humanitarian crisis today because the inevitable restructuring of its debt has been used as an excuse for postponing that restructuring ad infinitum . 
As a high-ranking European Commission official once asked me : &quot; Your debt will be cut come hell or high water , so why are you expending precious political capital to insist that we deliver the restructuring now ? &quot; 
The answer ought to have been obvious . 
An ex ante debt restructuring that reduces the size of any new loans and renders the debt sustainable before any reforms are implemented stands a good chance of crowding in investment , stabilizing incomes , and setting the stage for recovery . 
In sharp contrast , a debt write-down like Greece &apos;s in 2012 , which resulted from a program &apos;s failure , only contributes to maintaining the downward spiral . 
Why do Greece &apos;s creditors refuse to move on debt restructuring before any new loans are negotiated ? 
And why do they prefer a much larger new loan package than necessary ? 
The answers to these questions cannot be found by discussing sound finance , public or private , for they reside firmly in the realm of power politics . 
Debt is creditor power ; and , as Greece has learned the hard way , unsustainable debt turns the creditor into Leviathan . 
Life under it is becoming nasty , brutish and , for many of my compatriots , short .
