Did Taxes Cause the Financial Crisis ? 
CAMBRIDGE - After the financial crisis erupted in 2008 , many observers blamed the crisis in large part on the fact that too many financial firms had loaded up on debt while relying on only a thin layer of equity . 
The reason is straightforward : whereas equity can absorb a business downturn - profits fall , but the firm does not immediately fail - debt is less forgiving , because creditors do not wait around to be paid . 
Short-term creditors cash out or refuse to roll over their loans , denying credit to financially weakened firms . 
Long-term creditors demand to be &quot; made whole &quot; and sue . 
Without cash , the firm fails . 
Financial firms in the United States pay about 34 % of their profits in taxes , and , while they can deduct interest payments to creditors from taxable income , equity is not taxed as favorably . 
Most countries have similar tax preferences for debt over equity , thereby encouraging financial and other corporations to use more debt , as financial analysts have long known . 
And yet the argument that this tax preference for debt played a role in the financial crisis - and that it remains an ongoing risk to financial stability - was quickly rejected . 
After all , the tax preference for debt has existed for a long time , and nothing heightened it before the crisis hit . 
On the contrary , if anything , the tax preference has decreased somewhat over time . 
And the crisis was quite clearly tied to the explosion in risky mortgage-backed securities in the US ; when the market abruptly realized that these securities could not be paid off in full , many systemically important financial firms were seen to be much weaker than they had seemed . 
All of this is true , but , given the possibility of a major overhaul of US corporate taxation , which President Barack Obama has proposed , we should revisit the conventional wisdom concerning the supposedly weak connection between corporate taxation and the financial crisis . 
Indeed , in my view , policymakers , academics , and the media have rejected too resolutely the idea that corporate taxation played no more than a minor role . 
To be sure , the tax preference for debt has been embedded in the economy for a long time , with no financial crises for most of that period . 
Most important , while reliance on debt made financial institutions riskier , creditors knew that , in a crisis , the government would probably bail out the largest , if not all of them . 
Government was less likely to bail out equity . 
Viewed from this perspective , it is no wonder that the question of how debt is taxed has played a small role in financial-reform packages . 
Financial institutions fell off the cliff in 2008 , it is argued , because they got too close to the edge . 
Destabilized by too much short-term debt and too much exposure to risky , overvalued , low-quality mortgage-backed securities , they tripped and fell over it . 
So regulators have focused on command-and-control orders to financial firms to increase their equity , and to reduce the riskiness of their investments . 
But consider another way of viewing the crisis and our financial institutions : the financial system was never all that far from the cliff &apos;s edge , even before 2008 , because the tax system encouraged financial firms to overload themselves with debt . 
They generally managed themselves and their risks well , so they did not fall . 
The added risks pushed the financial system past the tipping point , but the baseline problem was that it always contained too much risky debt . 
From this perspective , it becomes clear that the baseline tax-induced risks should not be ignored . 
The policy consensus has properly focused first on the new risks that were added . 
The taxation issue may go deeper . 
The tax system first encourages financial firms to use more debt than is safe , but there is a parallel effect on non-financial firms and many homeowners . 
Tax deductions for interest payments encourage them to borrow , too , an issue that has long been understood . 
Were their demand for debt lower - and , in the case of corporate debtors , were they to rely more on equity - financial institutions would face less pressure to use so much debt themselves . 
Much consideration has already been devoted to how to reform corporate taxation in a way that levels the playing field for equity relative to debt ; more than 20 years ago , the US Treasury conducted a major analysis and devised a plan to do so . 
As the Obama administration moves ahead with its new proposals , it should look back at the financial crisis , which provides strong grounds for implementing such a change .
