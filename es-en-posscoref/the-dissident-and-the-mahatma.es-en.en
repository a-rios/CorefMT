The Dissident and the Mahatma 
NEW DELHI - With the Nobel Peace Prize presented this month in the absence of this year &apos;s laureate , the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo , it might be wise to think of a man who never won the prize : Mahatma Gandhi . 
Despite that omission , there is no doubting Gandhiji &apos;s worldwide significance - including for Liu . 
The Mahatma &apos;s image now features in advertising campaigns for everything from Apple computers to Mont Blanc pens . 
When Richard Attenborough &apos;s film Gandhi swept the Oscars in 1983 , posters for the film proclaimed that &quot; Gandhi &apos;s triumph changed the world forever . &quot; 
The case for Gandhi-led global change rests principally on the American civil-rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr . , who attended a lecture on Gandhi , bought a half-dozen books about the Mahatma , and adopted satyagraha as both precept and method . 
In leading the struggle to break down segregation in the southern United States , King used non-violence more effectively than anyone else outside India . 
&quot; Hate begets hate . 
Violence begets violence , &quot; he memorably declared . 
&quot; We must meet the forces of hate with soul force . &quot; 
King later avowed that &quot; the Gandhian method of non-violent resistance ... became the guiding light of our movement . 
Christ furnished the spirit and motivation , and Gandhi furnished the method . &quot; 
Last month , Barack Obama told India &apos;s Parliament that were it not for Gandhi , he would not be standing there as America &apos;s president . 
So , yes , Gandhism helped to change America forever . 
India &apos;s independence marked the dawn of the era of decolonization , but many nations threw off the yoke of empire only after bloody and violent struggles . 
Other peoples have since fallen under the boots of invading armies , been dispossessed of their lands , or terrorized into fleeing their homes . 
Non-violence has offered no solutions to them . 
Indeed , non-violence could only work against opponents vulnerable to a loss of moral authority - that is , governments responsive to domestic and international public opinion , and thus capable of being shamed into conceding defeat . 
In Gandhi &apos;s own time , non-violence could have done nothing to prevent the slaughter of Jews in Hitler &apos;s path . 
The power of Gandhian non-violence rests in being able to say , &quot; To show you that you are wrong , I punish myself . &quot; 
Your willingness to undergo punishment merely expedites their victory . 
No wonder Nelson Mandela , who told me that Gandhi had &quot; always been a great source of inspiration , &quot; explicitly disavowed non-violence as ineffective in South Africans &quot; struggle against apartheid . 
Indeed , Gandhi can sound frighteningly unrealistic : &quot; The willing sacrifice of the innocent is the most powerful answer to insolent tyranny that has yet been conceived by God or man . Disobedience , to be &quot; civil , &quot; must be sincere , respectful , restrained , never defiant , and it must have no ill will or hatred behind it . 
Neither should there be excitement in civil disobedience , which is a preparation for mute suffering . &quot; 
For many around the world who suffer under oppressive regimes , such a credo would sound like a prescription for sainthood - or for impotence . Mute suffering is fine as a moral principle , but only Gandhi could use it to bring about meaningful change . 
The sad truth is that the staying power of organized violence is almost always greater than that of non-violence . 
Gandhi believed in &quot; weaning an opponent from error by patience , sympathy , and self-suffering . &quot; 
But , while such an approach may have won Burma &apos;s Aung San Suu Kyi the Nobel that eluded the Mahatma himself , the violence of the Burmese state proved far stronger in preventing change than her suffering has in fomenting it . 
And , as the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008 demonstrated , India today faces the threat of cross-border terrorism to which the Mahatma &apos;s only answer - a fast in protest - would have left its perpetrators unmoved . 
In his internationalism , the Mahatma expressed ideals that few can reject . 
But the decades since his death have confirmed that there is no escaping the conflicting sovereignties of states . 
Some 20 million lives have been lost in wars and insurrections since Gandhi died . 
The current stockpile of nuclear weapons represents more than a million times the explosive power of the bomb whose destruction of Hiroshima so grieved him . 
Outside India , as within it , Gandhian techniques have been perverted by terrorists and bomb-throwers who declare hunger strikes when punished for their crimes . 
Gandhism without moral authority is like Marxism without a proletariat . 
Yet too few who have tried his methods worldwide have had his personal integrity or moral stature . 
None of these misguided or cynical efforts has diluted Gandhi &apos;s greatness , or the extraordinary resonance of his life and his message . 
While the world was disintegrating into fascism , violence , and war , the Mahatma taught the virtues of truth , non-violence , and peace . 
He destroyed the credibility of colonialism by opposing principle to force . 
He was that rare kind of leader who was not confined by his followers &quot; inadequacies . 
Yet Gandhi &apos;s truth was essentially his own . 
He formulated its unique content and determined its application in a specific historical context . 
Inevitably , few in today &apos;s world can measure up to his greatness or aspire to his credo . 
The originality of Gandhi &apos;s thought and the example of his life still inspire people around the world today - as Liu Xiaobo would readily admit . 
I wonder if the Mahatma , surveying today &apos;s world , would feel that he had triumphed at all .
