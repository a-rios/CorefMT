Russia &apos;s Eurasian Vision 
NEW YORK - The escalating conflict in Ukraine between the Western-backed government and Russian-backed separatists has focused attention on a fundamental question : What are the Kremlin &apos;s long-term objectives ? 
Though Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s immediate goal may have been limited to regaining control of Crimea and retaining some influence in Ukrainian affairs , his longer-term ambition is much bolder . 
That ambition is not difficult to discern . 
Putin once famously observed that the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse was the greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century . 
Thus , his long-term objective has been to rebuild it in some form , perhaps as a supra-national union of member states like the European Union . 
This goal is not surprising : declining or not , Russia has always seen itself as a great power that should be surrounded by buffer states . 
Under the Czars , Imperial Russia extended its reach over time . 
Under the Bolsheviks , Russia built the Soviet Union and a sphere of influence that encompassed most of Central and Eastern Europe . 
While the EAU is still only a customs union , the European Union &apos;s experience suggests that a successful free-trade area leads over time to broader economic , monetary , and eventually political integration . 
Russia &apos;s goal is not to create another North American Free Trade Agreement ; it is to create another EU , with the Kremlin holding all of the real levers of power . 
The plan has been clear : Start with a customs union - initially Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan - and add most of the other former Soviet republics . 
Indeed , now Armenia and Kyrgyzstan are in play . 
Once a broad customs union is established , trade , financial , and investment links within it grow to the point that its members stabilize their exchange rates vis-Ã -vis one another . 
Then , perhaps a couple of decades after the customs union is formed , its members consider creating a true monetary union with a common currency ( the Eurasian ruble ? ) that can be used as a unit of account , means of payment , and store of value . 
As the eurozone experience proves , sustaining a monetary union requires banking , fiscal , and full economic union . 
Realizing such a plan may require overcoming serious challenges and the commitment of large financial resources over a period of many decades . 
That is why Putin put so much pressure on former President Viktor Yanukovych to abandon an association agreement with the EU . 
Recent events have further weakened market-oriented , Western-leaning factions in Russia and strengthened the state-capitalist , nationalist factions , who are now pushing for faster establishment of the EAU . 
In particular , the tension with Europe and the United States over Ukraine will shift Russia &apos;s energy and raw-material exports - and the related pipelines - toward Asia and China . 
Likewise , Russia and its BRICS partners ( Brazil , India , China , and South Africa ) are creating a development bank that is to serve as an alternative to the Western-controlled International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
Revelations of electronic surveillance by the US may lead Russia - and other illiberal states - to restrict Internet access and create their own nationally controlled data networks . 
There is even talk of Russia and China creating an alternative international payment system to replace the SWIFT system , which the US and Europe can use to impose financial sanctions against Russia . 
Creating a full EAU - one that is gradually less tied to the West by trade , financial , economic , payments , communications , and political links - may be a pipe dream . 
Russia &apos;s lack of reform and adverse demographic trends imply low potential growth and insufficient financial resources to create the fiscal and transfer union that is needed to bring other countries in . 
But Putin is ambitious , and - like other autocrats in Central Asian nations - he may remain in power for decades to come . 
And , like it or not , even a Russia that lacks the dynamism needed to succeed in manufacturing and the industries of the future will remain a commodity-producing superpower . 
Revisionist powers like Russia , China , and Iran appear ready to confront the global economic and political order that the US and the West built after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
Unfortunately , the sanctions that the US and Europe are imposing on Russia , though necessary , may merely reinforce the conviction among Putin and his nationalist Slavophile advisers that Russia &apos;s future lies not in the West , but in a separate integration project in the East . 
US President Barack Obama says that this is not the beginning of a new Cold War ; current trends may soon suggest otherwise .
