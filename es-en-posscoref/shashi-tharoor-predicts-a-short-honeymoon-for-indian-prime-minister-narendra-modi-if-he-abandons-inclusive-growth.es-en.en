Nehru &apos;s Last Stand ? 
NEW DELHI - The victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its leader , Narendra Modi , in India &apos;s general election last month has raised a crucial question about the country &apos;s future . 
With the BJP sweeping to power on a platform of aggressive nationalism and business-friendly corporatism , has the socioeconomic consensus dating to India &apos;s first prime minister , the democratic socialist Jawaharlal Nehru , come to an end ? 
The &quot; Nehruvian consensus &quot; facilitated India &apos;s democratic maturation and accommodated the country &apos;s many diverse interests , without permitting any one group or section to dominate the nascent nation-state . 
It is fashionable today to decry Nehruvian socialism as a corrupt and inefficient system that condemned India to many years of slow economic growth . 
But at its core was the conviction that in a land of extreme poverty and inequality , the objective of government policy must be to improve the welfare of the poorest , most deprived , and most marginalized . 
In Nehru &apos;s day , the best way to accomplish that was by building up structures of public ownership and state control of resources , as well as by boosting economic capacity through government intervention . 
Of course , Nehru &apos;s economic vision had its flaws , giving rise , for example , to the so-called &quot; license-permit-quota Raj , &quot; under which government control stifled entrepreneurial activity , which in turn held growth rates below those of India &apos;s Southeast Asian neighbors . 
India slowly repealed many of these burdensome regulations in the 1980s , when Nehru &apos;s grandson , Rajiv Gandhi , was in power . 
Then , following reforms initiated by his successors atop the Indian National Congress , Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh , India entered a confident new era of flourishing growth and socioeconomic dynamism . 
So what went wrong ? 
Many attribute the astonishing scale of the BJP &apos;s victory to Modi &apos;s success in tapping into the restless ( and rightful ) aspirations of India &apos;s youth after two years of a slowing economy . 
This is where critics deem the Congress party to have failed , focusing as it did on the needs of India &apos;s poorest . 
Congress can justifiably argue that it helped build on the economic structures of Nehru &apos;s day while liberating them from excessive restrictions . 
But it remains committed to an inclusive idea of development , based on social justice and greater opportunity for India &apos;s deprived and marginalized - an idea that is not always easily marketable to a youthful electorate that wants change here and now . 
Admittedly , Congress could have better communicated its values and objectives to voters ; but the BJP &apos;s historic victory mainly reflected widespread anti-incumbent sentiment after ten years of Congress rule , aided by Modi &apos;s ability to convince Indians that he is the messiah of change . 
Those who claim that the Nehruvian consensus has unraveled allege that Congress failed to read the country &apos;s mood - that Indians want economic growth , not social legislation . 
But , leaving aside the last two years , India witnessed record-high growth rates while Congress was in power . 
Our objective - supported by eminent economists , lawyers , and social activists with tremendous first-hand experience - was to distribute the fruits of this growth more equitably . 
And , though the election results might suggest otherwise , most Indians &quot; lives and living standards have improved in the last ten years . 
This was not because of &quot; doles , &quot; as critics call them , but because of more generous and effective government . 
In fact , it is precisely the social investment carried out by Congress governments that put more children in school and more people to work , while ensuring that their basic needs were met . 
The alleged handouts empowered those with the least to stand on their own feet and seek to improve their lives . 
More people could demand more from their government , which is their right , generating a wave of aspiration that the BJP caught and rode into office . 
Some predict that Congress will move further to the left economically in order to distinguish itself from the BJP , and argue that this would be counterproductive , given that voters have seemingly rejected socialist policies . 
But , in a country where most people in every electoral constituency live on less than $ 2 a day , writing off &quot; pro-poor &quot; policies would be unwise . 
Congress leaders should continue to point out that it is their policies that have enabled most Indians to reach a point at which they are better informed and more empowered to make new and different demands of their government . 
The Nehruvian emphasis on socially inclusive growth is not simple &quot; leftism &quot; ; the Congress party supports growth and led the liberalization that made growth possible . 
But we wish to see the benefits of that growth reach the weakest and poorest sections of Indian society . 
In the long run , I am certain that the Nehruvians will be rewarded for not pursuing an economic-growth model that favors a select few at the expense of everyone else . 
India must shine , but it must shine for all of its citizens . 
Unless Modi can deliver inclusive growth , his triumph will prove short-lived and the Nehruvians will return .
