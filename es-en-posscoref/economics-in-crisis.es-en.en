Economics in Crisis 
BERKELEY - The most interesting moment at a recent conference held in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire - site of the 1945 conference that created today &apos;s global economic architecture - came when Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf quizzed former United States Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , President Barack Obama &apos;s ex-assistant for economic policy . 
Here is the most interesting part of Summers &quot; long answer : &quot; There is a lot in &#91; Walter &#93; Bagehot that is about the crisis we just went through . 
There is more in &#91; Hyman &#93; Minsky , and perhaps more still in &#91; Charles &#93; Kindleberger . &quot; 
That may sound obscure to a non-economist , but it was a devastating indictment . 
Bagehot ( 1826-1877 ) was a mid-nineteenth-century editor of The Economist who published a book about financial markets , Lombard Street , in 1873 . 
Summers is certainly right : there is an awful lot in Lombard Street that is about the crisis from which we are now recovering . 
Minsky ( 1919-1996 ) is best approached not through his collected essays , entitled Can &quot; It &quot; Happen Again ? , but rather through the use Kindleberger ( 1910-2003 ) made of his work in his 1978 book Manias , Panics , and Crashes : A History of Financial Crises . 
Asked to name where to turn to understand what was going on in 2008 , Summers cited three dead men , a book written 33 years ago , and another written the century before last . 
Summers then enlarged his answer to include living economists : &quot; Eichengreen , Akerlof , Shiller , many , many others . &quot; 
He talked about &quot; the revolution in finance as it was realized that asset prices show large volatility that does not reflect anything about fundamentals , &quot; but added that &quot; macroeconomics &#91; did not &#93; keep up with &#91; this &#93; revolution . &quot; 
As a result , &quot; to the great detriment of contemporary macroeconomics , &quot; his fellow economists did not understand asset prices , manias , panics , and liquidity . 
For Summers , the problem is that there is so much that is &quot; distracting , confusing , and problem-denying in ... the first year course in most PhD programs . &quot; 
As a result , even though &quot; economics knows a fair amount , &quot; it &quot; has forgotten a fair amount that is relevant , and it has been distracted by an enormous amount . &quot; 
I think that Summers &quot; judgments are fair and correct . 
But I was shocked by how large a panic was produced by what seemed to me - and still does - relatively small losses ( in terms of the size of the global economy ) in subprime mortgages ; by the weakness of risk controls at the major highly-leveraged banks ; by how deep the decline in demand was ; by how ineffective the market &apos;s equilibrium-restoring forces have been at rebalancing labor-market supply and demand ; and by how much core-country governments have been able to borrow to support demand without triggering any run-up in interest rates . 
It is the scale of the catastrophe that astonishes me . 
&quot; We need to change our hiring patterns , &quot; I expected to hear economics departments around the world say in the wake of the crisis . 
The fact is that we need fewer efficient-markets theorists and more people who work on microstructure , limits to arbitrage , and cognitive biases . 
We need fewer equilibrium business-cycle theorists and more old-fashioned Keynesians and monetarists . 
We need more monetary historians and historians of economic thought and fewer model-builders . 
We need more Eichengreens , Shillers , Akerlofs , Reinharts , and Rogoffs - not to mention a Kindleberger , Minsky , or Bagehot . 
Yet that is not what economics departments are saying nowadays . 
Perhaps I am missing what is really going on . 
Perhaps economics departments are reorienting themselves after the Great Recession in a way similar to how they reoriented themselves in a monetarist direction after the inflation of the 1970 &quot; s . 
But if I am missing some big change that is taking place , I would like somebody to show it to me . 
As university chancellors and students demand relevance and utility , perhaps these colleagues will take over teaching how the economy works and leave academic economists in a rump discipline that merely teaches the theory of logical choice . 
Or perhaps economics will remain a discipline that forgets most of what it once knew and allows itself to be continually distracted , confused , and in denial . 
If that were that to happen , we would all be worse off .
