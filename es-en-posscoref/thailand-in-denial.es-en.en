Thailand in Denial 
BANGKOK - Thailand &apos;s political and social fabric is fraying . 
Indeed , the country &apos;s future looks as shaky as it has never been . 
In other prosperous democracies , the middle class provides the glue that holds society together . 
In Thailand , by contrast , the bourgeoisie , centered in Bangkok , is barely emerging as a social and political force . 
Instead , for a half-century , an unspoken social contract among four broad groups has held Thailand together : the &quot; Palace &quot; - a euphemism used here to avoid violating draconian lèse majesté laws ; big business , the custodian of economic growth ; the military , which ensures , first and foremost , the sanctity of the Palace and the moral values it represents ; and the common people , mostly rural and urban poor , who accept the rule of the other three estates . 
Thailand &apos;s national mythology is that it is a happy Buddhist country , a &quot; land of smiles &quot; bound together by compassion and harmony under the benevolent grace and blessings of the Palace and the generosity of big business . 
The less fortunate classes are docile , content to accept their subservient roles and satisfied with the social welfare , no matter how skimpy , provided by their betters . 
The poor and the military hold the Palace in genuine reverence . 
Palace staff and people in the countryside kneel before the monarchy not merely as a matter of protocol , but out of genuine love and respect . 
Forbes magazine ranked the Thai monarchy in 2009 as the richest of all the world &apos;s royals , putting its net worth at $ 30 billion - a figure that locals consider too low . 
That royal wealth necessarily entails substantial investments in and with Thai big business in all sectors of the economy . 
Thailand &apos;s blue-chip firms gain much from direct involvement with the Palace and from social proximity to it . 
One Hong Kong scion whose wife is from an elite Thai family estimates that perhaps 20 families control most of Thai business . 
The Thai military is constitutionally subordinate to civilian leadership , but in reality it owes its allegiance to the Palace . 
In the current crisis , army generals have told the public that they are reluctant to use force , a position that was not theirs to take . 
How long this inactivity will last is anyone &apos;s guess . 
Mobs wearing red shirts to symbolize their loyalty to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra are now camped out in two major commercial areas , paralyzing a large part of the local economy . 
They demand that the government dissolve the current legislature immediately , and that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva resign because he was never elected and is viewed as a front man for the traditional anti-Thaksin monied groups . 
Many believe that the current crisis will pass , and that Thailand will revert to its historical harmony among the four groups . 
First and foremost , Thailand &apos;s lower classes have decided that docility is a thing of the past . 
They are angry and frustrated by the status quo . 
Save for the handouts they got under Thaksin , they benefited little from the economic growth of the past three decades . 
The vast gap between the urban rich and the rest has grown worse over the years , with no discernible &quot; trickle-down &quot; effect . 
Even in the prime commercial districts and chic neighborhoods of Bangkok , the nation &apos;s richest city , a short walk reveals miles of cracked pavements , piles of uncollected garbage , and rats scurrying freely . 
Such wrenching sights are typically accompanied by the pungent odor of a sewage system that is more a problem than a solution , especially during the rainy season . 
The sight of run-down physical infrastructure , punctuated by super-modern shopping malls with global consumer brand names well beyond the purchasing power of most citizens , is not what you would expect in an economy once described as a potential Asian Dragon . 
The wealthy dwell in air-conditioned houses , travel in chauffeur-driven cars , and shop in luxury malls , apparently oblivious to how the rest of the country lives . 
Poor rural families see too many of their children become prostitutes in order to survive . 
The poor view the coup against Thaksin of 2006 , and the later disbanding of his party , as revenge by the traditional elites who wanted the old ways back , and who would get what they wanted by force since they could no longer get it through the ballot box . 
It is a view that is not entirely wrong . 
In late 2008 , anti-Thaksin mobs wearing yellow shirts and led by prominent business figures occupied Bangkok &apos;s Suvarnabhumi International Airport with impunity , seeking to annul the result of a general election in which pro-Thaksin forces gained power , despite Thaksin &apos;s exile overseas . 
Yellow is the color of Thai royalty , and the Palace was believed to be sympathetic to the mobs . 
Now Thaksin loyalists - the &quot; red shirts &quot; - are doing much the same , demanding change through mob behavior . 
They believe that they , too , are entitled to act with impunity . 
The red shirts are not blind to Thaksin &apos;s excessive corruption . 
Moreover , as prime minister , Thaksin made a point of delivering much-needed services to the underclasses : subsidized medical care and micro-loans to name just two . 
But the unspoken issue behind Thailand &apos;s unrest is that , with the country &apos;s 82-year-old king ailing , the Palace &apos;s moral force has come into question . 
Indeed , Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Pirmoya , breaking taboos that have governed the country for years , recently spoke about the need to re-examine the country &apos;s lèse majesté laws so that public discourse could intelligently address the role of the Palace in Thailand &apos;s future . 
What Thaksin did for the poor required only political self-interest . 
Yet even that elementary wisdom has never occurred to traditional ruling elites too set in their myopic and arrogant ways . 
Until it does , Thailand &apos;s otherwise promising future will be increasingly remote .
