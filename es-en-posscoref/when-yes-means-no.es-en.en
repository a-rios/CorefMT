When Yes Means No 
Most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU . 
But there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom . 
The French referendum will determine the political fate of French President Jacques Chirac - not France &apos;s commitment to Europe , which is fixed and immutable . 
If the French vote No , M. Chirac is finished . 
If they vote Yes , he is re-empowered . 
Europe clearly would be better off with Chirac weakened than strengthened , even if it means a temporary slowing of the pace of integration . 
Chirac practices the politics of &quot; scapegoatism &quot; and excuses . 
According to Chirac , France &apos;s exports are lagging not because France is losing its international competitiveness - although it is , especially to Germany - but because of the strong euro . 
Likewise , France &apos;s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms , but because European interest rates are too high . 
Who does Chirac think is at fault ? 
The European Central Bank , of course , for allowing the euro to appreciate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough . 
Unfortunately , this is typical of Chirac &apos;s leadership style : blame others , excuse yourself , and ignore reform . 
This is hardly the type of leadership Europe needs to survive and prosper in the modern world . 
But Europe will get more of it if the French vote Yes . 
Europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries , with the small countries in the back of the bus . 
The fate of the Franco-German axis , in particular , hinges on the outcome of the referendum . 
A Yes invigorates the axis ; a No weakens it . 
&quot; Who would follow Chirac if the French vote No ? &quot; asked one EU ambassador in a recent interview . 
&quot; Even Berlin has options . &quot; 
But Berlin would not like a No vote . 
If Chirac goes down , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses face as well . 
Two birds would be wounded with one stone . 
The prospect of a re-energized Franco-German axis is why the Dutch - who are traditionally pro-European but do not want a Europe that marginalizes small countries - might vote No in their referendum ( which follows shortly upon France &apos;s ) if the French vote Yes . 
A Dutch No would signal rejection of a corporatist Europe dominated by French and German interests , as well as representing a protest against the unpopular conservative and moralistic policies of the Balkenende government . 
France is not the only EU country with an unpopular leader . 
Eastern Europe also has a big stake in the outcome of the French referendum . 
Chirac made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to &quot; shut up &quot; when they disagreed with him over Iraq . 
More recently , Chirac &apos;s foreign minister , Michel Barnier , chastised the Romanian President Traian Barescu for lacking a &quot; European reflex , &quot; because Barescu plans to align Romania with Anglo-Saxon liberal economic policies , and wants a special relationship with the US and UK to improve security in the Black Sea region . 
Rather than buckle to France &apos;s will , however , the Romanian president warned France &apos;s leaders to stop lecturing his country - a sure sign that French influence is on the wane even in countries with which it has had close historical ties . 
A French No would sit well with the Union &apos;s newer members from Eastern Europe , who know Chirac is not their friend , and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief . 
Finally , the referendum contains an unstated question about the future of European Monetary Union ( EMU ) and the euro . 
The Yes camp argues that rejecting the Constitution would damage the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the euro . 
But why would the EU fall into chaos and the euro wilt if the Treaty of Nice remains in force . 
In the area of monetary integration , the European Constitution doesn &apos;t change anything , other than the voting procedures in the Governing Council if EMU grows beyond 15 member countries . 
A Yes vote , on the other hand , would encourage a reassured Chirac to continue his policy of no reform and scapegoating the ECB . 
External political pressure on the ECB and its president , Jean-Claude Trichet , to lower interest rates and talk the euro down surely would increase . 
This is more likely to bring the euro down than a No vote .
