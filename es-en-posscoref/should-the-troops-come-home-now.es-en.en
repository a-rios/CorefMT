Should the Troops Come Home Now ? 
Last weekend &apos;s announcement that Iraqi lawmakers have finally formed a unity government is welcome news , both for Iraq and for George W. Bush and Tony Blair . 
The American and British governments , increasingly unpopular at home , desperately needed some tangible evidence of progress to assuage their domestic critics and to begin to speak openly of an exit strategy . 
But Iraq &apos;s greatest challenges lie ahead . 
If Bush and Blair declare victory before the real battles have begun , they will undermine the very process to which both have committed so much at such great cost . 
Bush waited weeks for a positive development that would allow him to suggest he can reduce troop levels in Iraq from 133,000 to 100,000 by the end of 2006 . 
Blair , still stung by his Labour Party &apos;s defeat in local elections in early May , also welcomed the good news from Iraq . 
During a triumphal surprise visit to Baghdad on May 22 , he said he expected Iraqi forces to take responsibility for &quot; territorial security &quot; in much of the country by the end of the year . 
&quot; It is the violence that keeps us here , &quot; he said . 
&quot; It is the peace that allows us to go . &quot; 
The optimism is premature . 
The formation of a unity government is only the first of many hurdles Iraq &apos;s new government must clear if it is to build a durable peace . 
Its first task will be to remove those provisions of Iraq &apos;s constitution that pit Iraq &apos;s Sunni , Shia , and Kurds against one another . 
Under current Iraqi law , the parliamentary committee charged with making these constitutional changes has four months to complete its task . 
The four-month clock began ticking on May 3 , following the first meeting of Iraq &apos;s new parliament . 
The changes are badly needed . 
The committee must enact a new hydrocarbon law that guarantees each of Iraq &apos;s factions a fair share of the country &apos;s oil wealth , which accounts for 97 % of total export revenue . 
Under the current constitution , local governments have the right to exploit ( and profit directly from ) oil extracted from new sites beneath their territory , while only a share of the income from existing sites must go to Iraq &apos;s central government . 
On May 15 , two small independent energy companies ( Turkey &apos;s Genel Enerji and Canada &apos;s Addax Petroleum ) became the latest foreign firms to begin drilling in Kurdish-controlled territory under an agreement with the regional government . 
Kurdish politicians within the new parliament have good reason to protect these lucrative deals as debate begins over constitutional changes . 
But the central government will need a large share of that income if it is to finance the construction of new institutions of governance , invest in critical infrastructure , undertake onerous reforms aimed at economic liberalization , and provide the resource-poor ( and already restive ) Sunnis of central Iraq with a greater share of the country &apos;s wealth . 
The constitution must also be amended to reverse the worst effects of a de-Baathification process that aimed to dismantle the vestiges of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime . 
In practice , de-Baathification has excluded thousands of Iraqis - most of them Sunnis who joined the party during the Saddam era only to secure good jobs - from the country &apos;s political and economic life . 
Finally , the Iraqi government must begin dismantling the militia groups that still outgun the fledgling Iraqi army , and it must defeat the largely Sunni-led insurgency . 
Each of these tasks is formidable . 
If Bush and Blair prematurely withdraw large numbers of the troops that support Iraqi stability , the country &apos;s new government would have little chance of success . 
There is some reason for optimism that efforts to stem the tide of violence can succeed . 
Media reports of Iraqi bloodshed focus overwhelmingly on Baghdad - where the large majority of foreign journalists are based - creating the impression that the desperate security situation there is representative of the country as a whole . 
But in the Kurdish-controlled areas of the north and Shiite-dominated provinces in the south , levels of crime and deadly violence compare favorably with those in many cities in the United States . 
But attacks in Iraq &apos;s &quot; Sunni triangle &quot; ( and Baghdad in particular ) occur at a rate rivaling those in Chechnya and the Niger Delta . 
Since Sunni militants destroyed the Shiite Askariya mosque in February , hundreds of Iraqis have been killed in a series of tit-for-tat sectarian attacks . 
Tens of thousands have fled from mixed Sunni-Shiite cities to safer havens in ethnically homogenous enclaves that are effectively controlled by Sunni and Shiite militias . 
Only the presence of foreign troops slows the further balkanization of the country &apos;s already fractious politics . 
That &apos;s why the temptation for Bush and Blair to limit further political damage at home by prematurely declaring victory in Iraq is so dangerous . 
If they use the good news to begin withdrawing significant numbers of the foreign troops who bolster Iraq &apos;s stability at a crucial and vulnerable moment , they will have undermined the project to which both have devoted so much political capital . 
And they will leave the new Iraqi government at the mercy of forces that would eventually pull the country apart .
