The French Death Rattle 
PARIS - Moody &apos;s announcement in November that it had downgraded France &apos;s sovereign-credit rating by one notch from its AAA rating prompted one blogger to poke fun at rating agencies &quot; tendency either to get things completely wrong or to recognize suddenly a crisis that had long been staring them in the face . 
The blogger joked , &quot; If this recognition by a rating agency that France has problems is an example of the first failing , a recovery must have begun ; if it is an example of the second failing , the country faces a dire reckoning . &quot; 
French President François Hollande &apos;s government claims to have awoken to the threat . 
In a recent interview , Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici likened the measures being undertaken to reduce the country &apos;s debt burden and restore competitiveness to a &quot; Copernican revolution ... because these choices were not clear for a French government or for a center-left government . &quot; 
As proof of this new realism , the government has been trumpeting its response to the set of policy recommendations that an expert panel led by the business executive Louis Gallois presented two weeks before the downgrade . 
The response is centered on a payroll-tax cut , which will be offset by spending cuts and a higher value-added tax . 
In the run-up to the downgrade , an analyst at Moody &apos;s said that the decision would be based largely on whether the government heeded the Gallois report &apos;s call for a &quot; competitiveness shock &quot; to France &apos;s economy . 
The downgrade thus suggests that Moody &apos;s considered the government &apos;s response insufficient . 
In fact , this negative verdict barely scratches the surface of France &apos;s predicament . 
The full picture emerges only after examining the motivations behind the government &apos;s inadequate response . 
The underlying explanation lies in the culture and prejudices of France &apos;s governing elite , the so-called grands commis formed by the National Civil Service School of which Hollande - like virtually all of his predecessors , except Nicolas Sarkozy - is an alumnus . 
In this cloistered world , a prosperous and just society requires a state-directed economy . 
This dedication to dirigisme has spawned among the ruling elite a sense of entitlement and hostility to business . 
Indeed , for France &apos;s political leaders , business amounts to a zero-sum competition to capture a higher share of total value added for owners and managers , at the expense of labor . 
Criticism of this anti-business approach is usually dismissed in France as &quot; ultra-liberal &quot; flailing against the &quot; social model &quot; that the French nation has embraced . 
But the example set by Scandinavian countries , which combine a generous welfare state with pro-business policies and traditions , repudiates such claims . 
The main difference between the failing French model and the more successful Scandinavian approach lies not in welfare &quot; outputs &quot; ( many public services in France , such as the health-care system , remain among the best in the world ) , but in how they are financed . 
The Scandinavian social compact rests on the understanding that citizens must pay high taxes in exchange for public services . 
While French public spending - which stood at 56 % of GDP in 2011 - is at or above Scandinavian levels , French households pay lower tax rates on consumption and personal income . 
The gap is bridged by a mixture of deficit spending and high taxation on employment . 
Relentless government borrowing and high payroll taxes ( employer-paid social security ) have long sustained citizens &quot; illusion that they are getting something for nothing , while perpetuating successive governments &quot; misconception that taxing business is a painless way of financing welfare and public services . 
But it is increasingly apparent that this approach has undermined public finances and competitiveness - and that households end up picking up the tab . 
( In fact , chronically high unemployment has meant that they have been doing so for years . ) 
Now , citizens are facing higher taxes and cuts to public services . 
Defenders of the French system quibble over labor-cost statistics in their efforts to prove that France is not so different from its main European trading partners . 
But the facts of the last decade - including a significant loss of export-market share and a 5 % -of-GDP deterioration in the current-account balance - paint a different picture . 
Moreover , this line of defense misses the point . 
The burden of payroll taxes , together with overweening labor-market regulation , stifles entrepreneurship . 
If Hollande &apos;s tax hikes - on income ( including a temporary 75 % tax rate for the country &apos;s wealthiest households ) , dividends , capital gains , and capital assets - are not enough to deter entrepreneurs , the cost of hiring workers and the difficulty of firing them remain powerful disincentives . 
Far from signifying a pro-business shift , Hollande &apos;s government &apos;s response to the Gallois report reflects the French elite &apos;s enduring interventionist mentality . 
Instead of implementing deep and permanent cuts in payroll taxes on businesses , the government will give companies a € 20 billion ( $ 26 billion ) income-tax credit over the next two years . 
And , with companies required to apply the rebated cash to investment and job creation , the government has portrayed the measure as a cut in taxes on labor that will boost employment . 
Furthermore , companies will not receive the cash until 2014-2015 , owing to the complexity of France &apos;s tax administration . 
And , when they do get it , the state cannot possibly know that reinvesting in the same enterprise will be more beneficial than , say , paying out dividends that shareholders could then use to finance a new venture . 
Once again , French lawmakers are acting on the conviction that they know better than market participants . 
Apart from promises to reduce employment regulation , all of the new measures boil down to officials directing state money and subsidies to companies and projects of their choosing . 
So the death rattle of the French economic model continues . 
What remains to be seen is how the end will come . 
And , whether it comes in the form of a capital strike by foreign bondholders , or of domestic labor strikes and wider social and political unrest , France &apos;s leaders remain entirely unprepared for the inevitable .
