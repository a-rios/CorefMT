Valuing the United Nations 
MELBOURNE - There is nothing like exposure to smart and idealistic young people to make jaded and world-weary policymakers and commentators feel better about the future . 
I have just had that experience meeting delegates to the 22nd World Model United Nations Conference , which brought together in Australia more than 2,000 students from every continent and major culture to debate peace , development , and human rights , and the role of the UN in securing them . 
What impressed me most is how passionately this generation of future leaders felt about the relevance and capacity of the UN system . 
They are right : the UN can deliver when it comes to national security , human security , and human dignity . 
But , as I told them , they have a big task of persuasion ahead of them . 
No organization in the world embodies as many dreams , yet provides so many frustrations , as the United Nations . 
For most of its history , the Security Council has been the prisoner of great-power maneuvering ; the General Assembly a theater of empty rhetoric ; the Economic and Social Council a largely dysfunctional irrelevance ; and the Secretariat , for all the dedication and brilliance of a host of individuals , alarmingly inefficient . 
My own efforts to advance the cause of UN reform when I was Australia &apos;s foreign minister were about as quixotic and unproductive as anything I have ever tried to do . 
Overhauling Secretariat structures and processes to reduce duplication , waste , and irrelevance ? 
Forget it . 
Changing the composition of the Security Council to ensure that it began to reflect the world of the twenty-first century , not that of the 1950 &quot; s ? 
No way . 
But I have also had some exhilarating experiences of the UN at its best . 
The peace plan for Cambodia in the early 1990 &quot; s , for example , dragged the country back from hellish decades of horrifying genocide and ugly and protracted civil war . 
Likewise , the Chemical Weapons Convention , steered through the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , is still the most robust arms-control treaty related to weapons of mass destruction ever negotiated . 
Perhaps one experience stands out above all . 
In 2005 , on the UN &apos;s 60th anniversary , the General Assembly , convening at head of state and government level , unanimously endorsed the concept of states &quot; responsibility to protect populations at risk of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes . 
With that vote , the international community began to eradicate the shameful indifference that accompanied the Holocaust , Rwanda , Srebrenica , Darfur , and too many similar catastrophes . 
What needs to be better understood publicly is just how many different roles the UN plays . 
The various departments , programs , organs , and agencies within the UN system address a broad spectrum of issues , from peace and security between and within states to human rights , health , education , poverty alleviation , disaster relief , refugee protection , trafficking of people and drugs , heritage protection , climate change and the environment , and much else . 
What is least appreciated of all is how cost-effectively these agencies - for all their limitations - perform overall , in both absolute and comparative terms . 
The UN &apos;s core functions - leaving aside peacekeeping missions but including its operations at its New York headquarters ; at offices in Geneva , Vienna , and Nairobi ; and at the five regional commissions around the world - now employ 44,000 people at a cost of around $ 2.5 billion a year . 
That might sound like a lot , but the Tokyo Fire Department spends about the same amount each year , and the Australian Department of Human Services spends $ 3 billion more ( with less staff ) . 
And that &apos;s just two departments in two of the UN &apos;s 193 member states . 
Even including related programs and organs ( like the UN Development Program and the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ) , as well as peacekeeping activities ( which involve more than 110,000 international military , police , and civilian personnel ) , the UN system &apos;s total cost is still only around $ 30 billion a year . 
Wall Street employees received more in annual bonuses ( $ 33.2 billion ) in 2007 , the year before the global financial meltdown . 
The whole family of the UN Secretariat and related entities , together with current peacekeepers , adds up to around 215,000 people worldwide - not a small number , but less than one-eighth of the roughly 1.8 million staff employed by McDonald &apos;s and its franchisees worldwide ! 
The bottom line , as the youngsters gathered in Melbourne fully understood , is that the UN provides fabulous value for what the world spends on it , and that if it ever ceased to exist , we would have to reinvent it . 
The downsides are real , but we need to remember the immortal words of Dag Hammarskjold , the UN &apos;s second secretary-general : &quot; The UN was created not to bring us to heaven , but to save us from hell . &quot;
