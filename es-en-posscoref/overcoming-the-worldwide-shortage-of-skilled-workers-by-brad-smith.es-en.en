Closing the Global Opportunity Gap 
SEATTLE - We stand in the midst of a global economic tragedy . 
Around the world , new job opportunities are being created that offer the promise of prosperity . 
Unless current trends are reversed , this opportunity gap will deepen , creating even greater income disparities and stifling economic recovery worldwide . 
To avoid this outcome , it is critical that business and governments around the world agree now on a strategy for improving educational opportunities , training , and global mobility for the next generation of workers . 
It is estimated that 600 million jobs worldwide will need to be created over the next decade to make up for jobs lost in the recent economic crisis . 
Many of these new jobs will come from sectors in which advances in science , engineering , and technology continue to drive innovation and growth . 
Between 2009 and 2013 , the IT industry will help to create more than 75,000 new businesses and 5.8 million new jobs worldwide . 
But , as job growth accelerates in industries requiring high-skilled workers , we are creating a global market for talent that remains largely vacant . 
For example , according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics , the US this year will create some 120,000 new jobs requiring at least a bachelor &apos;s degree in computer science . 
But all of America &apos;s colleges and universities put together will produce only 40,000 qualified graduates . 
This gap between supply and demand is not unique to the US . 
In Brazil , the world &apos;s sixth-largest economy , more than 40 % of businesses cannot find qualified staff . 
Recent reports by McKinsey 
Company detail how this skills gap - with a projected deficit of up to 40 million college-educated workers by 2020 - will suppress economic growth worldwide . 
As businesses and governments consider how to respond to these changes in the dynamics of the world labor market , nothing less than the future of our youth is at stake . 
Young people comprise the world &apos;s largest pool of untapped talent ; yet , in a world full of opportunities , far too many lack access to the right education and skills training needed to realize their potential . 
More than 2.2 billion people today are between the ages of six and 24 - more than ever before - and this cohort is expected to continue growing . 
But the global youth unemployment rate is 12.7 % - double the overall rate of 6 % . 
In the European Union alone , the youth unemployment rate has reached a staggering 22 % , and in some countries is topping out at roughly 50 % ; according to some reports , 75 million young people are currently experiencing unemployment , underemployment , or stagnating wages . 
It is clear that if change does not happen soon , this opportunity gap will continue to widen , causing both a humanitarian and an economic crisis that will hit citizens , businesses , and governments worldwide . 
Redressing the imbalance between the supply of and demand for skilled workers globally requires a unified agenda of the right education , training , and immigration policies . 
Building a global workforce that can drive economic growth and reduce long-term unemployment can be achieved only by equipping and empowering workers with the right skills . 
This will require a substantial investment in education and workforce training , a focus of the most recent McKinsey report detailing the importance of skill development and connecting education to employment . 
While this investment will pay off in time , countries need to match skilled workers to today &apos;s open jobs in order to preserve their economies &quot; vitality . 
That is why educational investments to improve future opportunities must be paired with progressive immigration policies that facilitate inflows of the skilled workers needed to address today &apos;s talent shortages . 
These are not just problems for governments to solve . 
Global corporations play a crucial role not only in creating the jobs that will turn our economies around , but also in creating opportunities for people to become part of that skilled workforce . 
We believe that by bringing workers , businesses , and governments together with a united approach to change , we can build a healthier world economy and improve the lives of current and future generations . 
If global leaders can come together to address the challenges and opportunities facing our economies today , we can strengthen our ability to cultivate global and sustainable talent pipelines . 
Microsoft has proposed a National Talent Strategy for the US , which could be the foundation for a global discussion . 
The strategy includes increasing global talent mobility through expanded US visa programs in so-called STEM fields ( science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ) ; broadening access to computer science at the secondary-education level ; and increasing STEM teacher training and degree programs to equip future generations to meet the needs of a changing labor market . 
There are no doubt other ideas and strategies that can contribute to this important discussion . 
But making the right decisions requires asking tough questions , seeking collectively to understand which changes are needed , and committing ourselves to achieving them . 
What role should governments , NGOs , and businesses each play in creating the educational opportunities needed to equip future generations ? 
Are we focusing enough on STEM fields in our education systems , and , if not , how can we strengthen those disciplines ? 
Which immigration policies best facilitate economic growth ? 
This year &apos;s discussions at the World Economic Forum provide an important opportunity to address these critical issues with global leaders . 
The time for a global talent strategy - for the benefit of all - is now .
