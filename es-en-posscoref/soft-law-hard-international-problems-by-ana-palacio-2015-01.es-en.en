The Erosion of Law 
MADRID - In assessments of global events and trends in 2014 , words like chaos , disorder , and fragmentation are likely to feature prominently . 
But the word &quot; soft &quot; should also appear . 
Indeed , 2014 was characterized by the continued rise of &quot; soft &quot; instruments to address global challenges : pledges , decrees , self-regulation , joint plans of action , and handshake deals . 
Are the days of organizing international relations according to traditional , formal law over ? 
To be sure , this shift toward &quot; soft &quot; law is also occurring in domestic contexts . 
In the United States , President Barack Obama used his executive power to sidestep Congress on immigration reform . 
At the supranational level , the new European Commission is pursuing its goal of &quot; better regulation &quot; using as little formal lawmaking as possible , focusing instead on recommendations , codes of conduct , and guidelines . 
But the erosion of traditional law remains most pronounced in the international arena . 
The G-20 &quot; s decisions have become increasingly informal , while rule-making authority has been outsourced to private regulatory bodies , such as the Basel Committee and the International Accounting Standards Board . 
Moreover , a growing number of arrangements are being introduced with little or no built-in enforcement . 
November &apos;s much-celebrated climate agreement between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping , and the interim &quot; joint plan of action &quot; between Iran and its international interlocutors on the country &apos;s nuclear program ( essentially two unilateral statements linked by a press release ) , are but two recent examples . 
Such agreements may be positive developments , but they are no substitute for official , enforceable international rules of conduct . 
And states , despite their reticence to be formally bound by preset terms , recognize this . 
From trade regulations and nuclear non-proliferation to climate action and maritime boundaries , there is a yearning for the clarity and certainty that only &quot; hard &quot; law can provide . 
So what is preventing the international community from making firm rules ? 
The protracted travails of the Doha Round of World Trade talks offer some clues . 
One key problem is the rapid rise in the number of actors . 
It is simply more difficult for 193 states to reach agreement than it was for the original 51 signatories of the post-World War II conventions that established the contemporary international order . 
This challenge is rooted in two developments : the post-colonial and post-Soviet proliferation of states , and the disaggregation and erosion of state sovereignty . 
Crafting agreements is no longer the job of only foreign ministers or heads of state ; it now must involve civil society , experts , international organizations , and the private sector - each of which has its own agenda . 
This may enrich negotiations ; but it also complicates and prolongs the process considerably . 
In this context , ensuring that formal rule-making remains a viable option internationally will require some adjustments . 
One potential solution would be for regional representatives to be empowered to negotiate on behalf of groups of states . 
Another would be to work from treaties involving fewer actors to build broader agreements . 
In international trade , for example , mega-regional deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership could serve as de facto standard setters , helping to facilitate a global agreement . 
Likewise , a binding and enforceable deal on Iran &apos;s nuclear program could encourage progress at this spring &apos;s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference toward instituting firm commitments to implement the action items agreed upon at the 2010 round - in particular , establishing a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East . 
Unless non-proliferation deals are infused with traditional legality , they will remain inadequate to achieve their goal of making the world a safer place . 
This year will offer one more critical opportunity to reestablish hard legality in international negotiations : the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December . 
It is widely believed that the conference may well represent the world &apos;s last chance to limit the global temperature increase to 2ยบ Celsius over pre-industrial levels - the threshold beyond which the risks of climate change become particularly daunting . 
To succeed , the Paris conference can look nothing like the disastrous meeting held in Copenhagen six years ago . 
And the negotiating parties must move beyond the soft &quot; intended nationally determined contributions , &quot; agreed to last month in Lima , to establish legally binding commitments . 
Such a result would be a boon not just for efforts to limit climate change , but also for addressing other global challenges . 
A firm , enforceable climate-change deal would show that , as difficult as it is to reach a hard-law agreement nowadays , it is possible . 
Indeed , world leaders should not settle for less . 
More flexible approaches to international negotiations may have facilitated &quot; landmark &quot; deals in 2014 . 
But without strong compliance mechanisms , such agreements could amount to little . 
Finding ways to adapt formal legal processes to today &apos;s complex global environment is a key challenge for 2015 . 
World leaders need a success story to get them motivated .
