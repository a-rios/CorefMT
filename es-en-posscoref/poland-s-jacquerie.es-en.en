Poland \ u0027s Jacquerie 
&quot; Bless ... the peasant who is born , eats , and dies without anyone bothering about his affairs . &quot; 
So wrote that some-time Italian journalist best known for his musical compositions , Giuseppe Verdi . 
What Verdi believed was possible in the 19 th century and the thousand years that preceded it , but is no longer . 
Indeed , the opposite is more likely . 
In Poland , for example , peasants not only want to shout news of their affairs to the world , but they want to shape Poland in their own image . 
In his The Age of Extremes , Eric Hobsbawm argued that the greatest change in the West in the 20 th century was the vast reduction in the number of people employed as farmers . 
Everywhere you look peasants have almost disappeared . 
Not here in Eastern Europe . 
Soviet-style economies may have posed as avatars of industrial modernization , but in most of the USSR &apos;s former satellite states Marxist-Leninist economics locked vast numbers of people onto farms . 
Today , this reserve army of peasants is creating the most serious political conflicts seen in Poland since communism &apos;s fall as the country seeks membership in the European Union . 
Most people in most societies feel something mystical about rural land and the people who work it . 
But in the Western world too much land is agricultural , so there is surplus food production . 
People recognize this , but still find the gradual disappearance of peasants troubling . 
Poland &apos;s peasants , who gained a glimpse of the wider world since 1989 , see what is going on and fear it . 
As 38 % of Poland &apos;s people live in villages or work on farms , this poses a serious political problem . 
No imaginable solution to their plight seems available . 
Like everyone else , our peasants vote their fears and choose as their representatives the peasant parties who think that political stalemate is the only way to preserve Poland &apos;s rural way of life . 
No EU membership ; no more privatization ; no pension reform . 
Standstill . 
Mysticism about the land plays into their hands . 
Many Poles believe that they should not sell their land to foreigners , because Poland &apos;s identity is somehow buried within its poor soil . 
Given the history , it is no surprise that Poles do not want to sell to Germans , and luckily few Germans are interested . 
But there is interest in the Netherlands , and some Poles bizarrely suspect the Dutch of wanting to take over the country . 
Fear of speculators , of people who want to sell Poland piece-by-piece , are rampant . 
Pure nonsense , of course . 
There are few buyers because Polish land is too poor . 
Yet everyone thinks that the country &apos;s independence will be lost in an instant when farms can be sold to other Europeans , a condition of EU membership . 
With communism discredited and Catholicism waning , the connection - mental , psychological , even spiritual - of the land with defense of the fatherland , appears to be Poland &apos;s last political certainty . 
After 1989 Poles ( as happened in other postcommunist countries ) gained freedom but lost their national identity , which had been constructed on the revulsion they felt towards their oppressors . 
You can deplore such social feelings , as I do , but the myth of the Polish peasant hero standing against communist collectivization on his small private plot seems ineradicable , even if it is undeserved . 
In reality , the peasants were not much help in the Solidarity era and they now constitute the main obstacle to modernization . 
Besides , heroes are no longer needed here . 
The sad thing about the power that Poland &apos;s peasants now exert is that theirs is a wholly negative one . 
Poles , who lost nearly all their patriotic ideas over the past decade , now seem poised to rediscover their national identity solely on a negative basis forged by our peasants . 
The European Union wants to steal ( or buy for nothing ) our land , they say . 
We Poles must fight them . 
If national pride demands eternal Polish ownership of Polish land , and thus scuttles membership in the EU , Poland will be condemned to a future as a kind of a gigantic museum of the peasantry . 
One horse carriages . 
A lone cow standing in a meadow . 
Pigs eating greedily from the family table . 
Cottages with TV satellite antennas may be seen , but they will be surrounded by straw , mud , chopped wood and the aromatic stench of livestock . 
Then , instead of buying Polish farms and modernizing them , Dutch and Germans and Danes and others will visit the farms as a type of rural Disneyland , a place where you see what the long-ago past was like . 
They will come , give some money to quaint and slightly lunatic looking farmers ploughing behind their mules , and they will leave . 
It may annoy the Polish to recognize this , but if they make such a choice they will be condemned to a perpetual third rate status , scarcely above the most wretched places on earth and without any illusion of progress . 
Verdi at least offered his peasants that illusion .
