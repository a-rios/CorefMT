The Nigerian Schoolgirls Near You 
CAMBRIDGE - The abduction of hundreds of young Nigerian girls by the Islamic militia Boko Haram has been front-page news for weeks . 
The global public is outraged by the group &apos;s violation of fundamental principles and sensibilities : the prohibition of slavery , the protection of personal integrity , the obligation to protect children , and the right of adolescent girls to obtain an education and choose when and whom to marry . 
Yet the presence of young Nigerian prostitutes on the streets of Western cities barely elicits a reaction . 
Indeed , most people simply avert their eyes . 
Each year , thousands of Nigerian girls are trapped by fanatical and mercenary thugs and forced into prostitution , often in the same wealthy countries that are now magnanimously offering help to Nigeria &apos;s government . 
Six of every ten people trafficked to the West are Nigerian , and at least 60 % of trafficked sex workers in Italy and Belgium are Nigerian girls . 
Across Europe , North America , Russia , and the Middle East , these young women are visible to all who bother to look - and have been for decades . 
Why is no one outraged ? 
The inconsistency is rooted in the girls &quot; circumstances : the schoolgirls are innocent victims crying out for protection , while the child sex workers are illegal immigrants , slated for deportation as soon as they are caught . 
They all come from impoverished , conservative communities , where girls &quot; prospects are bleak , owing to the prevalence of child marriage , endemic domestic violence , a lack of educational opportunities , and pervasive unemployment . 
In fact , according to one Nigerian survey , Nigeria has some of the world &apos;s highest rates of early marriage , with 48 % of girls married by 15 , and 78 % by 18 , in the Northwest region of the country . 
Moreover , 81 % of married women admitted to being subjected to verbal or physical abuse by their husbands . 
Given high rates of adolescent marriage , it should come as no surprise that the net secondary-school enrollment rate for Nigerian girls in 2008-2009 was only 22 % , compared to 29 % for boys . 
While the specter of unemployment haunts all Nigerians , with only 10 % of the nearly six million young people who enter the labor market each year managing to secure a formal-sector job , the problem is much worse for women , who account for only one-third of those who find a formal job . 
Most of the 54 million Nigerian girls and women who live and work in rural areas are forced into insecure employment in the informal economy . 
Nigeria &apos;s radical gender inequality reflects a widespread tolerance of discrimination against girls , which facilitates the brutal actions of extremist groups like Boko Haram and creates fertile ground for traffickers . 
In such dire circumstances , it is easy to lure girls with false prospects of attractive jobs abroad , often in bars , restaurants , and clubs . 
It is a short step from recruitment to a life of extreme exploitation . 
As a result , despite the valiant efforts of human-rights activists , at least 200 Nigerian girls are trafficked to Russia monthly to work as prostitutes , according to Nigeria &apos;s ambassador to Russia , Asam Asam . 
The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute reports that , there are at least 10,000 - and perhaps as many as 20,000 - Nigerian sex workers in Italy , most of them trafficked and many of them young teenagers . 
As if that were not enough , to ensure that the girls do not run away or report their abusers , they may be subjected to so-called juju rituals , during which they are sworn to secrecy under pain of severe sanctions . 
Though law-enforcement , anti-trafficking , and child-protection agencies have long known about these abusive practices , solutions - such as employment schemes , legal immigration status , and improved health-care access - remain absent . 
National and global leaders are not working to break the cycle of violence . 
The problem is not invisible ; people simply do not want to see it . 
Political leaders and law-enforcement authorities in the West and elsewhere know how Nigerian teenage prostitutes ended up in their cities , but choose to do nothing to help them - or , worse , punish them . 
Ideally , Boko Haram &apos;s abduction of the schoolgirls would galvanize worldwide support for efforts to protect the rights of African adolescent girls , just as the Pakistani Taliban &apos;s shooting of Malala Yousafzai helped to combat complacency regarding education for girls in South Asia . 
The question is whether the global public will demand action to protect young Nigerian girls &quot; basic rights and freedoms , or merely continue to condemn distant brutality while acquiescing in it on a nearby street corner .
