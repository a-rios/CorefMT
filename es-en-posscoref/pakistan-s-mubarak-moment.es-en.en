Pakistan &apos;s Mubarak Moment ISLAMABAD - Pakistan &apos;s domestic situation is becoming increasingly precarious . 
Indeed , serious questions are now being raised as to whether the country can survive in its present form . 
Such questions stem from a growing fear that Islamist groups might once again make a serious bid to capture the levers of power in the country . 
If that is not possible because of the presence of a large and disciplined military , the Islamists might attempt to carve out some space for themselves in which to establish a separate system of governance more fully aligned with what they view as the principles of Islam . 
Islamist groups &quot; previous attempt to create such a space was successfully countered by the military in 2009 , when it drove insurgent forces from the sensitive district of Swat and the tribal agency of South Waziristan . 
Today , however , Pakistan &apos;s military may not be prepared to act with the force and conviction it showed last time . 
Its resolve to counter the Islamists &quot; growing influence has been weakened by two unfortunate events : the recent assassination of Salman Tasser , the governor of Punjab , Pakistan &apos;s most populous province , and the deaths last month of two young men allegedly at the hands of an American official named Raymond Davis . 
Taseer &apos;s murder led to large public displays of support for the alleged assassin on the grounds that he had taken the life of a politician who had questioned the content of the &quot; Hudood ordinances . &quot; 
These laws , originally promulgated by the British in colonial India and made more draconian by a succession of Pakistani administrations , make any comment considered to be disrespectful toward Islam or the Prophet Muhammad an offense punishable by death . 
A Christian woman who was alleged to have made such a disparaging comment was the latest target of the ordinances . 
Taseer had given his word that he would not allow the woman &apos;s death sentence to be carried out . 
The Davis case further complicated Pakistan &apos;s relations with the United States , which were already strained because of the military &apos;s reluctance to move into North Waziristan - a mini-state within Pakistan from which the Taliban have launched operations in Afghanistan against US forces . 
With the Pakistani street now demanding action against the &quot; murderer &quot; of two young men in Lahore , it was unlikely that the military would move in any way that could be seen as a response to pressure from the Obama administration . 
Even before Pakistan &apos;s ruling elite was shaken by the killings in Pakistan &apos;s streets and the turmoil in Tunisia and Egypt , it had begun to plan measures aimed at mollifying an increasingly restive citizenry . 
Moreover , several senior members of President Asif Ali Zardari &apos;s government have concluded that the developments in Tunisia and Egypt could not be replicated in Pakistan . 
&quot; Our institutions are working and democracy is functional , &quot; Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told members of the Western press . 
There were also clear indications that the military was not inclined to venture into politics once again , as it has done many times in the past . 
But Gilani was not entirely unruffled . 
As Hosni Mubarak &apos;s Egyptian regime unraveled , Gilani decided to call for the resignation of his entire cabinet . 
Led by Senior Minister Amin Fahim from the province of Sindh , all cabinet members submitted their resignations to the prime minister on February 4 . 
On the same day , the Central Executive Committee of the Pakistan People &apos;s Party &quot; authorized the prime minister to reappoint a smaller cabinet with fewer ministers enjoying reputation of integrity , competence , and efficiency . &quot; 
The final move in that direction came on February 9 , when , at a farewell lunch for his large cabinet , Gilani sent his ministers packing . 
A new , smaller cabinet was sworn in two days later . 
Gilani &apos;s step was taken in response not only to the developments in the Middle East , but also in recognition of how little the return to democracy has done for Pakistan &apos;s citizens . 
Officials are also aware that a change in the cabinet will be seen as mere window dressing unless people are shown that the government has a plan to rescue the economy from collapse and alleviate the burdens faced by ordinary people . 
Indeed , Pakistan &apos;s rate of economic growth is the slowest on the South Asian mainland - one-half that of Bangladesh and one-third that of India . 
A sharp increase in the prices of essential commodities means that the real income of the bottom 60 % of the population has declined . 
Sluggish economic activity has increased the rate of urban unemployment to an estimated 34 % of the labor force . 
While a functioning democratic system and a vibrant media may have provided outlets for people to vent their frustration with the state of the economy and the quality of governance , the political elite now recognizes that many ingredients in the Pakistani situation were present in those Middle Eastern countries where street politics have reached the boiling point . 
The message is clear : democracy that does not deliver tangible benefits will not prevent Pakistan &apos;s people from demanding radical change . 
The question now is whether the political class has the wherewithal to act accordingly .
