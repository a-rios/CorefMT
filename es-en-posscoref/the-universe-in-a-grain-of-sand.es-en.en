The Universe in a Grain of Sand 
There was a flurry of press coverage when the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland was turned on , and again when it was shut down by a technical problem shortly afterwards . 
The collider &apos;s operation was a much-anticipated event in science , one that could confirm or undermine one of the most successful theories about how the universe is structured . 
The public attention that it has received is rare for scientific news , perhaps owing to concerns that something celestially dangerous is being cooked up in our backyard . 
The lead-up coverage was accompanied by hype about the potential risks , so when the test did not seem to go as planned , it was natural to wonder if the fabric of space-time had been bruised . 
Some of the initial rumors about what could happen were extreme . 
One speculated that these new high energies , when combined with the specific way the particles would be broken , would annihilate us . 
In another scenario , the lab might create uncontrollable tiny black holes . 
In yet another , the creation of a &quot; stranglet &quot; would spawn new and terrible levels of nuclear power . 
There are possible risks when messing around with fundamental matter , but in this case , the shutdown was due to a mundane gas leak . 
What makes this test interesting for scientists , rather than newsmakers , is unchanged , and will still be exciting when CERN starts up the collider again . 
Here is what is at stake . 
For a scientific theory to be accepted , it must 1 ) explain observable phenomena ; 2 ) be &quot; elegant &quot; in the sense that its truth and clarity are obvious ; and 3 ) predict what will happen when you do something you have never done before . 
The purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to create an unprecedented situation . 
If the predicted particle does not appear , a series of theoretical abstractions will be questioned - and become open to replacement by radically different alternatives . 
It is not generally appreciated how much real-world impact a changed scientific model can have . 
For most people , the topics that excite physicists do not seem to affect daily life in the slightest . 
But there is a deeper chain of abstractions - the tools we use to think - at work here , one based on the way we perceive reality . 
For example , consider how different the world was before the concept of &quot; zero &quot; was discovered . 
Zero is essential to bookkeeping and hence all modern commerce . 
And that is quite apart from the way we take for granted the idea of &quot; nothing . &quot; 
The concept simply did not exist in the west until the Catholic Church ended its prohibition on the notion in the twelfth century , 1400 years after zero had been invented in the Arab World . 
Similarly , what if theories using germs had not been proven ? 
We wouldn &apos;t think about information transfer or messages the same way . 
Or the concept of the force field , which enables the concept of influence ? 
Freud &apos;s original model of the mind , the successors of which since shaped how we think of ourselves , were inspired by Einstein &apos;s theory of relativity . 
Powerful scientific abstractions eventually creep into the way we enjoy art , and how we form our laws and articulate our ethics . 
In the highly anticipated CERN experiment , the theory in question is at the center of a controversy about what abstractions seem more fundamental in the universe . 
One is based on number ; the other is based on form . 
The first holds that the universe is fundamentally probabilistic , generally random but with an order to its randomness . 
The other posits that the universe is inherently geometric , and that geometric properties , such as symmetry , govern it . 
If the experiment finds the predicted particle , it will tilt the argument toward form . 
Here &apos;s what this could mean in the long run . 
We extend this simple notion through all of our reasoning about the world : man and woman , boss and employee , love and hate , left and right . 
It drives our ideas of politics , religion , and even the principles of truth underpinning our system of laws . 
But what if you naturally dealt with symmetries of three ? 
What if it was proven , through a particle collision , that a true balance required three sides instead of two ? 
The tests in the Hadron Collider may trigger this change , every bit as disruptive as an explosion . 
Or perhaps it will be less dramatic , dawning in the mind of a clerk gazing out the window of a patent office . 
A different perception of reality has the power to change us - change the way we think - and it could come from anywhere .
