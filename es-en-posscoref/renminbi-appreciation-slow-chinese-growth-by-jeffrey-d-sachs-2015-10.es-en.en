The Japan Syndrome Comes to China 
NEW YORK - China is now experiencing what Japan went through a generation ago : a marked slowdown in economic growth after demands by the United States that it restrict its exports . 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Japan was criticized by the US as an &quot; unfair trader &quot; by virtue of its soaring manufacturing exports . 
The US issued stern , and apparently credible , threats to restrict Japanese imports , and succeeded in pushing Japan to overvalue the yen , which helped to bring Japanese growth to a screeching halt . 
That may be happening again , with China &apos;s growth slowing markedly under the weight of an overvalued currency urged by the US . 
Figure 1 shows the yen &apos;s real ( inflation-adjusted ) exchange rate from 1964 ( when the yen became convertible on the current account ) until today . 
A rise in the index signifies real appreciation , meaning that the yen became more expensive relative to other currencies after correcting for relative price-level changes . 
As one can see , the yen appreciated gradually in the 1960s and 1970s , as one would expect , given Japan &apos;s rapid catch-up growth of those decades . 
Then came the trade pressures from the US , and Japan agreed to a major realignment of currencies in the mid-1980s , starting with the so-called Plaza Accord in 1985 . 
The yen appreciated substantially as part of that multi-country intervention , with the real appreciation reaching roughly 50 % from 1984 to 1988 . 
And , as Figure 2 shows , Japan &apos;s export growth plummeted . 
For a brief period , a domestic investment boom offset the export slowdown . 
With the yen seeming to have no place to go but up , foreign money flooded into Japan . 
A financial bubble developed . 
By 1990 , the investment boom had become a bust , the asset bubble had burst , and Japan began two decades of stagnation . 
Despite the Japanese economy &apos;s chronic underperformance , the US continued to press Japan to maintain an overvalued yen throughout this period . 
During the 1990s and 2000s , I repeatedly asked senior Japanese finance ministry officials why they allowed the yen &apos;s real appreciation to persist , thereby shutting down export growth . 
The answer was always the same : Japan was afraid of US trade retaliation if the yen weakened . 
It is only with the Bank of Japan &apos;s quantitative easing since the launch of &quot; Abenomics &quot; in 2012 that the yen &apos;s real appreciation has been reversed somewhat . 
Predictably , some US industrial lobbies are again complaining that Japan is manipulating its currency , even though the yen &apos;s real depreciation since 2012 has merely reversed the preceding growth-killing real appreciation . 
China now confronts the risk of the same sequence of events . 
Its booming exports in the mid-2000s led US officials to threaten trade retaliation unless the Chinese authorities took steps to restrict exports , cause the renminbi to appreciate , and shift to &quot; consumption-led growth . &quot; 
This is the same message once given to Japan . 
The US insistence on renminbi appreciation intensified after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis . 
The results to date can be seen in Figure 3 , which maps China &apos;s real exchange rate from the start of renminbi current-account convertibility ( 1996 ) until today . 
The currency began appreciating sharply in 2007 . 
As in Japan , the appreciation sparked destabilizing capital flows into China on the assumption that the renminbi , like the yen before it , had nowhere to go but up . 
As in Japan , a financial bubble accompanied the currency appreciation . 
Yet , as Figure 4 shows , the real appreciation led to a rapid collapse of China &apos;s annual export growth , from above 15 % ( smoothed over three-year intervals ) to elow 10 % , and now to a financial slump as well . 
From 2007 to 2014 , the renminbi appreciated by 32 % in real , trade-weighted terms ; by May 2015 ( the most recent month of the reported index ) , its total appreciation had reached 40 % . 
This partly reflected nominal appreciation against the US dollar , together with effective appreciation against the euro , yen , Korean won , and other currencies as the US dollar strengthened relative to them . 
The renminbi remains highly overvalued , despite August &apos;s modest 3 % nominal depreciation against the soaring US dollar . 
The renminbi &apos;s real appreciation should be compared with the recent movements of the yen and won . 
As of May 2015 , the yen had depreciated in real terms by around 7 % since January 2007 , and the won by around 3 % , thereby exacerbating the cost pressures on China &apos;s exporters relative to their Asian competitors . 
Further depreciation of the renminbi seems necessary if China is to bolster its flagging economic growth and avoid a long-term &quot; Japan trap . &quot; 
It is important to note that many of China &apos;s increased exports would find their way not to the US and Europe but to Africa and Asia , especially in the form of infrastructure equipment and other machinery . 
Nonetheless , political pressures from the US and Europe , manifested as charges of currency manipulation and unfair trade practices , as well as misguided ideas in China about the renminbi &apos;s &quot; prestige , &quot; might lead China to resist any meaningful exchange-rate correction . 
A month after the renminbi &apos;s 3 % depreciation , Chinese President Xi Jinping commented that , &quot; Given the current economic and financial conditions at home and abroad , there is no basis for sustained depreciation of the RMB . &quot; 
In recent weeks , the People &apos;s Bank of China has been defending the currency &apos;s valuation through foreign-exchange sales . 
Earlier this year , The Economist offered the conventional Western thinking . 
Don &apos;t let the renminbi depreciate , it wrote , for four reasons : depreciation might provoke a currency war in Asia ; 
Such misguided reasoning is precisely what led to a generation of unnecessarily slow growth in Japan .
