Saving Global Order 
GENEVA - As 2015 begins , the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are under threat . 
Around the world , personal liberty , human rights , and democracy are at risk - even in countries that have embraced democratic ideals . 
The international community is deeply divided , blocking progress on a host of global challenges , ranging from the crises in Syria , Iraq , and Ukraine to climate change and international trade . 
Three factors - all likely to persist this year - are driving these unsettling trends . 
First , globalization may have delivered many benefits , but it has also eroded the capacity of societies to determine their own destinies . 
Many modern challenges - including tax avoidance , organized crime , cyber insecurity , terrorism , climate change , international migration , and financial flows , both licit and illicit - have one thing in common : the traditional instruments of a sovereign state have become inadequate to manage them . 
Second , failed military solutions in Afghanistan and Iraq have played a large role in undermining the international community &apos;s unity , and eroding confidence in intervention in general , even as established powers cut budgets and emerging powers shy away from taking on new responsibilities . 
In 2014 , leaders in my native Africa and elsewhere challenged the objectivity and effectiveness of the International Criminal Court , the creation of which was a major milestone in the struggle to end impunity for national leaders . 
Finally , we have failed to modernize the international system &apos;s institutional architecture . 
The most important institutions - the United Nations Security Council , the World Bank , and the International Monetary Fund - remain dominated by the European and American victors of World War II , countries that represent an increasingly small minority of the world &apos;s population and a shrinking share of its economic output . 
The failure to reflect the changing balance of global power brought about by the rise of China , Brazil , South Africa , and other emerging countries undermines both the effectiveness and the legitimacy of today &apos;s international system , particularly in the eyes of those who feel denied of proper recognition . 
And yet , whatever the shortcomings of the international system , it is important to remember that never before in human history have so few people ( as a proportion of world population ) died from armed conflict . 
It may not make headlines , but the international system , with its rules and institutions , allows states to settle most of their disputes peacefully , most of the time . 
For better or worse , fighting epidemics like Ebola or preventing the most harmful consequences of climate change requires solidarity and cooperation . 
Retreating into unilateralism , ultra-nationalism , or the politics of identity will produce nothing but a bitter , fragmented , parochial , and dangerous world . 
The world desperately needs brave leaders who can take the long view . 
In a world where power ebbs and flows , it is in everyone &apos;s interest to adhere to a fair system of rules that respect both national sovereignty and individual rights . 
The heads of the world &apos;s historical powers need to recognize that it is in their interest , too , to follow the rules , and to allow rising states to help write these rules . 
As I have often argued , the Security Council must be enlarged , and developing countries should be given greater voting rights in the Bretton Woods institutions : the IMF and the World Bank . 
In exchange , the world &apos;s newest powers must begin to take on a greater share of responsibility for the global order upon which their success depends . 
They can no longer stand on the sidelines , denouncing the injustices of the past . 
Instead , they must join their peers in building the future . 
We often hear talk about the shortcomings of the UN , which stands at the heart of the international system . 
Too seldom do we note its achievements and successes , of which there have been many . 
Rather than retreat from a system that has yielded exceptional results , we must use the international community &apos;s current crisis as a historic opportunity to reshape the existing order to better meet our modern challenges .
