The &quot; Rational &quot; Suicide Bomber 
Hamas &apos;s surprise victory in the Palestinian parliamentary election has made the question of who is a terrorist , and how terrorism should be tackled , more urgent than ever . 
How Hamas behaves in government will reveal whether terrorists and suicide bombers are alike in their implacability . 
The test is suicide bombing . 
Few weapons in the terrorist &apos;s arsenal are as devastating as suicide bombing - or as poorly understood , for serious analysis has apparently given way to the desire to avoid conferring on the attackers any legitimacy whatsoever . 
But this attitude thwarts urgently needed insight into who the suicide bombers really are , what motivates them , and thus how they might be stopped . 
In fact , there are basically two categories of suicide bombers . 
The first includes the perpetrators of the attacks on the United States in 2001 , the Bali bombing in 2002 , the Madrid train bombing in 2003 , and the London bombings in the summer of 2005 . 
The perpetrators are indifferent as to whether their victims , both direct and indirect , are Muslim or non-Muslim ; their goal is to terrorize and eventually to destroy a way of life in the name of a nebulous Dar-al-Islam , a utopian entity that will supposedly solve all of life &apos;s problems . 
Suicide bombers of this type , while difficult to hunt down and neutralize , can easily be identified and their criminality exposed , given their vicious and wanton disdain for ethical , moral , and religious norms . 
Muslim religious and political leaders have the intellectual capital to refute their misplaced religious convictions , and can repeat sura after sura , hadith after hadith , detailing Islam &apos;s rejection of violence and repudiation of the killing of innocents . 
But the second category of suicide bombers presents a far greater challenge , for it comprises organizations , such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad that fight for avowedly nationalist goals . 
While terrorism is rightly viewed as an illegitimate means , nationalism is a rational , and often legitimate , goal , and it is shared by many people who are not terrorists . 
Unlike in the case of millenarian terrorists like Al Qaeda , for whom the goal is amorphous-nationalist extremists &quot; more realistic objectives might make it possible to neutralize them by addressing the root issue ( for example , the creation of a viable Palestinian state ) . 
The distinction between the two types of suicide bombers is not always stark . 
Many people enthralled by nationalistic struggle , end up rejecting all reasonable compromise and advocating genocidal goals . 
Nevertheless , the distinction is important and seems lost on the US - and a host of other countries - which have lumped the nationalist groups together with Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) in their lists of terrorist organizations . 
This one-size-fits-all approach may be convenient , but the failure to differentiate among suicide bombers vastly oversimplifies the realities that define the fight against terrorism . 
To be sure , Hamas and Islamic Jihad are often no less brutal than Al Qaeda or JI . 
But this does not mean that they should be dealt with in the same way . 
Indeed , while the demands of millenarians can never be met , thus leaving repression as the only means to deal with them , nationalism may be ( and often is ) effectively addressed through political means : when the legitimate and more widely shared nationalist goals are met , the radical fringe often loses its wider appeal and withers away . 
Failure to recognize this works to the advantage of religiously motivated terrorists because all the energy spent on fighting terrorism is spent on repression , leaving legitimate nationalist goals unaddressed and strengthening popular support for terrorism of all kinds . 
Frighteningly , groups like Al Qaeda can claim the mantle of popular nationalism as a means of pursuing their ultimate utopian aims . 
Moreover , although Muslim religious and secular leaders are able to isolate millenarian terrorists and undercut their popular support , they lack the moral capital to completely discredit nationalist extremists groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad , as long as the Muslim laity shares some of their goals . 
To the powerless , nationalist suicide bombers look like a great equalizer . 
Israeli Apache and Cobra gunships armed with Hellfire missiles regularly hit their targets from great distances , as do F-16 fighter jets armed with laser-guided munitions , but not without frequent &quot; collateral damage &quot; to innocent civilians . 
Suicide bombers who target innocent Israeli civilians - and sometimes legitimate military objectives - rightly or wrongly appear to counterbalance Israeli &quot; strategic &quot; strikes . 
Thus , despite repeated condemnation by establishment figures within the ummah ( the worldwide community of Muslims ) , some forms of suicide bombing may enjoy the quiet admiration of many . 
As long as no distinction is made between nationalist extremists and fanatical terrorists like Al Qaeda , the latter will be able to masquerade as the defenders of Muslims who are seen as &quot; driven &quot; to resort to suicide bombing because of military weakness . 
America &apos;s ill-advised foray into Iraq has further confounded the distinction between the two types of suicide bombers and created a nearly ideal breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists . 
Some are inspired by Al Qaeda , others by disgruntled Sunnis , but all can claim a nationalist mantle . 
Ignoring the various dimensions of suicide bombing , and the outlook of the groups responsible , America and its allies have been left helpless to comprehend , much less address , the largely indifferent reaction of many Muslims to the US-led &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
By regarding all suicide bombers as irrational fanatics , rather than drawing distinctions between millenarians and nationalists , the US and its allies have ceded crucial political ground to groups like Al Qaeda and JI that insist on the impossibility of negotiating with Islam &apos;s &quot; enemies . &quot; 
This stance carries a high cost : the empathy of the Muslim masses that is required to defeat those who debase Islam in their name .
