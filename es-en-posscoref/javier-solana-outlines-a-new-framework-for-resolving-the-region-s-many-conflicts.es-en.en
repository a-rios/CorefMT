The Middle East Balancing Act 
MADRID - The recent gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) confirms that , more than a decade after the war in Iraq began , stability in the Middle East remains on a knife &apos;s edge . 
ISIS - with its transnational commitment to a caliphate that encompasses vast swaths of territory from western Syria to central Iraq - exemplifies the interrelated nature of the challenges facing the region , and the threat it poses highlights the urgent need for a new framework for action in the Middle East . 
ISIS began as an affiliate of Al Qaeda , following America &apos;s invasion of Iraq . 
Though it was expelled from Al Qaeda last February for , of all things , its excessively violent tactics , it has thrived , finding fertile ground for expansion in a civil-war-ravaged Syria and among Iraq &apos;s Sunni population , which is increasingly alienated from the country &apos;s Shia-led government . 
Iraq &apos;s location on a major fault line between Sunnis and Shia - whose sectarian rivalry has become the main axis of confrontation in the region - has been a source of instability in the country for decades . 
The collapse of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime led to a surge in sectarian violence , except in the northern region of Kurdistan , which enjoys considerable autonomy vis-Ã -vis the central government in Baghdad . 
But Iraq &apos;s current travails are the direct result of the war in neighboring Syria , where ISIS has claimed thousands of lives . 
Moreover , the rise of ISIS will have repercussions far beyond Iraq &apos;s borders , as the organization competes with Al Qaeda to lead the global jihad - a competition that will undoubtedly involve violent efforts by both sides to demonstrate their anti-Western bona fides . 
ISIS &apos;s rise underscores the urgent need for fresh , creative diplomacy in Syria that can break the deadlock both on the battlefield and in the negotiating room - a challenge that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s recent electoral victory has deepened . 
New negotiating parameters are also needed to resolve the conflict in Iraq , reach a peace settlement between Israel and Palestine , and , ultimately , establish a stable balance of power in the Middle East that reconciles the influence of Sunni Saudi Arabia and that of Shia Iran . 
America &apos;s unwillingness to use the kind of &quot; coercive &quot; diplomacy that it did in the past makes such a framework all the more urgent - not to mention difficult - as it changes the way that regional actors view the United States . 
For starters , the West &apos;s decision not to intervene directly in Syria , particularly after the official exposure of the Assad government &apos;s use of chemical weapons , has diminished confidence in the US among its traditional allies , particularly Saudi Arabia . 
Moreover , Saudi Arabia , along with other Sunni countries , doubts the wisdom of negotiating with Iran , fearing a normalization of relations with its regional competitor . 
And the failure of the most recent round of Israel-Palestine peace talks , spearheaded by US Secretary of State John Kerry , has underscored America &apos;s inability to lead the peace process alone . 
Clearly , the US cannot stabilize the Middle East without help ; it needs a wide range of actors to commit to this goal . 
Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami has recently outlined a new peace paradigm for the negotiations between Israel and Palestine , in which the participation of actors like the European Union , Russia , and key Arab countries would facilitate the rise of a truly international solution . 
This paradigm should be extended to the Geneva negotiations on the Syrian civil war , with countries like Saudi Arabia , Iran , Turkey , and Egypt assuming a greater role . 
Of course , involving regional powers could complicate already-muddy negotiations further . 
The goal must therefore be clarity and equilibrium . 
Only with a balanced negotiation process , guided by regional and global actors , can a stable balance of power in the Middle East be achieved . 
If the regional balance of power is not introduced into negotiations , any future conflict - however small - could spread rapidly , with unimaginable consequences . 
An inclusive framework of conflict resolution in Syria is particularly critical today , as it would establish a precedent for cooperation among regional powers , especially Iran and Saudi Arabia . 
International negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program have provided some reason for optimism , which could lend impetus to efforts in Syria . 
But , again , success there would require the commitment of key regional and international actors . 
While it is true that international powers have their own troubles - from Europe &apos;s concerns about Russia &apos;s new foreign policy to China &apos;s territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas - it is in their interest to take an active role in addressing chronic instability in the Middle East . 
After all , disorder there is a serious threat to their security , with Europe at risk owing to its geographical proximity and countries like China and India facing the prospect of energy-supply disruptions . 
The Middle East has been a source of volatility and violence for far too long . 
With a new , creative approach and a strong commitment from countries worldwide , a stable regional balance of power can and should be achieved once and for all .
