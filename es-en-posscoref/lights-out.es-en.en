Lights Out ? 
RIO DE JANEIRO - When it comes to all things &quot; green , &quot; common sense seems to have been abandoned . 
Our failure to think clearly about such matters would be amusing if the potential consequences were not so serious . 
Consider the recent &quot; lights out &quot; campaign that supposedly should energize the world about the problems of climate change by urging citizens in 27 big cities to turn out their lights for an hour . 
With scores of companies and municipalities signing up , and even the monarchies of Denmark and Sweden turning off the lights in their many palaces , the World Wildlife Fund quickly called it an amazing success . 
Newspapers around the world dutifully wrote feel-good stories about how engaged environmentalists celebrated as the lights went out around the world . 
Nobody , it seemed , wanted to spoil the party by pointing that the event was immensely futile , that it highlighted a horrible metaphor , or that it caused much higher overall pollution . 
Danish newspapers - coincidentally in the native country of the story of the Emperor &apos;s New Clothes - happily quoted the WWF regarding the event &apos;s overwhelming success . 
But the entire savings ( assuming people didn &apos;t use more energy later in the night to make up for lost time ) amounted to just ten tons of CO2 - equivalent to just one Dane &apos;s annual emissions for a full year . 
Measuring the avoided climate impact for the indefinite future , the entire combined efforts of the Queen , many companies , and the city halls of Copenhagen and other cities yielded $ 20 worth of good . 
Are pointless gestures really the way to secure a greener future ? 
And what sort of message does turning out the lights send ? 
As some conservative commentators like to point out , the environmental movement has indeed become a dark force , not metaphorically , but literally . 
Indeed , urging us to sit in darkness will probably only make us realize how unlikely it is that we will ever be convinced to give up the advantages of fossil fuels . 
Curiously , nobody suggested that the &quot; lights out &quot; campaign should also mean no air conditioning , telephones , Internet , movies , hot food , warm coffee , or cold drinks - not to mention the loss of security when street lights and traffic signals don &apos;t work . 
Perhaps recruiting support would have been much harder had the Danes also had to turn off their heat . 
Ironically , the lights-out campaign also implies much greater energy inefficiency and dramatically higher levels of air pollution . 
When asked to extinguish electric lights , most people around the world would turn to candlelight instead . 
Candles are cozy and seem oh-so-natural . 
Yet , when measured by the light they generate , candles are almost 100 times less efficient than incandescent light bulbs , and more than 300 times less efficient than fluorescent lights . 
Moreover , candles create massive amounts of highly damaging indoor particulate air pollution , which in the United States is estimated to kill more than a 100,000 people each year . 
Candles can easily create indoor air pollution that is 10-100 times the level of outdoor air pollution caused by cars , industry , and electricity production . 
Measured against the relative decrease in air pollution from the reduced fossil fuel energy production , candles increase health-damaging air pollution 1,000-10,000-fold . 
Unfortunately , the lights-out campaign exemplifies the state of much of our environmental debate . 
We are spoon fed stories that fit preconceived frameworks . 
For example , the recent breakup of a massive glacier in the Antarctic supposedly proves the mounting effects of global warming . 
But we don &apos;t hear that the area was ice-free , possibly just some 400 years ago , without the help of global warming . 
We don &apos;t hear that the Wilkins glacier makes up less than 0.01 % of Antarctica . 
Likewise , we all heard Al Gore talking about the dramatic hurricane years of 2004 and 2005 , but we &apos;ve heard almost nothing about the complete absence of hurricane damage in 2006 and 2007 . 
The insurance company Lloyds of London has now begun to fret that the absence of natural disasters is putting a squeeze on its premiums . 
We are endlessly presented with stories of soaring temperatures , but over the past year , we &apos;ve experienced the single fastest temperature change ever recorded , and it &apos;s been downward . 
In January , Hong Kong was gripped by its second-longest cold spell since 1885 . 
This year &apos;s storms in central and southern China produced the worst winter weather in a half-century . 
Snow fell on Baghdad for the first time in living memory . 
When we get a distorted picture , we are likely to make wrong choices . 
Doing virtually no good while dramatically decreasing energy efficiency and increasing air pollution merely threatens any hope for enlightened public policy .
