The Big Bank Fix 
LONDON - Two alternative approaches dominate current discussions about banking reform : break-up and regulation . 
The debate goes back to the early days of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt &apos;s &quot; New Deal , &quot; which pitted &quot; trust-busters &quot; against regulators . 
In banking , the trust-busters won the day with the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 , which divorced commercial banking from investment banking and guaranteed bank deposits . 
With the gradual dismantling of Glass-Steagall , and its final repeal in 1999 , bankers triumphed over both the busters and the regulators , while maintaining deposit insurance for the commercial banks . 
It was this largely unregulated system that came crashing down in 2008 , with global repercussions . 
At the core of preventing another banking crash is solving the problem of moral hazard - the likelihood that a risk-taker who is insured against loss will take more risks . 
In most countries , if a bank in which I place my money goes bust , the government , not the bank , compensates me . 
Additionally , the central bank acts as &quot; lender of last resort &quot; to commercial banks considered &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
As a result , banks enjoying deposit insurance and access to central bank funds are free to gamble with their depositors &quot; money ; they are &quot; banks with casinos attached to them &quot; in the words of John Kay . 
The danger unleashed by sweeping away the Glass-Steagall barrier to moral hazard became clear after Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail in September 2008 . 
Bail-out facilities were then extended ad hoc to investment banks , mortgage providers , and big insurers like AIG , protecting managers , creditors , and stock-holders against loss . 
( Goldman Sachs became eligible for subsidized Fed loans by turning itself into a holding company ) . 
The main part of the banking system was able to take risks without having to foot the bill for failure . 
Public anger apart , such a system is untenable . 
Premature rejection of bank nationalization has left us with the same two alternatives as in 1933 : break-up or regulation . 
Taking his cue from Paul Volcker , a former chairman of the US Federal Reserve , President Barack Obama has proposed a modern form of Glass-Steagall . 
Under the Obama-Volcker proposals , commercial banks would be forbidden to engage in proprietary trading - trading on their own account - and from owning hedge funds and private-equity firms . 
Moreover , they would be limited in their holding of derivative instruments , and Obama has suggested that no commercial bank should hold more than 10 % of national deposits . 
The main idea is to reduce the risks that can be taken by any financial institution that is backed by the federal government . 
The alternative regulatory approach , promoted by Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman and the chairman of Britain &apos;s Financial Service Authority , Adair Turner , seeks to use regulation to limit risk-taking without changing the structure of the banking system . 
A new portfolio of regulations would increase banks &quot; capital requirements , limit the debt that they could take on , and establish a Consumer Financial Protection Agency to protect na√Øve borrowers against predatory lending . 
This is not an either-or matter . 
In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee in early February , MIT &apos;s Simon Johnson endorsed the Volcker approach , but also favored strengthening commercial banks &quot; capital ratios &quot; dramatically &quot; - from about 7 % to 25 % - and improving bankruptcy procedures through a &quot; living will , &quot; which would freeze some assets , but not others . 
Many details of the Obama package are unlikely to survive ( if , indeed , the plan itself does ) . 
But there are powerful arguments against the principles of his approach . 
Critics point out that &quot; plain old bad lending &quot; by the commercial banks accounted for 90 % of banks &quot; losses . 
The classic case is Britain &apos;s Royal Bank of Scotland , which is not an investment bank . 
The commercial banks &quot; main losses were incurred in the residential and commercial housing market . 
The remedy here is not to break up the banks , but to limit bank loans to this sector - say , by forcing them to hold a certain proportion of mortgages on their books , and by increasing the capital that needs to be held against loans for commercial real estate . 
Moreover , many countries with integrated banking systems did not have to bail out any of their financial institutions . 
Canada &apos;s banks were not too big to fail - just too boring to fail . 
There is nothing in Canada to rival the power of Wall Street or the City of London . This enabled the government to swim against the tide of financial innovation and de-regulation . 
It is countries like the US and Britain , with politically dominant financial sectors competing to take over financial leadership of the world , that suffered the heaviest losses . 
This is the point that the well-intentioned regulators miss . 
At root , the battle between the two approaches is a question of power , not of technical financial economics . 
As Johnson pointed out in his Congressional testimony , &quot; solutions that depend on smarter , better regulatory supervision and corrective action ignore the political constraint on regulation and the political power of big banks . &quot; 
Such proposed solutions assume that regulators will be able to identify excess risks , prevent banks from manipulating the regulations , resist political pressure to leave the banks alone , and impose controversial corrective measures &quot; that will be too complicated to defend in public . &quot; 
They also assume that governments will have to the courage to back them as their opponents accuse them of socialism and crimes against freedom , innovation , dynamism , and so on . 
In fact , this chorus of abuse has already started , led by Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein . 
There is another interesting parallel with the New Deal . 
Roosevelt got the Glass-Steagall Act through Congress within a hundred days of his inauguration . 
Obama has waited over a year to suggest his bank reform , and it is unlikely to pass . 
This is not just because the banking crisis in 1933 was greater than today &apos;s crisis ; it is because much more powerful financial lobbies now stand between pen and policy . 
If reformers are to win , they must be prepared to fight the world &apos;s most powerful vested interest .
