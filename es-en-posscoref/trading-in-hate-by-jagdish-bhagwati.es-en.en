Trading In Hate 
NEW YORK - The massacre in Norway in July 2011 and the recent attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek , Wisconsin , were the work of right-wing extremists who sought to remake the world in their neo-Nazi image . 
Likewise , the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , were the work of Islamist extremists who view other religions and cultures as a threat . 
But it would be simplistic to believe that our leaders do not add fuel to the fire of hatred , even if their chauvinism takes a more &quot; civilized &quot; form . 
Or consider how the unceasing refrain against outsourcing nowadays has demonized India . This is not new . 
Japan &apos;s heavy burden of atrocities during World War II effectively erased from America &apos;s popular memory the Immigration Act of 1924 and other federal legislation aimed at excluding the Japanese and the Chinese from the United States , as well as racist state legislation , such as California &apos;s 1913 Alien Land Act . 
With the war &apos;s outbreak , Americans of Japanese origin were expropriated and herded into concentration camps . 
California Attorney General Earl Warren championed the measures - the same Earl Warren , who , a decade later , as Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court , would oversee the rejection of the separate-but-equal doctrine at the heart of America &apos;s segregation of its black citizens . 
The anti-Japanese hysteria of the 1980 &quot; s fell on fertile ground . 
Many in the US feared that , just as the nineteenth century had been British and the twentieth century had been American , the twenty-first century would be Japanese . 
Virtually every Japanese policy was interpreted in the worst possible light . 
The propaganda was bipartisan in the US , and , with few noteworthy exceptions , was widely disseminated by the country &apos;s uncritical and pseudo-patriotic media . 
I recall the Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson - alongside John Maynard Keynes , arguably the greatest economist of his time - remarking that anti-Japanese propaganda had gone so far that Japan &apos;s critics would argue that the Japanese bow in greeting Westerners to make it easier to cut them off at the knees . 
The effect , particularly given a long history of anti-Japanese sentiment , was a predictable wave of racist violence , including the destruction of Japanese cars . 
The beating death of Vincent Chin , a Chinese-American who was mistaken for a Japanese , also resonated historically , recalling a pseudo-scientific article on how to distinguish the Chinese from the Japanese that Life magazine published in December 1941 . 
The Indian situation in the US today is different ; there is no baggage of unpleasant memories on which prejudice and violence can draw . 
Yet , like a desert cactus , hate can thrive on very little . 
Unfortunately , US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has continually harped on outsourcing to India as a cause of American job losses . 
Similarly , Senator Charles Schumer of New York has indulged in Japan-bashing , China-bashing , and India-bashing - a singular record of truculence and economic illiteracy - while Senator Barbara Boxer of California attacked her most recent electoral opponent , Carly Fiorina , for eliminating 30,000 jobs at Hewlett Packard during her stewardship of the company . 
In fact , in a highly competitive world , Hewlett-Packard managed to save 150,000 jobs by sacrificing those 30,000 . 
In the current presidential election campaign , the Democratic Party is attacking Obama &apos;s Republican challenger , Mitt Romney , on the same specious grounds , with a complacent media acquiescing in the Democrats &quot; de facto India-baiting . 
The net result has been to fuel resentment against India that spills over into occasional violence . 
Groups calling themselves &quot; dot-busters &quot; have attacked Indian women . 
When I have written in favor of freer trade and liberal immigration , I have been denounced as a &quot; curry nigger . &quot; 
Nor has the Obama administration helped matters by shifting the blame for the failure of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations onto India . 
Outside the US , it is well known that Obama himself pulled the plug on Doha . 
The notion that &quot; we are open and others are closed , &quot; a cherished belief of US politicians and media - and an article of faith with the current administration - also feeds the notion that countries like India are wicked traders , much like the Japanese in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Much of the world expected more elevated behavior from Obama . 
Unfortunately , it has gotten a much lower standard than it anticipated .
