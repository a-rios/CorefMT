Germany , Europe , and Russia 
European unity is indivisible . 
When one nation is intimidated or ostracized , all are not free . 
Every aspect of our shared culture , if not the last century of shared suffering , confirms that for us . 
So a prime objective of the European Union is to promote stability and security through a dynamic structure of economic and political inter-dependence in which all nations have a vested interest . 
But such a structure is lacking today between the EU and Russia , to the detriment of all the countries that lie between them . 
Thus it is vitally important that Germany has made this a central issue for its EU presidency , which is just beginning . 
With high prices for crude oil and natural gas bloating its coffers , Russia is once again aggressively confronting the small and still relatively weak states that fled the eroding Soviet empire 15 years ago . 
Given the residual economic and institutional ties born of the Soviet era , Russia &apos;s external influence in this region remains enormous . 
But Russia is also now extending its grasp of energy markets beyond those of its immediate neighbors . 
Europe &apos;s relationship with Russia is too important for it to be developed in an ad hoc fashion through bilateral arrangements . 
Today is Europe &apos;s moment of maximum flexibility ; as dependence on Russian energy supplies grows , the EU &apos;s leverage weakens . 
So Europe &apos;s strategy cannot be to take the historically well-trodden path of least resistance . 
Unfortunately , in the aftermath of the Cold War , it has often been assumed that Russia &apos;s hostile intentions have disappeared , and foreign policy toward Russia has been conducted as if traditional diplomatic considerations no longer apply . 
But , of course , they do apply . 
Encouraging economic and political reform are important objectives , but they can never serve as a substitute for a serious effort to contain Russia &apos;s deep-seated expansionism . 
To be sure , Russia has legitimate security interests in what has been called its &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
But Europe &apos;s stability and commitment to economic growth across the continent require that these interests be satisfied without economic pressure or unilateral intervention . 
A viable Russia policy for Europe must recognize Europe &apos;s growing dependence on Russian energy resources . 
To proceed otherwise would discount the most important question : the reliability of Russia as an energy supplier . 
Despite controlling the world &apos;s largest gas reserves , Russia &apos;s state-owned monopoly Gazprom is not producing enough for an economy growing at 6 % a year . 
Gazprom &apos;s three largest fields , which account for three-quarters of its output , are in decline . 
This domestic shortage means that Gazprom is unable to increase supply to Europe , at least in the short term , unless it can buy gas at below-market rates from its Eastern European and Central Asian neighbors and in turn sell it to its European customers at market prices . 
At the same time , Russia wants to cater to other markets , notably along its eastern frontier . 
The problem is not a lack of reserves , but Gazprom &apos;s investment strategy . 
In recent years , the company has spent vigorously on everything but developing its reserves . 
It has built or is building pipelines to Turkey and Germany , taken over an oil company , and sought footholds in European distribution markets . 
Instead of investing in discovering oil , Gazprom has become the biggest media group in Russia . 
All this is done in the name of creating and supporting a national energy champion which also serves as a foreign policy arm of the Kremlin . 
Meanwhile , with investment in Gazprom &apos;s core activity - production - steadily declining , a crisis is looming , one that requires the stewardship and steady hand of the EU . 
Gazprom &apos;s ambitions for gaining control of pipeline and energy transport infrastructure must be slowed , which requires allowing independent producers to prosper . 
Indeed , independent producers already account for 20 % of domestic gas sales in Russia . 
To boost their output and allow them direct access to European markets will require market-based incentives . 
Europe can help by insisting that Russia participate in the European Energy Charter , which calls for Gazprom to grant its production competitors access to Russian pipelines , and for all disputes to be settled by international arbitration . 
European competition policy , which successfully brought giant companies like Microsoft into line to promote competition , could help to turn Gazprom into a normal competitor , too . 
Europe &apos;s leaders should engage in frank discussions about where European and Russian interests converge or differ , and these discussions should include regional neighbors that are both producer and transit nations , like my own country , Ukraine . 
Moscow will understand a policy based on mutual respect for each other &apos;s interests better than simple appeals to goodwill and friendship . 
Russia should be welcome in institutions and agreements that foster cooperation , with reciprocal rights and responsibilities . 
Russian reform will be impeded , not nurtured , by turning a blind eye to political and economic aggression . 
The hard-fought independence of the former Soviet republics must not be tacitly traded away in acquiescence to Russia &apos;s desire for regional hegemony . 
Russia &apos;s leaders are entitled to the world &apos;s understanding as they struggle to overcome generations of Soviet misrule . 
But they are not entitled to the sphere of influence that Russian tsars and commissars coveted for 300 years . 
If Russia is to be a serious partner for Europe , it must be ready to accept the obligations of stability along with the benefits . 
If Europe is to ensure its prosperity and energy security , it must demand nothing less .
