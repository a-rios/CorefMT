When Inequality Kills 
NEW YORK - This week , Angus Deaton will receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics &quot; for his analysis of consumption , poverty , and welfare . &quot; 
Deservedly so . 
Indeed , soon after the award was announced in October , Deaton published some startling work with Anne Case in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - research that is at least as newsworthy as the Nobel ceremony . 
Analyzing a vast amount of data about health and deaths among Americans , Case and Deaton showed declining life expectancy and health for middle-aged white Americans , especially those with a high school education or less . 
Among the causes were suicide , drugs , and alcoholism . 
America prides itself on being one of the world &apos;s most prosperous countries , and can boast that in every recent year except one ( 2009 ) per capita GDP has increased . 
And a sign of prosperity is supposed to be good health and longevity . 
But , while the US spends more money per capita on medical care than almost any other country ( and more as a percentage of GDP ) , it is far from topping the world in life expectancy . 
France , for example , spends less than 12 % of its GDP on medical care , compared to 17 % in the US . 
For years , many Americans explained away this gap . 
The US is a more heterogeneous society , they argued , and the gap supposedly reflected the huge difference in average life expectancy between African Americans and white Americans . 
The racial gap in health is , of course , all too real . 
According to a study published in 2014 , life expectancy for African Americans is some four years lower for women and more than five years lower for men , relative to whites . 
This disparity , however , is hardly just an innocuous result of a more heterogeneous society . 
It is a symptom of America &apos;s disgrace : pervasive discrimination against African Americans , reflected in median household income that is less than 60 % that of white households . 
The effects of lower income are exacerbated by the fact that the US is the only advanced country not to recognize access to health care as a basic right . 
Some white Americans , however , have attempted to shift the blame for dying younger to African Americans themselves , citing their &quot; lifestyles . &quot; 
It is perhaps true that unhealthy habits are more concentrated among poor Americans , a disproportionate number of whom are black . 
But these habits themselves are a consequence of economic conditions , not to mention the stresses of racism . 
The Case-Deaton results show that such theories will no longer do . 
America is becoming a more divided society - divided not only between whites and African Americans , but also between the 1 % and the rest , and between the highly educated and the less educated , regardless of race . 
And the gap can now be measured not just in wages , but also in early deaths . 
White Americans , too , are dying earlier as their incomes decline . 
This evidence is hardly a shock to those of us studying inequality in America . 
Wages of male high school graduates have plummeted by some 19 % in the period studied by Case and Deaton . 
To stay above water , many Americans borrowed from banks at usurious interest rates . 
In 2005 , President George W. Bush &apos;s administration made it far more difficult for households to declare bankruptcy and write off debt . 
Then came the financial crisis , which cost millions of Americans their jobs and homes . 
When unemployment insurance , designed for short-term bouts of joblessness in a full-employment world , ran out , they were left to fend for themselves , with no safety net ( beyond food stamps ) , while the government bailed out the banks that had caused the crisis . 
The basic perquisites of a middle-class life were increasingly beyond the reach of a growing share of Americans . 
The Great Recession had shown their vulnerability . 
Those who had invested in the stock market saw much of their wealth wiped out ; those who had put their money in safe government bonds saw retirement income diminish to near zero , as the Fed relentlessly drove down both short- and long-term interest rates . 
With college tuition soaring , the only way their children could get the education that would provide a modicum of hope was to borrow ; but , with education loans virtually never dischargeable , student debt seemed even worse than other forms of debt . 
There was no way that this mounting financial pressure could not have placed middle-class Americans and their families under greater stress . 
And it is not surprising that this has been reflected in higher rates of drug abuse , alcoholism , and suicide . 
I was chief economist of the World Bank in the late 1990s , when we began to receive similarly depressing news from Russia . 
Our data showed that GDP had fallen some 30 % since the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
But we weren &apos;t confident in our measurements . 
Data showing that male life expectancy was declining , even as it was increasing in the rest of the world , confirmed the impression that things were not going very well in Russia , especially outside of the major cities . 
The international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress , which I co-chaired and on which Deaton served , had earlier emphasized that GDP often is not a good measure of a society &apos;s wellbeing . 
These new data on white Americans &quot; declining health status confirms this conclusion . 
The world &apos;s quintessential middle-class society is on the way to becoming its first former middle-class society .
