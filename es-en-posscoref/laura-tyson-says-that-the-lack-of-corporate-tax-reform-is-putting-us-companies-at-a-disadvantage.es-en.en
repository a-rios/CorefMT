The Inverted World of Mobile Capital 
BERKELEY - A growing number of American companies are seeking to move their legal headquarters abroad by acquiring or merging with foreign companies . 
In the latest case , Medtronics plans to acquire Irish-based Covidien , a much smaller company spun off by US-based Tyco , and move its legal headquarters to low-tax Ireland , culminating in the largest ever &quot; inversion &quot; or &quot; redomiciliation &quot; of a US company . 
Such deals reflect the deep flaws in the United States &quot; corporate tax system . 
By contrast , all other G-7 countries have adopted &quot; territorial &quot; systems that impose little or no domestic tax on the repatriated earnings of their global companies . 
This difference puts US-headquartered multinationals at a disadvantage relative to their foreign competitors in foreign locations . 
To offset this , US multinationals take advantage of a deferral option in US tax law . 
Deferral allows them to postpone - potentially indefinitely - the payment of US corporate tax on their foreign earnings until they are repatriated . 
Not surprisingly , as their foreign earnings have grown as a share of total earnings , and as foreign corporate tax rates have plummeted , US companies &quot; stock of foreign earnings held abroad has soared , now topping $ 2 trillion . 
The US system thus implies significant costs , as companies hold more cash abroad , borrow more to finance domestic cash requirements , and invest more in foreign locations . 
Deferred earnings are &quot; locked out &quot; of the US economy : the government receives no tax revenues from them , and they are not directly available for domestic use by US companies . 
This undermines their ability to compete with foreign companies in acquiring other US companies . 
Overall , deferral distorts corporate balance sheets , imposing efficiency costs on US companies that are estimated to be 5-7 % of deferred earnings . 
As the stock of deferred earnings grows , these costs accumulate , and moving legal headquarters abroad through cross-border acquisitions becomes a logical step for US companies with a large stock of deferred earnings abroad . 
Companies like Medtronics can then use future foreign earnings in the US with little or no repatriation tax . 
To be sure , strategic rather than tax considerations drive corporate mergers and acquisitions . 
The recent surge in cross-border M &amp; As to a seven-year high is the result of ample cash , strong balance sheets , cheap financing , and buoyant stock markets . 
But tax considerations play a major role in corporate decisions regarding how acquisitions are financed and where a merged entity is located . 
Large balances of foreign earnings are available to many US firms to finance their foreign acquisitions , and the competitive disadvantages of the US corporate tax system militate against locating the merged entities in the US . 
Though American officials rail against &quot; inversions &quot; as unpatriotic , they are an efficiency-enhancing response to the flaws in the corporate tax system . 
As the prospects for corporate tax reform deteriorate , cross-border mergers with redomicilation are becoming an attractive option for many of America &apos;s most competitive global companies . 
And the pressure on other companies to follow suit intensifies as more inversion deals are done . 
Under current law , US companies can move their legal headquarters abroad for tax purposes by buying a smaller foreign company as long as the acquired company &apos;s shareholders end up owning at least 20 % of the combined company . 
Moreover , a merged foreign company would be treated as a US company for tax purposes ( regardless of share ownership ) if its management and control functions and a substantial share of its economic activity - sales , employment , or assets - are located in the US . 
If enacted , the legislation would apply these new conditions retroactively to inversions occurring from May 2014 . 
Such policies will not address the underlying causes of inversions , will add to the widely acknowledged distortions in the corporate tax regime , and are likely to have negative unintended consequences . 
To meet the tougher new ownership requirements , US companies might respond by breaking up their business units into smaller pieces - reducing their market value and the returns to their shareholders and workers . 
Likewise , to meet the tougher new management and control conditions , US companies might respond by shifting more of these functions , and the jobs and investment ( especially in research and development ) associated with them , to foreign locations . 
The proposed anti-inversion measures would also make it more likely that US companies are the target , rather than the acquirer , in cross-border M &amp; A deals . 
Corporate tax reform should make the US a more attractive place for business activity ; threatening US corporations with tougher rules on cross-border M &amp; A and retroactive tax increases will have the opposite effect . 
The US should learn from the British example . 
In 2008 , several large UK companies threatened to redomicile in Ireland because of its lower corporate tax rate . 
The British government responded by cutting its corporate tax rate from 28 % to 20 % by 2015 ; introducing a territorial tax system that exempts UK-based companies &quot; foreign earnings from domestic taxation ; enacting a &quot; patent box &quot; that provides a 10 % corporate rate on patent-related income ; and adopting a new 10 % non-incremental , refundable R &amp; D tax credit . 
So far , these innovations appear to be attracting companies , investment , R &amp; D , and jobs to the UK . 
Bold and prompt US action to reform the corporate tax system is essential .
