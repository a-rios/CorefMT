China &apos;s New Global Leadership 
NEW YORK - The biggest economic news of the year came almost without notice : China has overtaken the United States as the world &apos;s largest economy , according to the scorekeepers at the International Monetary Fund . 
And , while China &apos;s geopolitical status is rising rapidly , alongside its economic might , the US continues to squander its global leadership , owing to the unchecked greed of its political and economic elites and the self-made trap of perpetual war in the Middle East . 
According to the IMF , China &apos;s GDP will be $ 17.6 trillion in 2014 , outstripping US output of $ 17.4 trillion . 
Of course , because China &apos;s population is more than four times larger , its per capita GDP , at $ 12,900 , is still less than a quarter of the $ 54,700 recorded in the US , which highlights America &apos;s much higher living standards . 
China &apos;s rise is momentous , but it also signifies a return . 
After all , China has been the world &apos;s most populous country since it became a unified state more than 2,000 years ago , so it makes sense that it would also be the world &apos;s largest economy . 
And , indeed , the evidence suggests that China was larger ( in terms of purchasing power parity ) than any other economy in the world until around 1889 , when the US eclipsed it . 
Now , 125 years later , the rankings have reversed again , following decades of rapid economic development in China . 
With rising economic power has come growing geopolitical clout . 
Chinese leaders are feted around the world . 
African leaders view China as their countries &quot; new indispensable growth partner , particularly in infrastructure and business development . 
Similarly , economic strategists and business leaders in Latin America now look to China at least as much as they look to the US . 
China and Japan seem to be taking steps toward better relations , after a period of high tensions . 
Even Russia has recently &quot; tilted &quot; toward China , establishing stronger connections on many fronts , including energy and transport . 
Like the US after World War II , China is putting real money on the table - a lot of it - to build strong economic and infrastructure links with countries around the world . 
This will enable other countries to boost their own growth , while cementing China &apos;s global economic and geopolitical leadership . 
The number of Chinese initiatives is staggering . 
In just the past year , China has launched four major projects that promise to give it a greatly expanded role in global trade and finance . 
China joined Russia , Brazil , India , and South Africa in establishing the New Development Bank , to be based in Shanghai . 
A new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , to be based in Beijing , will help to fund infrastructure projects ( roads , power , and rail , among others ) throughout the region . 
The New Silk Road land belt seeks to connect China with the economies of East Asia , South Asia , Central Asia , and Europe through an expanded grid of rail , highways , power , fiber , and other networks . 
And the new 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is aimed at boosting ocean-based trade in East Asia and the Indian Ocean . 
All told , these various initiatives are likely to leverage hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over the coming decade , speeding growth in the counterpart countries while deepening their production , trade , and financial linkages with China . 
There is no guarantee that all of this will succeed or proceed smoothly . 
And if China becomes too aggressive toward its neighbors - for example , by demanding rights to offshore oil or territory in disputed waters - it will generate a serious diplomatic backlash . 
No one should assume smooth sailing for China ( or for any other part of the world , for that matter ) in the years ahead . 
Still , it is striking that just as China is rising economically and geopolitically , the US seems to be doing everything possible to waste its own economic , technological , and geopolitical advantages . 
The US political system has been captured by the greed of its wealthy elites , whose narrow goals are to cut corporate and personal tax rates , maximize their vast personal fortunes , and curtail constructive US leadership in global economic development . 
They so scorn US foreign assistance that they have thrown open the doors to China &apos;s new global leadership in development financing . 
Even worse , as China flexes its geopolitical muscles , the only foreign policy that the US systematically pursues is unceasing and fruitless war in the Middle East . 
The US endlessly drains its resources and energy in Syria and Iraq in the same way that it once did in Vietnam . 
China , meanwhile , has avoided becoming enmeshed in overseas military debacles , emphasizing win-win economic initiatives instead . 
China &apos;s economic rise can contribute to global wellbeing if its leaders emphasize investment in infrastructure , clean energy , public health , and other international priorities . 
Still , the world would be better off if the US also continued to lead constructively , alongside China . 
The recent announcement by Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping of bilateral agreements on climate change and clean energy show the best of what &apos;s possible . 
America &apos;s perpetual war-making in the Middle East shows the worst .
