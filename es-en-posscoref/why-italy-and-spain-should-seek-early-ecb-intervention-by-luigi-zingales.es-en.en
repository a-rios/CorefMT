Pulling the OMT Trigger 
CHICAGO - Europe has been experiencing a period of calm after the storm since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s &quot; whatever it takes &quot; speech in July and the ECB &apos;s decision in September to proceed with its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) program to purchase distressed eurozone members &quot; government bonds . 
The interest-rate spreads for Italian and Spanish government bonds have dropped dramatically , corporate-bond issues have resumed , and a sense of normalcy is slowly pervading the continent . 
But it would be foolish to conclude that the euro &apos;s problems have been solved . 
The economic fundamentals are far from stable , while the reduced financial tension is the fortunate outcome of an expectation game . 
As long as investors believe that Italy and Spain will eventually be rescued by the OMT , these countries &quot; borrowing costs will be low , and the rescue will not be needed . 
If , however , the slightest doubt about the OMT &apos;s effectiveness arises , the expectation game will shift into reverse , and both countries &quot; bonds will quickly come under attack . 
One such source of doubt may be the OMT &apos;s safety catch . 
The rules vary among EU countries , but , in Germany , &quot; government approval &quot; implies parliamentary approval . 
In an emergency situation , it is difficult to imagine that Germany will not prefer approval to the disaster of an Italian or Spanish default . 
Still , any delay could be enough to trigger a bank run in either country . 
To eliminate this uncertainty , Italy and Spain should ask for the OMT intervention before it is desperately needed - a request that the Bundestag would most likely approve , viewing it as an insurance scheme rather than a pure transfer . 
Doing so would also eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the program itself and its implementation mechanisms . 
Identifying and addressing problems when intervention is not urgently needed is much easier than working them out under the threat of a pending sovereign default . 
Finally , an early request for OMT intervention would not only reduce the Italian and Spanish governments &quot; borrowing costs ( and thus their fiscal deficits ) , but would also lower the cost of capital for local firms , which currently find it difficult to borrow and invest . 
Thus , it would provide a much-needed boost to these countries &quot; struggling economies . 
So , if triggering OMT intervention would be so beneficial , why are the Spanish and Italian governments so reluctant to do so ? 
The main reason is political . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , all European governments feared that breaking from the gold standard would be perceived as a sign of weakness . 
The same is true of the OMT program : elected politicians fear that triggering it would be perceived as a sign of weakness , implying a cost that they have a strong incentive to delay paying . 
But why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti , who is not an elected politician ( and has promised not to run for election ) , so hesitant ? 
Given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat , he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first , which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy &apos;s government were it to file subsequently . 
Triggering OMT now would also be a safe play for Italy in the face of an imminent general election with a highly uncertain outcome . 
What is not uncertain is that an anti-euro party , run by a professional comedian , Beppe Grillo , will gain at least 20 % of the Italian vote . 
The political instability that could ensue would not provide a good opportunity to ask Germany for help . 
In fact , if one were to imagine reasons why Germany might not approve a request by Italy to trigger the OMT , political turmoil would top the list . 
By contrast , triggering the OMT in advance would promote political stability in the face of uncertainty , because it would tie the hands of any future Italian government . 
Why , then , is Monti not acting ? 
One possible reason is personal pride . 
An alternative explanation is that Monti does indeed have political ambitions . 
While Monti &apos;s mandate was set to last until the election , he might be trying to extend it with the support of the new parliament . 
Delay for either of these reasons would be a very selfish act . 
Monti should not risk European stability for his personal benefit .
