Today \ u0027s Lessons from the Cuban Missile Crisis 
&quot; Thirteen Days , &quot; a new film about the Cuban Missile Crisis , will soon be showing in many countries . 
Everyone should see it ; not only for its dramatization of the past , but for insights into current events , especially the controversy surrounding America &apos;s plans to establish National Missile Defense and the various regional disputes - India and Pakistan , Taiwan and China , North and South Korea - that may one day escalate into nuclear conflict . 
On 16 October , 1962 President John F. Kennedy called together his closest advisors in the White House . 
Aerial photographs had revealed nuclear missile sites under construction in Cuba . 
The decisions taken and not taken over the following 13 days could have led to nuclear war . 
The film depicts what happened in the White House during those days . 
Audio tapes from Kennedy &apos;s presidency aided in making the film . 
After the film &apos;s debut in America , the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard arranged for a panel to discuss the film and the crisis at its heart . 
Participants included : Robert McNamara , President Kennedy &apos;s Secretary of Defense ; 
Theodore Sorensen , his close aid and speech writer ; 
Ernest R. May , a professor of history at Harvard who has written a book about &quot; The Kennedy Tapes &quot; ; and Graham Allison , a professor of political science at Harvard who , 30 years ago , wrote the classic study of the missile crisis &quot; Essence of Decision . &quot; 
Peter A. Almond , the film &apos;s producer also participated . 
Although the dramatization was criticized in some ways , the panel agreed that it portrayed the problems and pressures faced by President Kennedy exactly as they were . 
What conclusions can be drawn today from the Cuban Missile Crisis ? 
Theodore Sorensen summarized them in this way : 
- Advisors have roles to play in a crisis , but only the President has ultimate responsibility . 
A majority of Kennedy &apos;s advisors - civil and military - wanted to attack Cuba . 
Kennedy &apos;s sober analysis and penetrating questions brought to light alternatives and risks that were fundamental to determining the outcome ; 
- It is essential to understand how your opponent thinks and to keep lines of communication open . 
Cornering an opponent without keeping open diplomatic channels that allow you to understand his situation may prove fatal ; 
- America needs friends . 
Kennedy acted as he did because NATO , other allies , and world opinion supported him ; 
- Good decisions need time . 
When life and death issues are at stake , a leader can never let the media rush him into acting . 
The fact that a week passed in which to scrutinize and reflect upon all the factors involved was critical to the outcome . 
But would such time for reflection exist with today &apos;s mass media ? 
Robert McNamara emphasized the necessity of putting yourself in your opponent &apos;s position . 
In one of the film &apos;s many charged sequences , McNamara explains to a trigger-happy admiral that the naval blockade Kennedy had imposed on Cuba was primarily intended as a signal to Chairman Khrushchev of Kennedy &apos;s resolve , not as a means to stop specific Soviet ships . 
Could Kennedy have acted even more coolly ? 
After all , the US had installed nuclear missiles near the USSR . 
Khrushchev &apos;s actions in sending missiles to Cuba mirrored that policy . 
But Kennedy was anxious about the consequences of having Soviet missiles in Cuba on Berlin . 
Nuclear pressures from Cuba would have made defense of Berlin more difficult , which was part of Khrushchev &apos;s strategy . 
In the end , &quot; the Berlin Crisis was solved through the outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis , &quot; the historian Ernest May argued . 
&quot; It will soon be too late , &quot; was a common argument presented to Kennedy by his advisors . 
They wanted to attack Cuba while the missiles were , as they believed , at sea and on their way to Cuba . 
Around 180,000 US troops were prepared to invade ; plans existed for a bombing blitz bigger than that over Kosovo thirty six years later . 
&quot; It took thirty years before I found out , &quot; McNamara said , &quot; that there were already nuclear arms on Cuba : 162 charges , of which 90 were tactical nuclear weapons . &quot; 
McNamara received this information at a meeting with Fidel Castro . 
He asked Castro three questions : 1 ) Did you know ? 2 ) If so , what did you recommend ? 3 ) What would the consequences for Cuba have been ? 
Castro answered : &quot; I knew . 
I strongly recommended that nuclear weapons be used . 
I knew it would lead to Cuba &apos;s annihilation . &quot; 
Castro , and to a stronger degree , his comrade Che Guevara , were willing to let Cuba go up in smoke in order to make their country a martyr in the world revolutionary struggle ! 
So an invasion might have led to the death of 80 million Americans and the obliteration of Cuba simply because Kennedy &apos;s government did not have the facts right ( which is often more common than not when the executive must take a solitary decision . ) 
McNamara believes an invasion would &quot; certainly &quot; have triggered a Soviet nuclear attack against the US . 
For Khrushchev &apos;s control over the Soviet military in Cuba was limited ; 
One difficult question not raised during those discussions at Harvard is this : what would have happened if the opponent had not been Khrushchev , who behaved rather rationally throughout the crisis , but had been an irresponsible Saddam Hussein , Kim Jong Il or a fundamentalist ? 
With nuclear proliferation , that risk may one day become real . 
Today &apos;s discussions about a limited missile shield and the threat of nuclear blackmail from rogue states should be analyzed in the light of this terrible but realistic thought . 
Harvard has now put up a new web-site where vital documents about the Missile Crisis and today &apos;s nuclear threats can be found : www.cubanmissilecrisis.org .
