Living the Saudi Dream 
IRVING , TEXAS - Saudi Arabia wants it all : to salvage OPEC , achieve income diversification and industrialization , and preserve its market share in crude oil , petroleum products , petrochemicals , and natural gas liquids ( NGLs ) . 
Whether the Saudis succeed will be determined largely by the shale-energy industry in the United States . 
The US shale revolution divided OPEC according to the quality of its members &apos; crude oil . 
Exporters of light sweet crude - such as Algeria , Angola , and Nigeria - lost nearly all of their market share in the US , while exporters of sour or heavier crude , including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , have lost little . 
Because almost all crude oil produced by the Gulf States is sour , and most of the global surplus is sweet , any production cut by Saudi Arabia and its neighbors would not drive prices back up and rebalance the oil market . 
The only way to do that - and prevent an OPEC breakup - would be to reduce the production of light sweet crude , including by US producers , which would thus lose market share . 
If this occurred , oil prices could be expected to rise again relatively quickly . 
If , however , Saudi Arabia remains more committed to its strategic development objectives , low oil prices could persist . 
Since the 1970s , several OPEC members , led by Saudi Arabia , have worked to diversify their industrial base by promoting sectors with a comparative advantage , such as petrochemicals , and building mega-refineries to enable the export of value-added products . 
At the same time , to boost revenues , they expanded exports of NGLs , which are not counted in OPEC quotas . 
But just when these countries were beginning to achieve success , the US shale revolution emerged , threatening all three of their main strategic objectives . 
The key to the competitiveness of Saudi Arabia &apos;s petrochemical industry was its use of natural gas and ethane , which was far less expensive than the oil product naphtha on which its global competitors depended . 
Now that the US is producing massive amounts of low-price natural gas and ethane , Saudi Arabia &apos;s competitive advantage - and market share - is beginning to deteriorate . 
The same goes for refining . 
Since the US does not allow exports of crude oil , the shale revolution pushed down the US benchmark price , the West Texas Intermediate , relative to international crude prices , sometimes with differentials as wide as $ 20 . 
US refiners took advantage of lower prices to increase their exports of petroleum products - so much so , that they are now threatening the market share of Saudi refineries in Asia and elsewhere . 
Likewise , US companies have increased NGL production considerably , enabling the country to slash its liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) imports and expand its NGL exports significantly . 
As a result , Saudi Arabia has lost market share to US producers in Central and South America . 
But the recent collapse in oil prices could change this dynamic . 
In refusing to cut its own production , Saudi Arabia seems to be hoping that low oil prices will drive down investment in US shale energy , undermining production growth there . 
Low prices may already have contributed to delays in America &apos;s decision to begin exporting crude oil , as well as to the political viability of US President Barack Obama &apos;s veto of the Keystone XL pipeline , intended to transport oil from the Canadian tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico for export . 
Add to that the delay in the opening of the Mexican energy sector , and it seems that low oil prices could amount to a net gain for the Kingdom . 
Though Saudi Arabia &apos;s motivation in not cutting production was probably almost entirely economic , low oil prices could also offer distinct political advantages . 
Most notably , the decline in prices is creating serious challenges for Iran , the Kingdom &apos;s main rival in the region , as well as for the unstable , oil-dependent economies of Russia and Venezuela . 
None of these countries has adequate savings to cushion the blow of reduced revenues . 
Under these circumstances , it seems likely that Saudi Arabia will continue to refuse to cut oil production , leaving prices low until market forces trigger a rebound . 
And even then , the price increase could be limited . 
After all , game theory dictates that , once the surplus is eliminated , the dominant producer must prevent oil prices from rising high enough to cause it to lose market share again . 
That means that Saudi Arabia will try to compel non-OPEC countries , mainly in North America , to keep oil-production increases commensurate with growth in global demand . 
In short , it is in Saudi Arabia &apos;s interest for oil prices to rise high enough to sustain its own economy , but not so high that they can sustain significant increases in non-OPEC supply . 
In order to keep prices in this ideal range , Saudi Arabia may even increase production again . 
This strategy is not without risk . 
In the short run , excessively low prices could trigger political instability in some oil-producing countries , driving up prices . 
Similarly , delays in upstream investment , especially megaprojects , could push prices above the ideal level in the medium and long term . 
But perhaps the biggest risk lies with the US shale-oil industry . 
Over the next few years , US producers are likely to retrench , focus on sweet spots , improve technology , reduce costs , and increase production once again . 
At that point , Saudi Arabia &apos;s current strategy may no longer be adequate to sustain its market dominance .
