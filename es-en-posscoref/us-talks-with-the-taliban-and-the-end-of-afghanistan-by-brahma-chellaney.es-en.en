Afghanistan &apos;s Unavoidable Partition 
NEW DELHI - The United States , still mired in a protracted war in Afghanistan that has exacted a staggering cost in blood and treasure , will formally open peace talks with the Taliban , its main battlefield opponent , in the coming days ( apparently despite last-minute opposition from Afghan President Hamid Karzai ) . 
With the US determined to withdraw its forces after more than a decade of fighting , the talks in Doha , Qatar , are largely intended to allow it to do so &quot; honorably . &quot; 
How the end of US-led combat operations shapes Afghanistan &apos;s future will affect the security of countries nearby and beyond . 
Here the most important question is whether the fate of Afghanistan , which was created as a buffer between Czarist Russia and British India , will be - or should be - different from that of Iraq and Libya ( two other imperial creations where the US has intervened militarily in recent years ) . 
Foreign military intervention can effect regime change , but it evidently cannot reestablish order based on centralized government . 
Iraq has been partitioned in all but name into Shia , Sunni , and Kurdish regions , while Libya seems headed toward a similar tripartite , tribal-based territorial arrangement . 
In Afghanistan , too , an Iraq-style &quot; soft &quot; partition may be the best possible outcome . 
Afghanistan &apos;s large ethnic groups already enjoy de facto autonomy , which they secured after their Northern Alliance played a central role in the US-led ouster of the Taliban from power in late 2001 . 
Having enjoyed virtual self-rule since then , they will fiercely resist falling back under the sway of the Pashtuns , who have ruled the country for most of its history . 
For their part , the Pashtuns , despite their tribal divisions , will not be content with control of a rump Afghanistan consisting of its current eastern and southeastern provinces . 
They will eventually seek integration with fellow Pashtuns in Pakistan , across the British-drawn Durand Line - a border that Afghanistan has never recognized . 
The demand for a &quot; Greater Pashtunistan &quot; would then challenge the territorial integrity of Pakistan ( itself another artificial imperial construct ) . 
The fact that Afghanistan &apos;s ethnic groups are concentrated in distinct geographical zones would simplify partition and make the resulting borders more likely to last , unlike those drawn by colonial officials , who invented countries with no national identity or historical roots . 
Indeed , both geographically and demographically , Afghanistan &apos;s non-Pashtun groups account for more than half of the country , with Tajiks , Uzbeks , and Hazaras alone making up close to 50 % of the population . 
After waging the longest war in its history , at a cost of tens of thousands of lives and nearly a trillion dollars , the US is combat-weary and financially strapped . 
But the American effort to cut a deal with the Pashtun-based , Pakistan-backed Taliban is stirring deep unease among the non-Pashtun groups , which suffered greatly under the Taliban and its five-year rule . 
( The historically persecuted Hazaras , for example , suffered several large-scale massacres . ) 
While Karzai has been fickle , to say the least , about cooperation with the Americans ( indeed , he has since backed away from participation in the Doha talks ) , the rupture of his political alliance with non-Pashtun leaders has also fueled ethnic polarization . 
Some non-Pashtun power brokers continue to support Karzai , but many others are now leading the opposition National Front . 
These leaders are unlikely to accept any power-sharing arrangement that includes the Taliban . 
In fact , they suspect that Karzai &apos;s ultimate goal is to restore Pashtun dominance throughout Afghanistan . 
Their misgivings have been strengthened by the &quot; Peace Process Roadmap to 2015 , &quot; a document prepared by the Karzai-constituted Afghan High Peace Council that sketches several potential concessions to the Taliban and Pakistan , ranging from the Taliban &apos;s recognition as a political party to a role for Pakistan in Afghanistan &apos;s internal affairs . 
The roadmap even dangles the carrot of cabinet posts and provincial governorships to prominent Taliban figures . 
The most serious problem today is that the country &apos;s ethnic tensions and recriminations threaten to undermine the cohesion of the fledgling , multiethnic Afghan Army . 
Indeed , the splits today resemble those that occurred when Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 , an exit that led to civil war and the Taliban &apos;s eventual capture of the capital , Kabul . 
This time , the non-Pashtun communities are better armed and prepared to defend their interests after the US withdrawal . 
Thus , in seeking to co-opt the Taliban , the US is not only bestowing legitimacy on a thuggish militia ; it also risks unwittingly reigniting Afghanistan &apos;s ethnic strife , which would most likely tear the country apart for good . 
This raises a fundamental question : Is Afghanistan &apos;s territorial unity really essential for regional or international security ? 
To be sure , the sanctity of existing borders has become a powerful norm in world politics . 
Yet this norm has permitted the emergence of ungovernable and unmanageable states , whose internal wars spill across international boundaries , fueling regional tensions and insecurity . 
With a war-exhausted US having run out of patience , outside forces are in no position to prevent Afghanistan &apos;s partition along Iraqi ( or even post-Yugoslav ) lines , with the bloodiest battles expected to rage over control of ethnically mixed strategic areas , including Kabul . 
In this scenario , Pakistani generals , instead of continuing to sponsor Afghan Pashtun militant groups ( like the Taliban and their allies like the Haqqani network ) , would be compelled to fend off a potentially grave threat to Pakistan &apos;s unity . 
A weak , partitioned Afghanistan may not be a desirable outcome ; but a &quot; soft &quot; partition now would be far better than a &quot; hard &quot; partition later , after years of chaos and bloodletting - and infinitely better than the medieval Taliban &apos;s return to power and a fresh reign of terror . 
Indeed , partition may be the only way to prevent Afghanistan from sliding into large-scale civil war and to thwart transnational terrorists from reestablishing a base of operations in the rubble .
