Schengen and European Security 
BRUSSELS - Another key European project is under threat . 
Some two decades after border controls were first abolished under the Schengen Agreement - which now includes 26 countries , including four non-members of the European Union - Germany has reinstated controls at its border with Austria , and France at its border with Belgium . 
The controls are meant to be temporary , and the vast majority of other borders remain open . 
But more openness does not seem to be the direction in which Europe is headed - and that is a serious problem . 
The shift away from a &quot; Europe without borders , &quot; instigated by images of refugees walking across internal frontiers , was fortified by the news that most of those who carried out last month &apos;s Paris attacks came from Belgium , and that some may have entered the EU via the Balkans , posing as refugees . 
The underlying assumption - reinforced by many European politicians , especially interior ministers - is that there is a tradeoff between security and openness . 
This is far from accurate . 
In fact , the reinstatement of border controls seems to be an example of &quot; security theater &quot; - a policy intended to make the public feel like something is being done . 
But , far from making Europeans safer , rolling back Schengen would actually hinder the fight against terrorism , because countries would be forced to devote valuable resources - thousands of police officers , if the agreement were to be abolished altogether - to checking documents at borders . 
Those resources would no longer contribute directly to investigations into terrorist activities . 
And those investigations need all the help they can get . 
After all , the objective - to identify a few terrorists hiding among millions of law-abiding citizens , before they commit a violent act - is the equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack . 
The recognition of the flawed logic behind reinstating border controls is probably why police officials have remained guarded in discussing the issue . 
It should be remembered that when five countries - Belgium , France , Germany , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands - agreed in 1985 ( in the village of Schengen , Luxembourg ) to abolish border controls , they did not do so on a whim or because some politicians had a lofty vision . 
However symbolic the agreement may have been , symbolism wasn &apos;t the point . 
Participating countries &quot; security establishments had recognized that stopping people at the internal borders did not help them counter major threats , such as organized crime and drug smuggling . 
Truck drivers , who protested against long waits at customs stations , helped spur the effort . 
But it took another decade of hard-nosed , detailed negotiations , entailing efforts to strengthen the EU &apos;s external borders , to reach the point , in 1995 , where internal border controls could actually be lifted . 
The subsequent decision by non-EU countries like Switzerland to join the Schengen Area highlights the massive benefits , including for security , of maintaining open borders . 
Rather than attempt to control the masses of tourists and business travelers entering the country from all sides - essentially an exercise in futility in Switzerland - the country decided to focus police resources specifically on security threats . 
By joining Schengen , the Swiss police also gained access to the Schengen Information System and other important European databases on criminal suspects , stolen cars , and more . 
Of course , there are flaws in the Schengen system . 
Like the eurozone , the area began with only a small group of member countries , all of which had a similar outlook and capacity to implement common rules , but soon welcomed many others , some of which , it later became apparent , could not uphold agreed standards . 
In the eurozone , imbalances in competitiveness and fiscal positions - which were not noted during the perfunctory check , based on formal criteria , that was conducted before approving new members - led to a protracted economic crisis . 
In the Schengen Area , some countries &quot; inability to protect external borders adequately - owing to a lack of administrative capacity ( especially true in Greece , but also , to some extent , Italy ) , together with geographic challenges like long and fractured coast lines - have undermined confidence in the face of the refugee crisis . 
The eurozone survived its crisis for two key reasons . 
First , a common institution , the European Central Bank , had the power to act . 
Second , member states relinquished some control over their banks , in order to boost the system &apos;s overall stability . 
If the Schengen Area is to endure , it needs to evolve in a similar direction , establishing a common institution responsible for securing external borders , while reinforcing the framework for internal security . 
As it stands , defense of Schengen &apos;s external borders is up to individual member states , including one , Greece , that is already facing a devastating economic crisis . 
The only EU-wide operation aimed at helping police the external border , called Frontex , is severely limited in scope . 
What the Schengen Area needs is a true European coast guard , with its own budget , ships , and personnel . 
The Mediterranean can be expected to remain the main security challenge for some time , owing both to illegal immigration and its proximity to terrorist training grounds . 
It thus makes sense for the new coast guard , backed by EU funds , to start there . 
Even a small fraction of the EU budget would far exceed the available resources of any individual country . 
Moreover , a European coast guard would provide a flexible tool with which to allocate resources as effectively as possible at any given moment . 
After all , even if security threats remain concentrated in the same broad area , the most urgent challenges can shift considerably over time . 
Last year , the problem was Southern Italy . 
Today , it is the Aegean . 
Tomorrow it might be somewhere else . 
Europe needs to prepare for any eventuality . 
It is not only possible to have both openness and security ; the former can actually bolster the latter . 
The Schengen Area &apos;s members need to recognize that the security rationale for abolishing internal borders remains as compelling today as it was when they joined .
