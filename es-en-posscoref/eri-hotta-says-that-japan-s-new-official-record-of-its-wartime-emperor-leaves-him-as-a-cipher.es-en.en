The Ghost of Hirohito 
NEW YORK - The completion by Japan &apos;s Imperial Household Agency of the 61-volume record of the life of Emperor Hirohito ( 1901-1989 ) has generated much interest and attention in Japan . 
The entire formidable work was recently opened to limited public viewing , with a plan to publish it over the next five years . 
Having taken a quarter-century to compile , the project relied on some 40 new sources , most notably the diary and notes of Saburo Hyakutake , an admiral who served as Court Chamberlain from 1936 to 1944 . 
Perhaps this is not surprising , coming from a conservative imperial institution &apos;s official team of editors . 
The record takes to new lengths the idea that the historian &apos;s task , as Leopold von Ranke put it in the nineteenth century , is to show &quot; what actually happened . &quot; 
It is said to be an excellent chronicle of the court &apos;s day-to-day goings-on , revealing , for example , that the emperor celebrated Christmas as a boy , that he had nose surgery in his youth , and how often he met with whom . 
To be fair , such tidbits can be interesting and useful . 
Readers will be disappointed if they want to learn more about Japan &apos;s entry into the Pacific War , its defeat , the Allied occupation ( especially Hirohito &apos;s relationship with General Douglas MacArthur ) , or Hirohito &apos;s later reluctance to visit the Yasukuni Shrine , where Imperial Japan &apos;s war dead , including Class-A war criminals , are honored . 
What is already known about Hirohito is sketchy . 
As a young sovereign ( imperial regent at age 20 ; emperor at 25 ) , he had to assume contradictory roles : divine pater familias of the Japanese state and Supreme Commander of the imperial armed forces that were colonizing Japan &apos;s Asian neighbors . 
He could not have been the bravest or most decisive man , given that he was unable to resist rising militarism . 
The conflict between Hirohito &apos;s divine and secular roles became most acute in the autumn of 1941 , when Japan &apos;s leaders debated whether to go to war with the United States and its allies . 
On September 6 , an imperial conference was convened to approve a timetable for war mobilization in the event of a breakdown in US-Japanese diplomatic talks . 
As was true of all imperial conferences , Hirohito was expected to remain silent and approve a policy that already had been decided . 
Breaking with protocol , however , Hirohito cautioned against giving up on diplomacy too soon , and then recited his grandfather Emperor Meiji &apos;s poem from the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War , in 1904 : &quot; Beyond all four seas , all are brothers and sisters / Then why oh why these rough winds and waves ? &quot; 
Thus , Hirohito might have been seeking to express his view that Japan should avoid a war with the US , especially given that the country had been fighting a savage and unsuccessful war of conquest in China for more than four years . 
But , whatever Hirohito &apos;s true intentions ( which we cannot know for certain ) , the larger fact remains that he went along with the war mobilization . 
Just as he dithered over going to war with the US , Hirohito was hopelessly ambivalent about how to end it . 
The new record reports that Hirohito told his closest adviser , Privy Seal K≈çichi Kido , on September 26 , 1944 : &quot; If one could come to a peace without the question of disarmament or war responsibility , I don &apos;t care &#91; if &#93; our conquered territories &#91; are taken away &#93; . &quot; 
This is reportedly the first indication in the new account about Hirohito &apos;s desire to end the war . 
But , whatever his true desire , his subsequent actions were - once again - not those of a man actively trying to find a path to peace . 
For months , he told himself and others that first &quot; Japan must have another brilliant military gain &quot; over the US , so that it would have a modicum of diplomatic clout in negotiating a postwar settlement . 
Needless to say , many Japanese and non-Japanese lives were lost during those months of indecision . 
Indeed , the very existence of the Japanese nation was endangered , as most cities were bombed , Okinawa was invaded , and atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
In the end , Japan was disarmed , postwar trials were held , and most of the country &apos;s imperial conquests were reversed . 
And yet Hirohito still managed to sidestep the question of his own responsibility in a war that was so obviously fought in his name . 
Amid the postwar devastation , he became a symbol of peace . 
The most important lesson of the new imperial record , then , might be quite different from what its compilers had intended . 
Japan &apos;s notorious collective inability to come to terms with its past is deeply entwined with its inability to understand this emperor . 
Admittedly , the new account makes only selective use of primary sources , quite a few of which have not been declassified in their entirety . 
It is possible that more revelations will emerge in the future .
