Realism about Russia 
BERLIN - Russia &apos;s strategy to revise the post-Soviet order in what it calls its &quot; near abroad &quot; will be pursued with even more perseverance following its victory over Georgia . 
Europe should have no illusions about this and should begin to prepare itself . 
But , as the European Union ponders what to do , cold realism , not hysterical overreaction , is in order . 
Unfortunately , equating the current situation in the Caucasus with the Soviet Union &apos;s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 does not attest to this kind of realism . 
Neither the West nor NATO constitutes the decisive strategic threat facing Russia , which comes from the Islamic South and from the Far East , in particular the emerging superpower , China . 
Moreover , Russia &apos;s strength is in no way comparable to that of the former Soviet Union . 
Indeed , demographically , Russia is undergoing a dramatic decline . 
Apart from commodity exports , it has little to offer to the global economy . 
Notwithstanding booming oil and gas revenues , its infrastructure remains underdeveloped , and successful economic modernization is a long way off . 
Likewise , its political and legal system is authoritarian , and its numerous minority problems remain unsolved . 
As a result , Russia &apos;s current challenging of the territorial integrity of Georgia might prove to be a grave error in the not-so-distant future . 
Given this structural weakness , the idea of a new Cold War is misleading . 
The Cold War was an endurance race between two similarly strong rivals , the weaker of which eventually had to give up . 
Russia does not have the capacity to wage another struggle of that type . 
Nevertheless , as a restored great power , the new Russia will for the time being attempt to ride in the slipstream of other great powers for as long as doing so coincides with its possibilities and interests ; it will concentrate on its own sphere of influence and on its role as a global energy power ; and it will otherwise make use of its opportunities on a global scale to limit America &apos;s power . 
But it will not be able to seriously challenge the United States - or looking towards the future , China - in ways that the Soviet Union once did . 
It is now clear that in the future , Russia will once again pursue its vital interests with military force - particularly in its &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
But Europe must never accept a renewal of Russian great power politics , which operates according to the idea that might makes right . 
Indeed , it is here that Russia &apos;s renewed confrontation with the West begins , because the new Europe is based on the principle of the inviolability of boundaries , peaceful conflict resolution , and the rule of law , so to forgo this principle for the benefit of imperial zones of influence would amount to self-abandonment . 
Further eastward expansion of NATO , however , will be possible only against fierce Russian resistance . 
Nor will this kind of policy in any way create more security , because it entails making promises that won &apos;t be kept in an emergency - as we now see in Georgia . 
For too long , the West has ignored Russia &apos;s recovery of strength and was not prepared to accept the consequences . 
But not only Russia has changed ; so has the entire world . 
America &apos;s neo-conservatives have wasted a large part of their country &apos;s power and moral authority in an unnecessary war in Iraq , willfully weakening the only global Western power . 
China , India , Brazil , Russia , and the Persian Gulf today are the world economy &apos;s new growth centers and will soon be centers of power to be reckoned with . 
In view of these realities , the threat of exclusion from the G8 doesn &apos;t really feel earth shattering to Russia . 
Europe &apos;s disunity and impotence underline this image of a West that has partially lost touch with geo-political realities . 
The response to the return of Russia &apos;s imperial great power politics has nothing to do with punishing Russia , and a lot to do with establishing innately Western - especially European - positions of power . 
This requires several measures : 
· a new political dynamism vis-à-vis Turkey to link this country , one crucial for European security , permanently to Europe ; 
· putting a stop to Moscow &apos;s divide-and-conquer politics by adopting a common EU energy policy ; 
· a serious initiative for strengthening Europe &apos;s defense capabilities ; 
· a greater EU commitment to Ukraine to safeguard its independence ; 
· a greater freedom of travel for all the EU &apos;s Eastern neighbors . 
All of this , and much more , is needed to send a clear signal to Russia that Europe is unwilling to stand idly by as it returns to great power politics . 
Presumably , none of this will happen , and it is precisely such inaction that is , in large part , the cause of Russia &apos;s strength and Europe &apos;s weakness . 
At the same time , however , one shouldn &apos;t lose sight of the joint interests linking Russia and the West . 
Cooperative relations should be maintained as far as possible . 
It is blatantly obvious that for Russia &apos;s elites , weakness and cooperation are mutually exclusive . 
Therefore , whoever wants cooperation with Russia - which is in Europe &apos;s interest - must be strong . 
That is the lesson from the violence in the Caucasus that Europe must urgently take to heart .
