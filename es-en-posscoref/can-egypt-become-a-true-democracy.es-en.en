Can Egypt Become a True Democracy ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - Hosni Mubarak &apos;s resignation as President of Egypt marks the beginning of an important stage in that country &apos;s transition to a new political system . 
But will the political transition ultimately lead to democracy ? 
We cannot know with certainty , but , based on the history of democratic government , and the experiences of other countries - the subject of my book , Democracy &apos;s Good Name : The Rise and Risks of the World &apos;s Most Popular Form of Government - we can identify the obstacles that Egypt faces , as well as the advantages it enjoys , in building political democracy . 
Understanding any country &apos;s democratic prospects must begin with a definition of democracy , which is a hybrid form of government , a fusion of two different political traditions . 
The first is popular sovereignty , the rule of the people , which is exercised through elections . 
Freedom comes in three varieties : political liberty , which takes the form of individual rights to free speech and association ; religious liberty , which implies freedom of worship for all faiths ; and economic liberty , which is embodied in the right to own property . 
Elections without liberty do not constitute genuine democracy , and here Egypt faces a serious challenge : its best-organized group , the Muslim Brotherhood , rejects religious liberty and individual rights , especially the rights of women . 
The Brotherhood &apos;s offshoot , the Palestinian movement Hamas , has established in the Gaza Strip a brutal , intolerant dictatorship . 
In conditions of chaos , which Egypt could face , the best-organized and most ruthless group often gets control of the government . 
This was Russia &apos;s fate after its 1917 revolution , which brought Lenin &apos;s Bolsheviks to power and condemned the country to 75 years of totalitarian rule . 
In the same way , the Muslim Brotherhood could seize power in Egypt and impose a far more oppressive regime than Mubarak &apos;s ever was . 
Even if Egypt avoids control by religious extremists , democracy &apos;s two-part anatomy makes swift and smooth progress to a democratic system problematic . 
While elections are relatively easy to stage , liberty is far more difficult to establish and sustain , for it requires institutions - such as a legal system with impartial courts - that Egypt lacks , and that take years to build . 
In other countries that have become democracies , the institutions and practices of liberty have often emerged from the working of a free-market economy . 
Commerce fosters the habits of trust and cooperation on which stable democracy depends . 
It is no accident that a free-market economy preceded democratic politics in many countries in Latin America and Asia in the second half of the twentieth century . 
Here , too , Egypt is at a disadvantage . 
Its economy is a variant of crony capitalism , in which economic success depends on one &apos;s political connections , rather than on the meritocratic free-market competition from which liberty grows . 
Egypt suffers from another political handicap : it is an Arab country , and there are no Arab democracies . 
This matters , because countries , like individuals , tend to emulate others that they resemble and admire . 
After they overthrew communism in 1989 , the peoples of Central Europe gravitated to democracy because that was the prevailing form of government in the countries of Western Europe , with which they strongly identified . 
Egypt has no such democratic model . 
Egypt is , however , better placed to embrace democracy than the other Arab countries , because the obstacles to democracy in the Arab world are less formidable in Egypt than elsewhere . 
Other Arab countries - Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon , for example - are sharply divided along tribal , ethnic , and religious lines . 
In divided societies , the most powerful group is often unwilling to share power with the others , resulting in dictatorship . 
Egypt , by contrast , is relatively homogeneous . 
Christians , who make up 10 % of the population , are the only sizable minority . 
The oil that the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf have in abundance also works against democracy , for it creates an incentive for the rulers to retain power indefinitely . 
Oil revenues enable them to bribe the population to remain politically passive , while discouraging the creation of the kind of free-market system that breeds democracy . 
Fortunately for its democratic prospects , Egypt has only very modest reserves of natural gas and oil . 
The fact that the large protest movement that suddenly materialized has , until now , been a peaceful one also counts as an advantage for building democracy . 
When a government falls violently , the new regime usually rules by force , not by democratic procedures , if only to keep at bay those it has defeated . 
The cause of democracy in Egypt has one other asset , the most important one of all . 
Democracy requires democrats - citizens convinced of the value of liberty and popular sovereignty and committed to establishing and preserving them . 
The political sentiments of many of the hundreds of thousands of people who gathered in Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square over the last three weeks leave little doubt that they do want democracy , and are willing to work and even to sacrifice for it . Whether they are numerous enough , resourceful enough , patient enough , wise enough , and brave enough - and whether they will be lucky enough - to achieve it is a question that only the people of Egypt can answer .
