Blair &apos;s EU disaster 
When voters in France and the Netherlands turned down the proposal for a Constitution for the European Union , the world knew that the European project was in deep trouble . 
Last week &apos;s bruising battle over the medium-term future of the Union &apos;s budget has confirmed that verdict with a vengeance . 
It also brought to a sorry close the UK &apos;s six-month presidency of the European Council , confirming Britain &apos;s long-standing reputation as the odd-man-out in the European Union . 
The two events are intimately connected . 
French and Dutch voters did not say why they voted against the planned Constitution . 
But many commentators believe that they were protesting against what they perceived as the precipitate admission of ten new member states , mainly much poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe . 
In particular , voters were afraid that their jobs would be lost to hordes of Eastern immigrants , exemplified in the image widely quoted at the time , of the low-cost Polish plumber . 
The irony , of course , was that most of the 15 old member states had refused to give the new members full and immediate access to the Western job markets . 
But in any event , it was too late to protest : the ten Eastern states had already been granted membership of the Union . 
But now the 25 member states must deal with the financial consequences of that enlargement , not just in the overall size of the European Union budget for the next seven years , but in who pays and who benefits . 
In particular , the central issue is how far the old member states are willing to pay to boost the less developed economies of the new members . 
In the event , it turned into a three-way battle between Britain , France and the new member states . 
Traditionally , a large majority of the budget has gone either on agriculture or on the development of backward regions . 
In practice , this has meant large flows of money either to big agricultural producers , like France , or to poorer member states , like Greece and Portugal . 
On both counts , the new member states expected to benefit substantially from the EU system . 
In the past , the big loser from the EU system , in budgetary terms , was the UK ; for while agriculture accounted for two thirds of all EU spending , the UK had a small farm sector , and therefore received small farm payments . 
The British long complained of the unfairness of these rules , especially in view of the fact that the UK was one of the relatively poorer member states ; and in 1984 , Margaret Thatcher &apos;s Conservative government demanded , and got , a massive rebate on its net contribution to the EU budget . 
Today , the situation has changed in three important respects . 
EU farm policy has started to be reformed , and its share of the EU budget has fallen from over 60 % to 40 % ; 
When negotiations started six months ago , it was Britain &apos;s turn to take over the Presidency of the European Council . 
Tony Blair , British Prime Minister , electrified the world of European politics by telling the European Parliament that he was a &quot; passionate pro-European . &quot; 
This was a message for which Britain &apos;s European friends had long been hoping , and for which they had waited in vain since Blair &apos;s election in 1997 . 
Certainly , he had never expressed any such sentiment inside the British Isles during the previous eight years . 
Since Britain had been one of the most insistent advocates of enlargement of the EU to the candidates from Central and Eastern Europe , one might have expected that the Blair government would have wished to be correspondingly generous to the new-comers in the conduct of the budgetary negotiations . 
At first , this seemed to be the British government &apos;s chosen tactic . 
Against all expectations , it struck a morally advantageous posture by offering to surrender some part of its budget rebate , but only if the rest of the European Union ( i.e. France , in particular ) would agree to fundamental reforms of EU farm policy . 
It took some time before the British came to understand that since President Jacques Chirac is a beleaguered lame-duck President , who will remain in office but not in power until 2007 , he is in no position to agree to any such bargain . 
So when the British came to terms with this harsh reality , they played out the lamentable end-game of their management of the negotiations with small-minded cheese-paring and logic-chopping offers , all designed primarily to safeguard narrow British interests , mainly at the expense of the new member states . 
It is a sad conclusion to a presidency , launched six-months ago , with Blair &apos;s claim that he was a &quot; passionate pro-European . &quot; 
Yet the full text of his speech tells it all . 
Blair is in favour of Europe ; but not this Europe . 
He wants to be a part of a political Europe ; but only if the other member states follow Britain &apos;s model of economic and social reform . 
The problem is that economic and social reform are purely national responsibilities , and do not lie within the competence of the Union ; if there is to be economic and social reform in France and Germany , that is a matter exclusively for French and German voters and politicians . 
It could only be a European matter , if the EU were a real federation . 
Is Blair a federalist , then ? 
Heavens , no ! 
He is merely an unthinking nationalist , living in terror of the nationalist yellow tabloid press . 
So why does he say he is a passionate pro-European ? 
Because he has not thought about the question for one moment .
