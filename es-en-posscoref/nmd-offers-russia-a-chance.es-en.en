NMD Offers Russia A Chance 
&quot; We have lived like pigs for half-a-century , so why not keep living like that for another fifty years ? &quot; 
In essence , that is what those who stonewall in defence of the 1972 ABM Treaty are saying when they reject all options to create anti-ballistic missile defensive systems . 
By opposing the development of such systems , however , the pro-ABM Treaty position creates a situation in which unsuspecting and peaceful citizens in Russia , the United States , and other countries are held permanently hostage to nuclear blackmail . 
The &quot; ABM at any cost &quot; view could only have &quot; guaranteed peace &quot; during the insanity of the Cold War . 
It certainly did not prevent an accelerated arms race . 
Indeed , the first strategic nuclear arms reductions were not agreed upon until two decades later with the START-2 Treaty of 1993 , a time when relations between Moscow and Washington had become more reasonable and realistic . 
Although the START-2 Treaty confirmed the ABM Treaty &apos;s importance , it also implied that new and more radical steps towards disarmament would follow . 
Unfortunately , this did not happen ; it took Moscow 8 years to ratify START-2 . 
In the interim , new threats have arisen . 
Today , it is not only the superpowers who are capable of blackmailing the world with &quot; super-murder . &quot; 
Mini-powers and even terrorist groups can adopt mass blackmail as their policy . 
Russia is as vulnerable as any country to such blackmail . 
So standing in support of the ABM Treaty and its ban on all national missile defenses is of no help to anyone . 
Despite this , Russia automatically opposes change . 
Why ? 
When will Russians stop being maniac and obsessive about America ? 
The inferiority complex of Russia &apos;s derzhavniki ( advocates of a powerful , effective state ) reflects only weakness , not strength . 
It is similar to the fanatic feelings of a mouse who thinks that there is nothing more fearful than a cat . 
But with its gigantic financial , economic , and technological resources , America can be an exceptional partner for Russia as well as a nemesis . 
It is to that positive partnership that Russia should look . 
For example , everyone knows how hard it was for Russia over the past decade to maintain its image as a space power . 
Today , due to American cooperation , Russia can do things in space that only yesterday seemed impossible . 
Tourists are going into space ! 
The Russian goes for free , the American pays a fee of $ 20 million . 
As strange as &quot; space tourism &quot; seemed two months ago , what seems like a fairy-tale today - cooperation with America to develop systems to prevent nuclear and missile terrorism - can become a reality tomorrow if Russia acts in its own interests . 
Those interests are crystal clear . 
Today , Pakistani generals who are notorious for organizing coups and helping the Taliban , possess atomic bombs . 
Tomorrow , Iranian generals may acquire atomic weapons . 
North Korea already assists them with arms . 
Russia is threatened by this as much as anyone . 
So it is in Russia &apos;s national interest - in the interest of its territorial integrity , the development of its military-industrial complex , the stoppage of a &quot; brain drain &quot; of its best minds to the West - to find the means to participate in this American &quot; project of the century &quot; - the National Missile Defense . 
But if we want to be partners in the development of modern defensive systems , we must negotiate in good faith , not bargain hard just to walk away in a pre-planned way at the end . 
Indeed , it is important not to overplay our hand . 
Otherwise Russia may look like a country whose main interest is in maintaining an option where all of America is vulnerable to nuclear blackmail . 
The door to partnership is open ; 
Russia need not break it down . 
From his first mention of the ABM Treaty , President Bush has suggested that it is crucial for America to cooperate with Russia . 
Of course , we must make sure that President Bush means what he says , but it is time for both sides to overcome Cold War militancy . 
Leftovers from the past - conspiracy theories , mistrust , spy-hunting , and embargoes on technological exchanges - should be consigned to the past . 
US / Russian diplomacy can either create difficulties that will cost both countries huge sums , or the conditions in which Russian industries can develop into world class competitors . 
Instead of engaging in bitterness and spy mania , it is time for Russia to find its &quot; place under the capitalist sun . &quot; 
The competitive fight between Russian industries and businesses around the world for commissions and contracts should have started &quot; yesterday . &quot; 
Europeans and Chinese who oppose missile defense do so in a very measured way ; they keep their options open ( and the hope of big contracts for their possible participation ) by hiding behind Russia &apos;s defense of the ABM Treaty . 
They understand that the issue is not just black and white . 
To avoid confrontation with America , Russia should call for the creation of a special international committee to deal with all ABM questions , and this committee should be responsible for international cooperation in the field of missile defense . 
It should not be confined to the political , diplomatic , and military aspects but should take in business concerns as well . 
This will give Russia a unique opportunity to step into the international business arena by providing some of the technologies involved , rather than just the usual raw materials . 
It is also important for us to mobilize state and private lobbying - both in Washington and in other Western capitals - for Russia &apos;s participation in the project . 
When Presidents Putin and Bush meet in Slovenia on June 16th , the ABM Treaty will top the agenda . 
That summit marks the moment to begin fulfilling President Putin &apos;s call to subordinate foreign policy to Russia &apos;s economic interests . 
Pragmatism - not old-fashioned and outlived stereotypes - should form the heart of Russian / American diplomacy .
