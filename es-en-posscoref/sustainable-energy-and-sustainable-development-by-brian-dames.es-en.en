A Roadmap to Global Electrification 
JOHANNESBURG - An international initiative is underway to connect 500 million people in developing countries to modern energy services by 2025 . 
That is a hugely ambitious - but entirely achievable - goal . 
It is also essential to realizing the United Nations Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , because , without access to energy , it will be almost impossible to reduce poverty and hunger , or improve education and health care . 
After all , electricity powers not only industrial development , but social and economic progress more broadly . 
In developing countries , it is a key factor in helping to lift families and communities out of poverty . 
Yet 58 % of Africans lack access to electricity , as do large numbers of people throughout the developing world . 
The new international initiative , called the &quot; Electrification Roadmap , &quot; grew out of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon &apos;s focus on the importance of energy supplies for achieving the MDGs , as well as from his initiative &quot; Sustainable Energy for All &quot; ( SE4ALL ) , and was officially launched at the Rio + 20 conference on sustainable development in June 2012 . 
As discussions there showed , these issues are receiving increased international attention and funding from governments , business , non-governmental organizations , and development finance institutions . 
Eskom &apos;s role is one of leadership and support . 
We have electrified more than four million households through a focused effort over a short period - an effort that has featured prominently in discussions held by the UN Secretary-General &apos;s advisory council on sustainable energy , and that has drawn interest from other developing countries . 
The idea is to leverage our capabilities , specifically our experience and expertise , to assist others in their own electrification efforts . 
An Electrification Roadmap implementation program is being developed in Sub-Saharan Africa , where we will facilitate the consolidation of national electrification plans in the Southern Africa Development Community by helping to finalize these plans where necessary , as well as to secure the resources needed to accelerate implementation . 
Partnerships are key to the success of this effort , which is why we are currently developing a model for stakeholder dialogue , financing , and implementation . 
The ultimate objective is to take the Roadmap project to other regions of the world , bringing electricity to people and communities that have previously not had access to energy . 
The initiative is being led by Eskom Holdings SOC of South Africa and Duke Energy of the United States , and has the support of international organizations , including the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership and the Southern African Power Pool . 
Sustainable energy is a laudable goal , but how do we achieve it for all ? 
The SE4ALL program comprises three interlinked objectives , all to be achieved by 2030 : ensure universal access to modern energy services ; double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency ; and double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix . 
By placing enormous emphasis on &quot; sustainable development , &quot; these objectives strengthen global efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change . 
We are promoting energy access in a way that reduces electricity utilities &quot; carbon footprint through improved efficiency and greater reliance on solar , wind , and hydroelectric power generation . 
Clean-energy initiatives are an international priority . 
Every year , national energy ministers and international organizations meet at what is known as the Clean Energy Ministerial , a forum for sharing lessons learned , promoting best practices , and encouraging the transition to a global clean-energy economy . 
At the African Union &apos;s Conference of Energy Ministers of Africa in Addis Ababa in November , the assembled ministers expressed support and optimism for SE4ALL . 
The UN is currently deploying structures to facilitate the implementation of the international commitments that were made as part of the initiative . 
The following month in Doha , the 18th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , known as COP18 , agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol as the only existing and binding agreement under which developed countries commit to cutting greenhouse gases . 
Governments have agreed to work speedily toward adoption by 2015 of a comprehensive climate-change agreement that will cover all countries from 2020 . 
This is the background against which the Electrification Roadmap is being developed . 
The United Nations declared 2012 the &quot; International Year of Sustainable Energy for All . &quot; 
But that is just the start . 
Our work on the Electrification Roadmap will not be finished until the 500 millionth person has the opportunity for progress and prosperity that electricity brings .
