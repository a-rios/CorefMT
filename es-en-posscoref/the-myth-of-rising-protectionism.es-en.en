The Myth of Rising Protectionism 
CAMBRIDGE - There was a dog that didn &apos;t bark during the financial crisis : protectionism . 
Despite much hue and cry about it , governments have in fact imposed remarkably few trade barriers on imports . 
Indeed , the world economy remains as open as it was before the crisis struck . 
Protectionism normally thrives in times of economic peril . 
Confronted by economic decline and rising unemployment , governments are much more likely to pay attention to domestic pressure groups than to upholding their international obligations . 
As John Maynard Keynes recognized , trade restrictions can protect or generate employment during economic recessions . 
When everyone raises trade barriers , the volume of trade collapses . 
No one wins . 
That is why the disastrous free-for-all in trade policy during the 1930 &quot; s greatly aggravated the Great Depression . 
Many complain that something similar , if less grand in scope , is taking place today . 
An outfit called the Global Trade Alert ( GTA ) has been at the forefront , raising alarm bells about what it calls &quot; a protectionist juggernaut . &quot; 
The GTA &apos;s latest report identifies no fewer than 192 separate protectionist actions since November 2008 , with China as the most common target . 
This number has been widely quoted in the financial press . 
Taken at face value , it seems to suggest that governments have all but abandoned their commitments to the World Trade Organization and the multilateral trade regime . 
But look more closely at those numbers and you will find much less cause for alarm . 
Few of those 192 measures are in fact more than a nuisance . 
The most common among them are the indirect ( and often unintended ) consequences of the bailouts that governments mounted as a consequence of the crisis . 
The most frequently affected sector is the financial industry . 
Moreover , we do not even know whether these numbers are unusually high when compared to pre-crisis trends . 
The GTA report tells us how many measures have been imposed since November 2008 , but says nothing about the analogous numbers prior to that date . 
In the absence of a benchmark for comparative assessment , we do not really know whether 192 &quot; protectionist &quot; measures is a big or small number . 
What about the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese tires ? 
President Barack Obama &apos;s decision to introduce steep duties ( set at 35 % in the first year ) in response to a US International Trade Commission ruling ( sought by US labor unions ) has been widely criticized as stoking the protectionist fires . 
But it is easy to overstate the significance of this case , too . 
The tariff is fully consistent with a special arrangement negotiated at the time of China &apos;s accession to the WTO , which allows the US to impose temporary protection when its markets are &quot; disrupted &quot; by Chinese exports . 
The tariffs that Obama imposed were considerably below what the USITC had recommended . 
The reality is that the international trade regime has passed its greatest test since the Great Depression with flying colors . 
Trade economists who complain about minor instances of protectionism sound like a child whining about a damaged toy in the wake of an earthquake that killed thousands . 
Three things explain this remarkable resilience : ideas , politics , and institutions . 
Economists have been extraordinarily successful in conveying their message to policymakers - even if ordinary people still regard imports with considerable suspicion . 
Nothing reflects this better than how &quot; protection &quot; and &quot; protectionists &quot; have become terms of derision . 
After all , governments are generally expected to provide protection to its citizens . 
But economists &quot; ideas would not have gone very far without significant changes in the underlying configuration of political interests in favor of open trade . 
For every worker and firm affected adversely by import competition , there is one or more worker and firm expecting to reap the benefits of access to markets abroad . 
The latter have become increasingly vocal and powerful , often represented by large multinational corporations . 
In his latest book , Paul Blustein recounts how a former Indian trade minister once asked his American counterpart to bring him a picture of an American farmer : &quot; I have never actually seen one , &quot; the minister quipped . 
&quot; I have only seen US conglomerates masquerading as farmers . &quot; 
But the relative docility of rank-and-file workers on trade issues must ultimately be attributed to something else altogether : the safety nets erected by the welfare state . 
Modern industrial societies now have a wide array of social protections - unemployment compensation , adjustment assistance , and other labor-market tools , as well as health insurance and family support - that mitigate demand for cruder forms of protection . 
The welfare state is the flip side of the open economy . 
If the world has not fallen off the protectionist precipice during the crisis , as it did during the 1930 &quot; s , much of the credit must go the social programs that conservatives and market fundamentalists would like to see scrapped . 
The battle against trade protection has been won - so far . 
Unfortunately , there is little to suggest that policymakers are yet ready to confront this genuine threat .
