When Xi Meets Obama 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle , home to many of the world &apos;s leading technology firms , most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama . 
Can the summit reverse the downward spiral in US-China relations that began with Xi &apos;s accession to power in 2013 ? 
Few dispute that the world &apos;s most important bilateral relationship is in deep trouble . 
From the US perspective , China &apos;s reckless behavior in the South China Sea , unrestrained cyber attacks against American targets , protectionist economic policies , and escalating political repression at home have demolished the belief that a globally integrated China would be a responsible and cooperative partner . 
Indeed , recent Chinese actions directly challenge vital American interests and core values . 
Chinese leaders , for their part , view America &apos;s strategic &quot; pivot to Asia &quot; as a thinly veiled step to tighten its geopolitical containment of China . 
Moreover , they have become obsessed with US dominance in international finance and technology and , most important , America &apos;s ideological commitment to liberal democracy , which they regard as an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . 
The toxic mix of mutual mistrust and tit-for-tat behavior has brought Sino-American ties to their lowest point since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 . 
There is now widespread concern that the US and China may be headed for a new cold war . 
For Xi , the stakes of his US trip could not be higher . 
To maintain his domestic image as a strong leader , he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies . 
But he also needs to stabilize the all-important relationship with the US . 
Judging by recent moves by China and the US , we can expect modest success in a few contentious areas . 
While such improvements , on their own , will not change the relationship &apos;s adversarial dynamic , they may halt the deterioration in bilateral ties , at least for now . 
On the eve of the summit , both the US and China took positive , albeit symbolic , steps to demonstrate their goodwill and improve the diplomatic atmosphere . 
The US extradited a low-level Chinese official to face corruption charges . 
The Obama administration also decided not to announce sanctions against Chinese entities and individuals allegedly involved in cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies . 
For its part , China released a human-rights activist and dispatched a high-level delegation to the US to discuss cyber security . 
In fact , the two sides are reportedly negotiating a landmark deal that would prohibit cyber attacks against each other &apos;s vital infrastructure . 
An agreement on the issue could be the most important outcome of the summit , although other types of cyber attacks are unlikely to be covered by it . 
For China , the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty ( BIT ) . 
In practical terms , a US-China BIT would make it easier for Chinese entities to invest and operate in the US and increase American firms &quot; access to Chinese markets . 
Such a deal would be a near-term boon for Xi , because it would represent a vote of confidence by the US in China &apos;s struggling economy . 
But the prospects for a BIT are uncertain , at best . 
The US Congress is deeply skeptical , and the American business community needs convincing as well . 
Both have been bitterly disappointed by China &apos;s mercantilist trading policies after its accession to the World Trade Organization . 
Given how many contentious issues remain unresolved , an accord is unlikely during the summit . 
The South China Sea dispute may prove to be the toughest diplomatic nut to crack . 
China has staked its national prestige and its leadership &apos;s nationalist credentials on this issue , which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters . 
The most that can be realistically expected is an insipid statement of the two sides &quot; agreement to disagree . 
But the most politically sensitive topic for China has little to do with cyber security or the South China Sea . 
Facing enormous domestic pressure , Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi . 
But Xi is unlikely to make any concessions , because doing so could damage his political standing within the CCP and undermine a central component of his political vision : the reassertion of political control over a dynamic society . 
Ultimately , the key question looming over the summit is whether Xi will be able to offer enough to repair the damage done to Sino-US relations in recent years . 
To be sure , trying is better than doing nothing . 
But what really matters is whether , after the summit , China takes concrete actions that reflect a genuine shift from the policies that have fueled the deterioration in bilateral ties .
