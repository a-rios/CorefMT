Asian Values Revisited 
Talk about &quot; Asian Values &quot; is rarely heard nowadays . 
Its currency seems to have been devalued along with East Asia &apos;s once booming economies . 
For Asia &apos;s financial crisis of a few years back uncovered many excesses that hid behind the rhetoric of Asian values - the cozy relations between governments and elites ; rampant corruption , cronyism and nepotism . 
But of equal importance in causing this diminishment is the fact that real reformers came to power in some Asian states , such as Kim Dae Jung in South Korea , and brought with them a more universal view of human rights . 
Good governance - in both the public and private sectors - is the post-crisis mantra . 
With transitions underway in Thailand and Indonesia , democracy is increasingly what Asians want . 
Although a return to the old discourse about Asian values is unlikely , some Asians may nevertheless reassert their differences on human rights , democracy and governance as memories of the crisis grow distant . 
The worst reason for this will be the oldest reason : some pre-crisis elites retain influence and / or power . 
Because reform threatens their privileges , it must be resisted . 
Other former elites may try to link self-protection to anti-Western rhetoric and nationalist sentiment . 
This holds the potential to be a potent weapon in dealing with outsiders like the IMF , or when foreigners buy ( at bargain prices ) into banks , public utilities and big companies . 
Alongside elite self-interest , the pain of ordinary workers and citizens is a genuine and widespread concern . 
Displaced by new competition , workers have gone on strike in countries like Korea , where the old &quot; iron bowl &quot; of employment protection has shattered . 
In Thailand , the rural poor organized against a reform minded Democrat government while its party rivals canvassed on the old politics of patronage and money . 
If united , entrenched elites and the mass of workers and the poor can create a powerful stumbling block to reform . 
Lingering resentments about colonization may also be tapped . 
Many segments of society still harbor reservations about foreigners and foreign investors , not only in countries new to global markets , like Vietnam , but even in countries with decades of economic openness . 
Moreover , in the wake of IMF-imposed remedies , many Asians feel marginalized . 
This is why Malaysia &apos;s Premier , Dr Mahathir Mohammed , strikes a cord beyond his country when he rails against American hegemony . 
Nationalism in Asia is both a proud and convenient flag to hide behind . 
A newer reason renewing Asia &apos;s sense of difference is that , thus far , human rights and democracy have not delivered good governance , stability or growth . 
Human rights advocates in Indonesia , for example , used the crisis to argue for political prisoners to be released , for East Timor to be given its independence , and for provincial human rights violations to be 
investigated . 
To succeed in restoring a strong growth path , East Asia must deliver justice for more than individual human rights violations . 
As the proponents of Asian values argued , all human rights - civil and political as well as social and economic - need to be strengthened . 
If not , advocates of democracy and human rights will face a backlash . 
Already , some Indonesians are nostalgic for Suharto &apos;s new order . 
A third , newly emerging reason for an Asian approach to human rights is more benign . 
It is an increasing sense that the aim should be to be both universal and Asian , not one or the other . 
For the crisis of 1997-98 brought Asians closer together . 
Governments cooperate more fully through the ASEAN plus 3 process that links 13 East Asian countries . 
A greater sense of regional identity exists even if regional cooperation is limited and most people think it should not take the form of a closed bloc or union . 
Open regionalism is an edict not only for the trade regime . 
It can also apply to other areas of cooperation , including human rights . 
So , the idea of an ASEAN or Asian regional mechanism should be re-evaluated . 
Asia is , after all , the only continent without such a regime to complement international institutions . 
The time may now be right because some countries have started their human rights commissions . 
Indeed , the new generation in the region is both more Asian and more open to the universal . 
For them , an understanding of the US and US-influenced international standards is second nature . 
The influence has come through popular and consumer culture as well as private sector business , non-government organizations and civil society groups . 
But this does not mean that Asia will be homogenized , like a McDonalds &apos; franchise . 
A new Asian culture is being articulated . 
Much of it is set within a Western framework , but some particulars do differ . 
In Asia , hybrids are emerging that are both modern and &quot; universal &quot; while still being Asian . 
Significantly , what is emerging is being negotiated at the level of individuals and communities , not states and national leaders . 
Asia cannot go back to what was before . 
But unless stability , growth and a sense of confidence are renewed , greater tension with the West and narrow forms of pan-Asian nationalism are possible . 
This need not be antagonistic , as in the past . 
The hope this time is that Asia &apos;s people - not just their semi-autocratic leaders - seek their own balance between the universal and a redefined sense of what Asia is .
