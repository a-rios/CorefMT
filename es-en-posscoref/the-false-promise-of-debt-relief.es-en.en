The False Promise of Debt Relief 
With debt relief for poor countries shaping up as a focal issue at the July G-8 summit in Scotland , it is a shame that so few people appreciate what a farce such measures could turn out to be . 
Unfortunately , most of the public , egged on by well-meaning rock stars , religious leaders , and other popular figures , seem brainwashed into believing that debt relief is a giant step on the road to ending world poverty . 
At first glance , it seems incredibly generous and statesman-like for G-8 leaders to endorse debt relief for the world &apos;s poorest nations . 
Indeed , thanks to ongoing grants and future loans from national aid agencies and multilateral lenders like the World Bank , most of the poor &quot; debtor &quot; countries look set to receive considerably more money than they pay back , with no end in sight . 
Citizens of rich countries may be self-centered and self-indulgent , but things are not quite as horrible as some would have us believe . 
True , the ultra-rich United States does only give a pathetic 0.2 % of its income in aid . 
But at least it doesn &apos;t tax poor countries , as rich-country imperialists did until well into the twentieth century . 
Besides , it is not like there is huge profit for G-8 leaders in trying to collect coins from impoverished peoples living on a dollar a day . 
What would the G-8 leaders do , station troops in Africa to seize coffee beans and peanuts ? 
Re-colonize Africa ? 
Debt collection from poor nations is an absurdity , now and into the distant future . 
The real issue is how much money rich-country governments will be giving poor-country governments , not vice versa . 
Third-world debt burdens are little more than a scorecard for past development failures . 
Generously interpreted , past loans reflected na√Øve optimism that with a bit of seed money , politically and economically backward countries would generate majestic growth and effortlessly repay their loans . 
A not-so-generous interpretation of modern aid history is that rich countries &quot; legislatures were too cheap to give outright grants to the poorest countries , and could be persuaded to help out only if they were told that the money would be repaid . 
Of course , I am focusing mainly on official loans , but private-sector lending to the world &apos;s poorest countries is generally a relatively minor issue . 
So now rich countries want to feel magnanimous for &quot; forgiving &quot; debts that should have been given as outright grants in the first place . 
As all but the most belligerent critics of US President George W Bush will acknowledge , America has taken an important lead in trying to make things marginally better . 
The Bush administration has put outright grants at the center of its foreign-assistance policy , a commitment that is embodied in its new aid agency , the &quot; Millennium Challenge Account . &quot; 
Moreover , following recent changes at the World Bank , the US is aiming to follow the classic doctor &apos;s dictum : &quot; First , do no harm . &quot; 
It is increasing aid , but it is trying to focus the benefits on countries that are reasonably well governed . 
The aim is praiseworthy : to ensure that aid will be unambiguously beneficial , and won &apos;t merely be exploited by bad governments to extend their hold on power . 
Admittedly , there is still a fierce debate over the right way to assist poor countries , and this will play out behind the scenes at the G-8 summit . 
Many Europeans believe that aid agencies like the World Bank will shrivel and die if left to depend on grants for income . 
The United Nations Development Program has championed the position that all countries should get significant aid , regardless of how they are governed , on the grounds that thousands of children die every day and there is no room for sanctimonious extremism . 
I beg to differ ; my reading of the evidence suggests that donors really do need to take extreme care not to make things worse , and that this is far more difficult to achieve in corrupt countries than the UN suggests . 
In short , the fundamental problem with the debt-relief mantra is that it looks backward rather than forward . 
If the G-8 leaders are serious about helping poor countries , finding a reliable way to support grant aid and promote accountability for donors and recipients , not debt relief , is the place to start . 
If the political will were there , it would be neither difficult nor expensive to restructure aid agencies like the World Bank and the regional development banks as grants-only agencies . 
For example , Professor Jeremy Bulow of Stanford University and I have shown that by endowing the World Bank with $ 100 billion dollars , it could carry out the tasks that it performs best more effectively and with greater transparency than it does today through borrowing and lending . 
Given today &apos;s exceptionally low long-term interest rates , the annual cost would be , well , peanuts .
