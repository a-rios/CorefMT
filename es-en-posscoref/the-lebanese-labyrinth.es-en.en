The Lebanese Labyrinth 
Lebanon is poised to hold a presidential election that none of its contending factions - indeed , none of the rival parties in the region - can afford to lose . 
Let &apos;s start with Syria . 
In 2005 , President Bashar Assad &apos;s regime was forced to withdraw its army from Lebanon , following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri . 
Syria is widely believed to have been responsible for the crime , and domestic Lebanese and international pressure helped force Syria &apos;s pullout . 
Yet in a speech soon thereafter , Assad warned that nothing could sever the Syrian-Lebanese relationship . 
Assad knows that the election of a president who bolsters Lebanon &apos;s sovereignty and independence would make Syria &apos;s return difficult - and Assad , as even his allies privately admit , wants nothing less . 
Indeed , it was his decision to extend , unconstitutionally , the term of the reliably pro-Syrian Emile Lahoud as Lebanon &apos;s president in 2004 that triggered the political crisis leading to Hariri &apos;s murder and the emergence of a coalition of anti-Syrian groups , which included many former Syrian allies . 
Assad is particularly worried about the creation of a mixed Lebanese-international court to try suspects in the Hariri assassination . 
The court was approved under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and will be situated in Holland . 
Once the trial begins , Syria may find itself in the dock . 
Closely allied with Syria is Hezbollah , which presides over a virtually autonomous mini-state in south Lebanon . 
Hezbollah has an armed militia that is far more effective than Lebanon &apos;s national army , and has openly rejected UN Security Council resolutions asking for its disarmament . 
Hezbollah &apos;s priority is to maintain the military capacity to fight Israel , and also to play a pivotal role in the broader regional rivalry between Iran , Syria , Hezbollah , and Hamas on one side , and the United States , the Sunni-led mainstream Arab states , the Mahmoud Abbas-led Palestinian Authority , and Syria &apos;s Lebanese foes on the other . 
But there are constraints on Hezbollah . 
The party &apos;s leaders know that any crisis in Lebanon could provoke a Sunni-Shiite conflict . 
Hezbollah &apos;s patrons in Iran , like the party itself , realize that the consequences would be disastrous . 
Iran would find itself the bogeyman of the Arab world &apos;s Sunnis , while Hezbollah could be swallowed up by another debilitating Lebanese civil war . 
In the coming weeks , Hezbollah will have to calculate at several levels . 
It will , above all , take Syrian priorities into consideration . 
If Assad decides to scuttle the presidential election in order to strengthen Syria &apos;s hold in Beirut , then the party will go along . 
But a political vacuum in Lebanon only makes violence more likely , which Hezbollah doesn &apos;t want . 
On the other side , interests vary . 
Syria &apos;s Lebanese enemies know that the election &apos;s outcome will determine their fate . 
Given that several prominent critics of Syria have been killed since 2005 , there is little room for compromise . 
The problem is that the anti-Syrian coalition , known as &quot; March 14 , &quot; is not yet united around a single presidential candidate . 
That said , the leaders of March 14 , which controls a parliamentary majority , will block any step that revives Syrian domination . 
The US has made it clear that it will not accept a president close to Hezbollah or Syria . 
While America will not bargain with Syria over the election , it would probably accept a candidate with whom Syria feels comfortable , provided he is acceptable across the political spectrum . 
The US must also calculate what the Europeans will accept . 
France , Italy , and Spain all have large contingents in the UN force in south Lebanon that was expanded after the summer 2006 war . 
No election , they fear , would endanger their soldiers . 
This makes them vulnerable to Syrian leverage , and is why they may be more amenable to dealing with Syria on the presidency . 
Another key actor is Saudi Arabia , whose relations with Syria are at an all-time low . 
The Saudis , deeply disturbed by the Syrian-Iranian alliance , worry that re-imposition of Syrian supremacy in Lebanon , and with it the strengthening of Iranian and Shiite power there , would threaten the Kingdom itself . 
But , as the Saudis also want Syria to be included in King Abdullah &apos;s regional peace plan , and with the US planning to hold a regional peace conference in November , they are not looking for an open-ended confrontation with Assad . 
These clashing interests will be played out after September 25 , when the two-month period during which Lebanon &apos;s parliament must elect a president begins . 
No side has a yearning for war , which is why compromise solutions are possible . 
But what would such a compromise look like ? 
One idea - to elect a candidate with whom everyone can live - would likely produce a weak president . 
So would an agreement by all sides to elect an interim president for two years , buying time until the regional balance of power changes or solidifies . 
Whatever the outcome , the choice of Lebanon &apos;s next president will emerge from a political maelstrom - one that he will almost certainly be powerless to allay .
