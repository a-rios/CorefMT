Remembering the Gulag 
&quot; There is nothing more inconspicuous than a monument , &quot; said the Austrian writer Robert Musil a hundred years ago . 
From the ruins of another empire , Russia &apos;s , I would add : There is nothing more conspicuous than an absent monument . 
Monuments compose the body of a nation on display . 
By looking at monuments , we feel how a nation-state affirms its continuity . 
When revolutions disrupt this continuity , they wreak violence against monuments . 
As the example of Saddam Hussein teaches us anew , to overturn a monument is easier than to try a dictator . 
Post-revolutionary periods , however , allow for more variety . 
Sometimes , new monuments are erected . 
Sometimes , old monuments return to their original spots . 
Sometimes , monuments are in absentia , like professors on sabbatical . 
While Holocaust deniers have been purged from German universities , Russian universities employ a number of professors of Russian history who conspicuously maintain the Gulag &apos;s absence from their lectures . 
Though terror in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia created many millions of victims , the memories of these events are vastly different . 
The most arresting but unrecognized of all post-Soviet monuments to the Gulag is the 500 ruble banknote , issued in the late 1990 &apos;s and widely used today . 
Seemingly a testament to the nation &apos;s proud history , this banknote carries a hidden message . 
It depicts the Solovki monastery , a historical complex on an island in the White Sea , which also served as the earliest and one of the most important camps in the Gulag . 
Local historians at Solovki believe that the atypical cupolas illustrated on the note date the picture to the end of the 1920 &apos;s , the time of the camp &apos;s peak development . 
The design raises some challenging questions . 
Is this one of those monuments that has been erected not by artists but by critics , who produce meaning not through creation but through interpretation ? 
Were officials of the Ministry of Finance being deliberately subversive ? 
Or is the choice of picture on the banknote a symptom of psychological trauma , an unconscious but realistic manifestation of the work of mourning ? 
The work of mourning , to use Freud &apos;s formula , is continuous . 
But symmetrical evil does not mean symmetrical memorialization . 
There are plenty of memorials on the sites of German concentration camps , and new ones are continually added . 
In Russia , only two Gulag sites , in Solovki and in Perm , have small museums that show conditions in the camps , the techniques of torture and murder , the documents , and the portraits . 
In some cases , monuments are erected not on the former murder sites , as in Germany , but near them . 
This pattern represents not the old regime &apos;s eradication , but its coexistence with the new one . 
Even such proximate memory is far from being the rule in Russia . 
There is not a single plaque commemorating the Leningrad KGB &apos;s victims near the site of their suffering . 
Such a monument is also notably absent from the vicinity of the Kremlin . 
The museum on Solovki Island fills just a few rooms inside the functioning monastery . 
Although about one million people were incarcerated there , there is only one heartbreaking plaque on a shed , which reads , &quot; The children &apos;s barrack of the Solovki Camp . &quot; 
Some local museums display fascinating objects . 
In the Kargopol museum , for example , stands a clay pitcher , presented to the museum by the descendants of a guard who appropriated a prisoner &apos;s parcel - a pitcher full of honey . 
In such exhibits , however , it is impossible to find answers to the most obvious questions : How many prisoners passed through this camp ? 
How many died here , and when ? 
Who were the administrators , guards , and executioners ? 
Close to the Belomorkanal , one of the Gulag &apos;s major construction sites , a large mass grave was uncovered at Sandarmokh . 
The site is a pine forest near an old highway , distinguished by the small , regular depressions in the earth that are characteristic of such graves . 
The Memorial Society meticulously compared their archeological findings with the &quot; shooting protocols &quot; kept in the KGB &apos;s archives . 
The protocols never mention names , but they give the number of those who were shot on a specific date , classified by gender , e.g. 20 men , seven women . 
By matching the number of skeletons and their gender , every &quot; shooting protocol &quot; was identified with a certain grave . 
About 9,000 people were shot at Sandarmokh between 1937-1938 . 
Today , a wooden pole marks each mass grave . 
Designed as a local symbol of mourning , these poles , with their sharply angled roofs , remind viewers either of a peasant cross or a human figure with hands raised in prayer . 
Sandarmokh is the most important , and best developed , Russian site of memory . 
Unfortunately , it is unknown even to neighbors as close as the Scandinavians . 
Two better-known memorials in Moscow and St. Petersburg consist of granite stones taken from Solovki . 
In St. Petersburg , the stone is complemented with inscriptions , such as &quot; To the victims of Communism . &quot; 
( This plaque has been vandalized many times , the last with a graffito in red oil paint , &quot; Too few were shot . &quot; ) 
Here we have memory converted to drama . 
But Russian memory is also subject to Western-style postmodernist mockery . 
A recent fashion in St. Petersburg are restaurants with names such as &quot; Lenin &apos;s Mating Call , &quot; &quot; USSR , &quot; and &quot; Russian Kitsch , &quot; which has frescos showing collective farmers socializing with American Indians while Leonid Brezhnev , resembling Frank Sinatra , gives a speech to a stone-age tribe . 
Far more than Nazism , Communism belongs to our common European heritage . 
The memory of its victims is not only a national , but also a European responsibility . 
As generations pass , monuments evolve from a medium of mourning to instruments of education . 
The work of memory is hard , expensive , and fragile . 
Monuments move back and forth . 
Capitals may be renamed . 
Banknotes expire . 
Everything may be mocked and change meaning . 
Even mummies are mobile . 
In 1961 , the mummy of Stalin was observed striding out of the Mausoleum in Red Square . 
Lenin &apos;s corpse remains there , but his departure is expected . 
This should be a European event .
