The Egyptian Struggle and Beyond 
LONDON - The events that led Egypt &apos;s military to remove President Mohamed Morsi confronted the army with a simple choice : intervention or chaos . 
Seventeen million people in the street is not the same thing as an election . 
Morsi &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood was unable to shift from being an opposition movement to being a governing party . 
Of course , governments govern badly or well or averagely . 
Egypt &apos;s economy is tanking . 
Ordinary law and order has virtually disappeared . 
Services are not functioning properly . 
Individual ministers did their best . 
A few weeks back , I met the tourism minister , who I thought was excellent and had a sensible plan to revive the sector . 
A few days later , he resigned , after Morsi took the mind-boggling step of appointing as Governor of Luxor province ( a key tourist destination ) someone who was affiliated with the group responsible for the terrorist attack in 1997 - Egypt &apos;s worst ever - in which more than 60 tourists in Luxor were killed . 
Now the army is faced with the delicate and arduous task of steering the country back onto a path toward elections and a rapid return to democratic rule . 
We must hope that they can do this without further bloodshed . 
Meanwhile , however , someone will have to run things and govern . 
It will not be easy . 
What is happening in Egypt is the latest example of the interplay , visible the world over , between democracy , protest , and government efficacy . 
Democracy is a way to decide who the decision-makers will be , not a substitute for making decisions . 
I remember an early conversation with some young Egyptians shortly after President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s downfall in 2011 . 
They believed that with democracy , problems would be solved . 
When I asked what the right economic policy for Egypt should be , they simply said that all would be fine , because now they had democracy ; and any economic ideas that they did have were well to the old left of anything that had a remote chance of working . 
I am a strong supporter of democracy . 
Today , efficacy is the challenge . 
When governments do not deliver , people protest . 
They don &apos;t want to wait for an election . 
In fact , as Turkey and Brazil show , people may protest even when , by any objective measure , their countries have made huge progress . 
But , as countries move from low- to middle-income status , people &apos;s expectations rise . 
They want higher-quality services , better housing , and good infrastructure ( especially transport ) . 
This is a sort of free democratic spirit that operates outside the convention that elections decide the government . 
It is fueled enormously by social media ( itself a revolutionary phenomenon ) . 
And it moves very fast in precipitating crisis . 
It is not always consistent or rational . A protest is not a policy ; and a placard is not a program for government . 
In Egypt , the government &apos;s problems were compounded by resentment of the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s ideology and intolerance . 
People came to believe that the Brotherhood was steadily imposing its own doctrines on everyday life . 
Across the Middle East , for the first time , there is open debate about the role of religion in politics . 
Despite the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s superior organization , those who support an intrinsically secular approach to government - and this is true in most of the region - are probably in the majority . 
Society can be deeply imbued with religious observance ; but people are starting to recognize that democracy works only as a pluralistic concept , requiring equal respect for different faiths and allowing a voice , but not a veto , for religion . 
For a country like Egypt , with its immense and varied civilization , which includes around eight million Christians and a young population that needs to be connected to the world , there is no future as an Islamic state that aspires to be part of a regional caliphate . 
So what should the West do ? 
Egypt is the latest reminder that the region is in turmoil and won &apos;t leave us alone , however much we may wish it would . 
Disengagement is not an option , because the status quo is not an option . 
Any decision not to act is itself a decision of vast consequence . 
At its crudest , the West cannot afford Egypt &apos;s collapse . 
So it should engage with the new de facto power and help the new government make the changes necessary , especially with respect to the economy , so that it can deliver adequate performance for Egypt &apos;s citizens . 
In that way , it can also help shape a path back to the ballot box that is designed by and for Egyptians . 
Engagement is demanded elsewhere in the region as well . 
As for Syria , the worst that can happen is unacceptable : effective partition of the country , with a poor , extremist-led Sunni state in the east , shut out from the sea and the country &apos;s wealth . 
In that case , Lebanon would be totally destabilized , Iraq further destabilized , and Jordan placed under even greater pressure ( which only the king &apos;s courageous leadership is managing to contain , on behalf of us all ) . 
And what would be left for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to govern would depend on Hezbollah , a terrorist organization , and Iran . 
As for the Islamic Republic , incoming President Hassan Rowhani may want to reach an agreement with the world on the country &apos;s nuclear ambition - or he may not . 
Either way , ultimate power in Iran still rests with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
The world cannot afford a nuclear-armed Iran . 
And I haven &apos;t even mentioned the challenges of Libya , Yemen , or , further afield , Pakistan , or the plague of extremism now coursing through the northern part of Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central Asia . 
The West &apos;s interests demand that we remain engaged . 
We have to make decisions for the long-term , because , in the short term , there are no simple solutions . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s current dedication and drive on the Israeli-Palestinian issue is exemplary : If it matters , act on it , however difficult . 
A long transition in the Middle East is underway . 
It is difficult , time-consuming , and expensive . 
Many in the West believe that it should be someone else &apos;s job to help sort it out . 
This struggle matters to everyone . 
The good news is that there are millions of modern and open-minded people in the Middle East . 
They need to know that we are on their side , that we are their allies - and that we are prepared to pay the price to be there with them .
