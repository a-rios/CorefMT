How Will Tomorrow &apos;s Scientists Learn ? 
I was recently invited to speak at science-related meetings on two consecutive days in different places in Europe . 
One was the official opening of a network of science centers in Vienna , linking decentralized activities in an interactive exhibition that tour Austria . 
The other was the Science Festival of Genoa , Italy , a young and hugely successful event with exhibitions and high-profile speakers throughout the ancient town . 
What struck me on both occasions was the sustained , and evidently successful , attempt to reach out to the two target groups upon whom the future of science and technology will depend . 
The first group is teenagers , who are deeply interested in all the new technologies and gadgets that surround them . 
They have made these technologies an integral part of their lives , but their relationship to science has remained distant . 
The other target audience consists of younger children , whose openness and inborn curiosity have not yet been stifled by formal schooling . 
The success of Europe &apos;s newly established science centers and festivals in reaching their potential audiences reflects their invention of a new way of teaching and learning . 
They have succeeded in setting up a largely informal learning environment , focusing mainly on truly interactive learning . 
By soliciting questions from children that have little place in the formal educational system , the audience is led to experience the research process - which often begins precisely by asking the right kind of question . 
Although we will need more such informal learning environments in the future , politicians and the public have hardly noticed . 
Gone are the utopian dreams of the 1970 &quot; s , when there were visions of life-long learning and paid leaves of absence to pursue topics that might be useful for further professional advancement - or might also include the sheer luxury of studying ancient Greek or Assyrian art . 
But the need for some kind of continuous learning has become even more obvious today , in a world driven by the forces of globalization . 
The relentless competition for talent and skills is being underscored daily by the increases in R D investment in China and India , whose growing middle classes are only too keen to seek better educational opportunities for their children . 
Talent is now recognized as a scarce commodity that needs to be nurtured for a worldwide market of skills and competencies . 
&quot; The battle for brainpower , &quot; as The Economist recently put it , has begun . 
It is fairly safe to predict that learning in a knowledge-intensive society will continue at a heightened pace , both at the workplace and outside of it . 
It will be facilitated through Web-based social software , through wikis , blogs , and similar developments as much as through new , &quot; open source &quot; business models . 
These are informal structures , even if they have owners and access to them is regulated . 
The corporate world - indeed , the formal workplace more generally - can no longer be strictly separated from the informal world in which work and leisure have become blurred . 
Just as formal schooling needs to become better integrated with the informal learning environments to which our children are exposed in multiple ways , formal and informal learning must mesh in a life-long process . 
Science and technology have an enormous stake in this development , and worldwide competition for the best brains is already acutely felt in European universities . 
This year &apos;s Nobel Prizes highlighted once more that the research climate in the United States continues to be more conducive to scientific excellence compared to what Europe has to offer . 
Initiatives aimed at fostering scientific excellence in Europe , like one recently launched in Germany that officially defined three universities , all in the southern part of the country , as &quot; excellent &quot; ( qualifying them for extra funding ) , seek to make universities more attractive and thus more competitive . 
While such efforts certainly point in the right direction , the research-friendliness and innovativeness of the wider societal environment - particularly practices of informal learning and opportunities to follow one &apos;s curiosity - also matter . 
When , beginning in the nineteenth century , book publishing became not only a lucrative business , but also made books increasingly affordable to many more households , the sources of learning in society exploded . 
Indeed , the societal wealth created through the Industrial Revolution is partly due to this new diffusion of knowledge and skills . 
Seeing the excitement that can be generated in young people through events like science festivals and networks of science centers gives rise to cautious optimism - provided we seize the diversity of opportunities that informal learning offers . 
Informal learning implies a messy , unruly , and potentially subversive process .
