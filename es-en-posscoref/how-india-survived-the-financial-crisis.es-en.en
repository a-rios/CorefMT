How India Survived the Financial Crisis 
NEW DELHI - As the world economy begins to recover , Indians are looking back with particular satisfaction at how they coped with the recent crisis . 
Despite an unprecedented global recession , India remained the second fastest growing economy in the world . 
Whereas most countries suffered negative growth in at least one quarter over the last two years , India &apos;s GDP grew by more than 6 % throughout this period - and by 7.9 % in the last quarter of 2009 . 
India &apos;s achievement is all the more striking given that the Pakistani terrorist attacks on Mumbai - India &apos;s financial nerve center and commercial capital - in late November 2008 came in the midst of the crisis . 
The terrorists dented the worldwide image of India as an emerging economic giant , a success story of the era of globalization , and a magnet for investors and tourists . 
Indeed , in late 2008 , foreign investors did withdraw $ 12 billion from India &apos;s stock markets . 
Foreign direct investment totaled $ 27.3 billion in 2008-2009 , despite the global financial crisis , and reached $ 1 billion in just one week in May 2009 . 
India &apos;s ability to stave off the economic gales was helped by the fact that it is much less dependent than most countries on global flows of trade and capital . 
India relies on external trade for about 20 % of its GDP ( the figure for China is roughly double ) . 
The country &apos;s large and robust internal market accounts for the rest . 
Indians continued producing goods and services for other Indians , and that kept the economy humming . 
Though India &apos;s merchandise exports did register declines of about 30 % , its exports of services continued to do well throughout the crisis . 
Indians abroad stayed loyal to India : remittances from overseas Indians remained robust , reaching $ 46.4 billion in 2008-2009 , the bulk of which came from the mainly blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf countries . 
India &apos;s generally conservative financial system played a vital role , too . 
Its banks and financial institutions were not tempted to buy the mortgage-supported securities and credit-default swaps that ruined several Western financial institutions . 
Among the drivers of growth , domestic capital formation retained much of its momentum from preceding years . 
Moreover , India &apos;s government adopted a pro-active fiscal policy , rolling out two rounds of stimulus packages . 
The authorities pursued pro-growth policies , including lower interest rates , expanded credit , and a reduction in excise duties . 
There are still challenges ahead . 
Reform is pursued hesitantly by a coalition government constantly wary of voters &quot; reactions . 
A decision to de-regulate petrol and diesel prices has sparked massive street protests and stoked fears of rampant inflation . 
Privatization of India &apos;s bloated public sector ( from massive coal and steel enterprises to the loss-making national carrier Air India ) has been slow to get off the ground . 
And , of course , the persistent complaints of corruption and bureaucratic red tape have not faded with liberalization . 
The country &apos;s infrastructure remains woeful , as any visitor flying into an Indian airport notices . 
Power shortages are frequent . 
Some 40 % of the population still lives below a poverty line drawn just this side of the funeral pyre . 
Yet all these problems are being dealt with by a confident Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who has steered the ship of state through some particularly treacherous waters . 
India is simultaneously tackling the &quot; hardware &quot; of development ( ports , roads , airports ) and its &quot; software &quot; ( health care , education ) . 
Success will not occur overnight , but progress has been impressive and is continuing . 
In the last 15 years , India has pulled more people out of poverty than in the previous 45 - roughly 10 million people per year on average in the last decade . 
The country has visibly prospered , and , despite population growth , per capita income has grown faster , and to a greater level , than ever before . 
The current financial crisis , far from prompting India to retreat , is an opportunity to safeguard and build on those gains . 
India can advance with the confidence that it can cope with the world from a very secure base . 
As the 2010 monsoon nourishes India &apos;s plains , that &apos;s an encouraging place to be .
