The Case for Opening Europe &apos;s Borders 
It is time for Europe &apos;s politicians to admit to voters that governments cannot stop people moving across borders . 
Despite efforts to build a Fortress Europe , over a million foreigners bypass its defences every year ; some enter covertly , but most just overstay their visas and work illicitly . 
Even if Europe became a police state , migrants could get through : documents can be forged or stolen , visas overstayed , people smuggled , officials bribed . 
While draconian policies can curb migration somewhat , they mostly drive it underground . 
That creates huge costs . 
Aside from a humanitarian crisis , with thousands drowning each year trying to reach Europe and thousands more detained , there is the soaring expense of border controls and bureaucracy , a criminalized people-smuggling industry , and an expanding shadow economy , where illegal migrants are vulnerable to exploitation , labor laws are broken and taxes go unpaid . 
In addition , there is rising mistrust of politicians who cannot fulfill promises to halt immigration , accompanied by perceptions of immigrants as law-breakers rather than enterprising people , and mistreatment of refugees aimed at deterring people who want to work from applying for asylum . 
These problems are due not to immigrants , but to our immigration controls , which are not only costly and cruel , but also ineffective and counterproductive . 
Far from protecting us , they undermine law and order , just as Prohibition did more damage to America than drinking ever has . 
Pragmatic governments surely ought to legalize and regulate migration instead . 
Immigrants are not an invading army ; they are mostly people seeking a better life who are drawn to Europe by the huge demand for workers to fill the low-end jobs that our aging and increasingly wealthy societies rely on , but which our increasingly well-educated and comfortable citizens are unwilling to take . 
Many services cannot readily be mechanized or imported - old people cannot be cared for by a robot or from abroad - while people increasingly pay others to perform tasks that they once did themselves , freeing up their own time for more productive work or leisure . 
Thus , as advanced economies create high-skilled jobs , they inevitably create low-skilled ones , too . 
In fact , low-skilled jobs still account for more than a quarter of Western Europe &apos;s workforce . 
But , whereas only half of Europeans now aged 55-64 finished secondary education , four in five 25-34-year-olds have done so , and they naturally aspire to better things . 
Even Europeans with few or no qualifications increasingly shun dirty , difficult , and dangerous jobs . 
The only way to reconcile our aspirations to opportunity for all with the reality of drudgery for some is through immigration . 
Consider old-age care , the fastest-growing employment sector in Europe . 
Since young Europeans would rather work in a shop than a retirement home , persuading them otherwise would require a huge wage hike . 
Given fiscal constraints , that implies either less care for pensioners , budget cuts elsewhere , or tax hikes . 
Immigrants , however , face a different set of alternatives ; with wages in Brussels far higher than in Manila , for example , Filipino immigrants are generally happy to do such work . 
This is not exploitation ; everyone - migrants , taxpayers , and Europeans young and old - is better off . 
Nor does it undercut wages , since most Europeans do not want these jobs . 
And it does not undermine social standards , because legal migrants have recourse to trade unions and the law . 
Indeed , just as it is often mutually beneficial to import computers from China , IT services from India , and investment-banking services from Americans , it can also make sense to import Filipino care workers , Congolese cleaners , and Brazilian bar staff . 
Policymakers who want products and providers of high-skilled services to move freely but people who provide less-skilled services to stay put are not just hypocrites ; they are also economically illiterate . 
Nor do immigrants merely take jobs ; they also create them . 
As they spend their wages , they increase demand for people to produce the goods and services that they consume . 
Spain has admitted more immigrants in recent years than any other European country , yet its unemployment rate continues to fall ; 
Britain , Ireland , and Sweden still have low unemployment after opening their labor markets to the Poles and other new EU members in 2004 . 
This is also because immigrants often complement native workers &quot; efforts . 
A foreign nanny may allow a British doctor to return to work , where hard-working foreign nurses and cleaners enhance her productivity . 
While innovation sometimes comes from brilliant individuals - 21 of Britain &apos;s Nobel prizewinners were refugees - it generally comes from the synergy of talented people in close proximity . 
Likewise , consider Silicon Valley : Intel , Yahoo ! , Google , and eBay were all co-founded by immigrants . 
Millions of Europeans want EU governments to lower their barriers to developing countries &quot; exports , cancel Third World debt , and increase foreign aid . 
Yet increased migration would help the poor far more . 
Migrants from poor countries already send home $ 200 billion a year - perhaps another $ 400 billion informally - compared to the $ 80 billion in aid given by Western governments . 
These remittances are not wasted on weapons or siphoned off into Swiss bank accounts ; they go straight into local people &apos;s pockets . 
They pay for food , clean water , medicines , and to keep kids in school . 
And returning migrants bring back new skills , new ideas , and the money to start new businesses . 
Africa &apos;s first Internet caf√©s were started by migrants returning from Europe . 
Politicians should have the courage to stop fighting an unwinnable war . 
If open borders are not politically feasible for now , our leaders should at least create a legal route for people from developing countries to enter and work . 
Of course , problems may arise ; learning to live together can be tough . 
But Europe would thrive on the cosmopolitan dynamism that results from treating immigration as an opportunity rather than as a threat .
