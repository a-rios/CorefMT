Technology and Inequality 
CAMBRIDGE - Until now , the relentless march of technology and globalization has played out hugely in favor of high-skilled labor , helping to fuel record-high levels of income and wealth inequality around the world . 
Will the endgame be renewed class warfare , with populist governments coming to power , stretching the limits of income redistribution , and asserting greater state control over economic life ? 
There is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world , whether it is in the United States , the European periphery , or China . 
Yet it is easy to forget that market forces , if allowed to play out , might eventually exert a stabilizing role . 
Simply put , the greater the premium for highly skilled workers , the greater the incentive to find ways to economize on employing their talents . 
The world of chess , with which I am closely familiar , starkly illustrates the way in which innovation in the coming decades may have a very different effect on relative wages than it did over the past three decades . 
During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , a brilliantly inventive chess-playing &quot; automaton &quot; toured the world &apos;s capitals . 
&quot; The Turk &quot; won games against the likes of Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin , while challenging many great minds to penetrate its secrets . 
Concealing a human player in a shifting compartment amid a maze of impressive-looking gadgetry , it took decades for outsiders to correctly guess how the Turk really worked . 
Today , the scam has been turned on its head : chess-playing machines pretend to be chess-playing humans . 
Desktop-based chess programs have considerably surpassed the best human players over the past decade , and cheating has become a growing scourge . 
The French chess federation recently suspended three of its top players for conspiring to obtain computer assistance . 
( Interestingly , one of the main ways to uncover cheating is by using a computer program to detect whether a player &apos;s moves consistently resemble the favored choices of various top computer programs . ) 
Of course , there are many other examples of activities that were once thought exclusively the domain of intuitive humans , but that computers have come to dominate . 
Many teachers and schools now use computer programs to scan essays for plagiarism , an ancient transgression made all too easy by the Internet . 
Indeed , computer-grading of essays is a surging science , with some studies showing that computer evaluations are fairer , more consistent , and more informative than those of an average teacher , if not necessarily of an outstanding one . 
Expert computer systems are also gaining traction in medicine , law , finance , and even entertainment . 
Given these developments , there is every reason to believe that technological innovation will lead ultimately to commoditization of many skills that now seem very precious and unique . 
My Harvard colleague Kenneth Froot and I once studied the relative price movements of a number of goods over a 700-year period . 
To our surprise , we found that the relative prices of grains , metals , and many other basic goods tended to revert to a central mean tendency over sufficiently long periods . 
We conjectured that even though random discoveries , weather events , and technologies might dramatically shift relative values for certain periods , the resulting price differentials would create incentives for innovators to concentrate more attention on goods whose prices had risen dramatically . 
Of course , people are not goods , but the same principles apply . 
As skilled labor becomes increasingly expensive relative to unskilled labor , firms and businesses have a greater incentive to find ways to &quot; cheat &quot; by using substitutes for high-price inputs . 
The shift might take many decades , but it also might come much faster as artificial intelligence fuels the next wave of innovation . 
Perhaps skilled workers will try to band together to get governments to pass laws and regulations making it more difficult for firms to make their jobs obsolete . 
But if the global trading system remains open to competition , skilled workers &quot; ability to forestall labor-saving technology indefinitely should prove little more successful than such attempts by unskilled workers in the past . 
The next generation of technological advances could also promote greater income equality by leveling the playing field in education . 
Currently , educational resources - particularly tertiary educational resources ( university ) - in many poorer countries are severely limited relative to wealthy countries , and , so far , the Internet and computers have exacerbated the differences . 
But it does not have to be that way . 
Surely , higher education will eventually be hit by the same kind of sweeping wave of technology that has flattened the automobile and media industries , among others . 
If the commoditization of education eventually extends to at least lower-level college courses , the impact on income inequality could be profound . 
Many commentators seem to believe that the growing gap between rich and poor is an inevitable byproduct of increasing globalization and technology . 
In their view , governments will need to intervene radically in markets to restore social balance . 
I disagree . 
Yes , we need genuinely progressive tax systems , respect for workers &quot; rights , and generous aid policies on the part of rich countries . 
But the past is not necessarily prologue : given the remarkable flexibility of market forces , it would be foolish , if not dangerous , to infer rising inequality in relative incomes in the coming decades by extrapolating from recent trends .
