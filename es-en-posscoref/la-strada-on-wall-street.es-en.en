La Strada on Wall Street 
VIENNA - Apologists for neo-liberalism assume not only that states should be run like companies , but also that , as far as possible , they should not intervene in the economy . 
The market , they insist , regulates itself . 
But , more than 50 years ago , the Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson contradicted this idealization of markets in graphic terms : absolute freedom for the market will lead to Rockefeller &apos;s dog getting the milk that a poor child needs for healthy development , not because of market failure , but because &quot; goods are placed in the hands of those who pay the most for them . &quot; 
This distributional quandary lies at the heart of the capitalist system , which is one of never-ending competition fueled by the drive to maximize profits . 
In such a world , there is no room for a social conscience . 
It is the state that , to a greater extent in some societies than in others , must fill the gap . 
The market economy is unsurpassed as a system for creating wealth , but only social compensation ensures that this wealth is distributed in a just manner . 
Europe &apos;s social-market economies , far more than the Anglo-Saxon neo-liberal model , regard mitigating the inequalities created by markets as the state &apos;s duty . 
In fact , the market economy can function only if the state does intervene . 
The US financial crisis demonstrates what happens when markets are given free rein . 
Rather than regulate themselves , market players destroy themselves , however much they might be marveled at as golden calves . 
Indeed , investment bankers transformed stock markets into a surreal circus . 
For the most part , they resembled high-wire artists juggling borrowed money without a safety net . 
They threatened to crash - until the state stepped in . 
In Fellini &apos;s film &quot; La Strada , &quot; the circus artists lived on the margins of society ; in the &quot; Wall Street Circus , &quot; they lived like gods , making millions . 
That &apos;s over for a while . 
Wall Street has collapsed . 
The present crisis , the fall of Wall Street , is to neo-liberalism what the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was to communism . 
The global dimension of this crisis surprisingly also has a positive side . 
The international community is now charged with thinking about how to reorganize the financial sector and minimize the risk of similar catastrophe in the future . 
Until now , a major part of the problem was countries &quot; unwillingness to cooperate . 
Previous demands for stricter regulations came to nothing because of financial sector opposition . 
When should this stance change if not now ? 
A start needs to be made at the European Council meeting of the heads of state and government in Brussels in mid-October . 
It is crucial that the European Union accepts the challenge of the financial crisis at the highest level , draws the appropriate conclusions , and takes the logical next steps . 
So what lessons are to be learned from the failure of the neo-liberal economic model ? 
First , markets need clear rules . 
Stronger regulation means legally binding , globally applicable rules and standards . 
While important areas of economic policy are subject to rules that allow penal sanctions , the financial sector has a special status that is no longer acceptable . 
Those areas of the financial sector that have suffered the most reputational damage are the ones least subject to regulation and supervision : the derivatives market , hedge funds and private equity funds , and the ratings agencies . 
Voluntary codes of good conduct have been a dismal failure . 
We urgently need globally applicable regulatory minimum standards similar to those , say , within the WTO . 
We need a democratically legitimized world finance organization , equipped with the necessary regulatory instruments , which would supervise major global financial institutions . 
This organization should also have authority to create conditions for greater transparency , and to implement better early-warning systems and instruments for crisis management . 
The newly created regulation need not apply to everyone . 
But only those financial institutions that subject themselves to these rules would be able to rely on the support of the public authorities in case of a crisis . 
This would ensure both fiscal stability and fiscal innovation - in contrast to the present situation , in which no one obeyed any rules and , when crisis erupted , taxpayers had to come to the rescue . 
Second , welfare-state institutions should be strengthened . 
The crisis has made clear that the provision of people &apos;s elementary needs must not be made dependent on speculation and stock market curves . 
Expansion of public financing for pensions , nursing care , and health insurance is therefore crucial . 
Finally , we need a European economic stimulus program - a &quot; Big Bargain &quot; - and we need it now . 
The crisis in international financial markets has had a noticeable impact on Europe &apos;s real economy . 
Some large EU countries are on the brink of recession . 
Japan in the early 1990 &quot; s waited too long to act and missed the right opportunity to enact countermeasures , which is why Japan has still not recovered from its long stagnation . 
Public investment in infrastructure ( such as a massive expansion of the European railroad network ) , as well as climate protection and environmental technology , will be needed . 
To strengthen purchasing power and to stimulate consumption , tax cuts on low- and medium-income households are essential . 
Of course , EU member states should determine the concrete form that such economic stabilization programs take for themselves . 
But that shouldn &apos;t stop European governments from working together closely . 
To be effective , any stimulus program will need Europe &apos;s nations to act in concert .
