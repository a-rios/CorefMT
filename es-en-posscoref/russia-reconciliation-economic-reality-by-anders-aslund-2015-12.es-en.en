Putin &apos;s New Prudence 
WASHINGTON , DC - This year , the Russian economy is the G-20 &quot; s worst performer , contracting by 3.8 % , according to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s latest forecast . 
And things could easily have been worse . 
At the end of 2014 , Russia was seized by financial panic . 
The Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) responded to collapsing oil prices by floating the ruble , which immediately lost half its value . 
Desperate Russians rushed to buy whatever they could before their money became worthless . 
Inflation shot up to 16 % . 
Putin &apos;s prescription - given at his annual televised press conference last December - was not reassuring : &quot; We intend to use the measures we applied , and rather successfully , back in 2008 . &quot; 
He was referring to Russia &apos;s response to the financial crisis , when it carried out the largest fiscal stimulus in the G-20 - no less than 10 % of GDP . 
The result : GDP fell by 7.8 % , the largest drop in the G-20 . 
In short , Putin was proposing to repeat a failed policy . 
Fortunately for Russia , Putin did not carry out his promise . 
In 2008-2009 , the CBR pursued a policy of gradual devaluation , bailing out all big state-owned and private corporations , regardless of their performance . 
This time , Russia has maintained a floating exchange rate , conserving its reserves . 
The CBR stabilized the market by shock-hiking its interest rate , and has since reduced it gradually , as any sound central bank would . 
Russia did adopt an anti-crisis stimulus package ; but , at 3.5 % of GDP , it was just one-third the size of the 2008 package . 
And while the Russian government singled out some enterprises as &quot; strategic , &quot; it actually gave them very little money . 
Many big companies , most notably in the construction and aviation sectors , were forced into bankruptcy . 
Creative destruction , which in the late 1990s provided Russia with a decade of stratospheric growth , has been revived somewhat . 
Since the expropriation of Yukos Oil Company in 2004 , Putin &apos;s policy had been highly benevolent to large state-owned firms . 
But now , with oil prices down sharply , Russia &apos;s export revenue has plummeted by 30 % this year , and state funds have become very scarce . 
Something had to give , and , to Putin &apos;s credit , it was not fiscal conservatism . 
This year , Russia &apos;s budget deficit is expected to be just 2 % of GDP , rising to 3.5 % in 2016 - a remarkably strong performance given that the country has had to weather a trade shock and international financial sanctions . 
Next year , the government is set to use $ 40-45 billion of its reserve fund for budget financing . 
But Russia can afford that : its total international reserves currently amount to $ 364 billion , and its public debt is barely 14 % of GDP . 
Accomplishing this has required Putin to abandon some of his regime &apos;s taboos . 
For the first 15 years of Putin &apos;s rule , Russians &quot; standard of living rose steadily ; but it has fallen sharply since November 2014 . 
Real pensions are also declining , and spending on health care and education is set to fall by 8 % next year . 
State-owned firms have been affected as well . 
Gazprom , Rosneft ( which absorbed Yukos ) , and Russian Railways have been publicly begging for government money . 
Last December , Putin accepted a complex financing scheme for Rosneft . 
But by August , it was clear that all three corporate giants would receive only a small share of what they wanted . 
The powerful head of Russian Railways , Vladimir Yakunin , an alleged former KGB officer and friend of Putin &apos;s , was fired . 
Given Western financial sanctions , Putin &apos;s effort to conserve state funds is entirely sensible . 
Still , the significance of these changes should not be exaggerated . 
Their macroeconomic impact is substantial , but no systemic reforms are on the agenda . 
Unlike China , Russia has made no attempt to rein in rampant corruption at the top . 
Nor has anything been done to strengthen the rule of law . 
Tens of thousands of presumably innocent Russian businessmen sit in pretrial detention because security officials want to seize their companies . 
Protectionism proliferates as Russia imposes ever more trade sanctions . 
The big question is how Russians will respond when they realize that the decline in their standard of living is not temporary , as it was in 1998 . 
In 2014 , Russia &apos;s GDP was $ 2.1 trillion ( at the current exchange rate ) . 
These numbers do not reflect purchasing power , but the Russian middle class measure their salaries in dollars . 
So far , public reaction has been muted , but a two-week protest by Russia &apos;s truck drivers over a new highway toll suggests that popular quiescence may not last . 
At his press conference last December , Putin laid out his expectations : &quot; In a worst-case scenario , I believe &#91; the crisis &#93; would take a couple of years .... After that , growth is inevitable , due to a changing foreign economic situation among other things . 
A growing world economy will require additional energy resources . &quot; 
This December , Putin stated : &quot; The current situation is complicated but ... not critical . &quot; 
That is no longer believable . 
Russia &apos;s economy was stagnating even before the bottom fell out of global oil prices , and most experts expect energy prices to remain low for years . 
This confronts Putin with a challenge he has never faced : leading Russia at a time when there is no light visible at the end of the tunnel .
