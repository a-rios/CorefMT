Obasanjo &apos;s Troubling End-Game 
In Nigeria today , the key question nowadays is not whether President Olusegun Obasanjo will quit after his second ( and final ) term expires next year , but who will succeed him . 
Given Nigeria &apos;s history of sit-tight military dictatorships , that is real progress . 
Unfortunately , it is not necessarily the president &apos;s doing . 
Attempts by Obasanjo &apos;s supporters to persuade the National Assembly to amend the Constitution to enable Obasanjo to continue in office beyond two terms met a solid wall of opposition . 
Government and commercial activities virtually ground to halt this spring as democracy activists , in alliance with politicians and lawmakers opposed to a third term , battled Obasanjo &apos;s allies to thwart the proposed bill . 
The failure of Obasanjo &apos;s supporters triggered three big political developments . 
The president &apos;s authority is draining away precipitately , and his vice-like grip on his People &apos;s Democratic Party ( PDP ) has loosened . 
Opposition parties , human rights groups , and other government critics , hitherto cowed by a seemingly omnipotent Obasanjo and PDP machine , have found a new lease on life . 
Obasanjo , besieged and angry that friends at home and abroad ( particularly in the United States and Europe ) betrayed him by aiding his political opponents in killing the amendment , is determined to settle scores . 
The storm had hardly settled when Obasanjo sacked General Aliyu Gusau , his powerful National Security Adviser . 
Several senior military officers whose loyalty was questionable were also replaced . 
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , the Finance Minister and the brain behind the government &apos;s economic reforms , was redeployed to head the Foreign Ministry , in a move widely seen as punishment , as Obasanjo has dominated foreign policy-making throughout his tenure . 
The official spin is that Okonjo-Iweala , a former World Bank economist , was reassigned to prepare her for higher office in 2007 , and that the move signals the end of the President &apos;s love affair with IMF-guided neo-liberal reforms . 
Obasanjo is also shaking up the oil industry in a double maneuver interpreted as a rap on the knuckles for his Western allies and a last ditch effort to secure a legacy as the one Nigerian leader who tamed corruption in that sector . 
American , British , and French oil companies enjoyed a virtual monopoly of Nigeria &apos;s oil industry . 
Royal Dutch Shell &apos;s joint venture with the government produces half of the country &apos;s daily output of 2.5 million barrels . 
Two US companies , Chevron Texaco and Mobil , are also key players . 
Obasanjo &apos;s new oil policy threatens this dominance . 
China made a dramatic entry into the picture last April , when Nigerian officials announced that China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) had bought a 45 % stake in a Nigerian oil field for more than $ 2 billion . 
That field will pump 225,000 barrels per day when it begins production in 2008 . 
Obasanjo also negotiated a loan of $ 1 billion from the Chinese government to finance repair of Nigeria &apos;s railways and buy new rolling stock . 
These deals were brokered at the height of the constitutional drama , when America said it would not support an attempt by the government to extend its stay in office unconstitutionally . 
In addition to rolling out the welcome mat for energy-hungry China , oil ministry officials say they will tighten financial regulations and impose sanctions on companies seen as defaulting on tax and royalty payments - moves apparently aimed at local subsidiaries of Western oil companies in the Niger Delta . 
The announcement was welcomed by ordinary Nigerians , but incited jitters in the industry , prompting anxious questions about how deep Obasanjo &apos;s angry sword will cut , and how smooth the political succession is likely to be . 
Obasanjo has made it clear that Atiku Abubakar , the Vice President and the arrowhead of the anti-third term coalition , will not succeed him . 
In fact , the PDP has splintered into three warring factions , drastically reducing Obasanjo &apos;s chances to control the succession . 
Muhammadu Buhari , a retired general who challenged Obasanjo for the presidency in 2003 and lost , has said that he will try again in 2007 on the platform of the All Nigeria People &apos;s Party ( ANPP ) , the second largest party . 
Obasanjo &apos;s spokesmen regularly brief journalists anonymously that he favors a successor from the Niger delta area . 
The President has appointed the late Ken Saro-Wiwa &apos;s son as one of his special assistants , in an attempt to mend fences with political elites in the restive delta . 
Obasanjo is anxious to thwart the region &apos;s growing armed insurgency , which is driven by widespread poverty and oil industry-related ecological damage . 
Dangling the PDP &apos;s presidential ticket before the delta region &apos;s leading politicians is seen as Obasanjo &apos;s strategy to maintain stability and , more importantly , prevent Atiku Abubakar or General Buhari from coming to power . 
As it has since the discovery of oil and the Biafran War in the 1960 &quot; s , the Niger Delta will be at the center of Nigerian politics . 
This time , however , the politics will be democratic .
