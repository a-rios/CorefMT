Milosevic and Hussein : Trial by Farce 
Trials of war criminals were once serious business . 
Recall the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg . 
Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials . 
Nowadays , legal proceedings against the world &apos;s most wicked leaders have become farce . 
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba &apos;athist cronies offers an ongoing series of embarrassments . 
The defendants try one antic after another , and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible except &quot; mooning &quot; the judge . 
It is hard to expect an outcome that will appear legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world . 
Meanwhile , Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s trial morphed into a funeral after four boring years of testimony and a sunken cost of more than $ 200 million . 
In Cambodia , the United Nations and the government have dickered for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures to trial . 
The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were doomed to being killed in popular revolts or to being tried for their crimes - that is , if they did not die in power . 
Who can be proud that Romania &apos;s last Communist boss , Nicolai Ceaucescu , and his wife were shot without even the semblance of a fair trial ? 
The formal trappings of a real court always seem better than instant justice , even if the end result is also death . 
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant . 
A nation could put its own former leaders on trial , as the Argentines did in the 1980 &quot; s with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 fellow citizens . 
At the international level , the Nuremberg model remains available to generate further trials , though under the dubious conditions that victorious powers sometimes impose liability for crimes , such as &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; that were are not properly defined at the time they are committed . 
There was a time when we could see the advantages of both national and international trials . 
Home grown trials enabled the local community to work out its grief by participating closely in the process . 
As judges and juries , the defendant &apos;s compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the assessment of guilt because they appreciated the tough conditions under which a deposed dictator made his decisions . 
Argentina &apos;s trial of the generals was a successful ritual in the painstaking transition from military junta to democracy , but the experience ended with weeping self-doubt . 
Even after conviction , the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president . 
Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of those trials of 20 years ago . 
At the international level , the UN Security Council &apos;s decision to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) was also greeted with great confidence . 
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese . 
But then the judges had the misfortune of realizing their fondest dream - trying in their court the arch-villain Slobodan Milosevic . 
It is not clear how the Serbs would have handled Milosevic in a local trial . 
A lot would have depended on the political party that controlled the court . 
At the international level , the fear was not of too much politics but of too much law . 
Milosevic &apos;s trial had to be more than fair , it had to be an emblem of UN Justice . 
Thus Milosevic was allowed to defend himself - a huge mistake in terms of the trial &apos;s length and efficiency . 
There was no limit on the number of witnesses the prosecution called to testify about the same gruesome story of Serbian aggression and brutality . 
It will take many months to determine what went wrong and why the trial lasted a scandalous four years . 
My hunch is that the court &apos;s well-meaning officials were too influenced by the South African Peace and Reconciliation Commission , a model touted in law schools as the desired alternative to retributive justice . 
In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims . 
Every victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened . 
In the case of massacres endured in the twentieth century , such storytelling can last decades . 
Encouraging victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to filibuster the proceedings by touting his merits as a political leader amounts to a formula for infinite delay . 
One lesson we have learned from both the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that one should not put men or women on trial in order to terminate their charismatic appeal . 
They will turn the trial around - particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves - and use the courtroom to vindicate their careers . 
Tyrants should be tried only after they are clearly defeated . 
Ironically , it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were staffed by the representatives of the victorious powers . 
They were a constant reminder to Goering , Hess , and their henchmen that the Allies were in charge , that the Nazis were irreversibly defeated . 
Punishing the guilty , rather than shaping the way history would be written , was always the clear objective of the trial . 
The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the &quot; i &quot; s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial . 
The resulting hesitancy of those in charge gave rise to procedures - both international and national - that facilitated fantasies of vindication and return . 
In the case of Hussein , that fantasy may yet become real .
