A Prisoner &apos;s Reflections on Nelson Mandela 
KHARKIV - Incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability . 
As a prisoner , I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself , my political beliefs , and my country . 
So I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men , old and young , who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future . 
In prison , your hopes and dreams become your reality . 
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed . 
The South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades , but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality , courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence . 
Around the world , most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness . 
Even here , behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long , I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile , merry eyes , and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache . 
And I can admire his unyielding - and , yes , sometimes wily - commitment to reconciliation , which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable . 
How wrong they were , and how miraculous was Mandela &apos;s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa . 
But here , in this place , it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination . 
&quot; My &quot; Mandela is the prisoner , the Mandela of Robben Island , who endured 27 years behind bars ( 18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic ) and yet emerged with his spirit intact , brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa , a country liberated even for apartheid &apos;s architects and beneficiaries . 
No purges marked the end of white rule . 
There were no witch-hunts , nor was there summary justice . 
All that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed . 
Through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country &apos;s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future - a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess . 
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom , because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison . 
Indeed , he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison - perhaps like no other environment - can nurture . 
Imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well . 
&quot; Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties , either - but right through every human heart - and through all human hearts , &quot; he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago . 
&quot; This line shifts .... And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil , one small bridgehead of good is retained . 
The ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow . 
Forced to reckon with your own vulnerability , isolation , and losses ( and seemingly lost cause ) , you learn to look more carefully into the human heart - yours and that of your jailers . 
Mandela epitomized this rare gift . 
How else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa &apos;s first democratically elected president ? 
Of course , behind Mandela &apos;s generous spirit was a character of steel . 
He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause . 
As usual , Mandela &apos;s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this : &quot; As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , I knew if I didn &apos;t leave my bitterness and hatred behind , I &apos;d still be in prison . &quot; 
And just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall , I know in my solitude that Ukraine &apos;s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain .
