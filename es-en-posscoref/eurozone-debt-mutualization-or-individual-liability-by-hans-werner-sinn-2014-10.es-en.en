Europe &apos;s Brush with Debt 
MUNICH - French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and his Italian counterpart , Matteo Renzi , have declared - or at least insinuated - that they will not comply with the fiscal compact to which all of the eurozone &apos;s member countries agreed in 2012 ; instead , they intend to run up fresh debts . 
Their stance highlights a fundamental flaw in the structure of the European Monetary Union - one that Europe &apos;s leaders must recognize and address before it is too late . 
The fiscal compact - formally the Treaty on Stability , Coordination , and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union - was the quid pro quo for Germany to approve the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , which was essentially a collective bailout package . 
The compact sets a strict ceiling for a country &apos;s structural budget deficit and stipulates that public-debt ratios in excess of 60 % of GDP must be reduced yearly by one-twentieth of the difference between the current ratio and the target . 
Yet France &apos;s debt / GDP ratio will rise to 96 % by the end of this year , from 91 % in 2012 , while Italy &apos;s will reach 135 % , up from 127 % in 2012 . 
The effective renunciation of the fiscal compact by Valls and Renzi suggests that these ratios will rise even further in the coming years . 
In this context , eurozone leaders must ask themselves tough questions about the sustainability of the current system for managing debt in the EMU . 
They should begin by considering the two possible models for ensuring stability and debt sustainability in a monetary union : the mutualization model and the liability model . 
Europe has so far stuck to the mutualization model , in which individual states &quot; debts are underwritten by a common central bank or fiscal bailout system , ensuring security for investors and largely eliminating interest-rate spreads among countries , regardless of their level of indebtedness . 
In order to prevent the artificial reduction of interest rates from encouraging countries to borrow excessively , political debt brakes are instituted . 
In the eurozone , mutualization was realized through generous ESM bailouts and some â‚¬ 1 trillion ( $ 1.27 trillion ) worth of TARGET2 credit from national printing presses for the crisis-stricken countries . 
Moreover , the European Central Bank pledged to protect these countries from default free of charge through its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) scheme - that is , by promising to purchase their sovereign debt on secondary markets - which functions roughly as Eurobonds would . 
The supposed hardening of the debt ceiling in 2012 adhered to this model . 
The alternative - the liability model - requires that each state take responsibility for its own debts , with its creditors bearing the costs of a default . 
Faced with that risk , creditors demand higher interest rates from the outset or refuse to grant additional credit , thereby imposing a measure of discipline on debtors . 
The best example of the liability model is the United States . 
When US states like California , Illinois , or Minnesota get into fiscal trouble , no one expects the other states or the federal government to bail them out , let alone that the Federal Reserve will guarantee or purchase their bonds . 
Indeed , the Fed , unlike the ECB , does not buy any bonds from individual states ; investors must bear the costs of any state insolvency . 
In 1975 , New York had to pledge its future tax revenues to its creditors in order to remain solvent . 
Of course , the US was not always so strict . 
Shortly after its founding , it tried debt mutualization , with Alexander Hamilton , America &apos;s first Treasury secretary , describing the scheme in 1791 as the &quot; cement &quot; for a new American federation . 
But , as it turned out , the mutualization model - used again in 1813 during the second war against the British - fueled a credit bubble , which collapsed in 1837 and thrust nine of the 29 US states and territories into bankruptcy . 
The unresolved debt problem exacerbated tensions over the slavery issue , which triggered the Civil War in 1861 . 
In this sense , as the historian Harold James has noted , mutualization turned out to be dynamite , not cement , for the new US federation . 
Only after the Civil War did the US decide to operate the federation according to the liability model - an approach that has underpinned stability and limited individual states &quot; debt levels ever since . 
For Europe &apos;s leaders , the withdrawal by France and Italy from the fiscal compact should serve as a clear sign that the mutualization model is not working for the eurozone , either . 
Following the Fed &apos;s example , the ECB should abolish its OMT program - which , according to Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , does not comply with EU treaty law anyway . 
Furthermore , the ECB should reintroduce the requirement that TARGET2 debts be repaid with gold , as occurred in the US before 1975 to settle balances among the districts of the Federal Reserve System . 
Perhaps even the fiscal compact itself should be reconsidered . 
Such measures would serve notice to investors that they cannot hope to be saved by the printing press in times of crisis , and would thus compel them to demand higher interest rates or deter them from granting credit in the first place . 
This would lead to greater discipline among the eurozone &apos;s indebted countries and save Europe from a debt avalanche that could ultimately drive currently solvent states into bankruptcy and destroy the European integration project .
