The Value of Being Undervalued 
The paramount policy dilemma that emerging markets face nowadays is this : on the one hand , sustained economic growth requires a competitive ( read &quot; undervalued &quot; ) currency . 
On the other hand , any good news is immediately followed by currency appreciation , making the task of remaining competitive that much harder . 
So , you finally passed that crucial piece of legislation ? 
Your fiscally responsible political party just won the election ? 
Or your commodity exports hit the jackpot ? 
Good for you ! 
But the currency appreciation that follows will likely set off an unsustainable consumption boom , wreak havoc with your export sector , create unemployment , and sap your growth potential . 
Success brings its reward in the form of immediate punishment ! 
In response , central banks may intervene in currency markets to prevent appreciation , at the cost of accumulating low-yield foreign reserves and diverting themselves from their primary goal of price stability . 
This is the strategy followed by countries such as China and Argentina . 
Or the central bank lets the markets go where they will , at the cost of drawing the ire of business , labor , the rest of the government , and , in fact , practically everyone except financial types . 
This is the strategy pursued by countries such as Turkey and South Africa , which have adopted more conventional &quot; inflation targeting &quot; regimes . 
The first strategy is problematic because it is unsustainable . 
The second is undesirable because it buys stability at the cost of growth . 
The importance of a competitive currency for economic growth is undeniable . 
Virtually every instance of sustained high growth has been accompanied by a significantly depreciated real exchange rate . 
This is as true of South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , as it is of Argentina today . 
Chile made its transition to high growth in the 1980 &quot; s on the back of a large depreciation . 
Since the 1990 &quot; s , both China and India have received a huge boost from their undervalued currencies . 
These are just some of the better-known examples . 
Looking at the experience of more than 100 countries , I have found in my research that each 10 % undervaluation adds 0.3 percentage points to growth . 
Currency undervaluation is such a potent instrument for growth for the simple reason that it creates incentives for the economy &apos;s growth-promoting sectors . 
It increases the profitability of manufacturing and non-traditional agricultural sectors , which are the activities with both the highest level of labor productivity and with the most rapid rates of productivity increase . 
An undervalued currency enables an economy to integrate into the world economy on the basis of strong export performance . 
It stimulates production ( and hence employment ) , unlike overvaluation , which stimulates consumption . 
So what should policymakers do ? 
First , it is important to realize that a strong and overly volatile currency is not just the central bank &apos;s problem to fix . 
While the central bank bears a good part of the responsibility , it needs support from other parts of the government , most notably from the finance ministry . 
Maintaining a competitive currency requires a rise in domestic saving relative to investment , or a reduction in national expenditure relative to income . 
Otherwise , the competitiveness gains would be offset by rising inflation . 
This means that the fiscal authorities have a big responsibility : to target a structural fiscal surplus that is high enough to generate the space needed for real exchange rate depreciation . 
This may not be popular , especially in an economic downturn . 
But no one has the right to complain about the central bank &apos;s &quot; high-interest rate , appreciated currency &quot; policy when fiscal policy remains too lax for interest rates to be reduced without risking price stability . 
There are other instruments available for increasing domestic saving and reducing consumption besides the fiscal balance . 
Government policies can target private saving directly , by creating incentives for saving through appropriate tax and pension policies . 
Even more importantly , policies can discourage foreign-borrowing-led consumption booms by taxing capital inflows ( Chilean-style ) or increasing financial intermediaries &quot; liquidity requirements . 
There is little to be gained from letting hot money flow into an economy freely . 
With such policies in place , the comfort zone for central banks is enlarged sufficiently to loosen monetary policy . 
Equally important , the central bank needs to signal to the public that it now cares about the real exchange rate , because it is important to exports , jobs , and sustainable growth . 
This can be done without announcing a specific target level for the exchange rate . 
There is huge room to maneuver between the extremes of targeting a specific level of the real exchange rate and disowning any interest in the real exchange rate . 
The central bank does need to have a view , updated over time , about the exchange rate &apos;s appropriate range , and it should signal when it thinks the currency is moving in the wrong direction . 
Once the monetary rules of the game incorporate the real exchange rate , and assuming that fiscal policy remains supportive , investors can look forward to a less volatile and more competitive currency . 
This will mean more investment in tradable industries , more employment overall , and faster growth . 
You will know you have succeeded when the United States &quot; Treasury Secretary comes knocking on your door saying that you are guilty of manipulating your currency .
