Beggaring the World Economy 
CHICAGO - Global capital is on the move . 
As ultra-low interest rates in industrial countries send capital around the world searching for higher yields , a number of emerging-market central banks are intervening heavily , buying the foreign-capital inflows and re-exporting them in order to keep their currencies from appreciating . 
Others have been imposing capital controls of one stripe or another . 
In recent weeks , Japan became the first large industrial economy to intervene directly in currency markets . 
Why does no one want capital inflows ? 
Which intervention policies are legitimate , and which are not ? 
And where will all this intervention end if it continues unabated ? 
The portion of capital inflows that is not re-exported represents net capital inflows . 
So , one reason countries do not like capital inflows is that it means more domestic demand &quot; leaks &quot; outside . 
Indeed , because capital inflows often cause the domestic exchange rate to appreciate , they encourage further spending on foreign goods as domestic producers become uncompetitive . 
Another reason that countries do not like foreign capital inflows is that some of it might be &quot; hot &quot; ( or dumb ) money , eager to come in when foreign interest rates are low and local asset prices are rising , and quick to leave at the first sign of trouble or when opportunities back home beckon . 
Volatile capital flows induce volatility in the recipient economy , making booms and busts more pronounced than they would otherwise be . 
But , as the saying goes , it takes two hands to clap . 
If countries could maintain discipline and limit spending by their households , firms , or governments , foreign capital would not be needed , and could be re-exported easily , without much effect on the recipient economy . 
Problems arise when countries cannot - or will not - spend sensibly . 
Countries can overspend for a variety of reasons . 
The stereotypical Latin American economies of yesteryear used to get into trouble through populist government spending , while the East Asian economies ran into difficulty because of excessive long-term investment . 
In the United States in the run up to the current crisis , easy credit , especially for housing , induced households to spend too much , while in Greece , the government borrowed its way into trouble . 
Unfortunately , though , so long as some countries like China , Germany , Japan , and the oil exporters pump surplus goods into the world economy , not all countries can trim their spending to stay within their means . 
Since the world does not export to Mars , some countries have to absorb these goods , and accept the capital inflows that finance their consumption . 
In the medium term , over-spenders should trim their outlays and habitual exporters should increase theirs . 
In the short run , though , the world is engaged in a gigantic game of passing the parcel , with no country wanting to take the habitual exporters &quot; goods and their capital surpluses . 
This is what makes today &apos;s beggar-thy-neighbor policies so destructive : though some countries will eventually have to absorb the surpluses and capital , each country is trying to avoid them . 
So which policy interventions are legitimate ? 
Any policy of intervening in the exchange rate , or imposing import tariffs or capital controls , tends to force other countries to make greater adjustments . 
China &apos;s exchange-rate intervention probably hurts a number of other emerging-market exporters that do not intervene as much and are less competitive as a result . 
But industrial countries , too , intervene substantially in markets . 
For example , while US monetary-policy intervention ( yes , monetary policy is also intervention ) has done little to boost domestic demand , it has spurred domestic capital to search for yield around the world . 
The US dollar would fall substantially - encouraging greater exports - were it not for the fact that foreign central banks are pushing much of that capital right back by buying US government securities . 
All this creates distortions that delay adjustment - exchange rates are too low in emerging markets , slowing their move away from exports , while the ease with which the US government is being financed creates little incentive for US politicians to reduce spending over the medium term . 
Rather than intervening to obtain a short-term increase in their share of slow-growing global demand , it makes sense for countries to make their economies more balanced and efficient over the medium term . 
That will allow them to contribute in a sustainable way to increasing global demand . 
China , for example , must move more income to households and away from its firms , so that private consumption can increase . 
The US must improve the education and skills of significant parts of its labor force , so that they can produce more of the high-quality knowledge and service-sector exports in which the US specializes . 
Higher incomes would boost US savings , reducing households &quot; dependence on debt , even as they maintained consumption levels . 
Unfortunately , all this will take time , and citizens impatient for jobs and growth are pressing their politicians . 
Countries around the world are embracing shortsighted policies that cater to the immediate needs of domestic constituencies . There are exceptions . 
India , for example , has eschewed currency intervention thus far , even while opening up to long-term rupee debt inflows , in an attempt to finance much-needed infrastructure projects . 
India &apos;s willingness to spend when everyone else is attempting to sell and save entails risks that need to be carefully managed . 
After all , beggar-thy-neighbor policies will succeed only in making us all beggars .
