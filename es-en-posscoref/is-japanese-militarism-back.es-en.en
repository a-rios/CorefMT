Is Japanese Militarism Back ? 
Japan &apos;s barbaric conduct during WWII - and the Allies &apos; nuclear retaliation at Hiroshima and Nagasaki - laid the foundation for the US-imposed pacifism that has reigned since the war &apos;s end . 
The Self-Defense Forces ( SDF ) that emerged during the 1950 &apos;s were designed ( in theory ) only to defend Japan from attack . 
Offensive missions were forbidden by the Constitution . 
But Japan now has in Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi a leader who wants the country to be militarily proactive . 
Koizumi holds a majority in both houses of the Diet , Japan &apos;s parliament , and despite the continuing popularity of pacifism , he intends the SDF to become capable of &quot; preventive self defense &quot;  - a form of offensive action in all but name . 
That proposal is uniting Japan &apos;s opposition parties against him . 
Indeed , the dispatch of Japanese peacekeepers under UN command to Cambodia in 1992 ( the first time the 240,000-strong SDF had ventured on a mission abroad ) was bitterly contested . 
While Japanese warships &apos; logistical support during the recent Afghan conflict was a no-risk operation , that may not be true of the SDF &apos;s latest venture - participation in reconstruction in &quot; pacified zones &quot; in Iraq . 
Japan &apos;s growing willingness to flex its muscles overseas is reflected in the changing face of the SDF . 
The Koizumi government plans to add two new 13,500-ton warships , both capable of carrying helicopters and of being converted to take jump jets to strike enemy territory . 
Similarly , a 6,000-man commando unit will be recruited not only to confront outbreaks of domestic terrorism , but also to provide the air-landed component for the new ship-based helicopter squadrons . 
Today , Japanese spy satellites closely observe North Korea &apos;s nuclear sites . 
If evidence emerges that Korea has the means to deliver nuclear weapons , then it seems probable that Japan will follow suit and develop its own nuclear capacity , riling South Korea and China . 
All of this suggests a tectonic shift in Japan &apos;s military thinking . 
But Koizumi is behaving in accordance with a deep-rooted tradition in Japan , one that long precedes the attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 . 
Indeed , next year is the centenary of the Russo-Japanese War . 
To understand what is happening militarily in Japan today , there is no better approach than to examine the soul of the Japanese state one hundred years ago . 
By 1904 , Japan had already fought a one-sided , eight-month campaign against China . 
Under the 1895 peace settlement of Shimonoseki , the full independence of Korea was guaranteed and Japan gained Formosa , the Pescadores , and Manchuria &apos;s strategically important Liaoting Peninsula , with Port Arthur ( Lushun ) lying just to the south . 
Russia , France , and Germany objected to this . 
Russia coveted Port Arthur , and the powers jointly brought pressure on Japan to withdraw from the Treaty of Shimonoseki . 
As a sweetener , Japan was offered Â£ 5 million . 
Outraged at being forced to back down , the Japanese invested in shipyards to build a modern fleet . 
Japan was determined to assert its mastery in the region because Korea and Manchuria were essential for producing food for a population of over 46 million engaged principally in manufacturing . 
Russia also coveted Korea and Manchuria . 
The Japanese at first tried to appease the Russians , declaring Manchuria beyond its sphere of interest in exchange for a similar guarantee from Russia about Korea . 
But Russian noblemen with timber interests in Korea persuaded the Tsar to resist . 
What , they asked , could Russia possibly fear from &quot; yellow monkeys &quot; ? 
Besides , a short , victorious war might help stem the revolutionary tide threatening the Romanov dynasty . 
With a diplomatic resolution ruled out , Japan launched a preemptive strike that annihilated the Russian Fleet in Port Arthur and Chemulpo , Korea . 
For the Russians , the situation military went from bad to worse . 
But the peace treaty agreed at Portsmouth , New Hampshire in 1905 ( brokered by President Theodore Roosevelt ) hardly reflected this . 
On the contrary , the New York Times called the outcome &quot; astonishing ... 
Predictably , this fueled more outrage in Japan . 
Indeed , from this point began the fatal rivalry between Japan and the US that culminated in Pearl Harbor . 
The Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi , which led the attack on Pearl Harbor , flew the battle flag flown by the Mikasa , Admiral Togo &apos;s ship when he attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . 
Japan became militaristic previously because civilian politicians lost control of Japan &apos;s generals , who were ignored by their own colonels and majors . 
The most dangerous course for Japan now would be to continue its dribbled , strategically aimless increase in defense spending , while treating the armed forces as pariahs , leaving them without a coherent command and with no leadership from the government . 
The doctrine of preventive defense has deep roots in Japan , and it is a dangerous doctrine if there is a political vacuum for the country &apos;s militarists to fill . 
Such a vacuum can be created only by government leaders who are too cowardly to devise and enforce their own defense policy . 
The Koizumi government ought to take note .
