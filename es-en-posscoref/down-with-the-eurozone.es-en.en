Down with the Eurozone 
NEW YORK - The eurozone crisis seems to be reaching its climax , with Greece on the verge of default and an inglorious exit from the monetary union , and now Italy on the verge of losing market access . 
But the eurozone &apos;s problems are much deeper . 
They are structural , and they severely affect at least four other economies : Ireland , Portugal , Cyprus , and Spain . 
For the last decade , the PIIGS ( Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain ) were the eurozone &apos;s consumers of first and last resort , spending more than their income and running ever-larger current-account deficits . 
Meanwhile , the eurozone core ( Germany , the Netherlands , Austria , and France ) comprised the producers of first and last resort , spending below their incomes and running ever-larger current-account surpluses . 
These external imbalances were also driven by the euro &apos;s strength since 2002 , and by the divergence in real exchange rates and competitiveness within the eurozone . 
Unit labor costs fell in Germany and other parts of the core ( as wage growth lagged that of productivity ) , leading to a real depreciation and rising current-account surpluses , while the reverse occurred in the PIIGS ( and Cyprus ) , leading to real appreciation and widening current-account deficits . 
In Ireland and Spain , private savings collapsed , and a housing bubble fueled excessive consumption , while in Greece , Portugal , Cyprus , and Italy , it was excessive fiscal deficits that exacerbated external imbalances . 
The resulting build-up of private and public debt in over-spending countries became unmanageable when housing bubbles burst ( Ireland and Spain ) and current-account deficits , fiscal gaps , or both became unsustainable throughout the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
Moreover , the peripheral countries &quot; large current-account deficits , fueled as they were by excessive consumption , were accompanied by economic stagnation and loss of competitiveness . 
So , now what ? 
Symmetrical reflation is the best option for restoring growth and competitiveness on the eurozone &apos;s periphery while undertaking necessary austerity measures and structural reforms . 
This implies significant easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank ; provision of unlimited lender-of-last-resort support to illiquid but potentially solvent economies ; a sharp depreciation of the euro , which would turn current-account deficits into surpluses ; and fiscal stimulus in the core if the periphery is forced into austerity . 
Unfortunately , Germany and the ECB oppose this option , owing to the prospect of a temporary dose of modestly higher inflation in the core relative to the periphery . 
The bitter medicine that Germany and the ECB want to impose on the periphery - the second option - is recessionary deflation : fiscal austerity , structural reforms to boost productivity growth and reduce unit labor costs , and real depreciation via price adjustment , as opposed to nominal exchange-rate adjustment . 
The problems with this option are many . 
Fiscal austerity , while necessary , means a deeper recession in the short term . 
Even structural reform reduces output in the short run , because it requires firing workers , shutting down money-losing firms , and gradually reallocating labor and capital to emerging new industries . 
So , to prevent a spiral of ever-deepening recession , the periphery needs real depreciation to improve its external deficit . 
But even if prices and wages were to fall by 30 % over the next few years ( which would most likely be socially and politically unsustainable ) , the real value of debt would increase sharply , worsening the insolvency of governments and private debtors . 
In short , the eurozone &apos;s periphery is now subject to the paradox of thrift : increasing savings too much , too fast leads to renewed recession and makes debts even more unsustainable . 
And that paradox is now affecting even the core . 
If the peripheral countries remain mired in a deflationary trap of high debt , falling output , weak competitiveness , and structural external deficits , eventually they will be tempted by a third option : default and exit from the eurozone . 
This would enable them to revive economic growth and competitiveness through a depreciation of new national currencies . 
Of course , such a disorderly eurozone break-up would be as severe a shock as the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 , if not worse . 
Avoiding it would compel the eurozone &apos;s core economies to embrace the fourth and final option : bribing the periphery to remain in a low-growth uncompetitive state . 
This would require accepting massive losses on public and private debt , as well as enormous transfer payments that boost the periphery &apos;s income while its output stagnates . 
Italy has done something similar for decades , with its northern regions subsidizing the poorer Mezzogiorno . 
But such permanent fiscal transfers are politically impossible in the eurozone , where Germans are Germans and Greeks are Greeks . 
That also means that Germany and the ECB have less power than they seem to believe . 
Unless they abandon asymmetric adjustment ( recessionary deflation ) , which concentrates all of the pain in the periphery , in favor of a more symmetrical approach ( austerity and structural reforms on the periphery , combined with eurozone-wide reflation ) , the monetary union &apos;s slow-developing train wreck will accelerate as peripheral countries default and exit . 
The recent chaos in Greece and Italy may be the first step in this process . 
Clearly , the eurozone &apos;s muddle-through approach no longer works . 
Unless the eurozone moves toward greater economic , fiscal , and political integration ( on a path consistent with short-term restoration of growth , competitiveness , and debt sustainability , which are needed to resolve unsustainable debt and reduce chronic fiscal and external deficits ) , recessionary deflation will certainly lead to a disorderly break-up . 
With Italy too big to fail , too big to save , and now at the point of no return , the endgame for the eurozone has begun . 
Sequential , coercive restructurings of debt will come first , and then exits from the monetary union that will eventually lead to the eurozone &apos;s disintegration .
