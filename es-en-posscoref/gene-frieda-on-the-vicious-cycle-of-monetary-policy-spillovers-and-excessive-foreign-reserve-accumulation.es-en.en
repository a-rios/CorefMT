Self-Insurance or Self-Destruction ? 
NEW DELHI - Though the US Federal Reserve is turning a blind eye to the spillover effects of its monetary policy , the rest of the world is worrying about the impact that capital-flow reversals will have on emerging economies . 
Will the foreign reserves that these countries have built up in recent years prove adequate to protect their financial systems , as liquidity flows back toward developed economies ? 
The short answer is no , because excessive self-insurance ultimately does more harm than good . 
In order to break the destabilizing cycle of short-term capital flows and excessive accumulation of foreign reserves , the International Monetary Fund , with broad support from the G-20 , must devise new rules regarding monetary-policy spillovers . 
Severe crises leave an imprint on a nation &apos;s psyche . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s , the currency and banking crises that ravaged Asian economies led the affected countries &quot; leaders to a simple conclusion : no amount of insurance was too much . 
Although the introduction of floating exchange rates removed the incentive to borrow in a foreign currency ( and thus the need for self-insurance ) , the political humiliation of losing sovereignty to the IMF - if only temporarily - was so devastating that the economic costs of building a massive foreign-currency war chest seemed worthwhile . 
But these countries &quot; leaders failed to grasp the full consequences . 
Foreign-exchange reserve accumulation depresses the exchange rate , ostensibly as a smoothing device . 
But stronger emerging-market currencies in the 2000 &quot; s would likely have led to earlier rebalancing toward domestic demand . 
And if these countries had recycled a smaller stock of foreign reserves into US Treasuries , agency bonds , and subprime securities , US interest rates would likely have remained higher , emerging-market current-account surpluses would have declined earlier , and advanced-economy deficits would have contracted , thereby restoring some semblance of equilibrium . 
But , of course , that is not what happened - to the detriment of global financial stability . 
Furthermore , the accumulation of self-insurance can beget competition similar to an arms race . 
Whether to prevent the appearance of inadequate insurance or to avoid losing export share , sizable interventions in currency markets became widely accepted among Asia &apos;s emerging economies as a natural response to large capital inflows - directly contradicting these countries &quot; commitments to floating exchange rates . 
Given that persistent currency intervention reduced volatility , it encouraged ever-larger capital inflows , under the presumption of less risk . 
At the same time , the currencies of countries that chose not to intervene became targets of speculative inflows , owing to the expectation that they would appreciate.In other words , spillovers occurred not only between advanced and emerging economies , but also among emerging economies . 
Nonetheless , countries like South Africa and Mexico - both of which chose to forego intervention - did better , in many ways , than their intervention-happy counterparts . 
Both suffered little financial fallout from the currency weakness that followed the Fed &apos;s announcement last May that it would &quot; taper &quot; its purchases of long-term assets . 
Truly floating exchange rates generally served their purposes : removing the incentive to accumulate external debt , encouraging flexibility within the real economy , and promoting the development of deep and liquid capital markets . 
Another consequence of self-insurance is rooted in the ostensibly laudable goal of preserving national sovereignty . 
Specifically , governments may be tempted , especially around election time , to use self-insurance as a substitute for adjustment , rather than to help cushion the impact of a shock or support economic rebalancing . 
The alternative - &quot; renting &quot; insurance from multilateral bodies like the IMF - would demand fulfillment of certain reform obligations . 
The fact is that emerging economies &quot; self-insurance policies , like the Fed &apos;s ultra-loose monetary policy , fuel a reflexive feedback loop . 
While any suggestion that countries cede monetary-policy independence would be foolhardy , some rules are clearly needed to limit spillovers - rules that should come from a revamped IMF , with the US Congress demonstrating its support through a long-overdue quota increase . 
Specifically , the IMF should be responsible for assessing spillovers and mobilizing liquidity support for vulnerable economies accordingly , either through central-bank currency-swap lines or IMF liquidity facilities . 
Such multilateral insurance would lessen the need for self-insurance , without impinging on countries &quot; sovereignty . 
To be sure , such rules would not insulate economies entirely from monetary-policy spillovers , which are an inescapable element of an economy &apos;s adjustment process . 
But they would help to mitigate the kind of tail risks that have plagued the financial system over the last two decades . 
Only with a well-defined mechanism for managing spillovers can the vicious cycle of capital-flow volatility and excessive self-insurance accumulation finally be broken .
