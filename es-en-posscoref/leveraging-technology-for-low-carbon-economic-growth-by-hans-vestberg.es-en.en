Networked Development 
STOCKHOLM - The challenges that the world faces in the twenty-first century are systemic and global in nature . 
There will be no easy answers to any of them , but one thing is clear : we need transformative solutions that are scalable . 
Incremental measures will only distract us from the scope of the challenges that we confront . 
One of the best examples of scale is the mobile telecommunications industry . 
There are now 6.4 billion mobile phone subscriptions , with the number expected to increase to 9.3 billion by 2017 or 2018 . 
Ericsson estimates that by 2018 , 85 % of the world &apos;s population will have access to mobile-broadband coverage via 3G networks , and 50 % will have 4G . 
In this context , the near ubiquity of mobile networks has created a new paradigm for sustainable development , putting technological advances at the forefront of policymaking . 
Technology is enabling us to share , collaborate , and exchange knowledge in entirely new ways , creating a dynamic shift in mindset . 
A new society - what we call the Networked Society - is emerging . 
Connectivity is a basic enabler of economic growth and improved quality of life , and there is a strong business case for investing in broadband to optimize the delivery of essential services in education , health care , safety , and security , and to redefine urban landscapes through intelligent electricity grids and more efficient transportation . 
In 2000 , when the United Nations Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) were established , broadband was in its infancy , and most of these benefits had not even been imagined . 
Today , as world leaders consider the post-2015 development agenda , we cannot overlook the importance of including broadband as a key part of the infrastructure needed to achieve future goals . 
The economic benefits of broadband are immense . 
A 10 % increase in broadband penetration can add a full percentage point to sustainable GDP growth , and doubling broadband speed increases GDP by 0.3 % on average . 
Moreover , mobile commerce - expected to reach $ 800 billion worldwide by 2016 - has enormous potential to improve social and financial inclusion . 
Likewise , cloud computing is already starting to revolutionize the way content is delivered and accessed both by teachers and students . 
An example of this is the cloud-based solution for schools developed by Ericsson in the Connect To Learn program . 
By addressing the challenges of access and quality of education , Connect To Learn - a collaborative effort between Ericsson , Columbia University &apos;s Earth Institute , and Millennium Promise - identifies strategies to integrate teachers &quot; professional development with twenty-first-century tools and practices in classrooms . 
As for health care , half could be delivered remotely and more efficiently . 
Evidence of this can be seen in the Millennium Villages Project , where mobile communications have had a particularly significant impact on health care : improved response times to emergencies , reduced isolation , and better training and equipment for health-care workers . 
Building on this success , the One Million Community Health Workers campaign was recently launched to expand community health-worker programs in Sub-Saharan Africa by the end of 2015 . 
With the use of the latest communications technology and diagnostic testing materials , the health workers will be able to link the rural poor to the broader system of doctors , nurses , hospitals , and clinics . 
These transformations are the result of both scale and innovation . 
If these examples were deliberately and specifically considered by the 110 countries that have national broadband plans ( and those that still do not ) , we would be much more likely to achieve the positive transformations that we all want . 
This shift in awareness among policymakers will be crucial not just for socio-economic improvement , but also for creating a low-carbon economy , which will require moving from the energy-intensive physical infrastructure of the last century to the connected , information-based infrastructure of the twenty-first century . 
We need a new paradigm that enables us to decouple GDP growth from CO2 emissions , thereby ensuring further poverty reduction without causing greater environmental damage . 
The potential is there , but too often government talks to government and industry talks to industry . 
Public-private partnerships are essential to solving these shared challenges . 
Development agencies , NGOs , and the private sector should work more effectively together to create scalable and maintainable solutions . 
Two forums are making great strides . 
One is the Broadband Commission , which advocates for broadband as a key infrastructure of the twenty-first century . 
The other is the UN &apos;s Sustainable Development Solutions Network ( SDSN ) , which seeks to leverage the private sector &apos;s wealth of resources - its innovative capacity , research and development , management skills , and know-how - to turn policy ideas into reality . 
Already , industries that have traditionally operated independently - from energy to utilities to transportation - are moving quickly toward cross-sector collaboration , radically altering the business environment , and creating opportunities for new low-carbon business models to thrive . 
With concentrated public-private efforts , and proactive governments like those of Sweden , Australia , and India , to name a few , the Networked Society will produce transformative solutions that lift billions of people out of poverty and help us to sustain our planet . 
We may not be able to imagine what the future holds , but we know that the Networked Society will shape its possibilities .
