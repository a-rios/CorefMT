A Star is Jailed 
BANGKOK - Joseph Estrada , the disgraced former president of the Philippines , faces the prospect of spending his remaining years in prison after a special court in Manila found him guilty of amassing around US $ 15 million in bribes and kickbacks . 
During the 30 months he ruled his country , from mid-1998 to the start of 2001 , Estrada accepted payoffs from gambling lords and orchestrated ( with social security funds ) sales of stocks , channeling much of the profits into his personal aliased account . 
Estrada literally defined plunder : as a senator in the early 1990 &quot; s , he was a member of the congress that crafted the law under which he was convicted . 
For many Filipinos , there is more than enough poetry in this fact , and certainly more irony than Estrada &apos;s action-comedy movies of the 1960 &quot; s ever mustered . 
There is no underplaying the significance of the court &apos;s unanimous decision to convict the first Philippine president ever to undergo a criminal trial . 
This is , after all , the Philippines , where Imelda Marcos is still living free and easy . 
Despite massive evidence of the widespread death , poverty , suffering , and dysfunction she and her late husband , the dictator Ferdinand Marcos , inflicted on the Philippines , the only real disappointment she has subsequently endured has been losing the last presidential election she was allowed to contest . 
The Philippines is not a country used to seeing powerful people punished . 
When officials are accused or suspected of corruption , they do not quickly resign , as in Korea or Japan . 
Instead , they often seek immunity by running for public office . 
When a bloody coup against Corazon Aquino &apos;s fledgling democratic government failed , the leader of the putsch escaped from a floating prison - and then successfully ran for senator . 
The wheels of Philippine justice need retooling , so much so that the country &apos;s Chief Justice himself recently called for an emergency summit to discuss a rash of extra-judicial killings that have the claimed the lives of leftists , human rights workers , and journalists under President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo . 
There have been few convictions for these crimes . 
Yet Filipinos themselves simply cannot seem to imagine their leaders behind bars . 
Even before Estrada &apos;s conviction , opinion polls showed that 48 % of Filipinos wanted clemency , if not a guaranteed pardon from Arroyo . 
More than 80 % said Estrada should be allowed to languish in a lush private family vacation home where he already spent the last six years awaiting his verdict . 
Is this lack of appetite for justice a part of Filipino culture , or learned behavior ? 
Has an overly forgiving nature prevented Filipinos from achieving closure in so many painful chapters of their history , or are the ravages of impunity to blame ? 
With so few examples of justice clearly dispensed , and overwhelmed by examples of villains so easily forgiven or forgotten , perhaps Filipinos could not bring themselves to demand what they could not imagine . 
Estrada &apos;s conviction gives Filipinos the clearest illustration of what the rule of law may bring to their society . 
Estrada remains adored by the masses , but so far the public &apos;s reaction to the verdict has been nonviolent and almost subdued . 
Notwithstanding the opinion polls , it does seem as though the public not only accepts his conviction , but that they respect it as the outcome of a fair system that has been allowed to work . 
This suggests not only that justice in the Philippines has a chance ; equally important , it suggests that Filipinos will give justice a chance . 
If the Estrada saga leads to a firm yet dignified exercise of justice , Filipinos may discover a taste for more of the same .
