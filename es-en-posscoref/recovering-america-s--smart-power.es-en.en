Recovering America &apos;s &quot; Smart Power &quot; 
The United States needs to rediscover how to be a &quot; smart power . &quot; 
That was the conclusion of a bipartisan commission that I recently co-chaired with Richard Armitage , the former deputy secretary of state in the Bush administration . 
The Smart Power Commission , convened by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , comprised Republican and Democratic members of Congress , former ambassadors , retired military officers , and heads of non-profit organizations . 
We concluded that America &apos;s image and influence had declined in recent years , and that the US must move from exporting fear to inspiring optimism and hope . 
We are not alone . 
Recently , Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for the US government to commit more money and effort to &quot; soft power , &quot; including diplomacy , economic assistance , and communications , because the military alone cannot defend America &apos;s interests around the world . 
Gates pointed out that military spending totals nearly a half-trillion dollars annually , compared to the State Department &apos;s budget of $ 36 billion . 
He acknowledged that for the head of the Pentagon to plead for more resources for the State Department was odd , but these are not normal times . 
Smart power is the ability to combine the hard power of coercion or payment with the soft power of attraction into a successful strategy . 
By and large , the US managed such a combination during the Cold War ; more recently , however , US foreign policy has tended to over-rely on hard power , because it is the most direct and visible source of American strength . 
But , while the Pentagon is the best-trained and best-resourced arm of the government , there are limits to what hard power can achieve on its own . 
Democracy , human rights , and the development of civil society do not come from the barrel of a gun . 
True , the American military has impressive operational capacity , but turning to the Pentagon because it can get things done creates an image of an over-militarized foreign policy . 
Diplomacy and foreign assistance are often under-funded and neglected , in part because it is difficult to demonstrate their short-term impact on critical challenges . 
In addition , wielding soft power is difficult because many of America &apos;s soft power resources lie outside of government in the private sector and civil society , in its bilateral alliances , multilateral institutions , and transnational contacts . 
Moreover , American foreign policy institutions and personnel are fractured and compartmentalized , and there is no adequate inter-agency process for developing and funding a smart power strategy . 
The effects of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks have also thrown us off course . 
Since the shock of those attacks , the US has been exporting fear and anger rather than the country &apos;s more traditional values of hope and optimism . 
Guant√°namo Bay has become a more powerful global icon than the Statue of Liberty . 
The CSIS Smart Power Commission acknowledged that terrorism is a real threat and likely to be with us for decades , but pointed out that over-responding to extremists &quot; provocations does more damage to the US than terrorists ever could . 
Success in the struggle against terrorism means finding a new central premise for American foreign policy to replace the current theme of a &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
That premise should be a commitment to invest in the provision of public goods that people and governments worldwide want but cannot attain without American leadership . 
By doing so , the US could rebuild the framework that it needs to address tough global challenges . 
Specifically , the Smart Power Commission recommended that American foreign policy focus on five critical areas : 
Restoring alliances , partnerships , and multilateral institutions , many of which have fallen into disarray in recent years , owing to unilateral approaches . 
Elevating the role of economic development to help align US interests with those of people around the world , starting with a major initiative on global public health . 
Investment in a public diplomacy that focuses less on broadcasting and more on face-to-face contacts , education , and exchanges that involve civil society and target young people . 
Resisting protectionism and promoting continued engagement in the global economy , which is necessary for growth and prosperity at home and abroad , while seeking inclusion for those left behind by changes that an open international economy implies . 
Shaping a global consensus and developing innovative technologies to meet the increasingly important global challenges of energy security and climate change . 
Implementing such a smart power strategy will require a strategic reassessment of how the US government is organized , coordinated , and budgeted . 
The next president should consider a number of creative solutions to maximize the administration &apos;s ability to organize for success , including the appointment of senior personnel who could reach across agencies to better align resources . 
This will require innovation , but the US has been a smart power in the past , and it can become so again .
