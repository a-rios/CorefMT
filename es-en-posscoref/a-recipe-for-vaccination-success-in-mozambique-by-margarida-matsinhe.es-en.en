Immunization on the Front Line 
MAPUTO - Most of the news one hears coming out of Mozambique is bad - poverty , disease , conflict , and floods . 
But there are a lot of good things happening in my country , too . 
I am particularly proud of the last achievement , because , by working in partnership with my fellow Mozambicans to expand immunization coverage , I believe that I have played a part in bringing it about . 
I grew up in Mozambique when the country was still under Portuguese rule , and the inequality in our colonial society shaped my view that all people have a right to health care . 
I remember working at a pediatric ward as a teenager and watching children die from diseases like polio , measles , and tetanus - all easily prevented by vaccines . 
The impact of that experience led me to spend the next 40 years working to ensure that every child in Mozambique , regardless of her ethnicity or where she lives , gets the vaccines that she needs to help her lead a long and healthy life . 
In a few days , I will join 300 global leaders in Abu Dhabi for the world &apos;s first vaccine summit - a gathering dedicated to ensuring that all children everywhere have access to vaccines . 
People like Bill Gates and Kofi Annan will make the case that immunization programs deserve adequate funding and political support . 
I don &apos;t have an audience like Gates or Annan , but I would like to add my voice to theirs . 
Millions of health workers like my colleagues and I make immunization their daily work . 
We have made tremendous strides in reaching more children with more vaccines , which is why more children are surviving than ever before . 
Because vaccines are useless if parents refuse to give them to their children , a big part of my job is to collaborate with health workers , community leaders , school teachers , and local political figures to educate parents about vaccines . 
It is also vital to ensure that vaccines get to the right place , at the right time , and in the right condition . 
For example , in order to prevent shortages , VillageReach , the organization for which I work , helped to correct the population figures used to forecast the number of vaccines needed in each health center . 
VillageReach also started a company that delivers propane gas to health centers in northern Mozambique , where , like in many of the country &apos;s rural areas , electricity is unreliable or completely unavailable to power the refrigerators that keep vaccines cool . 
Through the use of propane , we can ensure that the vaccines do not spoil during the journey from manufacturer to mother and child . 
Finally , I have learned that meticulous record-keeping and measuring results is critical to reaching more children . 
That is why we are assessing different methods for gathering data from the field , including the use of mobile applications to digitize paper records . 
Building these routine immunization systems has already helped us to eradicate diseases like polio and all but one type of measles . 
Earlier this month , we used them to vaccinate children against pneumonia for the first time in Mozambique &apos;s history , and we hope that next year we will begin to address rotavirus , which causes diarrhea and is the number one killer for children under five years old . 
Our longer-term goal is to strengthen these systems enough to reach all children in Mozambique with basic vaccines and other forms of health care . 
I believe that we can achieve this goal , because I have witnessed how far we have come already , despite our struggles . 
Big challenges lie ahead , but I am confident that with the support of the global community , I can leave to my own children and community a thriving country where every person has the opportunity to prosper .
