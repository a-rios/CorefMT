Europe &apos;s Nationalists on the March 
BERLIN - Europe is made up of its nations , and has been for hundreds of years . 
That is what makes the continent &apos;s unification such a difficult political task , even today . 
But nationalism is not Europe &apos;s principle of construction ; on the contrary , it has been , and remains , Europe &apos;s principle of deconstruction . 
That is the main lesson to be drawn from the dramatic gains made by anti-European populist parties in last weekend &apos;s European Parliament election . 
It is a lesson that all Europeans should have learned by now . 
Europe &apos;s twentieth-century wars , after all , were fought under the banner of nationalism - and almost completely destroyed the continent . 
In his farewell address to the European Parliament , Fran√ßois Mitterrand distilled a lifetime of political experience into a single sentence : &quot; Nationalism means war . &quot; 
This summer , Europe will commemorate the centennial of the outbreak of World War I , which plunged Europe into the abyss of modern nationalist violence . 
Europe will also mark the 70th anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy , which would decide World War II in favor of democracy in Western Europe ( and later , after the end of the Cold War , in all of Europe ) . 
Recent European history abounds with such commemorations and anniversaries , all closely connected with nationalism . 
And yet many Europeans &quot; hopes for the future once again seem to find expression in it , whereas a unified Europe , the guarantor of peace among Europe &apos;s peoples since 1945 , is viewed as a burden and a threat . 
That is the true significance of the European Parliament election results . 
But numbers and percentages alone do not express the scale of the defeat suffered by the EU . 
As much as democratic elections define majorities and minorities - and thus the distribution of power for a period of time - they do not always guarantee a correct assessment of the political situation . 
Elections provide a snapshot - a frozen moment ; to understand long-term trends , we need to examine the change in various parties &quot; share of the vote from one election to the next . 
If the outcome of the European Parliament election were to be judged exclusively by the fact that an overwhelming majority of Europe &apos;s citizens cast their votes for pro-EU parties , the most fundamental point - the dramatic increase in support for Euroskeptic nationalist parties in states like France , the United Kingdom , Denmark , Austria , Greece , and Hungary - would be missed . 
If this trend continues , it will become an existential threat to the EU , as it will block further integration , which is urgently needed , and destroy the European idea from within . 
France , in particular , gives cause for great concern , because its National Front has established itself as the country &apos;s third political force . 
&quot; Conquer France , destroy Europe ! &quot; has become the Front &apos;s next electoral goal . 
Without France , little or nothing happens in the EU ; together with Germany , it is indispensable to the EU &apos;s future . 
And no one should doubt that the Front and its voters mean what they say . 
At the heart of Europe &apos;s political crisis is the eurozone &apos;s economic and financial malaise , which neither national governments nor EU institutions seem able to address . 
Rather than strengthening pan-European solidarity , economic distress has led to a massive distribution conflict . 
What once was a relationship among equals has given way to a face-off between debtors and creditors . 
The mutual distrust that characterizes this conflict may irreparably harm the soul of the Union and the entire European project . 
Northern Europe is plagued by fears of expropriation ; the south is in the grip of a seemingly unending economic crisis and unprecedentedly high unemployment , for which its citizens hold the north - particularly Germany - responsible . 
The debt crisis in the south , together with the social consequences of harsh austerity measures , is seen simply as the abandonment of the solidarity principle by the rich north . 
In this climate of diminishing solidarity , old-style nationalism was practically handed its victories on a silver platter . 
Indeed , wherever the EU could be blamed for the collapse of middle-class wellbeing , national chauvinism and xenophobia were winning electoral strategies . 
Given France &apos;s current weakness and the dramatic election result there , as well as the United Kingdom &apos;s bizarre path toward an EU exit , Germany &apos;s leadership role will continue to increase , which is good for neither Germany nor the EU . 
Germany never aspired to such a role ; the country &apos;s economic strength and institutional stability has made accepting it unavoidable . 
Nonetheless , Germany &apos;s reluctance to lead remains a big problem . 
All Europeans have it in their political genes to object instinctively - and also rationally - to any form of hegemony . 
This also applies to Germany . 
But to hold the German hegemon responsible for austerity policies in the south is only partly justified ; the German government did not force the affected countries to run up high levels of public debt . 
What Germany can be held responsible for is its leaders &quot; insistence on simultaneous debt reduction and structural reforms and their objection to almost any growth-oriented policies within the eurozone . 
Moreover , none of Germany &apos;s political camps is willing to acknowledge the monetary union &apos;s &quot; German problem &quot; ( namely the country &apos;s relative strength , which it has not used for the good of the European project as a whole ) . 
The burning question now is how much Germany will do for France to save Europe . 
The pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will certainly increase , and it will not just come from Paris , but also from Rome , Athens , and other capitals . 
For Germany , the alternative to changing course now is to wait until Europe &apos;s debtor countries elect governments that call into question their obligation to pay . 
In Greece , the writing is already on the wall . 
For Europe , this would be a disaster ; for Germany , it would be simply foolish .
