The Perils of 2012 
KOLKATA - The year 2011 will be remembered as the time when many ever-optimistic Americans began to give up hope . 
President John F. Kennedy once said that a rising tide lifts all boats . 
But now , in the receding tide , Americans are beginning to see not only that those with taller masts had been lifted far higher , but also that many of the smaller boats had been dashed to pieces in their wake . 
In that brief moment when the rising tide was indeed rising , millions of people believed that they might have a fair chance of realizing the &quot; American Dream . &quot; 
Now those dreams , too , are receding . 
By 2011 , the savings of those who had lost their jobs in 2008 or 2009 had been spent . 
Unemployment checks had run out . 
Headlines announcing new hiring - still not enough to keep pace with the number of those who would normally have entered the labor force - meant little to the 50 year olds with little hope of ever holding a job again . 
Indeed , middle-aged people who thought that they would be unemployed for a few months have now realized that they were , in fact , forcibly retired . 
Young people who graduated from college with tens of thousands of dollars of education debt cannot find any jobs at all . 
People who moved in with friends and relatives have become homeless . 
Houses bought during the property boom are still on the market or have been sold at a loss . 
More than seven million American families have lost their homes . 
The dark underbelly of the previous decade &apos;s financial boom has been fully exposed in Europe as well . 
Dithering over Greece and key national governments &quot; devotion to austerity began to exact a heavy toll last year . 
Contagion spread to Italy . 
Spain &apos;s unemployment , which had been near 20 % since the beginning of the recession , crept even higher . 
The unthinkable - the end of the euro - began to seem like a real possibility . 
This year is set to be even worse . 
It is possible , of course , that the United States will solve its political problems and finally adopt the stimulus measures that it needs to bring down unemployment to 6 % or 7 % ( the pre-crisis level of 4 % or 5 % is too much to hope for ) . 
But this is as unlikely as it is that Europe will figure out that austerity alone will not solve its problems . On the contrary , austerity will only exacerbate the economic slowdown . 
Without growth , the debt crisis - and the euro crisis - will only worsen . 
And the long crisis that began with the collapse of the housing bubble in 2007 and the subsequent recession will continue . 
Moreover , the major emerging-market countries , which steered successfully through the storms of 2008 and 2009 , may not cope as well with the problems looming on the horizon . 
Brazil &apos;s growth has already stalled , fueling anxiety among its neighbors in Latin America . 
Meanwhile , long-term problems - including climate change and other environmental threats , and increasing inequality in most countries around the world - have not gone away . 
Some have grown more severe . 
For example , high unemployment has depressed wages and increased poverty . 
The good news is that addressing these long-term problems would actually help to solve the short-term problems . 
Increased investment to retrofit the economy for global warming would help to stimulate economic activity , growth , and job creation . 
More progressive taxation , in effect redistributing income from the top to the middle and bottom , would simultaneously reduce inequality and increase employment by boosting total demand . 
Higher taxes at the top could generate revenues to finance needed public investment , and to provide some social protection for those at the bottom , including the unemployed . 
Even without widening the fiscal deficit , such &quot; balanced budget &quot; increases in taxes and spending would lower unemployment and increase output . 
The worry , however , is that politics and ideology on both sides of the Atlantic , but especially in the US , will not allow any of this to occur . 
Fixation on the deficit will induce cutbacks in social spending , worsening inequality . 
Likewise , the enduring attraction of supply-side economics , despite all of the evidence against it ( especially in a period in which there is high unemployment ) , will prevent raising taxes at the top . 
Even before the crisis , there was a rebalancing of economic power - in fact , a correction of a 200-year historical anomaly , in which Asia &apos;s share of global GDP fell from nearly 50 % to , at one point , below 10 % . 
The pragmatic commitment to growth that one sees in Asia and other emerging markets today stands in contrast to the West &apos;s misguided policies , which , driven by a combination of ideology and vested interests , almost seem to reflect a commitment not to grow . 
As a result , global economic rebalancing is likely to accelerate , almost inevitably giving rise to political tensions . 
With all of the problems confronting the global economy , we will be lucky if these strains do not begin to manifest themselves within the next twelve months .
