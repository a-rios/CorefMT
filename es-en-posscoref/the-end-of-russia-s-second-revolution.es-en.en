The End of Russia \ u0027s Second Revolution 
MOSCOW : Sooner or later , all revolutions end . 
People are so sickened by crime and uncertainty that &quot; law and order &quot; becomes their primary goal . 
At this point , society either succumbs to dictatorship or forges a new social compact that accepts the revolution &apos;s key results . 
In Russia , the Revolution of the 1990s has clearly entered its stabilization phase : there is broad acceptance of the market and private property ; the period of feeble state authority and weak government is giving way to enhanced state power as an exhausted society allows today &apos;s rulers wider latitude for political maneuver . 
So there now exists a real possibility for a new social / political compact . 
Yet a critical question remains : how will Russia &apos;s rulers use their enhanced powers and freedom to maneuver ? 
They are now in a position to conduct a constructive policy and address problems too long ignored . 
But there is also a danger that these stronger powers may forge an undemocratic regime ; that stabilization may be followed by authoritarianism . 
Hope is to be found here in the fact that market economics is no longer seriously challenged . 
Struggles over the re-distribution of property , and debates about the form of the market economy continue , of course , but everybody sees Russia &apos;s market economy as a reality . 
The Primakov government , which came to power in 1998 , depended on the Communist majority in the Duma ; yet even it did not dare dismantle any market institution . 
On this issue , basic agreement seems to have been achieved . 
That agreement matters . 
After years of decline , Russia &apos;s economy is growing fast , in industrial production , investment and incomes . 
This is not , in my view , primarily due to economic reforms ( which are too recent to have had this effect ) , nor is it due to a fall in the ruble or rising oil prices . 
The true explanation is that , in the past few years , there has formed in Russia a critical mass of well-managed , market-oriented enterprises capable of normal production , with resources released from the inefficient Soviet-era public sector . 
Encouraged by improved economic performance , last year the government had the will to introduce a program of in-depth structural transformations . 
It started on tax reform : a &apos; flat &apos; income tax , a single regressive social tax , a ban on the turnover tax , etc . 
The second important area of progress has been reform of Russia &apos;s federation : establishment of federal districts and reform of the Federation Council . 
These changes are controversial , but a federation whose laws are not observed by some of its constituent members cannot function normally ; a federation in which the observance of laws depends on the whim of local administrators simply cannot exist . 
President Putin &apos;s moves to strengthen an integrated power system are therefore logical and correct . 
As a result , Russia is today a realistic , even if imperfect , federation . 
Yet , in this phase of post-revolutionary stabilization , there is real danger that the central authorities , having strengthened the &quot; vertical power structure , &quot; might interfere in affairs that are within the competence of the regions and local government . 
The third important area of progress is in military reform , including a decision to cut the numerical strength of the Armed Forces over the next three years . 
There will be bitter resistance here , however , for the interests of strong political forces are at stake . 
As the first revolution in the post-industrial world , the Russian revolution of the 1990s was characterized by limited violence and broad compromises with the old elites . 
The main danger for today &apos;s stabilization period concerns the functioning of democratic institutions and the preservation of freedom of speech . 
These risks to democracy are greatest because of the bad and sad traditions of Soviet power and the centuries of the pre-Soviet epoch . 
Admittedly , the &quot; oligarchs &quot; helped discredit freedom of speech in this country . 
But Russia and all its citizens - not just Gusinsky and Berezovsky - need freedom of speech and democratic institutions . 
Despite this , many supposedly liberal economists toy with the naive and dangerous idea that &quot; We don &apos;t need democracy , give us a Russian Pinochet and to hell with freedom . &quot; 
Yes , economically efficient authoritarian regimes have existed , but they were exceptions . 
With our traditions , authoritarianism here would likely be so corrupt as to be incapable of conducting a sensible economic policy . 
Democracy may be imperfect , but compared to other arrangements it remains the best instrument for adapting to the world with flexibility and efficiency . 
Today &apos;s threats to freedom of speech and to our democratic institutions are realistic . 
We see examples in many of our neighbors , where democracy seems to exist formally , but where everybody understands that it is a toy democracy . 
In this country , democracy is - so far - a young but realistically working instrument . 
Preserving and strengthening it is and must be our paramount objective .
