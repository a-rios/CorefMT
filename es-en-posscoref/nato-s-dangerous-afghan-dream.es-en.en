NATO &apos;s Dangerous Afghan Dream 
NEW DELHI - The agreement at the NATO summit meeting in Lisbon on a transition plan to help end the war in Afghanistan within the next four years raises troubling questions about regional security and the global fight against transnational terrorism . 
As the US and other coalition partners gradually wind down their combat role , Afghan security forces - to number 300,000 after crash training of new recruits - are to take their place . 
The most likely post-war scenario is a partition of Afghanistan , with the Taliban calling the shots in the Pashtun-dominated south and east , and the non-Pashtun northern and western regions retaining their current de facto autonomy . 
Regionally , there is likely to be greater turmoil . 
The withdrawal of NATO forces before the job is done will leave India on the front lines to face the brunt of greater terror from the Afghanistan-Pakistan belt . 
In fact , NATO &apos;s retreat is expected to embolden jihadists in the region - and beyond it - to stage transnational attacks . 
The 2014 withdrawal plan , however , comes as no surprise , given US President Barack Obama &apos;s expressed desire to end combat operations in Afghanistan . 
Indeed , his defense secretary , Robert Gates , made clear last year that the US will now seek to contain terrorism regionally rather than defeat it . 
The transition plan cements that strategic shift . 
The problem , however , is that the US war effort is already faltering , with Afghan President Hamid Karzai exploring the possibility of cutting his own deals with the Taliban and other warlords . 
Why would the Taliban be interested in negotiating a deal with the Americans , given Obama &apos;s public declaration , just weeks after coming to office , that he was interested in a military exit from Afghanistan ? 
The Afghan Taliban and their sponsors , the Pakistan military , simply want to wait out the Americans . 
Last year , with the stroke of his pen , Obama ended his predecessor &apos;s &quot; global war on terror . &quot; 
The US has been lucky to escape further terrorist strikes since September 11 , 2001 , despite several attempts . 
By contrast , India &apos;s location next to the Af-Pak has left it far more vulnerable , and the country has since suffered a series of major attacks - from the assault on its parliament in December 2001 to the terrorist siege of Mumbai in 2008 . 
Afghanistan and Pakistan , two artificially created states with no roots in history , have searched endlessly for a national identity . 
Today , they have emerged as the global epicenter of transnational terrorism and the heroin trade . 
Although Pakistan is now the largest recipient of US aid in the world , the Failed States Index2010 , created by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace , ranks the country 10th , between Guinea and Haiti . 
Unlike in other failed states , however , in Pakistan state-nurtured terrorism and state-supported nuclear smuggling uniquely intersect . 
To compound the situation , the political border between Afghanistan and Pakistan has now ceased to exist in practice . 
The 2,640-kilometer Durand Line , a British-colonial invention that divided the large Pashtun community when it was established in 1893 as the border between British-led India and Afghanistan , has long been despised and rejected by Afghanistan . 
Today , the Durand Line exists only on maps . 
On the ground , it has little political , ethnic , or economic relevance , even as the Af-Pak region has become a magnet for the world &apos;s jihadists . 
A de facto Pashtunistan , long sought by Pashtuns , has now grown up on the ruins of an ongoing Islamist militancy , but without any political authority in charge . 
The disappearance of the Af-Pak political border seems irreversible , undermining Pakistan &apos;s own territorial integrity . 
Yet , as if the forces of terror could be neatly boxed in , the US has scaled back its objective to contain terrorism regionally - a strategy that promises to keep the Af-Pak problem a festering threat to global security . 
Indeed , NATO &apos;s withdrawal plan is likely to lead to a realignment of ethnic forces , and thus to greater volatility . 
Afghanistan is not Vietnam . 
A withdrawal of US and other NATO troops will not mean the end of the war , because the enemy will continue to target Western interests , wherever they may be . 
The hope that terrorism can be regionally contained is a dangerous exercise in self-delusion .
