Latin America &apos;s Next Growth Challenge 
Since 2003 , Latin America &apos;s economies have been thriving , with GDP , including estimates for 2006 , up by 17 % - an average annual growth rate of 4.3 % and a 12 % increase in per capita GDP . 
While impressive , this is only the second time in 25 years that Latin America experienced four consecutive years of positive economic growth . 
Will such good times continue ? 
This recent growth has been fueled by a strong boom in commodity prices , including not only energy inputs such as oil , gas and coal , but also metals , minerals , and agricultural products . 
Growing demand for raw materials , owing to sharply increased industrial growth in Asia , particularly China and India , has benefited the terms of trade of many Latin American countries , and this is not expected to end anytime soon . 
Historically , fiscal profligacy tends to take hold at times like these , with windfall revenues wasted on extravagant public projects . 
But not this time Â­ - at least so far . 
In Latin America &apos;s seven principal economies ( Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , Peru , and Venezuela ) , which together account for almost 90 % of regional GDP , annual economic growth averaged 6 % in the third quarter of 2006 , while industrial output was up by 8 % . 
But their governments seem to be taking advantage of the bonanza to pay off pending external debt and increase their foreign reserves . 
Remarkably , responsible macroeconomic policy has followed a wave of populist / socialist electoral victories in recent years . 
Brazil , Chile , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and Venezuela elected socialist or populist / reformist presidential candidates in 2006 , while Bolivia elected a populist indigenous president in 2005 , Uruguay a socialist president the same year , and Argentina a leftist-centrist president in 2003 . 
An increased degree of international financial independence is among the consequences of the raw materials bonanza . 
Countries such as Brazil and Argentina paid off their loans to the IMF ahead of time , while others are buying up their own debt in secondary markets . 
Increased liquidity in international capital markets also reduced the need to obtain multilateral financing , and with it the need to accept conditions like privatization of natural resources and deregulation of public utilities . 
But , for the most part , fiscal and monetary policies have so far not followed leaders &quot; rhetorical promises of deep structural reforms and redistribution to favor the indigenous and the poor . 
Even so , the danger of fiscal deficits and inflation persist in several countries . 
As a result , the new generation of leaders cannot introduce drastic structural reforms , badly needed in several countries , in a way that jeopardizes macroeconomic stability - without which none of their promises can be fulfilled . 
In fact , whereas economic growth in Latin America is often perceived as being very unequal - which explains the shift to the left - recent United Nations data puts the region in first place among all developing-country areas . 
Not only is the region &apos;s economic performance strong ; so is its score on the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , which includes social indicators such as education and health . 
Indeed , while Latin America &apos;s GDP per capita is lower than the world average , it surpasses all other developing regions , as well as the world average , in the main social indicators . 
Only one Latin American country ( Haiti ) appears in the group of low HDI countries , while the rest are in the medium and high HDI groups . 
Of the 30 Latin American countries included in this year &apos;s report , only one-third have lower HDI rankings than GDP rankings , and only a few - those with the region &apos;s greatest need for significant improvements in social infrastructure , particularly provision of health and education - show large discrepancies . 
But two risks to Latin America &apos;s economic recovery loom large . 
First , with the current raw materials bonanza driving up prices of exported goods , the region is increasingly vulnerable to the so-called &quot; Dutch disease , &quot; whereby higher wages and prices spread throughout the economy , weakening competitiveness , particularly in industrial markets . 
With Asian manufacturing exporters penetrating markets worldwide , such a development would be highly damaging to Latin America &apos;s growth prospects . 
Second , at a time when economic globalization is rendering national borders porous , political leaders may get carried away by their rhetoric of independence . 
All bonanzas end . 
If no adequate provisions are made to sustain global competitiveness , the economic , social , and political consequences could be dire .
