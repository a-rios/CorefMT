Will the Rumsfeld Revolution Continue ? 
America &apos;s defense policy is at a crossroads . 
Since 1997 , the United States Congress has required the Department of Defense to undertake a major defense review every four years . 
The department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year . 
The review promises to be nothing short of a watershed . 
The last Quadrennial Defense Review was published a few weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . 
As a result , it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come . 
The 2005 review , by contrast , will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration , and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy . 
The grand strategy that serves as the foundation for American defense policy has not undergone major change since 2002 . 
Focusing on terrorism , the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism , and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors . 
Ultimately , it seeks to address what President Bush considers the root causes of terrorism , particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity . 
What is changing is the way that US military power is used to implement this grand strategy . 
There is little doubt that the 2005 Defense Review will formalize the change in focus underway since September 11 , 2001 . 
Before that , the American military concentrated on swift victory in a major theater war against another state &apos;s military forces . 
Today , however , the US military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states , assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism , control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse , or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters . 
This requires a different type of force , and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint , sustaining major deployments for extended periods . 
The global configuration of America &apos;s military is also changing . 
The goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the US , with a network of lightly-manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war . 
Rather than being miniature Americas , many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation . 
This will capitalize on the US military &apos;s ability to project force around the world quickly , while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so . 
But , beyond the ongoing changes , major strategic questions persist . 
First , how much conventional war-fighting capability should the US military retain ? 
The goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors , but not so much that it detracts from other , more likely missions . 
Second , what will America &apos;s relationship with its traditional allies be ? 
Will formal alliances such as NATO remain the centerpiece of American strategy , or will they be superseded by mission-specific coalitions ? 
Third , how much should the US continue to invest in advanced , high-tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insurgents ? 
Systems such as the F / A-22 Raptor aircraft and the Army &apos;s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive . 
At a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military &apos;s existing equipment needs repair or replacement , questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment . 
Fourth , what is the appropriate size of the US military ? 
Many defense intellectuals , former military leaders , and politicians believe that America &apos;s military , particularly the ground forces , are too small to implement Bush &apos;s grand strategy . 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , on the other hand , believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re-organized for maximum efficiency . 
He is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems . 
Because Rumsfeld is the primary architect of the upcoming defense review , it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force . 
The changes underway in American defense policy reflect planning assumptions . 
The strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate . 
The upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years , focusing especially on Iraq , Afghanistan , and other aspects of the war on terror . 
The question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years . 
If not , the US might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one . 
One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue , although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate . 
In any case , the new review will serve as a roadmap for future US defense policy , thus affecting America &apos;s partners and adversaries alike .
