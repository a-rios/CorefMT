Farewell to the Neo-Classical Revolution 
LONDON - The looming bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , and the forced sale of Merrill Lynch , two of the greatest names in finance , mark the end of an era . 
But what will come next ? 
Cycles of economic fashion are as old as business cycles , and are usually caused by deep business disturbances . 
&quot; Liberal &quot; cycles are followed by &quot; conservative &quot; cycles , which give way to new &quot; liberal &quot; cycles , and so on . 
Liberal cycles are characterized by government intervention and conservative cycles by government retreat . 
A long liberal cycle stretched from the 1930 &quot; s to the 1970 &quot; s , followed by a conservative cycle of economic deregulation , which now seems to have run its course . 
With the nationalization of America &apos;s two giant mortgage banks , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , following the nationalization earlier this year of Britain &apos;s Northern Rock , governments have started stepping in again to prevent market meltdowns . 
The heady days of conservative economics are over - for now . 
Each cycle of regulation and de-regulation is triggered by economic crisis . 
The last liberal cycle , associated with President Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal and the economist John Maynard Keynes , was triggered by the Great Depression , though it took World War II &apos;s massive government spending to get it properly going . 
During the three-decade-long Keynesian era , governments in the capitalist world managed and regulated their economies to maintain full employment and moderate business fluctuations . 
The new conservative cycle was triggered by the inflation of the 1970 &quot; s , which seemed to be a product of Keynesian policies . 
The economic guru of that era , Milton Friedman , claimed that the deliberate pursuit of full employment was bound to fuel inflation . 
Governments should concentrate on keeping money &quot; sound &quot; and leave the economy to look after itself . 
The &quot; new classical economics , &quot; as it became known , taught that , in the absence of egregious government interference , economies would gravitate naturally to full employment , greater innovation , and higher growth rates . 
The current crisis of the conservative cycle reflects the massive build-up of bad debt that became apparent with the sub-prime crisis , which started in June 2007 and has now spread to the whole credit market , sinking Lehman Brothers . 
&quot; Think of an inverted pyramid , &quot; writes investment banker Charles Morris . 
&quot; The more claims are piled on top of real output , the more wobbly the pyramid becomes . &quot; 
When the pyramid starts crumbling , government - that is , taxpayers - must step in to refinance the banking system , revive mortgage markets , and prevent economic collapse . 
But once government intervenes on this scale , it usually stays for a long time . 
At issue here is the oldest unresolved dilemma in economics : are market economies &quot; naturally &quot; stable or do they need to be stabilized by policy ? 
Keynes emphasized the flimsiness of the expectations on which economic activity in decentralized markets is based . 
The future is inherently uncertain , and therefore investor psychology is fickle . 
&quot; The practice of calmness , of immobility , of certainty and security , suddenly breaks down , &quot; Keynes wrote . 
&quot; New fears and hopes will , without warning , take charge of human conduct . &quot; 
This is a classic description of the &quot; herd behavior &quot; that George Soros has identified as financial markets &quot; dominant feature . 
It is the government &apos;s job to stabilize expectations . 
The neo-classical revolution believed that markets were much more cyclically stable than Keynes believed , that the risks in all market transactions can be known in advance , and that prices will therefore always reflect objective probabilities . 
Such market optimism led to de-regulation of financial markets in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , and the subsequent explosion of financial innovation which made it &quot; safe &quot; to borrow larger and larger sums of money on the back of predictably rising assets . 
The just-collapsed credit bubble , fueled by so-called special investment vehicles , derivatives , collateralized debt obligations , and phony triple-A ratings , was built on the illusions of mathematical modeling . 
Liberal cycles , the historian Arthur Schlesinger thought , succumb to the corruption of power , conservative cycles to the corruption of money . 
Both have their characteristic benefits and costs . 
But if we look at the historical record , the liberal regime of the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s was more successful than the conservative regime that followed . 
Outside China and India , whose economic potential was unleashed by market economics , economic growth was faster and much more stable in the Keynesian golden age than in the age of Friedman ; its fruits were more equitably distributed ; social cohesion and moral habits better maintained . 
These are serious benefits to weigh against some business sluggishness . 
History , of course , never repeats itself exactly . 
Circuit-breakers are in place nowadays to prevent a 1929-style slide into disaster . 
But when the financial system , left to its own devices , seizes up , as it now has , we are clearly in for a new round of regulation . 
Industry will be left free , but finance will be brought under control . 
The cycles in economic fashion show how far economics is from being a science . 
One cannot think of any natural science in which orthodoxy swings between two poles . 
What gives economics the appearance of a science is that its propositions can be expressed mathematically by abstracting from many decisive characteristics of the real world . 
The classical economics of the 1920 &quot; s abstracted from the problem of unemployment by assuming that it did not exist . 
Keynesian economics , in turn , abstracted from the problem of official incompetence and corruption by assuming that governments were run by omniscient , benevolent experts . 
Today &apos;s &quot; new classical economics &quot; abstracted from the problem of uncertainty by assuming that it could be reduced to measurable ( or hedgeable ) risk . 
A few geniuses aside , economists frame their assumptions to suit existing states of affairs , and then invest them with an aura of permanent truth . 
They are intellectual butlers , serving the interests of those in power , not vigilant observers of shifting reality . 
Their systems trap them in orthodoxy . 
When events , for whatever reason , coincide with their theorems , the orthodoxy that they espouse enjoys its moment of glory . 
When events shift , it becomes obsolete . 
As Charles Morris wrote : &quot; Intellectuals are reliable lagging indicators , near-infallible guides to what used to be true . &quot;
