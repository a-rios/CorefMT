Lessons from a Divided Island 
CAMBRIDGE : Seven hundred miles off Florida &apos;s coast lies one of the most impoverished places on earth . 
Hispaniola was Christopher Columbus &apos;s first stop in the New World . 
Just a hour-and-a-half flight south of Miami , we might expect that island to be a tropical paradise and a favored spot for offshore US business . 
But reality is more cruel . 
Hispaniola is home to two nations . 
Haiti , on the western side , is the poorest country in the Americas . 
The Dominican Republic , to the east , is more successful , with six times Haiti &apos;s average income . 
It too , however , experienced political and economic horrors until a breakthrough in the past decade . 
With President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returning to office in February , Haiti &apos;s long cycle of poverty and violence could end , but only if Haiti and the US understand the lessons of Hispaniola &apos;s tortured history . 
Hispaniola &apos;s impoverishment has colonial era roots . 
Europeans colonized the Caribbean islands as sugar plantations , ruthlessly bringing African slaves by the millions to work , and die young , on those plantations . 
Hispaniola suffered the worst fate of deforestation , soil erosion , and collapse of agricultural productivity , especially on the Haitian side . 
After slavery ended , the once beautiful island could barely sustain the former slave populations because the soils were exhausted by overuse and erosion . 
Racism in America made conditions worse . 
America refused to recognize Haiti as an independent country until the 1860s , nearly six decades after Haiti &apos;s slave rebellion successfully ended French colonial rule . 
Countries like Haiti and the Dominican Republic found themselves adrift , with uneducated populations barely surviving on subsistence agriculture . 
Their long-term needs required massive investment in health and education , as well as a shift to new kinds of economic activity . 
In the 20th century , profitable activities in the Caribbean included tourism , offshore banking , and labor-intensive manufacturing , especially of textiles and apparel and electronics . 
But the Haitian and Dominican dictatorships that ruled through most of these decades were incapable of attracting these businesses . 
The Dominican Republic , despite violence , dictatorship , and periodic invasions from the US , broke through recently to embark on a two-pronged development path : expanded health and education and a shift to profitable manufacturing and services activities . 
As a result , the Dominican Republic became one of the world &apos;s fastest growing economies in the 1990s , with booming investments in tourism and in labor-intensive manufactures . 
In Haiti , however , misery deepened . 
America supported a series of brutal dictators uninterested in economic development . 
When the Duvalier dictatorship fell , America started promoting democratization in the mid-1980s , but violence ensued and the US imposed various economic sanctions . 
These chased away even the tiny levels of foreign investment that had come to Haiti . 
Jean Bertrand Aristide , a leader of Haiti &apos;s poor , won election as President in 1990 , only to be overturned by a military coup in 1991 . 
Three years later , Aristide was returned to power through the support of the US military , but America allowed him to serve less than two years , on the grounds that his election in 1991 was for a term originally scheduled to end in 1996 . 
After a five-year hiatus , he has won re-election as President . 
Haiti &apos;s situation is fraught with peril . 
The few rich Haitians distrust Aristide . 
Aristide distrusts the rich because of their support for the coup that ousted him , and because of their traditional intransigence against reform . 
America &apos;s political leadership is also divided . 
Despite Aristide &apos;s undoubted popularity , he is viewed by many US conservatives with suspicion . 
Centuries of violence and poverty could finally yield to social and economic progress if all of the key actors rise above their bitter fights . 
President Aristide understands that his real fight is not with Haiti &apos;s tiny rich community but against mass poverty . 
This fight requires large investments to create jobs and well as financial aid from America and the UN to fight disease , illiteracy , and environmental ills . 
Aristide should , and will , endorse this two-pronged strategy of business investment and human investments in health and education . 
Haiti &apos;s elite should not view Aristide as the enemy . 
For Aristide &apos;s mass popularity is not a threat to their wealth but an opportunity for reforms that can produce long-term economic development . 
The US should understand that Haiti cannot overcome its intense poverty on its own . 
Haiti requires urgent financial support to put children in schools , and to reduce diseases like tuberculosis and AIDS which now cripple and kill many . 
As Haiti &apos;s first popular leader in decades , perhaps in history , President Aristide is the best chance for addressing these ills in a peaceful , effective , and democratic manner . 
Haiti is an extreme example of how a cycle of poverty , disease , and violence reproduces itself for generations . 
The path of economic development is not hard to see , but to get on that path , impoverished countries often require the good will and support of powerful neighbors , and usually luck as well . 
Haiti &apos;s luck today is to have a popular and freely elected leader . 
When countries with tortured histories get this modicum of good fortune , the rich and powerful should seize the chance to help them develop .
