Opening Up Japan 
After a dozen years of stagnation , Japan &apos;s economy seems to be looking up . 
Despite improvements and reforms , many of Japan &apos;s fundamentals remain woeful . 
Japan &apos;s decline has been palpable . 
In the late 1980 &apos;s , it was fashionable in some Japanese policy circles to argue that the Pax Americana was over , to be replaced in Asia by Pax Japonica . 
America &apos;s economy seemed to be tanking , Japan &apos;s was soaring , and projections favored 2005 as the date when it would overtake the United States . 
That things have turned out far differently reflects Japan &apos;s inertia . 
The problems underlying Japan &apos;s decline are legion . 
Japanese policymakers and business leaders do not understand the concept of &quot; creative destruction . &quot; 
Too many industrial dinosaurs are kept on life support . 
So , although some firms do extremely well - say , Toyota and Canon - there is little space for new ventures and entrepreneurs . 
If Japan &apos;s economy were a computer , it would have a hard disk full of obsolescent programs and a &quot; delete &quot; button that doesn &apos;t work . 
No matter what criterion one uses , Japan &apos;s economy remains the most closed among OECD countries and one of the most closed in the world . 
Not only is foreign capital conspicuously absent , but so are foreign managers , workers , intellectuals , and ideas . 
Universities , think tanks , and the media are for the most part insular institutions . 
Similarly , while non-government organizations ( NGO &apos;s ) are a dynamic component in most societies nowadays , Japan has few , and major international NGO &apos;s are nonexistent or have only a weak presence . 
Oxfam , one of the world &apos;s leading NGOs , with offices and branches all over the world , is absent altogether . 
The closed nature of Japanese society and the dearth of ideas are partly attributable to the linguistic barrier . 
Where Japan really falls short is in English - the global language , and thus the main purveyor of global ideas . 
In Asia , Japan ranks above only North Korea in scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language ( TOEFL ) examination . 
Moreover , Japan &apos;s demographics are among the worst in the world . 
In this respect , Europe is not much better , although its current restrictive immigration policies will likely be eased over the next decade or so . 
No such assumption can be made about Japan , where an aging population will intensify the closed and intellectually arid nature of its society . 
As one of the world &apos;s major trading powers , Japan should be a leading player in the World Trade Organization and in trade policy forums . 
Yet despite being one of the main beneficiaries of the post-World War II open and multilateral trading system , Japan stands out as a retrograde mercantilist state . 
Isolation has brought confusion about Japan &apos;s place in the world . 
While Japan &apos;s government lobbies hard to get a permanent seat on the UN Security Council , its Prime Minister regularly flouts Asian opinion by paying his respects to war criminals at the Yasukuni Shrine . 
Apart from the immorality of such public behavior ( imagine a German chancellor paying his respects at Goebbels &apos; grave ! ) , the fact that both China and the US have veto power at the UN suggests that it is stupid even from the standpoint of Realpolitik . 
Indeed , relations with China are Japan &apos;s most profound problem . 
Japan &apos;s emergence as East Asia &apos;s leading power in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries involved three brutal wars in China , in which the Japanese army committed dreadful atrocities . 
The 1949 communist takeover in China , the Cold War , America &apos;s adoption of Japan as its pampered protégé , and the failure to prosecute Emperor Hirohito for war crimes , allowed Japan to avoid a moral reckoning . 
Now , as China rises and Japan declines , the old , deep-seated suspicions , tensions , and distrust are resurfacing . 
Japan &apos;s grim outlook is bad news for the world because it is the globe &apos;s second leading economic power . 
Prospects for Japan acting as a global economic locomotive and of playing a role in poverty reduction and economic development are , for now , almost nil . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s current growth is being driven overwhelmingly by trade with China - a country with only one-thirtieth of Japan per capita GDP ! 
From a broader geopolitical perspective , the situation becomes alarming . 
Despite its frequent economic booms , Asia is also a strategic and security minefield . 
A sclerotic , atavistic , nationalist , and inward-looking Japan can only aggravate the situation . 
What should Japan do ? 
The only solution for Japan is to open up - not only its economy , but its society , its universities , its media , its think tanks , and , indeed , its bars and bathhouses . 
Many young Japanese - often the brightest and most entrepreneurial - demand to live in an open society , but the option they are choosing now is emigration . 
An open Japan would , by definition , be more outward-looking , would speak better English so that it could communicate across Asia and the world , would be more influenced by foreign ideas - including ideas concerning war guilt . 
It has been 150 years since the &quot; black ships &quot; of America &apos;s Navy forcibly opened up Japan . 
Today , the Japanese must open up their country themselves .
