The Essence of Putin 
MOSCOW - Few people , least of all Vladimir Putin , who plans to return to Russia &apos;s presidency on March 4 , could have imagined last December that Russians would , for the first time in 20 years , wake up and rally in their tens of thousands against the government . 
Unlike the Arab Spring rebellions , the driving force behind the ongoing protests is not Russia &apos;s poor and disadvantaged , but rather the country &apos;s rising urban middle class . 
That is an important difference , for , historically , successful democratic transitions have almost always required a politically mobilized middle class . 
Well-educated and successful , middle-class Russians have taken to the streets to gain respect from a Kremlin hierarchy that is mired in deceit and corruption . 
The last straw was the blatant falsification of December &apos;s parliamentary elections , which reinforced citizens &quot; sense that the regime regards them with contempt . 
Russians are particularly outraged by Putin &apos;s arrogant treatment of the presidency as an office that can be &quot; loaned &quot; to allies - like the current incumbent , Dmitri Medvedev - and reclaimed whenever he wishes . 
But , despite the large protests in Moscow , Saint Petersburg , and other cities , the authorities rejected demonstrators &quot; demands to nullify the election results . 
Indeed , it is becoming increasingly clear that , by hook or by crook , Putin will spend six more years as Russia &apos;s ruler . 
What will another Putin presidency mean for Russia ? 
Securely fenced off from real political competition , Putin cannot return to the Kremlin as &quot; the president of hope , &quot; as he styled himself in 2000 , at the beginning of his first term . 
Moreover , he no longer resembles Putin the &quot; national leader , &quot; who , in his second term , reinvigorated the state and presided over an economic boom . 
So who can Putin III be ? 
How will he use the enormous powers granted the Russian president in a political system that lacks any real checks and balances ? 
Putin &apos;s pre-election monologues and articles suggest an ominous answer : his presidency will be based on a genuine misunderstanding of the structure of contemporary international relations , markets , and democracy , and will be driven by his uncontrollable messianism . 
Calls for liberalism coexist with statist dogma , and bloviating populism trumps regard for complexity and hard choices . 
In fact , Putin has nothing to offer Russians aside from his own vulgar , hackneyed rhetoric . 
He no longer understands the problems facing the country , and therefore has no idea what needs to be done . 
Nor does he have any anxiety about the damage that his misrule portends for Russia &apos;s future . 
Putin &apos;s third presidency will be a reign of instinct and appetite , rather than a government of reason and restraint . 
Of course , Putin will begin his new term with earnest words about renewal , development , democratization , and the scourge of corruption . 
He might even offer some symbolic gestures , such as dissociating himself from objectionable political and media figures , or showing leniency towards those he has imprisoned for opposing him . 
But all of this would be aimed at maintaining political power , rather than reforming it . 
Indeed , the Kremlin has produced much lofty talk of freedom and modernization in recent years . 
But , without the political will to implement the necessary changes , such promises are destined to remain just that . 
The problem is that the principle of free and fair competition that characterizes the developed world is subversive of the Russian state that Putin has built - a state based on the merger of government and business . 
As a result , even if the will to change suddenly and miraculously emerged in today &apos;s Kremlin , the illegitimacy of the entire federal government would render effective policymaking impossible . 
Instead of formulating and implementing comprehensive and transparent reforms , the government would have no choice but to continue to indulge - and , above all , avoid threatening - vested interests . 
No one should be deceived by any concessions that the Kremlin makes . 
Russia &apos;s liberals would gain nothing from compromising their consciences and blessing Putin &apos;s third term . 
As before , they would get no real power in return , and any possibility of genuine change from within the existing power structure would remain minimal . 
Indeed , steps by the authorities to mollify public opinion will continue to be accompanied by increased pressure on the opposition and on civil-society organizations . 
In the months following Putin &apos;s return to the presidency , much will depend upon Russia &apos;s civil society and the protest movement &apos;s leaders . 
Russians must persevere and formulate a set of specific political demands . 
They must insist upon real and dramatic changes - rather than cosmetic improvements - to Russia &apos;s political system . 
The main objective now is to strive for free and fair elections that will ultimately lead to a legitimate and responsible government . 
The list of pressing issues facing Russia is already long , and their resolution can no longer be delayed . 
As long as Putin remains in control , that list will only grow .
