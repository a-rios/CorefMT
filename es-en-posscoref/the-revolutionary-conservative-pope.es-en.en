The Revolutionary Conservative Pope 
Twenty-five years ago , Poland &apos;s people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot , Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow , as Pope . 
Some were frightened , others wept with joy . 
Here , said a prominent writer , was &quot; Poland &apos;s second baptism . &quot; 
But even in our euphoria , we did not expect how much the new Pope would change not only Poland , but the world . 
His first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new Pope &apos;s power . 
Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw , yet the streets became models of order . 
After decades of disempowerment , Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination . 
In saying aloud that &quot; there can be no just Europe without an independent Poland on its map , &quot; the Pope effectively swept away the unjust postwar settlement that had subjugated Poland to Soviet power . 
Then , in Auschwitz , the Pope said : &quot; I speak in the name of everyone whose rights go unrecognized and violated anywhere in the world , I speak because I am bound , we are all bound , by truth . &quot; 
On that spot , that Golgotha of modern times , he called the Poles , who remembered dear ones gassed to death in Auschwitz &apos;s crematoria as well as those frozen into glass in Siberia &apos;s concentration camps , to a brotherhood devoted to struggle against even justified hatred and revenge . 
Some see in the Pope the person responsible for a religious revival ; others see a man of peace . 
Some see a defender of the poor , others a critic of liberation theology . 
For the people of Poland , John Paul II , by making human rights the central subject of his teaching , will forever be the man who gave us courage and hope , who restored our historical identity . 
Indeed , the central feature of the first decade of the Pope &apos;s reign was his struggle against dictatorship - Communist dictatorship in particular . 
The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church , and his ability to mobilize millions of believers in its cause , meant that no one could ever again repeat Stalin &apos;s question : &quot; How many divisions does the Pope have ? &quot; 
John Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon potent enough to undo Yalta &apos;s division of the world . 
Perhaps in part because of their strong anticommunist stance , the Polish Church and John Paul II are often branded as &quot; conservative . &quot; 
The accusation is meant to suggest that the Church cannot live comfortably with a pluralist democracy . 
To be sure , in the struggle against Communism , the Polish Church was , indeed , conservative - and thank God for that ! 
It was conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values , to the truth of faith , to its historical identity . 
For the system of official atheism and legalized mendacity , the Church was a living rebuke . 
With Communism gone , however , the problem confronted by John Paul II and his Church today is this : in what language can evangelical values be articulated in a world where evil is not incarnated in a political system but is diffused in individual souls ? 
What is the Pope &apos;s message for the postcommunist world he helped create ? 
John Paul II undoubtedly keeps a distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state , which he often charges with permissiveness and moral relativism . 
A critique of individualism in the name of collective values occurs frequently in the Pope &apos;s pronouncements . 
He sees the failings of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries . 
The market economy , despite its practical achievements , seems to him oftentimes to lack a heart and a human face . 
He sees the market as favoring entrepreneurship over human solidarity . 
So John Paul II is no enthusiast of modern Western civilization , with its divorce from the world of values , and he contrasts with it the moral sensitivity of societies with fresh memories of decades of dictatorship . 
Like Alexander Solzhenitsyn , the Pope tends to believe that it was above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man could become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilization . 
I confess that I view the heritage of Communism with more skepticism . 
Totalitarian pressure did , indeed , form exceptional people such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn , people for whom religious faith bought freedom from mendacity and solitude . 
But it did the same for Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel , who defended their supreme values with reference to , and in the language of , lay humanism . 
For most people , however , life under totalitarian dictatorship was not ennobling ; it was , rather , a daily immersion in lies , spiritual depravity , and material corruption . 
This is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the West . 
Communism &apos;s defeat left a huge black hole in communities &apos; souls , which is now being filled with nationalism , bigotry , and Western consumerism . 
But John Paul II &apos;s basic intuition is correct : the postcommunist world - East and West - is in spiritual crisis , and the Pope wants to shake it into realizing the importance of higher values . 
Indeed , by his words and example , the Pope disrupts the world : it wants to live in wealth and comfort ; he reminds us that we must also live in dignity . 
In the end , John Paul II does not fit neatly into any category and often represents a meeting of opposites : rejection of compromise with ecumenism , toughness with warmth , intellectual openness with insistence on theological orthodoxy . 
He is a conservative who loves freedom and a &quot; peacemonger &quot; who condemns injustice , but who reminds us that mercy is more important than justice . 
In this , he personifies the paradox that is Christianity : unbreakable and lasting principles joined by understanding and tolerance . 
Twenty-five years after John Paul II left Poland for Rome , we Poles remain grateful to him for having helped us regain our freedom . 
It is good that John Paul II is among us . 
A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same .
