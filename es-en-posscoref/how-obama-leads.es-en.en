How Obama Leads 
CAMBRIDGE - Two years ago , Barack Obama was a first-term senator from a mid-western state who had declared his interest in running for the presidency . 
Many people were skeptical that an African-American with a strange name and little national experience could win . 
But as his campaign unfolded , he demonstrated that he possessed the powers to lead - both soft and hard . 
Soft power is the ability to attract others , and the three key soft-power skills are emotional intelligence , vision , and communications . 
In addition , a successful leader needs the hard-power skills of organizational and Machiavellian political capacity . 
Equally important is the contextual intelligence that allows a leader to vary the mix of these skills in different situations to produce the successful combinations that I call &quot; smart power . &quot; 
During his campaign , Obama demonstrated these skills in his calm response to crises , his forward-looking vision , and his superb organizational ability . 
In addition , his contextual intelligence about world politics has been shaped from the bottom up with experience in Indonesia and Kenya , and his understanding of American politics was shaped from the bottom up as a community organizer in Chicago . 
Obama continued to demonstrate these leadership skills in his almost flawless transition . 
By selecting his primary opponent , Hillary Clinton , as his Secretary of State , and reaching across party lines to retain Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense , he showed openness to strong subordinates . 
In his inaugural address , he sounded the themes of smart power - a willingness &quot; to extend an open hand to those who unclench their fists &quot; - but also stressed themes of responsibility as Americans confront sobering economic problems . 
Moreover , Obama has started his term in decisive fashion . 
In his first weeks in office , he began to fulfill his campaign promises by outlining a massive economic stimulus plan , ordering the closure of the Guant√°namo Bay prison , promoting new fuel-efficiency standards to save energy , giving an interview to Al Arabiya , and sending a top emissary to the Middle East . 
George W. Bush once said that his role as leader was to be &quot; the decider . &quot; 
But even if Bush had been better as a decider , people want something more in a leader . 
We want someone who reinforces our identity and tells us who we are . 
We judge leaders not only by the effectiveness of their actions , but also by the meanings that they create and teach . 
Most leaders feed upon the existing identity and solidarity of their groups . 
But some leaders see moral obligations beyond their immediate group and educate their followers . 
Nelson Mandela could easily have chosen to define his group as black South Africans and sought revenge for the injustices of Apartheid and his own imprisonment . 
Instead , he worked tirelessly to expand the identity of his followers both by words and deeds . 
When Obama was faced with a campaign crisis over incendiary racial remarks by his former pastor , he did not simply distance himself from the problem , but made use of the episode to deliver a speech that served to broaden the understanding and identities of both white and black Americans . 
The crisis on September 11 , 2001 , produced an opportunity for Bush to express a bold new vision of foreign policy . 
But he failed to produce a sustainable picture of America &apos;s leadership role in the world . 
A successful vision is one that combines inspiration with feasibility . 
Bush failed to get that combination right . 
Obama will need to use both his emotional and contextual intelligence if he is to restore American leadership . 
Contextual intelligence is the intuitive diagnostic skill that helps a leader align tactics with objectives to produce smart strategies in different situations . 
A decade ago , the conventional wisdom was that the world was a uni-polar American hegemony . 
Neo-conservative pundits drew the conclusion that the United States was so powerful that it could do whatever it wanted , and that others had no choice but to follow . 
This new unilateralism was based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of power - that is , the ability to affect others to get the outcomes one wants - in world politics . 
The US may be the only superpower , but preponderance is not empire . 
America can influence but not control other parts of the world . 
Whether certain resources will produce power depends upon the context . 
To understand power and its contexts in the world today , I have sometimes suggested the metaphor of a three-dimensional chess game . 
On the top board of military power among countries , the US is the only superpower . 
On the middle board of economic relations among countries , the world is already multipolar . 
America cannot get the outcomes it wants in trade , antitrust , or other areas without the cooperation of the European Union , China , Japan , and others . 
On the bottom board of transnational relations outside the control of governments - pandemics , climate change , the drug trade , or transnational terrorism , for example - power is chaotically distributed . 
Nobody is in control . 
This is the complex world in which Obama takes up the mantle of leadership . 
He inherits a global economic crisis , two wars in which US and allied troops are deployed , crises in the Middle East and South Asia , and a struggle against terrorism . 
He will have to deal with this legacy and chart a new course at the same time . 
He will have to make difficult decisions while creating a larger sense of meaning in which America once again exports hope rather than fear . 
That will be the test of his leadership .
