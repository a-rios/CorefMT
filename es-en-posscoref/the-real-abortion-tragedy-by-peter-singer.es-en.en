The Real Abortion Tragedy 
MELBOURNE - In the Dominican Republic last month , a pregnant teenager suffering from leukemia had her chemotherapy delayed , because doctors feared that the treatment could terminate her pregnancy and therefore violate the nation &apos;s strict anti-abortion law . 
After consultations between doctors , lawyers , and the girl &apos;s family , chemotherapy eventually was begun , but not before attention had again been focused on the rigidity of many developing countries &quot; abortion laws . 
Abortion receives extensive media coverage in developed countries , especially in the United States , where Republicans have used opposition to it to rally voters . 
Recently , President Barack Obama &apos;s re-election campaign counter-attacked , releasing a television advertisement in which a woman says that it is &quot; a scary time to be a woman , &quot; because Mitt Romney has said that he supports outlawing abortion . 
But much less attention is given to the 86 % of all abortions that occur in the developing world . 
Although a majority of countries in Africa and Latin America have laws prohibiting abortion in most circumstances , official bans do not prevent high abortion rates . 
In Africa , there are 29 abortions per 1,000 women , and 32 per 1,000 in Latin America . 
The comparable figure for Western Europe , where abortion is generally permitted in most circumstances , is 12 . 
According to a recent report by the World Health Organization , unsafe abortions lead to the death of 47,000 women every year , with almost all of these deaths occurring in developing countries . 
A further five million women are injured each year , sometimes permanently . 
Almost all of these deaths and injuries could be prevented , the WHO says , by meeting the need for sex education and information about family planning and contraception , and by providing safe , legal induced abortion , as well as follow-up care to prevent or treat medical complications . 
An estimated 220 million women in the developing world say that they want to prevent pregnancy , but lack either knowledge of , or access to , effective contraception . 
That is a huge tragedy for individuals and for the future of our already very heavily populated planet . 
Last month , the London Summit on Family Planning , hosted by the British government &apos;s Department for International Development and the Gates Foundation , announced commitments to reach 120 million of these women by 2020 . 
The Vatican newspaper responded by criticizing Melinda Gates , whose efforts in organizing and partly funding this initiative will , it is estimated , lead to nearly three million fewer babies dying in their first year of life , and to 50 million fewer abortions . 
One would have thought that Roman Catholics would see these outcomes as desirable . 
( Gates is herself a practicing Catholic who has seen what happens when women cannot feed their children , or are maimed by unsafe abortions . ) 
Restricting access to legal abortion leads many poor women to seek abortion from unsafe providers . 
The legalization of abortion on request in South Africa in 1998 saw abortion-related deaths drop by 91 % . 
Opponents will respond that abortion is , by its very nature , unsafe - for the fetus . 
They point out that abortion kills a unique , living human individual . 
That claim is difficult to deny , at least if by &quot; human &quot; we mean &quot; member of the species Homo sapiens . &quot; 
It is also true that we cannot simply invoke a woman &apos;s &quot; right to choose &quot; in order to avoid the ethical issue of the moral status of the fetus . 
If the fetus really did have the moral status of any other human being , it would be difficult to argue that a pregnant woman &apos;s right to choose includes the right to bring about the death of the fetus , except perhaps when the woman &apos;s life is at stake . 
The fallacy in the anti-abortion argument lies in the shift from the scientifically accurate claim that the fetus is a living individual of the species Homo sapiens to the ethical claim that the fetus therefore has the same right to life as any other human being . 
Membership of the species Homo sapiens is not enough to confer a right to life on a being . 
Nor can something like self-awareness or rationality warrant greater protection for the fetus than for , say , a cow , because the fetus has mental capacities that are inferior to those of cows . 
Yet &quot; pro-life &quot; groups that picket abortion clinics are rarely seen picketing slaughterhouses . 
We can plausibly argue that we ought not to kill , against their will , self-aware beings who want to continue to live . 
We can see this as a violation of their autonomy , or a thwarting of their preferences . 
We have no obligation to allow every being with the potential to become a rational being to realize that potential . 
If it comes to a clash between the supposed interests of potentially rational but not yet even conscious beings and the vital interests of actually rational women , we should give preference to the women every time .
