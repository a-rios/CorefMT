The Cancer Season 
As summer beckons , we should take a moment to focus on the sun &apos;s dark side . 
The source of all life on Earth , the sun is also a fountain of environmental carcinogens . 
Specifically , we now know that the sun &apos;s ultraviolet radiation is the primary cause of most skin cancers . 
Skin cancer , long thought to be a disease of little public health significance , has now become epidemic . 
An estimated 90,000 new cases of malignant melanoma and well over one million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer will occur in the United States this year . 
Melanoma will cause 8,000 deaths , and non-melanoma skin cancer will kill another 2,000 . 
Melanoma is now the most common cancer in women aged 24 to 35 . 
Once a disease of men in their fifties and sixties , it is not unusual for women in their twenties to develop basal cell cancer or squamous cell cancer . 
While the incidence of skin cancer has risen dramatically , so has our understanding of its causes . 
For over fifty years , ultraviolet radiation from the sun has been the number one suspected cause of skin cancer . 
Epidemiologic data from Australia , animal studies with artificial sources of ultraviolet light , and the development of skin cancer in individuals with a genetic inability to correct the DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation provided circumstantial evidence of the connection . 
Recent work has made the causal link between the sun and skin cancer at the molecular and cellular level . 
Ultraviolet radiation causes specific and unique mutations in the tumor suppressor gene that produces a protein called p53 . 
This protein is involved in a process called apoptosis in which damaged cells commit &quot; suicide &quot; to ensure that their defective genes are not passed on to daughter cells . 
( This is perhaps the first indication that self-sacrifice may be an intrinsic human trait ! ) 
Damaged by the sun , but not quite able to commit suicide , the mutated cell continues to proliferate at the expense of normal surrounding cells , resulting in a pre-cancerous growth that can progress to a full-blown squamous cell carcinoma . 
But how should we communicate to people about skin cancer and its prevention ? 
If our key message is &quot; stay out of the sun forever , &quot; we are doomed to fail . 
Creating a culture of cave dwellers is no way to decrease the incidence of skin cancer . 
Moreover , in educating the public we confront formidable forces : cultural icons who are as bronze as the statuary in the Louvre , the sheer pleasure of being in the sun , and the perceived incremental health benefits of ultraviolet radiation . 
The dearth of pale actors , actresses , corporate leaders , and politicians confirms that a tan is identified with health , wealth , and power , rather than the travails of the working class , as in the past . 
The artificial tanning industry promises that ultraviolet radiation from their machines causes less damage than natural sunlight . 
But in both cases , a tan is the body &apos;s response to injury . 
Microscopic pigment granules produced by skin pigment cells aggregate around the cell &apos;s nucleus to shield the DNA from the marauding rays and prevent mutation . 
It is irrelevant whether the ultraviolet radiation came from a bulb or a star . 
Whether natural or artificial , ultraviolet radiation causes the skin to age prematurely . 
The inescapable irony is that teenagers and young women pursue a tan to look more attractive , but trade a moment or two of sunny radiance for a whole lifetime of premature wrinkles , fine lines , and haggard-looking skin . 
As young people consider themselves immortal , not even appeals to lifelong vanity , let alone warnings about cancer , are sufficient to deter them from the tanning booths . 
But the difficulties of educating the public about the causes of skin cancer do not diminish our obligation to try . 
There are enough other diseases about which we do not have a clue as to the cause . 
With skin cancer , we know very well how we can prevent it - and prevention is always easier than treatment . 
A good place to start is to ensure that the public has access to accurate information . 
While pseudoscience and the anti-aging industry represent an important source of potential misinformation , the Internet often provides damaging false information as well . 
Amazingly , the Internet has the same level of credibility with the patient as television does with the consumer : &quot; I read it on the Web , so it must be true . &quot; 
At the same time , tanning parlors should be regulated . 
While barbers , hairdressers , taxi drivers , bar owners , and doctors are often licensed , permits are rarely required to operate a tanning parlor . 
None of the other professions listed above , however , knowingly exposes its clients to a confirmed environmental carcinogen . 
Until the tanning industry chooses to police itself , customers should eschew the bulbs and pursue the spray : wear an artificial tan . 
This preventable disease should be the focus of a comprehensive educational campaign similar to anti-smoking campaigns , which are now bearing fruit in many countries . 
In addition , scientific research on this most accessible of human organs will continue to identify innovative treatments and modes of prevention , which may well become applicable to other cancers .
