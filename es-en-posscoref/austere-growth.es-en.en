Austere Growth ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - The German government &apos;s reaction to newly elected French President Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s call for more growth-oriented policies was to say that there should be no change in the eurozone &apos;s austerity programs . 
Rather , growth-supporting measures , such as more lending by the European Investment Bank or issuance of jointly guaranteed project bonds to finance specific investments , could be &quot; added &quot; to these programs . 
Many inside and outside of Germany declare that both austerity and more growth are needed , and that more emphasis on growth does not mean any decrease in austerity . 
The drama of the ongoing eurozone crisis has focused attention on Europe , but how the austerity-growth debate plays out there is more broadly relevant , including for the United States . 
Three essential points need to be established . 
First , in a situation of widespread unemployment and excess capacity , short-run output is determined primarily by demand , not supply . 
In the eurozone &apos;s member countries , only fiscal policy is possible at the national level , because the European Central Bank controls monetary policy . 
So , yes , more immediate growth does require slower reduction in fiscal deficits . 
The only counterargument is that slower fiscal adjustment would further reduce confidence and thereby defeat the purpose by resulting in lower private spending . 
This might be true if a country were to declare that it was basically giving up on fiscal consolidation plans and the international support associated with it , but it is highly unlikely if a country decides to lengthen the period of fiscal adjustment in consultation with supporting institutions such as the International Monetary Fund . 
Indeed , the IMF explicitly recommended slower fiscal consolidation for Spain in its 2012 World Economic Outlook . 
Without greater short-term support for effective demand , many countries in crisis could face a downward spiral of spending cuts , reduced output , higher unemployment , and even greater deficits , owing to an increase in safety-net expenditures and a decline in tax revenues associated with falling output and employment . 
Second , it is possible , though not easy , to choose fiscal-consolidation packages that are more growth-friendly than others . 
There is the obvious distinction between investment spending and current expenditure , which Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has emphasized . 
The former , if well designed , can lay the foundations for longer-term growth . 
There is also the distinction between government spending with high multiplier effects , such as support to lower-income groups with a high propensity to spend , and tax reductions for the rich , a substantial portion of which would likely be saved . 
Last but not least , there are longer-term structural reforms , such as labor-market reforms that increase flexibility without leading to large-scale lay-offs ( a model rather successfully implemented by Germany ) . 
Similarly , retirement and pension reforms can increase long-term fiscal sustainability without generating social conflict . 
A healthy older person may well appreciate part-time work if it comes with flexibility . 
The task is to integrate such work into the overall functioning of the labor market with the help of appropriate regulation and incentives . 
Finally , particularly in Europe , where countries are closely linked by trade , a coordinated strategy that allows more time for fiscal consolidation and formulates growth-friendly policies would yield substantial benefits compared to individual countries &quot; strategies , owing to positive spillovers ( and avoidance of stigmatization of particular countries ) . 
There should be a European growth strategy , rather than Spanish , Italian , or Irish strategies . 
Countries like Germany that are running a current-account surplus would also help themselves by helping to stimulate the European economy as a whole . 
Slower fiscal retrenchment , space for investment in government budgets , growth-friendly fiscal packages , and coordination of national policies with critical contributions from surplus countries can go a long way in helping Europe to overcome its crisis in the medium term . 
Unfortunately , Greece has become a special case , one that requires focused and specific treatment , most probably involving another round of public-debt forgiveness . 
But insufficient and sometimes counterproductive actions , coupled with panic and overreaction in financial markets , have brought some countries , such as Spain , which is a fundamentally solvent and strong economy , to the edge of the precipice , and with it the whole eurozone . 
In the immediate short run , nothing makes sense , not even a perfectly good public-investment project , or recapitalization of a bank , if the government has to borrow at interest rates of 6 % or more to finance it . 
These interest rates must be brought down through ECB purchases of government bonds on the secondary market until low-enough announced target levels for borrowing costs are reached , and / or by the use of European Stability Mechanism resources . 
The best solution would be to reinforce the effectiveness of both channels by using both - and by doing so immediately . 
Such an approach would provide the breathing space needed to restore confidence and implement reforms in an atmosphere of moderate optimism rather than despair . 
The risk of inaction or inappropriate action has reached enormous proportions . 
No catastrophic earthquake or tsunami has destroyed southern Europe &apos;s productive capacity . 
What we are witnessing - and what is now affecting the whole world - is a man-made disaster that can be stopped and reversed by a coordinated policy response .
