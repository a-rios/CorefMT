India \ u0027s Second Great Mutiny ? 
For all its long history , India is a young country , with perhaps 70 % of its population under 30 years of age . 
The number of those with memories of the bloody 1947 partition that produced India and Pakistan as independent states is declining , and for the young generation , Pakistan is no longer a part of the great nation that was lost , but a hostile neighbor that supports violent , fundamentalist jihad . 
Sadly , distrust of Pakistan increasingly touches India &apos;s Muslim community , more than 100 million strong , but still only 12 % of the Indian population . 
Despite partition , India &apos;s mood in the first decades of independence was one of idealism and hope . 
Most Muslims saw Jawaharlal Nehru , India &apos;s first Prime Minister , as the true inheritor of Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s vision of India as a tolerant , multi-national state . 
In turn , several of Nehru &apos;s Muslim associates were respected nationally across the religious divide . 
This support persisted despite difficult conditions for the Muslim minority , including blatant discrimination in employment and in the distribution of government largesse . 
More ominously , Muslims were often considered a Fifth Column within India , plotting to divide the country further . 
Such suspicions frequently boiled over into religious riots , in which Muslims bore over 90 % of the casualties . 
No one has ever been punished for these killings . 
By the 1980s , the Congress Party &apos;s dominance of Indian politics was ending . 
From the Muslim point of view , no major political party took up the cause of Indian pluralism with the conviction that guided Nehru . 
Other parties moved in to take their share of Muslim votes while the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party , ( BJP ) the current ruling party , began creating and consolidating a growing bloc of anti-Muslim voters . 
The BJP has always evoked instinctive fear among Muslims . 
It exploited the multiple failures of the Congress Party in launching its quest for power , building vicious diatribes against Muslims and Christians into their campaign rhetoric . 
The BJP and its allies sought retribution for what they portrayed as the historical sins of the Muslims , and turned an insignificant 16 th century mosque at Ayodhya into the symbol of this mission . 
The BJP &apos;s real target was Indian society tradition of tolerance and pluralism , which it attacked for allegedly representing the appeasement of religious minorities . 
Constitutional law was defied and horrendous communal violence against religious minorities became frequent . 
Finally , the Ayodhya mosque was demolished in December 1992 during a mass gathering organized by the BJP . 
The current Deputy Prime Minister , Lal Kishan Advani , was present when the structure was brought down . 
The destruction of the mosque was seen as the most serious rupture between Hindus and Muslims since India became independent in 1947 . 
The Indian state began to be perceived as openly discriminatory . 
Muslims became suspicious of other Indian political parties , none of which seemed able to stand up to the BJP . 
The Muslim community closed in on itself . 
Muslim professionals , fearing for their safety , began to move into ghettos . 
Muslim charitable organizations , often funded by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries , began to move into areas of social life where the state had failed dismally , particularly education . 
As a result , thousands of Muslim boys were enrolled in school for the first time . 
Unfortunately , they were educated in religious seminaries espousing a deeply intolerant , fundamentalist brand of Islam . 
With discrimination soon cutting across class lines , increasing numbers of Indian Muslims began to look for links with Muslim communities elsewhere in the world . 
They willingly bought the &quot; Great Satan &quot; theory of Ayatollah Khomeini , whose face was spread on posters across Muslim India in the 1980s . 
In the 1990s , Saddam Hussein replaced this poster boy . 
The Taliban &apos;s rise in Afghanistan also had a strong impact . 
The jihadi movement that gripped Pakistan crossed into the neighboring Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir , where the two countries have repeatedly fought for control , even , recently , threatening an exchange of nuclear weapons . 
As the only state in India with a Muslim majority , Jammu and Kashmir has a special status under India &apos;s Constitution . 
However , the BJP has campaigned to rescind that status , a campaign that gathered supporters in reaction to Pakistan &apos;s activities . 
Today , Kashmir is seen as a front against terrorism , and Indian Muslims are seen as sympathizers with terrorists - although the overwhelming majority of the jihadis &apos; victims inside Kashmir have been Muslim . 
Secular , liberal Indians are alarmed at the rise of both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism as domestic policies in South Asia become entangled with America &apos;s global anti-terrorist objectives . 
Their only hope is to ensure that Indian Muslims do not lose faith in the democratic process . 
If that happens , India &apos;s admirable pluralist traditions , to which Muslims have made significant contributions , would be lost forever .
