Pakistan &apos;s Black Revolution 
SHANGHAI  -  Immediately after taking office last month , Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani ordered the release of the 60 judges who had been detained by President Pervez Musharraf since November . 
This is a triumph for the rule of law in Pakistan , and above all a triumph for the brave Pakistani lawyers who took to the streets to protest Musharraf &apos;s imposition of a state of emergency last autumn . 
The lawyers marched , sang , danced , and exchanged their briefcases for signs and , occasionally , eggs and stones . 
As one Pakistani blogger wrote , &quot; They danced in black coats and they danced in black ties . 
Their black coats their Kalashnikovs and their black ties their bullets . &quot; 
In a world of color revolutions , Pakistan &apos;s was clothed in the sober hues of the law . 
Last November , Musharraf effectively declared war on both the bar and the judiciary , dismissing all judges who refused to recognize his declaration of a state of emergency , purportedly aimed at protecting the nation from terrorists . 
The seven-member Supreme Court , headed by Chief Justice Iftikar Mohammad Chaudhry , countered by issuing an order barring the government from proclaiming emergency rule . 
Musharraf dissolved the Supreme Court and the four High Courts , put Chaudhry and his entire family under house arrest , sealed the Supreme Court premises under army guard , and proceeded to arrest and detain all judges who refused to swear allegiance to the Provisional Constitutional Order upholding the state of emergency . 
The result was the detention of most of the senior judiciary , as well as bar association presidents across the country and all leading lawyers and human rights activists seeking to defend judicial independence . 
In the ensuing protests , lawyers were routinely beaten , gassed , brutalized , and humiliated . 
They stood with and for their judges , making it virtually impossible for judges willing to take Musharraf &apos;s oath of allegiance to operate . 
The lawyer &apos;s movement , it seems , drove a historic wedge between the judiciary and the executive . 
Yet in Pakistan , the United States , and other countries where lawyers have helped to lead fights for human rights and the rule of law , lofty ideals cloak an equally important set of interests . 
The Pakistani lawyers were safeguarding their livelihoods as much as their principles . 
Lawyers cannot practice without judges to hear their cases . 
And clients will not bring those cases unless they believe that the judges are independent enough to decide cases on the merits , rather than on the basis of bribes or political considerations . 
These interests also help explain why Kenya &apos;s lawyers were at the forefront of protests against the corruption of President Daniel Arap Moi &apos;s regime in the early 1990 &quot; s , but much less visible in the eruption of tribal violence this past year . 
Corruption corrodes the possibility of making a living through the law , which becomes a preserve of the rich . 
By contrast , in crises fueled by ethnic conflict , lawyers &quot; interests are not so clear . 
Noting the convergence between ideals and interests does not in any way demean the Pakistani lawyers &quot; courage and the importance of their protests . 
America &apos;s founders , for instance , fully understood that the two must go hand in hand . 
Their design for constitutional democracy ensured , in James Madison &apos;s words , that ambition would counter ambition and &quot; the interests of the man &quot; would be &quot; connected to the constitutional rights of the place . &quot; 
The best foundation for the rule of law is to build an island of legality wherever it is most needed to advance legitimate government goals - to stop corruption , to protect the environment , to clean up the financial system , or to enforce contracts with foreign investors . 
Within these limited areas , independent judges and the lawyers who can argue before them have a home . 
As these islands begin to form an archipelago , a legal class emerges , supported by the clients who need them . 
And on the day that a judge finally crosses a political line , speaking constitutional truth to usurped power , the government &apos;s refusal to comply threatens the interests and ideals of an articulate and motivated segment of society . 
The coming weeks will reveal whether Pakistan &apos;s new government has the courage and integrity not only to release the fired judges , but to restore them to the bench and perhaps to face their scrutiny down the road . 
If it does , Pakistan &apos;s lawyers will be able to return to the courtrooms , and Pakistani citizens will have another chance to make democracy work . 
If they succeed , perhaps they should add a black border around the proud Islamic green of their flag - the black not of mourning , but of justice .
