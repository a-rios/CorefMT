Putin &apos;s Balkan Mischief 
Russia is again on a tear . 
Unlike the fracas over an American missile shield in Europe , this conflict shows no signs of blowing over , and threatens to damage further the rocky relationship between Russia and the West . 
At every turn , Russia has challenged Western efforts to facilitate Kosovo &apos;s independence . After a year of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s Kremlin rejected the UN mediator &apos;s report recommending supervised independence , prevented the Security Council from accepting that report , and insisted on three additional months of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo - even after compromise became impossible . 
Three weeks ago in the UN Security Council , Russia again insisted that any agreement required the approval of both Serbia and Kosovo , and that further negotiations were necessary . 
Russia knows that such negotiations will be fruitless , but believes that another seemingly innocent appeal for more talks would strain EU unity , which appears to be a vital goal for Putin . 
Further delay might also generate violence in Kosovo and undermine international support for independence . 
Putin &apos;s hatred of the Yeltsin era &apos;s &quot; subservient &quot; relations with the West fuels his opposition . 
But the West &apos;s delay in resolving Kosovo &apos;s status permitted that opposition to gain traction . 
Indeed , the West has consistently misread Russia &apos;s intentions on Kosovo . 
Many claimed that the Kremlin was delaying the inevitable but ultimately would not block independence . 
Now , at the eleventh hour , Russia is sticking to its obstructionist position , and its presidential election in March will likely reinforce anti-Western postures . 
So what will Putin do when the United States and most European Union members recognize an independent Kosovo in the coming months without a UN blessing , as they now plan ? 
It is unlikely that the Kremlin would attempt another military intervention in Kosovo ( their effort in 1999 to land troops at Pristina airport was a fiasco ) , but it has a range of options that must give the West pause . 
Kremlin support has made Serbia &apos;s nationalist intransigence over Kosovo effective . 
Russia has said that it will not give Serbia a blank check , but it will likely support the Serbian government &apos;s efforts to isolate and destabilize an independent Kosovo . 
While Serbia has resisted partition of Kosovo , Russia would also support a Serbian proposal to partition the Serb-populated north , an effort that would open up a Pandora &apos;s box of possible partition of Serbia , Bosnia , and Macedonia . 
Such a proposal could get some support in Europe and elsewhere as a seemingly appropriate compromise , even if it would destabilize the Balkans once more . 
Russia will certainly continue its diplomatic efforts to persuade the world that negotiations are the only way to solve the problem , and that it cannot be solved outside the UN . 
That will attract support among many UN members , including those that have major dissatisfied ethnic minorities . 
Russia could also react beyond the Balkans , most obviously in the Caucasus , with its breakaway regions , particularly in Georgia . 
A declaration of independence by Kosovo will likely bring a similar declaration from Georgia &apos;s breakaway Abkhazia region , which Russia could well recognize . 
If Georgia takes military steps to prevent that , Russia &apos;s military would likely react with force , creating a situation that could get out of control . 
While the US and the EU do not want to worsen relations with Russia , they cannot retreat in the face of Russian obduracy ; security in Europe is at stake . 
But they must also continue to try to preempt confrontation with Russia on all fronts . 
The West should make clear to Serbia that it will react vigorously against any efforts to promote violence or partition Kosovo . 
Dispatching additional NATO troops , in addition to the planned EU mission , to supervise Kosovo independence would be helpful . 
Putin &apos;s Russia , which pays little attention to the rule of law , cloaks its diplomatic effort in the guise of adherence to international law , in particular UN Security Council resolution 1244 , which ended the 1999 Kosovo war . 
A long overdue diplomatic offensive needs to be launched to undercut Russian arguments as well as remind the world of what happened in Kosovo . 
Resolution 1244 does not state that Kosovo must remain under Serb sovereignty , as Russia and Serbia insist , nor does it preclude independence . 
Indeed , any reasonable reading of the resolution - especially in the context of the conflict-ridden Balkans over the past two decades - would acknowledge that independence would satisfy the resolution &apos;s intent and the purpose of sustaining UN supervision of the province for the past eight years . 
In the case of Abkhazia , the West should reiterate the sui generis nature of Kosovo and highlight the tremendous efforts it has undertaken there since 1999 . 
The world must make clear that Russian military involvement in Abkhazia is unacceptable , while also restraining Georgia &apos;s government from reacting militarily to any provocation . 
How Russia reacts to Western support of Kosovo &apos;s coming declaration of independence will test how far we have progressed since the Cold War . 
Through careful management of Kosovo &apos;s independence process , and attentiveness to opportunities to improve relations with Russia , the West might mitigate the worst consequences of this confrontation . 
Regardless , a new Cold War might just get a little colder .
