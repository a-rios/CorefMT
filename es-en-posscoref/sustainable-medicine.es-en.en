Sustainable Medicine 
There is hardly a developed country where health care reform has not become a kind of chronic disease of modern medicine : as soon as some reforms are implemented , a call comes for yet another round . 
Costs continue to climb , but nothing seems to contain their growth for very long . 
Why ? 
Politics surely plays a role . 
Most developed countries have a growing number and proportion of elderly . 
Since health care costs for those over 65 are approximately four times higher than for those under 65 , aging societies place massive claims on medical resources . 
This is compounded by the constant introduction of new ( and usually more expensive ) technologies , together with increased demand for high-quality health care . 
We want more , expect more , and complain more loudly if we don &apos;t get it . 
When we do get it , we quickly raise the bar , wanting still more . 
The net result has been an average general system-wide cost increase of 10 % -15 % annually in the United States for the past several years - and with no end in sight . 
European countries are under severe cost pressures as well , undermining their cherished ideal of equitable access . 
Unfortunately , greater use of co-payments and deductibles , privatization of health-care infrastructure , and waiting lists for elective surgery and other non-emergency care are unlikely to work much better in the future than they have in the past . 
What is needed is a radical change in how we think about medicine and health care , not simply better ways to reorganize existing systems . 
We need a &quot; sustainable medicine &quot; that is affordable to national health care systems and provides equitable access in the long term . 
The notion of &quot; sustainability &quot; comes from environmentalism , which seeks to protect the earth and its atmosphere in order to sustain indefinitely human life of a good quality . 
As with environmentalism , sustainable medicine requires reformulating the idea of progress that drives technology costs and fuels public demand . 
The Western idea of progress , translated to medicine , sets no limits on the improvement of health , defined as the reduction of mortality and the relief of all medical miseries . 
However much health improves , it will never be sufficient - so further progress is always required . 
But unlimited progress cannot be paid for with finite funds . 
Long-term affordability and equitable access requires a finite vision of medicine and health care , one that does not try to overcome aging , death , and disease , but tries to help everyone avoid a premature death and to live decent , even if not perfect , lives . 
This implies shifting medical resources sharply towards health promotion and disease prevention . 
Billions of dollars have been spent on mapping the human genome . 
Why is obesity increasing almost everywhere ? 
Why do so many people continue smoking ? 
Why is it so difficult to persuade contemporary people to exercise ? 
Sustainable medicine also requires comparing health care expenditure with spending on other socially important goods . 
In a balanced society , health care may not always be the top priority . 
At the same time , we often overlook the health benefits of spending money in ways that have nothing to do with the direct delivery of medical care : education and health , for example , are strongly correlated : the higher the former the better the latter . 
In any case , sustainable medicine acknowledges that rationing is and always will be a part of any health care system . 
No system can give everyone everything they need . 
Our aspirations will always exceed our resources , particularly since medical progress itself raises public expectations . 
One place to start is to evaluate the economic impact of new technologies , preferably before they are released to the public . 
Evidence-based medicine - a popular technique for controlling costs - is ordinarily aimed only at the efficacy of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures . 
But if drug companies must test new products for their safety and efficacy , why not also for their economic impact on health care ? 
New technologies should not be dropped into health care systems uninvited . 
Only if a technology does not significantly raise costs , or does so only exceptionally , should governments be willing to pay for it . 
Most fundamentally , a finite model of medicine must accept human aging and death as part of the human life cycle , not some kind of preventable condition . 
Medicine must shift its focus from length of life to quality of life . 
A medicine that keeps people alive too long is not a decent and humane medicine . 
We can live to be 85 , but we are likely to do so with chronic conditions that leave us sick and in pain . 
This is not an argument against progress : I , for one , am glad that people don &apos;t die of small pox at 40 anymore . 
But aging and death will still win out in the end . 
Medical progress is like exploring outer space : no matter how far we go , we can go further . 
With space travel , the economic limitations of unlimited exploration soon became obvious : no more moon walks . 
Medicine needs an analogous insight . 
Slower technological progress may seem a high price to pay for sustainable health care . 
At the same time , only about 40 % of the rise in health status over the past century is attributable to medical progress , with the rest reflecting improved social and economic conditions . 
This trend is likely to continue , so that even if technological progress slows , people are almost certain to live longer lives in the future - and in better health - than they do now . 
That outcome should be acceptable to everyone .
