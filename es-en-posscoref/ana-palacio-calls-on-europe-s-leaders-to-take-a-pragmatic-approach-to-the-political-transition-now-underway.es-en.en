Europe &apos;s Ukrainian Test 
MADRID - Powerful images have been pouring out of Ukraine lately : Kyiv &apos;s Maidan protesters bravely enduring months of bitter cold , withering police attacks , and sniper bullets ; the gilded bathroom fixtures of deposed President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s opulent personal residence ; a wheelchair-bound Yuliya Tymoshenko emerging from prison to address her countrymen in a broken voice . 
And now Russian troops in the streets of Crimea &apos;s cities . 
At a time when Europe &apos;s self-confidence is at low ebb , Ukrainians &quot; courageous struggle to topple a rotten political system is a powerful reminder of Europe &apos;s core values . 
The question now is what Europeans will do about it . 
With the Russian Duma &apos;s approval of President Vladimir Putin &apos;s request to use Russian military forces in Ukraine ( not restricted to Crimea ) , the mirage that Yanukovych &apos;s ouster signal the start a new era , in which Ukraine moves inexorably away from Russia and into the European democratic fold , has now evaporated . 
Confronted with a reality that they should have foreseen , Europe &apos;s leaders must recognize that Ukraine is subject to deep internal cleavages and conflicting geopolitical forces . 
For starters , Ukraine is riven by deep-seated cultural tensions , stemming from its history of occupation by competing foreign powers . 
In the seventeenth century , the struggle among the Cossacks , Russia , and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for control of Ukraine resulted in a split along the Dnieper River . 
While the division was formally eliminated after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 , its legacy has remained . 
Ukraine &apos;s geography has also contributed to its disunity . 
Following the devastating famine of 1932-1933 , 2-3 million Russians repopulated deserted farming areas in southern and eastern Ukraine , contributing to ethno-linguistic divisions that endure to this day . 
Add to that endemic corruption , unscrupulous and powerful oligarchs , and fractious political parties , and it is easy to see why Ukraine &apos;s efforts to consolidate a more democratic system will be exceedingly difficult . 
And the challenges do not end at Ukraine &apos;s borders . 
On the contrary , the country &apos;s internal discords operate within the context of a broader , ever-mutable geopolitical rift that many assumed had been buried with the end of the Cold War . 
Since the beginning of the Maidan protests , Russia had signaled that its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was not an isolated phenomenon , highlighting America &apos;s lack of strategic vision and declining global influence . 
Indeed , US President Barack Obama &apos;s response to Putin &apos;s decision to send in Russian troops pales in comparison even with the proposals made a week ago by former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski . 
Whereas Brzezinski advocated threatening financial sanctions or a review of Russia &apos;s World Trade Organization status should Putin take military action , Obama warned only that the June G-8 summit in Sochi might be canceled . 
Further complicating matters is the shifting nature of transatlantic security arrangements . 
The good news is that Europe finally seems to have recognized the need to assume greater strategic responsibility , exemplified in the recent French-led missions in Mali and the Central African Republic . 
But the process of building a common and relevant EU security strategy has only just begun - and progress will undoubtedly be slow . 
As it stands , the EU lacks the experience and savvy that the US accumulated over decades as an international hegemon . 
This deficiency was on full display last November , when the EU offered Ukraine an Association Agreement that failed to account for the country &apos;s financial vulnerabilities . 
That enabled Russian President Vladimir Putin to swoop in and compel Yanukovych to scuttle the deal in exchange for a promise of $ 15 billion in loans and energy subsidies . 
Making matters worse , Germany , the reluctant leader of the EU , has traditionally acted in support of its own economic and energy interests , maintaining a strong bilateral relationship with Russia . 
Today , German leaders are sending mixed and confusing signals . 
While Germany has increasingly emphasized values - from the rule of law to human rights - in its dealings with Russia over the last year , it remains unclear whether it will go so far as to lead the tough EU-wide initiative that is needed . 
The fact that German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was joined by his French and Polish counterparts in brokering last week &apos;s agreement in Kiev could confirm that Germany is not planning to go it alone . 
However , in the aftermath of German President Joachim Gauck &apos;s recent announcement that his country is prepared to embrace a larger role in global affairs , it is far from certain whether Germany is willing to align its foreign policy more closely with that of the EU . 
The West &apos;s uncertainty over Ukraine contrasts sharply with Russia &apos;s clear vision . 
Putin knows that a pro-Western , pro-NATO Ukraine would present a major obstacle to Russian dominance in Eurasia , potentially cutting off Russia &apos;s access to the Black Sea and , most important , providing a model to his opponents at home . 
His acts over the last days confirm that he is willing to play hardball , leveraging the discontent ( real or provoked ) of Ukraine &apos;s ethnic Russian population , particularly in Crimea , the home of Russia &apos;s Black Sea Fleet . 
Against this background , if we let old conflicts and rivalries persist , the images that emerge from Ukraine will progressively contrast with the hopes of Maidan and echo those seen in 2008 , 1979 , 1968 , and 1956 . 
The international community must balance the need to ensure that Ukraine does not become the site of a proxy battle with the necessity of stopping Putin &apos;s destructive ambitions . 
Ukraine &apos;s conflict bears out a critical reality : the Atlantic Community and Russia need each other . 
It is therefore urgent and essential that the US and Europe do not leave Putin with a free hand .
