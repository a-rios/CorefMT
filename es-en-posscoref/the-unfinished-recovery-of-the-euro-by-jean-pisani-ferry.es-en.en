The Euro on the Mend 
PARIS - A year ago the eurozone was in serious trouble . 
A series of policy actions - the creation of a rescue fund , a fiscal treaty , and the provision of cheap liquidity to the banking system - had failed to impress financial markets for long . 
The crisis had moved from the monetary union &apos;s periphery to its core . 
Southern Europe was experiencing a sell-off of sovereign debt and a massive withdrawal of private capital . 
Europe was fragmenting financially . 
Speculation about a possible breakup was widespread . 
Then came two major initiatives . 
For the first time since the onset of the crisis in Greece , it was officially recognized that the root of the eurozone &apos;s problem was not the flouting of fiscal rules , and that the very principles underlying the monetary union had to be revisited . 
The endeavor was bound to be ambitious . 
In the eyes of most observers , to reach the leaders &quot; goal of &quot; break &#91; ing &#93; the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns &quot; required centralizing authority for bank resolution and rescue . 
The second initiative came a month later . 
Speaking on July 26 , European Central Bank President Mario Draghi announced that the ECB was ready to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to preserve the euro : &quot; Believe me , &quot; he said , &quot; it will be enough . &quot; 
The meaning of these words became clear with the subsequent announcement of the ECB &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) scheme , under which it would purchase short-term government bonds issued by countries benefiting from the European rescue fund &apos;s conditional support . 
Both measures had an immediate and profound impact on financial markets . 
Seen from Wall Street , the euro was moving closer to becoming a normal currency . 
Turmoil in bond markets began to abate . 
A year later , where are we ? 
First , the two initiatives resulted in markedly improved borrowing conditions for southern European governments ( at least until Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke created new shockwaves with his indication in mid-June that the US would wind down more than three years of so-called quantitative easing ) . 
Capital stopped flowing out of southern Europe and speculation eased . 
Second , an agreement on authorizing the ECB to oversee the banking sector was reached at the end of last year . 
In a year , the new regime will be fully operational - not a trivial achievement in view of the complexity of the issue . 
Third , discussions are being held to prepare the next steps , namely how to arrange the resolution of failed banks and support for ailing ones . 
Ministers recently agreed upon a template for action . 
So there are clear positive outcomes . 
One problem is architectural : any banking union is only as strong as its weakest component . 
What matters for markets is not what happens in normal times , or even what happens when uncertainty and volatility rise ; what markets care about are possible scenarios in truly adverse conditions . 
Breaking the negative feedback loop between distressed sovereigns and distressed banks - whereby bank rescues exhaust fiscal resources and make it likely that the next financial institution in trouble will not be able to count on government support - requires ensuring that it will not recur even in extreme circumstances . 
Merely &quot; weakening &quot; this loop , as European officials recently advocated , could prove deeply insufficient . 
There are two ways to eliminate the feedback loop . 
One is to exclude bank rescues altogether : only creditors would have to pay for bankers &quot; mistakes . 
This type of rule could insulate governments from banking risk only if applied systematically , even at the expense of financial stability . 
Simply put , governments should be ready to let banks fail . 
The other solution is to mutualize the cost of rescue at the margin . 
States could be involved and accept losses , but catastrophic risks would have to be shared among all eurozone members . 
Europe these days is vacillating between these two approaches . 
France does not want to rule out state-financed bailouts ; 
A compromise is being worked out , but it must pass the test of reality . 
Unfortunately , the middle way between two logically consistent solutions may itself not be a logically consistent one . 
Meanwhile , the credibility of Draghi &apos;s atomic weapon is being undermined . 
The miracle of the OMT scheme is that , since it was announced a year ago , it has had its intended effect without ever being used . 
Strong opposition on the part of the Bundesbank and many German academics , however , has raised questions about whether and how it could ever be used . 
To defend its legality in hearings before Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , the ECB itself has argued that the OMT program is a less potent instrument than many believe . 
Although the German government has been adamant that it is not a German court &apos;s role to rule on the legality of ECB instruments , markets have taken note . 
In a few months , it will be four years since the eurozone crisis began - almost an eternity by historical standards . 
Much has been done to overcome it .
