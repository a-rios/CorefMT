Bear Hunting in Romania 
NEW YORK - Nicolae Ceausescu liked to hunt bear . 
With his retinue , he would retreat to a lodge in Transylvania and sally forth , locked and loaded . 
He was accustomed to good fortune , for his huntsmen took precautions . 
They would chain some poor beast to a tree , drug it to keep it still , and conceal themselves around the blind from which the Great Man would shoot . 
One day , they did their job haphazardly . 
Ceausescu took aim , then fell backward when the bear , inadequately sedated , reared on its hind legs as if to attack . 
His shot flew into the treetops , even as three bullets entered the bear &apos;s heart from the snipers who guaranteed the dictator &apos;s marksmanship . 
This day , I was told by a forester who claimed to have witnessed the incident , Ceausescu did not acknowledge the applause of his retainers . 
This could be the story of the Romanian revolution , 20 years ago . 
The bear is the country &apos;s enslaved people . 
They rise up from slumber . 
The sharpshooters hidden in the forest take aim and fire , only this time their target is not the bear , but Ceausescu himself . 
Just as the glory of the French Revolution ended in the Terror , so Eastern Europe &apos;s miracle year of 1989 ended in blood . 
Elsewhere , communist regimes seemed almost to run from power . 
The people who deposed them celebrated largely painless victories . 
Not so in Romania . 
There , the country &apos;s communist masters ordered the security forces to fire on the people . 
They obeyed . 
A civil war was fought , albeit briefly . 
It began in mid-December in the gritty industrial town of Timisoara , close to the Hungarian border . 
When Ceausescu ordered the military to stage a show of force against those who dared oppose him , commanders took him literally : they put on a parade , complete with marching band . 
Farce quickly turned to tragedy in the face of the dictator &apos;s rage . 
&quot; I meant tanks , you fool , &quot; he said , in effect , to Gen. Iulian Vlad , threatening to put him in front of a firing squad if he did not comply . 
That night , roughly a hundred Romanian citizens died in the streets , and hundreds more were wounded . 
The rest is well-known history . 
On the morning of December 21 , Ceausescu stepped onto the balcony of the Central Committee in the heart of Bucharest to address the people - cadres of state workers assembled , as was customary , to cheer on cue . 
From the rear of the huge crowd came shouts : &quot; Ti-mi-soara ! 
Ti-mi-soara ! &quot; 
Then came the fateful call , shouted by perhaps one or two people but soon picked up by others : &quot; Down with Ceausescu ! &quot; 
Never had Ceausescu heard anything like it . 
His face sagged . 
Flustered , he stopped speaking , waved his arms in timid bewilderment , the weak and ineffectual gestures of an imposter . 
This moment of truth lasted only a few seconds , but it was enough . 
He stood revealed . 
Everyone on the square and everyone watching on national TV saw clearly . 
The emperor had no clothes . 
By the next day , rebellion had spread to all major cities . 
Ceausescu and his wife , the infamous Elena , fled from the roof of the Central Committee aboard a white helicopter as crowds stormed the building . 
Fighting erupted between the army , siding with the people , and elements of the secret police loyal to Ceausescu . 
Snipers shot from the rooftops , and tanks blasted away in what today is Revolution Square , setting the national library ablaze . After a three-day chase , on Christmas Day , the dictator and his wife were captured , tried , and summarily executed by a kangaroo &quot; people &apos;s court . &quot; 
Revolutions are probably never as they seem , but Romania &apos;s was especially ambiguous . 
For , at the moment of Ceausescu &apos;s speech , it became in effect two revolutions - one that played out publicly in the streets , and the other a deep and behind-the-scenes struggle for power among elites . 
I sensed this arriving in Bucharest on December 26 . 
Visiting the television station , seized by a new provisional government called the National Salvation Front , I found an odd m√©lange of revolutionary leaders . 
I could understand the poets , students , dissidents , and allegedly disaffected government officials . 
The newly appointed president , Ion Iliescu , who was Ceausescu &apos;s former chief propagandist ? 
Perhaps the most incongruous presence was Gen. Victor Stanculescu , a favorite of the Ceausescu &apos;s who only days before had reportedly organized their evacuation from the rooftop of the Central Committee . 
Other reports credited him with subsequently organizing both their trial and a firing squad - even before the legal proceedings began . 
The &quot; trial &quot; itself lasted less than an hour . 
Scarcely seven minutes after the sentence was read out , had the executioners done their work . 
The event was videotaped , to be aired to an astonished nation the next day , but in the rush the cameraman &apos;s power cable was yanked from the wall as the convicted couple was dragged out to an open-air courtyard . 
By the time he caught up , soldiers were already shooting . 
Nicolae Ceausescu lay on his back , in the overcoat and suit in which he had fled , his blue-grey eyes staring vacantly at the sky . 
Elena had fainted and was shot where she lay .
