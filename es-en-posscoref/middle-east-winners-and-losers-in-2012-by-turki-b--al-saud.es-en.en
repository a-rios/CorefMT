How to Win in the Middle East 
RIYADH - Analysts the world over are assessing the situation in the Middle East in 2012 by listing the region &apos;s &quot; winners &quot; and &quot; losers . &quot; 
Hamas won . 
Egypt &apos;s President Mohamed Morsi won , then lost . 
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won . 
Syria lost . 
Iraq lost . 
Iran had a draw ( tougher sanctions , but closer to nuclear-weapons capability ) , as did Saudi Arabia ( growing clout , but unable to stop the killings in Syria or Gaza ) and Israel ( avoided massive bloodshed , but became even more isolated ) . 
All of these lists , however , are merely the pastimes of policy wonks . 
In the bloody , hostile miasma of the Middle East , being a &quot; winner &quot; in any sense of the word is fallacious . 
The region continues to breed only losers . 
The victims of the conflicts in Syria , Iran , and Palestine ; the friends and families of the victims ; those who hope for peace : all lost . 
This is a grim reminder that when it comes to killing one another , repeatedly missing opportunities for peace , and botching all efforts at progress , no one can beat the Middle East . 
In 2012 , the region proved once again that it is truly the best at perpetrating the worst . 
When will these vital , eclectic , and prosperous ( or potentially prosperous ) countries stop their ravenous infighting and start nurturing , protecting , and sustaining their people ? 
While there have been many prescriptions , I will provide my own 2012 Middle East roundup , with a look toward what must happen in 2013 if we want it to bring fewer losses . 
The Israeli killing machine must be stopped by a determined United States using its leverage to bring about implementation of the land-for-peace principles of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 , the Madrid Conference , the Oslo Agreement , and the Abdullah Peace Initiative . 
This is the only way out of the current unworkable predicament . 
Borrowing a term from nuclear strategy , the situation between Israel and the Palestinians can be described only as &quot; mutually assured destruction , &quot; also known , fittingly , as MAD . 
It benefits no one , so why let it continue ? 
Only the US has the ability to push the Israelis out of their MAD-ness , so I look forward to the Obama administration recognizing and acting on that moral obligation in the coming year . 
The Assad killing machine must also be stopped . 
In this case , it is through the West agreeing with Saudi Arabia to arm the Free Syrian Army with the defensive weapons that it needs to ground Bashar al-Assad &apos;s aircraft and immobilize his tanks and artillery . 
Unlike some conflicts in the region , this is a case with a clear and simple solution . 
Those being attacked merely need weapons to defend themselves ; if they get them , the entire dynamic of the conflict will shift , in turn ending the bloodshed . 
By now , all of the actors in Syria are known . 
There are no hidden jihadis , terrorists , or gangsters . 
They are all well documented . 
So the moderates are the ones who should get the anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons . 
Having them , their prestige among other fighters will soar , and so will support for their moderate stance . 
Iranian intervention in Iraq must stop . 
It is tearing Iraq apart and endangering the countries around it . 
Western and Iranian support for Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s government , which is controlled by Iran &apos;s Basij militia , must be withdrawn , enabling the Iraqi people to determine freely their own destiny . 
Did the Americans defeat Saddam Hussein , and did more than 100,000 Iraqis die in the process , so that their country could become a puppet of the hostile Iranian regime ? 
Iran &apos;s meddling in Bahrain , Kuwait , Yemen , and other Gulf states must end as well . 
In addition to these major tasks , Palestine &apos;s main political rivals , Hamas and Fatah , must reconcile and turn their united efforts toward improving the lives of the Palestinian people . 
Egypt must get over its post-revolutionary squabbling and reassume its leading role among the Arab states . 
And all Arab states must coordinate their efforts to realize common ambitions , rather than continuing to pursue only narrow national interests . 
Central to all of these tasks is a Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) that is united into a confederation that can meet the challenges of Iran &apos;s regional ambitions and bring major military deployments to bear on regional conflicts . 
If anything has become clear in the last year , it is that states like Israel , Iran , and Syria will act with impunity if no one is ready , willing , and able to stand up to them . 
It is time for the GCC , anchored on Saudi Arabia &apos;s power , to take up that role . 
The Middle East has been losing for too long , because its national leaders have been seeking to win in their own way , for their own purposes , and at everyone &apos;s cost but their own . 
Such unilateralism is impossible in today &apos;s globalized world . 
We must join together , or else we will rip each other to shreds . 
The choice is simple : Do we want to be winners or losers ?
