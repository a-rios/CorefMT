The Limits of the German Promised Land 
MUNICH - Migrants seeking to escape poverty and war are flowing into Europe by the hundreds of thousands . 
They are still mostly being welcomed , but the capacity of the reception centers is fast reaching its limits . 
To staunch the flow of migrants over the Balkan route , Hungary has imposed controls on its borders - and was promptly followed by Germany , Austria , Slovakia , Croatia , Slovenia , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , and Poland . 
Germany is the migrants &quot; most favored destination . 
So far this year , half of all asylum applications in the European Union have been filed there , although the country accounts for only 16 % of the EU &apos;s population . 
By September , Germany had probably received some 400,000 applications or more , with the dramatic increase in migration flows since summer and before the reinstatement of border controls expected to push the number of asylum-seekers to 800,000 this year . 
Moreover , regular immigration to Germany could again reach the 400,000 mark , as in 2014 . 
The total would represent net immigration of 1.5 % of the resident population - an extremely high proportion by historical and international standards . 
The reason for the migrants &quot; strong preference for Germany is that the country , together with Sweden , has Europe &apos;s most liberal asylum system and allocates particularly high levels of funding to accommodate the newcomers . 
Between € 1,000 ( $ 1,120 ) and € 1,200 per person per month is being transferred to the municipalities to cover the costs of accommodating them . 
The value of the benefits that the immigrants receive in Germany is a multiple of the wages they can earn in their home countries ( if they manage to find a job there at all ) . 
The Dublin Regulation , according to which the first EU country that a migrant reaches is obliged to register and process the migrant &apos;s application , has long been disregarded . 
Greece and Italy are simply waving the refugees on . 
Germany accepted , with much fanfare , a large number of unregistered refugees from Hungary and offered them a warm welcome . 
This decision arguably tempted so many more refugees from the Arab countries that soon thereafter Germany was forced to impose border controls . 
What the German government had not reckoned with is that every refugee who manages to make it to Germany immediately texts the good news back to the home country , fueling a fresh wave of migrants . 
The UN refugee camps in the countries surrounding Syria are thus being gradually relocated to Germany . 
Only a fraction of asylum-seekers &quot; applications are ultimately approved , because most applicants are not politically persecuted but simply economic migrants . 
In the first half of 2015 , for instance , only about one-quarter of applicants came from Syria and Iraq , a significant proportion of whom had already found shelter in the UN camps in or around those countries . 
But the proportion of Syrian refugees subsequently ballooned quickly , in part because the news spread that Germany approves most Syrian applications . 
If an application is successful , a refugee has the right to bring along his or her family members as well . 
Frequently , Arab families send their minors to Germany in the not-unjustified hope that they will obtain the right for other family members to follow later . 
Germany will have to deal with the consequences of this refugee wave for years to come . 
In order to distribute the burden more equitably , Germany tried to have a European quota system instituted to allocate applicants among the EU &apos;s member countries . 
But Germany &apos;s EU partners rejected this as &quot; moral imperialism . &quot; 
Germany thus failed to have a system adopted that would have provided it with some relief . 
Instead , a quickly convened summit has now agreed on a limited quota system that will cover barely 120,000 people , aimed at providing relief to Hungary , Italy , and Greece ; it will bring a further 31,000 refugees to Germany . 
In order to avert chaos , Germany has no choice but to impose restrictions . 
Among the most urgently needed steps is to develop the capacity to distinguish quickly - and ideally at the border - between refugees ( who face political persecution ) and economic migrants . 
Germany &apos;s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees could set up border outposts to clear baseless asylum claims and send the rejected applicants , in accordance with the Dublin Regulation , back to the first safe country they reached . 
This would allow Germany to concentrate on the task at hand : providing those granted refugee status the schooling and language lessons they will need to allow them to find employment as quickly as possible .
