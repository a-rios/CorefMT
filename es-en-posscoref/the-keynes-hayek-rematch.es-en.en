The Keynes-Hayek Rematch 
LONDON - The Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek , who died in 1992 at the age of 93 , once remarked that to have the last word requires only outliving your opponents . 
His great good fortune was to outlive Keynes by almost 50 years , and thus to claim a posthumous victory over a rival who had savaged him intellectually while he was alive . 
Hayek &apos;s apotheosis came in the 1980 &quot; s , when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took to quoting from The Road to Serfdom ( 1944 ) , his classic attack on central planning . 
But in economics there are never any final verdicts . 
While Hayek &apos;s defense of the market system against the gross inefficiency of central planning won increasing assent , Keynes &apos;s view that market systems require continuous stabilization lingered on in finance ministries and central banks . 
Both traditions , though , were eclipsed by the Chicago school of &quot; rational expectations , &quot; which has dominated mainstream economics for the last twenty-five years . 
With economic agents supposedly possessing perfect information about all possible contingencies , systemic crises could never happen except as a result of accidents and surprises beyond the reach of economic theory . 
The global economic collapse of 2007-2008 discredited &quot; rational expectations &quot; economics ( though its high priests have yet to recognize this ) and brought both Keynes and Hayek back into posthumous contention . 
The issues have not changed much since their argument began in the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
What causes market economies to collapse ? 
What is the right response to a collapse ? 
What is the best way to prevent future collapses ? 
For Hayek in the early 1930 &quot; s , and for Hayek &apos;s followers today , the &quot; crisis &quot; results from over-investment relative to the supply of savings , made possible by excessive credit expansion . 
Banks lend at lower interest rates than genuine savers would have demanded , making all kinds of investment projects temporarily profitable . 
But , because these investments do not reflect the real preferences of agents for future over current consumption , the savings necessary to complete them are not available . 
They can be kept going for a time by monetary injections from the central bank . 
But market participants eventually realize that there are not enough savings to complete all the investment projects . 
At that point , boom turns to bust . 
Every artificial boom thus carries the seeds of its own destruction . 
Recovery consists of liquidating the misallocations , reducing consumption , and increasing saving . 
Keynes ( and Keynesians today ) would think of the crisis as resulting from the opposite cause : under-investment relative to the supply of saving - that is , too little consumption or aggregate demand to maintain a full-employment level of investment - which is bound to lead to a collapse of profit expectations . 
Again , the situation can be kept going for a time by resorting to consumer-debt finance , but eventually consumers become over-leveraged and curtail their purchases . 
Indeed , the Keynesian and Hayekian explanations of the origins of the crisis are actually not very different , with over-indebtedness playing the key role in both accounts . 
But the conclusions to which the two theories point are very different . 
Whereas for Hayek recovery requires the liquidation of excessive investments and an increase in consumer saving , for Keynes it consists in reducing the propensity to save and increasing consumption in order to sustain companies &quot; profit expectations . 
Hayek demands more austerity , Keynes more spending . 
We have here a clue as to why Hayek lost his great battle with Keynes in the 1930 &quot; s . 
It was not just that the policy of liquidating excesses was politically catastrophic : in Germany , it brought Hitler to power . 
As Keynes pointed out , if everyone - households , firms , and governments - all started trying to increase their saving simultaneously , there would be no way to stop the economy from running down until people became too poor to save . 
It was this flaw in Hayek &apos;s reasoning that caused most economists to desert the Hayekian camp and embrace Keynesian &quot; stimulus &quot; policies . 
As the economist Lionel Robbins recalled : &quot; Confronted with the freezing deflation of those days , the idea that the prime essential was the writing down of mistaken investments and ... fostering the disposition to save was ... as unsuitable as denying blankets and stimulus to a drunk who has fallen into an icy pond , on the ground that his original trouble was overheating . &quot; 
Except to Hayekian fanatics , it seems obvious that the coordinated global stimulus of 2009 stopped the slide into another Great Depression . 
To be sure , the cost to many governments of rescuing their banks and keeping their economies afloat in the face of business collapse damaged or destroyed their creditworthiness . 
But it is increasingly recognized that public-sector austerity at a time of weak private-sector spending guarantees years of stagnation , if not further collapse . 
So policy will have to change . 
Little can be hoped for in Europe ; the real question is whether President Barack Obama has it in him to don the mantle of President Franklin Roosevelt . 
To prevent further crises of equal severity in the future , Keynesians would argue for strengthening the tools of macroeconomic management . 
Hayekians have nothing sensible to contribute . 
It is far too late for one of their favorite remedies - abolition of central banks , supposedly the source of excessive credit creation . 
Even an economy without central banks will be subject to errors of optimism and pessimism . 
And an attitude of indifference to the fallout of these mistakes is bad politics and bad morals . 
So , for all his distinction as a philosopher of freedom , Hayek deserved to lose his battle with Keynes in the 1930 &quot; s . 
He deserves to lose today &apos;s rematch as well .
