Hamas Comes in from the Cold 
GAZA CITY - In the wake of revolutionary change in the Middle East , the forces of political Islam have scored one electoral victory after another . 
As the West grapples with the rapid rise of moderate Islamists in Tunisia , Morocco , and Egypt , the issue of Hamas &apos;s role in the Palestinian territories looms large . 
The signing of a new unity deal between Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s secular Fatah party earlier this month has heightened an unprecedented struggle within Hamas over its future course as an Islamist movement . 
How the West responds could very well influence the outcome . 
As events in recent weeks have proven , Hamas &apos;s days of near-total isolation in the Middle East are over . 
While most Western governments continue to consider it a terrorist organization , in Arab capitals , political embargos have given way to engagement . 
In December , Ismail Haniyeh , Prime Minister of the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority in Gaza , embarked on a tour of the Mediterranean that included stops in Tunis , Cairo , and Istanbul . 
In mid-February , he was warmly received in Qatar , Bahrain , and Iran . 
This political outreach , however , has not emanated solely from Gaza . 
In January , Khaled Mashal , the leader of Hamas &apos;s Damascus-based political bureau , embarked on a diplomatic initiative of his own , and was hosted by King Abdullah of Jordan - the first such visit in more than a decade . 
In February , Mashal crowned these efforts in Qatar with the signing of the new unity agreement with Fatah , which commits both Palestinian movements to a transitional government under Abbas &apos;s leadership . 
Ever since , disagreements within Hamas have been escalating , pitting the movement &apos;s Diaspora leadership against the Hamas-led Gaza administration , which has openly rejected the unity deal . 
While personal ambitions certainly play a role in the tensions , what lies at the core is a fundamental conflict over Hamas &apos;s character . 
Haniyeh , who represents the conservative wing of Gaza &apos;s Hamas leadership , has sought to cash in on regional changes . 
His long-boycotted government was thrown a lifeline by regime change in Egypt and the opening of the border with Gaza . 
Notably , Haniyeh &apos;s recent diplomatic tour garnered not only symbolic recognition for Hamas , but also support for his uncompromising stance vis-Ã -vis Israel . 
He missed no opportunity to criticize &quot; futile &quot; peace negotiations , and , in Tehran , he pledged that Hamas &apos;s &quot; resistance &quot; would continue &quot; until all Palestinian land has been liberated . &quot; 
What that means needs little clarification . 
In a further telling move , Haniyeh also recently suggested merging Hamas with the Islamic Jihad movement , which continues to target Israeli civilians with rockets fired from Gaza . 
Mashal , by contrast , has come to represent a force of change . 
Last May , he signed an initial reconciliation agreement with Fatah in Cairo , which committed Hamas to a Palestinian unity government , called for a cessation of violence , and accepted the notion of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders . 
Mashal also offered Abbas a one-year mandate for negotiations with Israel , and , unlike Haniyeh , supported recent Israeli-Palestinian &quot; exploratory talks &quot; in Jordan . 
One reason for Mashal &apos;s change of heart can be found in the ongoing popular revolt in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad . 
The leader of the Sunni Hamas can no longer support his Syrian host , who has cracked down on the Sunni-dominated opposition . 
Thus , Mashal has attempted to close ranks with Fatah , and is seeking to move Hamas &apos;s Diaspora headquarters from Damascus - a powerful symbol of his efforts at re-invention . 
But Mashal &apos;s refusal to support Assad has not only forced him to re-locate . 
It has also unleashed the wrath of Syria &apos;s ally , Iran , which has responded by scaling down its financial support for Hamas - thus denying Mashal a key source of influence within the movement . 
Indeed , Mashal &apos;s decision has effectively ended his ties to his two most important allies , thereby not only weakening his position , but also increasing his readiness to embrace political moderation . 
Tensions increased dramatically when Mashal signed the unity agreement with Fatah , after stating his intention to resign as head of the political bureau . 
While that announcement may have been political blackmail aimed at forcing Gaza into line , it underscored Mashal &apos;s confidence in his popularity , which has since been vindicated by expressions of support from both within and outside of the political bureau for him to remain in charge . 
Mashal has more than one option . 
He may reemerge as the head of a newly established Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , or as a leader of a new Islamist political party under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organization . 
Such a merging of Hamas with the established Palestinian political organizations would signify Hamas &apos;s formal acceptance of a two-state solution , and would mark an important step in transforming the movement . 
For the West , using the opportunity to influence Hamas &apos;s future course requires modifying the failed policy of all-encompassing rejection . 
As in Egypt , Morocco , and Tunisia , Islamist moderates in the Palestinian territories need to be engaged as a legitimate political force . 
Leaders such as Mashal , who has expressed a readiness to forsake alliances with Syria and Iran and to accept a two-state solution with Israel , should be bolstered rather than boycotted . 
That means supporting the ongoing effort to form an interim Palestinian government of technocrats , as stipulated in the Qatar agreement . 
At times , such an approach will be challenging ; 
Hamas will undoubtedly prove to be a difficult counterpart . 
But the United States , European governments , and Israel should take this opportunity to engage Hamas &apos;s moderates and test their flexibility . 
In the new Middle East , the West &apos;s current approach will only strengthen the hardliners in Gaza and elsewhere .
