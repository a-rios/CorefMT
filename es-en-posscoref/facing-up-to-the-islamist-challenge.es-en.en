Facing up to the Islamist Challenge 
Our traditional understanding of Muslim communities assumes that when Islam arrives in an area , it becomes deeply rooted in the population and culture , producing powerful local variations . 
A Muslim community in the United Arab Emirates is very different from one in Nigeria , and both are very different from Islam in Indonesia . 
Recent developments in Russia , however , constitute a stark challenge to this understanding - which explains President Vladimir Putin &apos;s bold decision to support the US-led war on terrorism following the September 11 th attacks . 
The scenario is the same within Muslim communities throughout Russia . 
Young activists arrive in a particular area , typically from Arab countries . 
They know how to work with local law enforcement agencies , and initially their activities are limited to gathering information aimed at discrediting the current local religious leaders - whose average age is over 70 - and working skillfully with local media to ensure that this defamatory information is publicized . 
The religious community then convenes , removes its old leaders , with the young challengers taking over . 
The new leaders proceed on the assumption that they need not - and indeed should not - adapt to national or cultural distinctions among Muslims , for their goal is Islamic unification , not differentiation . 
They send their most promising local supporters abroad - not necessarily to Arab countries , but also to France , England , and the US - to be trained to carry out the same work , whether it is in the Volga region ( home to 40 % of Russia &apos;s Muslims ) or elsewhere . 
Participation in these networks convinces new recruits that they are part of a globally integrated organization . 
Operating these networks costs money . 
Indeed , notwithstanding the conventional wisdom that the main post-Cold War division pits the poor South against the rich North , the ferment within Islam suggests a struggle between rich and rich . 
Elites in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states have the financial clout of the most advanced countries , yet not a single Arab state has a seat in the Security Council or is a member of the G-7 . 
To the extent that such international councils of power exclude representatives of the Islamic world , a portion of this would-be Muslim counter-elite will seek to challenge the system , finding no shortage of ideologically committed proxies . 
So efforts at Islamic unification are at most only indirectly the result of relative economic backwardness . 
Rather , greater mobility , enlarged markets , and increased access to information have made traditional borders increasingly porous , and a more globalized world has led to the emergence of political actors seeking to gain a greater say in international councils . 
The steady growth of network communities , linked together by a religious identity that transcends the hierarchical organization of nations and states , reflects this emerging new reality . 
The theological and political implications of this integral thrust within Islam are very different from those associated with the emergence of Protestantism in Christianity . 
For example , both share a religious concern with bringing the individual into direct contact with God , and both entail a radical challenge to foreign domination in the temporal world . 
However , whereas the Protestant Reformation underpinned a sea change in ethics that spurred the growth of capitalism and liberal democracy , the focus for Islamic unifiers is the establishment of a greater collective presence . 
While the Reformation was supported by national elites seeking to throw off Roman hegemony , integralist Islam seeks to unify the community of believers by liberating it from the Western-imposed model of separate Muslim nation states . 
As with Protestantism , new developments within Islam cannot be simply banned . 
Fortunately , it is not too late to avoid recourse to repression . 
So far , Muslims in Russia have not been actively involved in political life , with the glaring exception of certain localities , such as Chechnya . 
For the most part , they are still mainly concerned with the transition of religious authority within their communities . 
This process implies that political mobilization is inevitable , facilitated by the fragmenting of Russian society and the weakness of Russia &apos;s national identity . 
Our task is therefore not only to bolster the authority of federal legislation throughout Russia - a key goal from the outset of President Putin &apos;s administration - but to find and publicize strategies by which Muslims can preserve their identity without taking to arms . 
This is an effort that requires international cooperation , for it cannot be achieved in one country alone . 
We must examine the political culture and behavior of Muslims in Europe , China , India , the US , and other countries . 
Two distinct parts of this problem exist . 
On the one hand , we confront a radical terrorist element which cannot be engaged constructively . 
On the other , the ideological struggle with integralist Islam can be won only by displaying a more solid and stronger identity . 
The organizers of the September 11 th attacks clearly anticipated retaliation , evidently hoping that an indiscriminate response would strengthen integralist tendencies worldwide . 
President Bush &apos;s rhetorical slip about a &quot; crusade &quot; against terrorism was one such response . 
Excessive civilian deaths in Afghanistan - or , for that matter , in Chechnya - are even more damaging . 
This brings us to the issue of common values . 
President Putin &apos;s decision to support the US military &apos;s use of bases in Central Asia was a risky step domestically . 
Russian politicians urged him to haggle , arguing that President Bush would give him anything : money , debt forgiveness , and technology . 
Yet President Putin refused on the grounds that cooperation is both in keeping with Russia &apos;s interests and morally correct . 
We must now take this collaboration a step further . 
If we are to win Muslim hearts and minds and undercut Islam &apos;s integralist threat , we must recognize that defending national security cannot come at the price of ignoring human rights and freedoms .
