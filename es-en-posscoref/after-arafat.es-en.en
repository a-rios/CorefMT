After Arafat 
Yasir Arafat appears , once again , to have held off challenges to his rule . 
When Arafat was seriously ill in 2003 , Palestinians were near panic . 
Ahmad Dudin , former Fatah leader in Hebron , summed up the dilemma this way : &quot; The Palestinian Authority has always been a one-man operation . 
Arafat never really agreed to share power . 
That is the problem . &quot; 
Not only does Arafat have no designated successor , but he has crippled the creation of institutions that could provide for a smooth transition , develop new leaders , mediate disputes among competing candidates and factions , or check the power of a future dictator . 
But at some point , Arafat will depart . 
He is 74 years old , and cannot be described as healthy . 
Arafat &apos;s ability to symbolize the Palestinian cause throughout the world has worn thin in recent years , but any successor would be more obscure . 
So what will happen when a transition is forced on the Palestinian movement by his demise ? 
The best way to address that question is to focus not on who , but on what , would replace Arafat . 
In a certain sense , Arafat is the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) . 
As a pro-reform Fatah official put it : &quot; This is Arafat &apos;s narcissism . 
I am afraid the Palestinian people will still be suffering from it even after his death . &quot; 
Arafat &apos;s departure will leave a vacuum that no other institution or leader will be able to fill . 
Indeed , Arafat has had several roles , and in each of them his stature has been unique . 
While nominally the Palestinians have a collective leadership , the reality is that Arafat has overwhelming control . 
He has been the Palestinian movement &apos;s sole leader almost from the day he founded it in 1959 . 
Other contenders , like Abu Jihad and Abu Iyad , were assassinated , and Faisal al-Husseini - the only major leader to rise to prominence within the West Bank and Gaza Strip - died young . 
Arafat alone has the power to make everyone obey him , even if he often decides not to exercise this power . 
Some argue that an obvious alternative to Arafat is democracy . 
In a post-Arafat situation , it will be much harder for any successor or successors to impose discipline and hierarchy on the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , the PA , or Fatah . 
Nor will Arafat &apos;s departure revive hopes for a political settlement with Israel . 
True , Arafat &apos;s refusal to authorize crucial compromises on such matters as Israel &apos;s legitimacy and Palestine &apos;s borders has been a critical reason for the failure to resolve the Israel-Palestinian or Arab-Israeli conflicts . 
Given Arafat &apos;s stature and control over the movement , he could have downsized the Palestinians &apos; goals to acceptance of a state in only part of historic Palestine . 
The problem is that even if future Palestinian leaders want to resolve the issues that block peace with Israel , doing so will be far more difficult than it would have been for Arafat . 
Under Arafat &apos;s long rule , whole generations of Palestinians have been indoctrinated with the belief that only total victory is acceptable . 
Indeed , beyond day-to-day policies , Arafat has constructed the Palestinian movement &apos;s intellectual and psycho-political style , which is dogmatic and uncompromising . 
Arafat &apos;s legacy is thus a political culture in which a leader may portray a disastrous tactic , strategy , or outcome as a victory and be believed . 
So no political price is ever paid for continuing wars that cannot be won or making demands that will not be met . 
The acceptance of violence without limit will be the most devastating feature of Arafat &apos;s legacy . 
Many movements throughout history have used violence , but few have so thoroughly justified and romanticized it . 
This problem will not go away when Arafat does . 
How can someone with less legitimacy than Arafat escape this justification of violence ? 
Entire groups - Hamas , Islamic Jihad , Fatah &apos;s al-Aqsa Martyrs &apos; Brigades - and their leaders owe their power to their willingness to kill Israelis , which has become the ultimate measure of political virtue . 
Any effort by Palestinian security authorities to put down these groups by force would lead to far more violence . 
Arafat &apos;s refusal to take sides ideologically helped create an illusion of Palestinian unity , with everyone dedicated to a single Palestinian struggle . 
He achieved this consensus by devaluing statehood as an end in itself , building political unity on the myth of an idealized pre-1948 Palestinian society that could be &quot; recreated &quot; on the basis of the &quot; right of return &quot; and Israel &apos;s disappearance . 
These aims are never going to be realized , but they also have never been subordinated to &quot; ending the occupation , &quot; so they form the glue of Palestinian nationalism . 
In today &apos;s divisive circumstances , the emergence of a new Palestinian leader will most likely take years . 
During that interregnum , we should expect deadlock , anarchy , or civil war .
