Winds of Vanity 
COPENHAGEN - Copenhagen , Denmark &apos;s capital , wants to be the world &apos;s first CO2-neutral city by 2025 . 
But , as many other well-meaning cities and countries have discovered , cutting CO2 significantly is more difficult than it seems , and may require quite a bit of creative accounting . 
More surprisingly , Copenhagen &apos;s politicians have confidently declared that cutting CO2 now will ultimately make the city and its citizens wealthier , with today &apos;s expensive green-energy investments more than paying off when fossil-fuel prices rise . 
But how can deliberately limiting one &apos;s options improve one &apos;s prospects ? 
These sound more like the arguments of green campaigners - and they are most likely wrong . 
The first challenge that Copenhagen faces in reaching its zero-emissions goal is the lack of cost-effective alternatives for some sources of CO2 , particularly automobiles . 
Denmark already provides the world &apos;s largest subsidy to electric cars by exempting them from its marginal 180 % car-registration tax . 
For the most popular electric car , the Nissan Leaf , this exemption is worth $ 85,000 ( â‚¬ 63,000 ) . 
Yet , just 1,536 of Denmark &apos;s 2.7 million cars are electric . 
There is also the challenge inherent in wind-generated electricity : ensuring that the city can continue to run when the wind is not blowing . 
To address this problem , Copenhagen has had to devise an electricity-generation strategy that enables it sometimes to run on coal-fired power when necessary , without creating net emissions . 
The city &apos;s plan is to build more than 100 wind turbines within the greater Copenhagen area and in the shallow waters around it . 
With a combined output of 360 megawatts , which will feed electricity into the grid , these turbines will more than cover Copenhagen &apos;s electricity needs - and the surplus can be used to offset the city &apos;s remaining CO2 emissions , including from the city &apos;s millions of non-electric cars . 
Copenhagen &apos;s success thus depends on the surrounding areas not aiming for CO2 neutrality . 
After all , the whole accounting exercise works only if others are still using fossil fuels that Copenhagen &apos;s unpredictable wind power can replace . 
In this sense , Copenhagen is hogging the chance to feel righteous . 
The city &apos;s political leaders promise that this strategy for attaining carbon neutrality &quot; provides an overall positive economic picture and will lead to economic benefits for Copenhageners &quot; based on the expectation that prices for conventional energy sources like coal , oil , and gas will rise in the coming years . 
But the often-heard justification for this assumption - that humanity is rapidly depleting these scarce resources - is inconsistent with real-world events , as innovation has effectively expanded oil , gas , and coal reserves to unprecedented levels in recent years . 
Consider Copenhagen &apos;s wind-turbine plan , the single largest expected source of savings . 
The total cost of construction and maintenance is projected to be $ 919 million . 
Even assuming a very large carbon tax , this amounts to a rather paltry $ 142 million , meaning that the project &apos;s value - $ 261 million in savings - stems largely from the $ 1.04 billion saved on electricity payments . 
While that sounds impressive , it depends on a massive 68 % increase in the price of fossil-fuel-produced electricity by 2030 . 
And Copenhagen is not alone in making such assumptions ; the United Kingdom &apos;s Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change estimates a 51 % price increase by 2030 . 
It is likely that these projections are unrealistic . 
Look at the long-term price trends of coal and gas , which power the vast majority of global electricity production . 
Despite a recent increase , real coal prices have been trending downward since the 1950s . 
In the United States , the shale-gas revolution , facilitated by the development of hydraulic fracturing ( &quot; fracking &quot; ) , has brought prices to their lowest levels since natural gas gained prominence after the oil crises of the 1970s . 
With many more countries set to tap shale-gas reserves over the next decade , this downward trend will most likely continue , helping to lower the price of electricity generation further . 
That is why Aurora Energy Research recently projected a significant decline in electricity prices for the next three decades . 
Fracking technology has also enabled the US to tap its large shale-oil reserves , making it the world &apos;s largest petroleum producer , ahead of Saudi Arabia . 
Citigroup estimates that , by 2020 , oil will cost just $ 75 per barrel , and the former head of international forecasting at the OECD suggests that the number could be closer to $ 50 . 
This is inconvenient for climate mandarins in the UK and Copenhagen alike , because it reduces clean energy &apos;s allure . 
Even if fossil-fuel-powered electricity prices remain constant , Copenhagen &apos;s wind turbines become a net drain . 
If Aurora &apos;s forecast proves correct , Copenhagen &apos;s wind project would become a massive failure , costing 50 % more than the saved electricity is worth . 
Instead of allowing politicians to spend public money on feel-good climate projects based on distant - and unreliable - predictions , citizens should encourage their leaders to invest those funds in clean-energy research and development , with the goal of making renewables inexpensive enough to overcome fossil fuels in the market . 
Initiatives like Copenhagen &apos;s , however wonderful they sound , are ultimately little more than costly vanity projects .
