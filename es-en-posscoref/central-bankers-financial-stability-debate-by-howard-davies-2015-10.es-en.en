The Trouble With Financial Bubbles 
LONDON - Very soon after the magnitude of the 2008 financial crisis became clear , a lively debate began about whether central banks and regulators could - and should - have done more to head it off . 
The traditional view , notably shared by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , is that any attempt to prick financial bubbles in advance is doomed to failure . 
The most central banks can do is to clean up the mess . 
Bubble-pricking may indeed choke off growth unnecessarily - and at high social cost . 
But there is a counter-argument . 
Economists at the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) have maintained that the costs of the crisis were so large , and the cleanup so long , that we should surely now look for ways to act pre-emptively when we again see a dangerous build-up of liquidity and credit . 
Hence the fierce ( albeit arcane and polite ) dispute between the two sides at the International Monetary Fund &apos;s recent meeting in Lima , Peru . 
For the literary-minded , it was reminiscent of Jonathan Swift &apos;s Gulliver &apos;s Travels . 
Gulliver finds himself caught in a war between two tribes , one of which believes that a boiled egg should always be opened at the narrow end , while the other is fervent in its view that a spoon fits better into the bigger , rounded end . 
It is fair to say that the debate has moved on a little since 2008 . 
Most important , macroprudential regulation has been added to policymakers &quot; toolkit : simply put , it makes sense to vary banks &quot; capital requirements according to the financial cycle . 
When credit expansion is rapid , it may be appropriate to increase banks &quot; capital requirements as a hedge against the heightened risk of a subsequent contraction . 
This increase would be above what microprudential supervision - assessing the risks to individual institutions - might dictate . 
In this way , the new Basel rules allow for requiring banks to maintain a so-called countercyclical buffer of extra capital . 
But if the idea of the countercyclical buffer is now generally accepted , what of the &quot; nuclear option &quot; to prick a bubble : Is it justifiable to increase interest rates in response to a credit boom , even though the inflation rate might still be below target ? 
And should central banks be given a specific financial-stability objective , separate from an inflation target ? 
Jaime Caruana , the General Manager of the BIS , and a former Governor of the Bank of Spain , answers yes to both questions . 
In Lima , he argued that the so-called &quot; separation principle , &quot; whereby monetary and financial stability are addressed differently and tasked to separate agencies , no longer makes sense . 
The two sets of policies are , of course , bound to interact ; but Caruana argues that it is wrong to say that we know too little about financial instability to be able to act in a preemptive way . 
We know as much about bubbles as we do about inflation , Caruana argues , and central banks &quot; need to move interest rates for reasons other than the short-term control of consumer-price trends should be explicitly recognized . 
At the Lima meeting , the traditionalist counterview came from Benoît Cœuré of the European Central Bank . 
A central bank , he argued , needs a very simple mandate that allows it to explain its actions clearly and be held accountable for them . 
So let central banks stick to the separation principle , &quot; which makes our life simple . 
We do not want a complicated set of objectives . &quot; 
For Cœuré , trying to maintain financial stability is in the &quot; too difficult &quot; box . 
Even macroprudential regulation is of dubious value : supervisors should confine themselves to overseeing individual institutions , leaving macro-level policy to the grownups . 
Nemat Shafik , a deputy governor of the Bank of England , tried to position herself between these opposing positions . 
She proposed relying on three lines of defense against financial instability . 
Microprudential regulation , she argued , is the first line of defense : if all banks are lending prudently , the chances of collective excesses are lower . 
But the second line of defense is macroprudential manipulation of capital requirements , to be applied across the board or to selected market segments , such as mortgages . 
And , if all else fails to achieve financial stability , central banks could change interest rates . 
Because British law assigns capital regulation and interest-rate policy to two separate committees - with different members - within the Bank of England , the Shafik strategy would require some clever political and bureaucratic maneuvering . 
Industrial quantities of research , analysis , and debate have been devoted to the causes of the 2008 crisis and its consequences ; so it seems odd that senior central bankers are still so sharply divided on the central issue of financial stability . 
All those days spent in secret conclave in Basel , drinking through the BIS &apos;s legendary wine cellar , have apparently led to no consensus . 
My view is that Caruana had the best of the arguments in Lima , and Cœuré the worst . 
Sticking to a simple objective in the interests of a quiet life , even if you know it to be imperfect , is an inelegant posture at best . 
We need our central bankers to make complex decisions and to be able to balance potentially conflicting objectives . 
We accept that they will not always be right . 
However , it is surely incumbent on them to learn from the biggest financial meltdown of the last 80 years , rather than to press on , regardless , with policy approaches that so signally failed .
