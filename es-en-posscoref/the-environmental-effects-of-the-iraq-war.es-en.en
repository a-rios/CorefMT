The Environmental Effects of the Iraq War 
Aside from the infrastructure damage and civilian suffering and death implied by the cynical term &quot; collateral damage , &quot; all wars have environmental effects . 
The extent of environmental damage depends on a war &apos;s duration , the weapons used , and the type of terrain and ecosystems in which it takes place . 
Now that the main combat in the Iraq war is over , the final environmental toll of the fighting can be uncovered through comprehensive on-the-ground analyses and the release of previously privileged information . 
Neither of these steps has yet occurred , but , based on my experiences in 1991 , when I led a UN team studying the environmental effects of the first Persian Gulf war , several initial observations are possible . 
Some reports described the sandstorms in south central Iraq in the first week of the war as &quot; sent by Allah against the aggressors . &quot; 
In fact , US and British troops may have only themselves to blame . 
Increased sand drift was one of the effects noted during and after the first Gulf war . 
This is because the desert in the region normally has a crust , what Arabs call &quot; the desert skin , &quot; consisting of sand and clay particles that have been baked together , or sintered , by the heat and sun . 
Sometimes this crust is strong enough to carry a person and sometimes not , much like the hard ice crust that develops on snow in colder climates . 
Under the crust , the sand particles are loose . 
Crushed by the bands and wheels of military vehicles , explosions of bombs and mines , and digging of trenches and walls , the desert &apos;s crust is broken and the fine sand particles beneath it are exposed to the wind . 
In the first Gulf war , this resulted in &quot; rolling &quot; sand dunes , sometimes ten meters high and several kilometers long , that covered roads and buildings . 
Finer particles became airborne and caused environmental and health problems across northeastern Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and southwestern Iraq . 
It took between five and ten years for this effect to abate . 
The unusual intensity of the sandstorms in Iraq is most likely the result of the same process . 
But the consequences of the increased mobility of sand are likely to be far worse than they were in Kuwait , where in the absence of significant agriculture and forests , the impact was mainly on technical systems and infrastructure . 
In Iraq , a large agricultural sector operates on fairly marginal lands , where farmers fight a constant battle against salt intrusion and face severe water shortages . 
Drifting sand may frequently tip the balance to unsustainability , threatening the livelihoods of entire districts . 
Another serious problem is the use of ozone-depleting substances , such as halons and freons . 
Halogenated fire retardants are added to the fuel tanks of combat airplanes , causing massive damage to the stratospheric ozone layer . 
Some 60-80,000 combat missions were reportedly been flown in the Iraq war , releasing an estimated 2,000 tons of ozone-destroying halons . 
Stealth bombers and fighters , meanwhile , use freon fuel additives to reduce the number of exhaust particles that could otherwise be detected by enemy sensors . 
Following international agreements such as the Montreal Protocol on the Protection of the Ozone Layer , global emissions of ozone-depleting substances have otherwise been substantially reduced . 
The Iraq war emissions may therefore reach the equivalent of three months of normal global civilian release . 
Burning oil fields were a vivid image - and a major part - of the environmental damage caused by the first Gulf war . 
The six or seven Iraqi fields currently ablaze are a pittance compared to the six hundred that burned in Kuwait . 
The smoke over Baghdad came mostly from oil deliberately burned in ditches and trenches to obscure potential targets from air attack . 
Those emissions were insignificant from a global or regional point of view , but oil-drenched particles will likely have adverse health effects for local inhabitants and combatants . 
Such effects could be reinforced by the addition of metals to the oil in order to confuse bombs &apos; guidance systems . 
During the war in Kuwait , the Iraqis pumped massive amounts of oil into the Persian Gulf , resulting in the world &apos;s largest-ever oil spill - some fifty times the amount released from the tanker &quot; Prestige &quot; off the Spanish coast last fall . 
Nothing similar happened this time . 
Similarly , large-scale bombings of Iraqi industry , power plants , and infrastructure in 1991 resulted in substantial chemical spills into the Tigris and Euphrates rivers . 
Nothing on a similar scale has been reported in this war . 
In the first Gulf war it was also found that the Iraqis &apos; Soviet-built tanks and artillery had PCBs ( poly-chlorinated biphenyls ) in their hydraulic systems for the same reason that combat airplanes use halons . 
When destroyed , such as on the road north from Kuwait City , the PCBs leaked into the ground . 
The extent of destruction of Iraqi tanks during this war is not yet public information , but the same ground pollution can be expected . 
Finally , most of the ammunition used in wars consists of nitrogen compounds . 
Whether they explode or not , these compounds are hardly benign environmentally , posing risks for both ecosystems and human health . 
These initial considerations cover only a small range of the conceivable environmental effects of the Iraq war . 
Destroyed water and wastewater treatment facilities , use of depleted uranium in anti-tank missiles , and ground water contamination may well lead to a host of other problems . 
For now , limited information makes any accurate assessment impossible . 
However , whichever administration governs Iraq in the future must be prepared to face up to an environmental debt - the cost of restoring what can be restored - that will be a substantial liability for years to come .
