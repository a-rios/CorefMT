Look East Again , Europe 
The EU &apos;s historic decision to admit eight former communist countries as members must not be create a new division between Eurasia &apos;s haves and have nots . 
Instead , the Union needs to turn its attention further east - to its new neighbours and the other countries of the former Soviet Union . 
The EU spent 9billion euros between 1999 and 2002 to prepare Central European and Baltic candidate countries for membership - 10 times the amount it spent on Central Asia &apos;s impoverished non-candidate countries . 
The EU will spend over 30billion euros integrating its new members into the Union . 
It is in the EU &apos;s economic and security interests to extend that generosity further eastward to assist the development of stable market-economies in Central Asia , the Caucasus and other CIS countries . 
Poverty and under-development undermine security and democracy . 
They fuel cross-border organised crime , trafficking in human beings and illicit migration , as well as the drugs trade , religious extremism and terrorism . 
Afghanistan is a stark warning of what happens when the world turns its back on an impoverished country in a volatile region . 
Expanding Europe &apos;s common economic space to all territories of the former Soviet bloc will contribute to security and prosperity across the region . 
In many respects , the former Soviet republics are less well-placed than their former communist neighbours to the West to cope with the transition to a market economy . 
For some , indeed , the challenges look almost insurmountable . 
In Georgia , Moldova , Tajikistan and Ukraine , for example , per capita GDP is now less than half of the dire levels achieved under communism . 
Economic discrepancies are growing . 
Foreign direct investment in 1991-2001 averaged $ 1,400 per capita in the eight former communist EU candidate countries . 
It was only $ 198 per capita in the CIS . 
Recent studies by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) , the World Bank and the CASE Foundation show that geographical distance from centres of development , mountainous terrain , lack of &quot; market memory &quot; - recent historical experience of an entrepreneurial tradition - and failures of economic policy are the main causes of the lack of recovery after the collapse of the Soviet-era economy . 
Let me add another : Western assistance to EU non-candidate countries is neither comprehensive nor systematic . 
It is scattered , sporadic and uncoordinated , leaving many areas uncovered . 
It is too modest . 
All of this is in sharp contrast with the treatment given the EU candidates . 
They were assisted by thousands of experts in adopting the EU &apos;s legendary , 80,000-page &quot; acquis communautaire . &quot; legislative package . 
For the first time in EU history , they received pre-accession funding to help overcome costly hurdles . 
If such massive assistance was necessary to restore the market economy to Western Europe &apos;s closest neighbours , who spent &quot; only &quot; 45 years under Communism , how much greater is the challenge of building modern economies from scratch in remote lands like Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan ? 
These countries never experienced modern market arrangements . 
For 70 years , their contacts with the West were stifled by the Soviet system . 
No matter how hard they try - and Kyrgyzstan has certainly tried - they are doomed to fail without co-ordinated , well-designed and adequate assistance . 
Some good news is on the way . 
The EU is doubling its TACIS program in Central Asia . 
President Bush wants Congress to fund $ 5 billion of assistance over three years to the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
Foreign ministers of the 55-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) decided last month in Porto to develop a new strategy for economic and environmental co-operation in the Euro-Atlantic area so as to address security threats resulting from the growing inequalities between countries of this region . 
But this will not suffice . 
From my perspective at the OSCE , it is clear that far more needs to be done : 
The EU &apos;s technical capacity , which has been preoccupied by enlargement , could be redirected towards assistance for the non-candidate countries of Euro-Asia . 
Building the institutions of a market economy should be the main focus , not alignment with expensive EU standards in food production or the environment ; 
The EU should gradually phase out its Common Agricultural Policy , which primarily benefits owners of large farms , and instead develop new instruments of financial assistance for its own poor regions and its new neighbours ; 
Current EU members and successful candidate countries could make available large-scale training programmes in market-relevant disciplines for the young generation in CIS countries ; 
Taking as a model the Stability Pact in the Balkans , the EU could offer concrete incentives , such as economic assistance and the prospect of closer integration , to stimulate parties to end unresolved regional conflicts in the Caucasus , Transdniestria and Central Asia ; 
The main actors providing international assistance - including the World Bank , International Monetary Fund , EBRD , the EU itself and the United Nations Development Programme - should ensure a minimum level of co-ordination to avoid duplication and waste . 
The OSCE , with field offices in all the countries concerned , could play a useful role here . 
By preventing a new division of the Euro-Asian region into successes and failures , the EU will make a substantial investment in its own long-term security .
