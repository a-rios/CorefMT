Islam &apos;s Democratic Imperative 
Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s election in Palestine and the forthcoming vote in Iraq on January 30 have pushed the question of Islam &apos;s compatibility with democracy to the center of the world &apos;s agenda . 
Sheik Dia al-Shakarchi , a leading Shi &apos;ite theologian , argues that democracy is not only compatible with Islam , but is essential to it . 
During the last 25 years , Islam has played an increasingly influential role in politics , and not only in the Islamic world , with political Islam frequently expressing itself in radicalism and terror . 
Both Muslims and non-Muslims have not always agreed on the extent to which this is compatible with genuine Islam . 
How Islam is understood varies widely among devout , moderately religious , and non-observant Muslims , as well as among Islamic scholars , political parties , and organizations . 
Even western experts and critics of Islam hold different views . 
Overall , there are two conflicting images of Islam : a peaceful Islam , which is ready for dialogue and coexistence , and a fundamentalist Islam , which is militant and even terrorist . 
There is a widespread misperception that Islam &apos;s holy texts are written in a way that can justify both interpretations . 
This approach to Islamic texts - coming from both secular and religiously oriented Muslims , as well as from non-Muslims with an interest in the subject - calls into question the compatibility of Islam and democracy , and also whether Islam is capable with peace and moderation . 
Indeed , in my view , democracy is not only permitted by Islam , but can be regarded as a religious rule . 
My understanding is drawn from a principle contained by the basic Islamic theory of legal reasoning , which asserts that when strong religious interests can be realized only through a particular path of action , that path itself is no longer a matter of choice . 
Thus , if we can establish that democracy is the means to realize the strong interests of the Muslim community - and I believe we can do this - then democracy may be declared a religious duty in Islam . 
Even if democracy might be viewed primarily as an evil from an Islamic point of view , there is another principle of interpretation of religious laws in Islam , according to which minor evils - even if religiously impermissible or not recommended at first - become permissible , recommended , and even mandatory if they alone can prevent major evils . 
The Muslim interest in democracy is best understood through a clear perception of the reality of how Muslims live . 
A country like Iraq , for example , is home to a diverse and varied population : Arab and Kurd , Sunni and Shi &apos;ite , not to mention minorities of other religions and ethnic groups . 
Moreover , not all Muslims practice Islam , nor do those who practice do so in the same way . 
So religion cannot be imposed ; individuals must practice it according to their own decisions . 
Any enforcement of religious practice only creates hostility toward religion . 
Thus , I believe that a political system that best serves free choice - including the choice of people to be practicing Muslims - is the best system for Islam . 
Of course , the problem of Islam &apos;s compatibility with democracy may be analyzed from different points of view . 
One possible approach is purely practical , comparing democracy with all other conceivable alternatives . 
In my opinion , there are only five conceivable alternatives in a Muslim country . 
The first is secular dictatorship . 
This is unacceptable for two reasons . 
First , dictatorship itself is ugly and unacceptable ; second , secular dictatorship excludes Islamic parties from participating normally in the political system . 
We have considerable experience of this in the Middle East . 
Of course , an Islamic dictatorship is also possible . 
As with a secular dictatorship , Islamic dictatorship is ugly and destructive . 
Such a dictatorship would damage Islam by associating Islam with unjust rule and creating enemies for Islam . 
A third alternative is democracy , but with secular restrictions on religious parties . 
In fact , this would be a pseudo-democracy , and would infringe on the rights of religious people to full participation . 
Likewise , an Islamic democracy with restrictions on non-religious parties would be a mockery of democracy and harmful to Islam . 
This would also be unrealistic , because in the current age of globalization , any claims to democracy would be exposed as obviously false . 
So , in my view , true democracy is the only alternative , because it is realistic and promotes peace . 
Call this ideology-free democracy : a political system that tolerates restrictions imposed only from within , never from outside , the democratic process itself . 
We must recognize that democracy has proved its worth around the world . 
It is the best way of organizing a society based on reality and not ideals . 
Why shouldn &apos;t Iraqis benefit from the proven experience of other peoples ?
