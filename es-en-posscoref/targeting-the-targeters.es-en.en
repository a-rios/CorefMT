Targeting the Targeters 
LONDON - Speaking in the happier economic times of 2005 , Mervyn King - then , as now , Governor of the Bank of England - stressed the importance of entrenching public expectations of stable , low inflation . 
He warned that , &quot; if you let inflation expectations drift too far away from the target , you can end up in quite serious difficulty with a costly process to bring them back again . &quot; 
King must now be a worried man . 
The Bank of England &apos;s own commissioned quarterly surveys of public attitudes reveal that the credibility of its Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) has now been impaired . 
For the last 15 months , the 2 % inflation target , which is set by the government and is supposed to be enforced by the Bank of England , has been exceeded by more than a full percentage point . 
For most of this period , the British public expected inflation in the coming year to be lower than in the previous year , thanks to the MPC &apos;s strong track record on price stability . 
That confidence has now dissipated : inflation expectations have caught up with the actual inflation rate of 4 % . 
There is no mystery about what is going on . 
The price-stability mandate has been trumped by concerns about growth . 
The fear is that tightening monetary policy to bear down on inflation could snuff out the faltering economic recovery . 
So not only has the MPC kept interest rates at a rock-bottom 0.5 % since 2009 , but policy has been loosened further by the Bank of England &apos;s so-called &quot; quantitative easing &quot; - that is , expanding the monetary base by the stroke of a pen in the hope of reinvigorating domestic credit markets . 
But the United Kingdom is now faced with the worst outcome : stagflation . 
The economy is incurring the inflationary costs of the Bank &apos;s policy while missing out on the intended benefit of growth . 
In the US , where the Federal Reserve is running a similarly loose monetary policy , the situation looks rosier - at least at first sight . 
The US economy is staging a more convincing recovery than the UK , and , in contrast to the Bank of England and the European Central Bank , the Fed is not explicitly mandated by Congress to achieve a specific inflation target . 
Thus , compared to the Bank of England , the all-important credibility of the monetary authority seems less vulnerable in the case of the Fed . 
But , even in the US , policy-setting officials , such as Thomas Hoenig , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , express concern that inflation expectations may become unanchored , owing to the massive expansion of government debt and the Fed &apos;s balance sheet since the financial crash in 2008 . 
All the major Western central banks - including even the traditionally &quot; hawkish &quot; ECB - appear to be sticking their heads in the sand . 
But there is something they can do to ensure the benefits of inflation-targeting rules ( credibility and well-anchored inflation expectations ) while also supporting recovery : raise the stated target . 
The case for doing so can best be shown by Britain , where the situation is particularly delicate . 
The UK authorities have decided to prioritize fiscal consolidation while running a loose monetary policy to contain risks to the recovery from higher taxes and lower government spending . 
The thinking is clear ( if rarely spelled out clearly by politicians ) : whereas a loss of market confidence in the British state &apos;s solvency would most likely trigger a depression , above-target inflation can be rectified at a relatively tolerable cost to living standards ( though higher than it should have been ) . 
Granting , for the sake of argument , the force of this logic ( and even its critics could hardly deny its coherence ) , it would be foolish to underestimate the risk of runaway inflation and underplay the economic and social harm it would cause . 
To the extent that tolerance of above-target inflation also reflects a desire to erode the real value of public and private debts , market interest rates could soar , leaving indebted governments and households in even greater trouble . 
Many commentators believe that governments &quot; huge budget constraints will force them to rely on inflation . 
If so , it is better to do it transparently , unlike the Bank of England . 
Simply put , in order to anchor inflation expectations effectively , inflation targets must be realistic . 
The current high-stakes conundrum faced by policymakers suggests that they should apply inflation-targeting principles more flexibly in the context of a major economic shock . 
This would involve raising the target to a level in line with the actual inflation rate observed in the post-crisis period - a level that the public would perceive as realistic , honest , and credible . 
Doing so would reduce the debt and tax burdens on future generations , while crucially limiting the risks of much higher inflation in the nearer term . 
Moreover , a higher inflation target - and the restoration of credibility that it would imply - would enable central banks to return to a lower inflation target without creating a recession once debt levels had been reduced and aggregate demand had recovered .
