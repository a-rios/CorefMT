Can We Fight Depression ? 
If one enters the term &quot; mood disorder &quot; in the largest online medical database - Medline - you get close to 62,000 hits . 
If you restrict your search to randomized controlled trials , generally considered the most reliable design for investigating the efficacy of treatments , still more than 3,200 hits appear . 
Considering the huge impact worldwide of depression on health , health care costs , and the ability to work , so much information should be good news . 
But look more closely at individual studies and it soon becomes obvious that most investigate physiological , metabolic , or biochemical disturbances associated with depression . 
None of these findings have been shown to be of any help for deciding which patients should be treated with what therapies over what period of time . 
Of course , there are still roughly 1,500 studies of a multitude of treatments : psychopharmaceutical drugs , ECT , bright light , exercise , psychotherapies , and even acupuncture . 
True , many of these studies document the short-term , and in some cases the long-term , effects of various treatments , and generally with an acceptable trade-off between efficacy and safety . 
To be sure , if many millions of people are prescribed a group of drugs , not only for depression , but also for many other mental health problems , it is quite reasonable that some of them will suffer an adverse effect or reaction . 
But blanket claims that antidepressant drugs are dangerous , addictive , or bad in other ways are not based on strong evidence . 
Reports of severe adverse effects in adults are rare , while children and adolescents with depression seem much more vulnerable . 
Possibly the biggest obstacle to more effective treatment is that the diagnostic category &quot; major depression &quot; is so heterogeneous as to be outright unhelpful when trying to decide on a therapeutic plan for an individual patient . 
Of course , the level of severity of depression is obviously relevant , but few treatment studies use this criterion . 
Melancholia , a depressive subtype with more biological abnormalities , should be another candidate for treatment studies , yet few have been undertaken . 
Pharmaceutical companies sponsor most drug treatment studies , with the primary purpose being to secure the licenses required to market their products . 
To increase the speed of the process , patients are recruited by advertising and many trials are subcontracted to specialist trial companies with little or no interest in the long-term welfare of patients . 
In many trials , companies are paid per patient recruited , regardless if a patient remains in the trial or not . 
Unsurprisingly , dropout rates are high , often more than 50 % after six weeks . 
Failed studies - meaning studies that do not demonstrate significant differences between an active drug and a placebo - are common . 
This obviously is contrary to the interest of the funding company , but so far it has not resulted in substantial changes in the way trials are done . 
Because pharmaceutical companies want their drug to work , they are rarely interested in studying what to do if it is ineffective . 
That is true even when we know that only two-thirds of patients respond to a drug , and that significantly fewer get completely well . 
So clinicians are faced daily with questions about which drug to administer , but the base of empirical evidence for this decision is appallingly thin . 
Several large government-funded trials are ongoing , and it is hoped that these will improve the scientific basis for decision-making within the next few years . 
Another major area of ignorance concerns the extent to which results generated in specialized mental health settings can be transferred to primary care , where the majority of patients with depression are treated . 
The uncertainties are not so much about treatments , because patients with similar levels of severity should respond in rather similar ways regardless of the treatment setting . 
A much more important uncertainty is whether the chronic course of major depression treated in psychiatry is similar in primary care . 
If so , many more patients should probably be recommended to receive long-term treatment with antidepressants . 
Moreover , the huge problem with compliance , similar for all prophylactic treatments in medicine , must be addressed . 
Finally , has the enormous increase in prescriptions of anti-depressive drugs , and the greater availability of short-term psychotherapies , self-help manuals , and Internet support , had any positive impact on health ? 
Here , too , the data are contradictory or preliminary , with some indicating a decrease in suicide accompanying the increase in use of antidepressants . 
But this does not hold true in all countries or all age groups , so other factors must be influential , too . 
A more revealing-and distressing-indicator is that sick leave and disability pensions due to depression are on the rise in many Western countries . 
Moreover , the first depressive episode occurs in ever-younger children or adolescents , implying that research on primary or secondary prevention should receive higher priority . 
On the level of the wider population , the battle against depression has not been won . 
But there is good news : for individual patients with depression , the possibility of getting completely well is high , assuming that effective treatments are used in a skillful and persistent way .
