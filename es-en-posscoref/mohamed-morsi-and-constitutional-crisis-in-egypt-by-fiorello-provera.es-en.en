Egypt &apos;s Monster in the Making 
BRUSSELS - On December 15 , Egypt &apos;s draft constitution is due to be put to a referendum . 
A year ago , Egyptians were thrilled to know that finally their country &apos;s constitution would reflect their democratic hopes and aspirations . 
Yet the document that they will now vote on is more likely to dash those hopes and dim Egyptians &quot; prospects for democracy . 
The constitutional drafting process was rushed , without the input of liberals , non-Muslims , and women , all of whom boycotted the process , owing to the preponderance of Islamists . 
The Muslim Brotherhood , and primarily President Mohamed Morsi , is banking on the assumption that the strength of Egypt &apos;s Islamist vote will earn him enough support among &quot; regular Egyptians , &quot; and that the opposition will have little impact on the referendum &apos;s outcome . 
One political adviser for the ruling Freedom and Justice Party - the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s political wing - even boasted that the Brothers could easily mobilize 20 million supporters . 
The Brothers dismiss those who have demonstrated in the streets during the past three weeks as Mubarak sympathizers . 
Morsi &apos;s decision on November 22 to grant himself absolute authority for the spurious purpose of defending the revolution is not new for Egypt . 
A succession of dictator-presidents ruled the country under a state of emergency for more than 40 years . 
While Morsi has now bowed to pressure to annul a decree granting him powers without judicial oversight , it seems only yesterday that people were prepared to put their fears aside and trust that Morsi was ready to rule in the interests of all Egyptians . 
Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy notes that Morsi &apos;s previous role in the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s Guidance Council sheds some light on the motives behind his current behavior . 
In the past , Morsi advocated a platform that excluded Christians from political life and granted Islamic scholars oversight authority to ensure that all legislation complied with Sharia law . 
He also worked to expunge young members of the Freedom and Justice Party that he deemed to hold dissenting views . 
While the draft constitution does contain positive provisions , many are causing concern . 
For example , Article 11 authorizes the state to &quot; safeguard ethics , public morality , and public order , and foster a high level of education and of religious and patriotic values . &quot; 
This leaves plenty of room for interpretation by the government . 
In addition , the mosque of al-Azhar is promised an advisory role in Islamic legislation . 
The Brothers &quot; political opponents have not been silent . 
On December 8 , the National Salvation Front announced that the draft &quot; does not represent the Egyptian people . &quot; 
Moreover , ordinary Egyptians have responded viscerally and swiftly to Morsi &apos;s moves , perhaps more so than he had anticipated . 
Strikes were called , newspapers halted publication , and fears of widespread insurrection remain high . 
Hundreds have been injured in street clashes in Cairo . 
The president &apos;s supporters have declared that &quot; defending Morsi is defending Islam . &quot; 
Today , Morsi seems as besieged as Syria &apos;s President Bashar al-Assad . 
The military has barricaded the presidential palace and , until the results of the referendum are announced , they are under orders to protect Egypt &apos;s state institutions . 
Outside the Middle East , the United States has scaled back its relations with Egypt since the government &apos;s weak response to the attack on the US embassy in September , which signaled a rapid deterioration in bilateral relations . 
America &apos;s main priority now is to ensure that the peace treaty with Israel is maintained . 
The European Union cannot afford to engage in wishful thinking when it comes to Morsi &apos;s ambitions and the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s agenda . 
The EU &apos;s &quot; more for more &quot; policy has made human rights a cornerstone of its foreign policy toward states in the Union &apos;s neighborhood . 
And , though Morsi &apos;s recent role in mediating discussions between Hamas and the Israeli government was invaluable in preventing a serious regional conflict , his government &apos;s actions are undermining prospects for further cooperation with Europe . 
No matter how Morsi attempts to sideline his domestic opponents , Egypt is in no shape to ignore the rest of the world . 
It lacks a stable economy , relying heavily on tourism and imports to feed the country &apos;s more than 80 million people . 
Power cuts and public-service strikes are a regular feature of daily life . 
Egypt &apos;s government needs to secure consistent foreign financing to keep the country afloat , providing leverage for international opposition to Morsi &apos;s efforts to impose an agenda that runs contrary to Egyptians &quot; fundamental rights . 
Egypt can thrive only on the basis of honest adherence to a democratic process . 
The current constitutional crisis has caused many to wonder how Egypt will face future political tests . 
The referendum &apos;s outcome will prove an important guide regarding the direction the country is likely to take . 
Will it embrace a new Islamic authoritarianism , or build the democracy that Egyptians have risked their lives to secure ?
