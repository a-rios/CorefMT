Short-Term Talk , Long-Term Cost 
CAMBRIDGE - The idea that financial markets are too focused on the short term is gaining ground in the media and among academics . 
Investors &quot; obsession with short-term returns , according to the new conventional wisdom , compels corporate boards of directors and managers to seek impressive quarterly earnings at the expense of strong long-term investments . 
Research and development suffers , as does long-term investment in plant and equipment . 
Similarly , short-term thinking leads major companies to buy back their stock , thereby sapping them of the cash they need for future investments . 
None of this is good news for the economy - at least , it wouldn &apos;t be , if it were real . 
Upon closer inspection , the supposed negative consequences of investor short-termism appear not to be happening at all . 
While institutional investors do trade stock regularly , and sometimes rapidly , financial firms like Fidelity Investments , Vanguard , and other mutual funds have maintained 12-15-month holding periods for stocks for decades . 
Moreover , while much has been made of a new fringe of program traders that moves in and out of stocks in nanoseconds , the belief that this rapid computer-driven trading makes it impossible - or even difficult - for corporate managers to adopt a long-term perspective is not supported by the facts . 
In the US , neither R &amp; D nor overall investment is declining . 
Indeed , many industries pursue long-term investments , notwithstanding their short-term stockholders . 
For example , pharmaceutical companies cannot develop new products on a quarterly basis ; they must operate with multi-year time horizons . 
The oil industry cannot open and close oil fields on a quarterly basis ; companies must spend a decade or more investing in developing new fields . 
And remaining on the cutting edge of innovation demands that tech giants like Apple , Intel , Amazon , and Google continue to play the long game . 
If these industries and companies can take a long-term view , what is stopping other firms from doing so ? 
Of course , it is true that these industries and companies do not always serve the economy faithfully and well . 
Excessive program trading is a poor use of resources , but it rarely undermines effective management for a simple reason : the investors who trade only trade ; they do not participate in corporate governance , and sometimes they do not even vote for directors . 
Critics might point out that managerial compensation is typically tied to the company &apos;s stock price , meaning that short-term trading could affect managers &quot; remuneration . 
But if this is true , it does not have to be ; boards can , and sometimes do , choose to tie managers &quot; compensation to longer-range , rather than current , stock performance . 
Moreover , &quot; short term &quot; need not connote something pernicious . 
It can mean flexibility and adaptability . 
Actions that are criticized as &quot; short-term thinking &quot; may , in some cases , be steps toward abandoning old businesses and failed solutions , helping the company adjust to a changing economy . 
The video rental chain Blockbuster was not thinking short-term when , seeing the rise of Netflix &apos;s DVD mailers and streaming video , it decided to close its brick-and-mortar stores . 
Concerns that stock buybacks are draining healthy , promising companies of cash needed for investment and research are similarly misplaced . 
True , buybacks can undermine a particular firm &apos;s ability to invest in its own future , causing incumbent employees and managers to lose out . 
Indeed , the cash should leave old-line firms with weak futures and end up where it can be deployed more effectively , benefiting the economy as a whole . 
Excoriating short-termism resonates widely , because it justifies protecting those with a stake in the status quo - including blue-collar workers with high wages , well-paid CEOs and senior managers , and directors with prestigious positions - from rapid change . 
For those who are doing well , change can be uncomfortable . 
Yet few are willing consciously or explicitly to oppose change for pure self-interest ( and those who do are unlikely to be successful ) . 
Better that they embrace loftier rationales , one of which is the supposed danger of &quot; short-termism . &quot; 
It is probably not a coincidence that similar rhetoric has long been prominent in business and political discourse in Western Europe , where incumbent employees and firms enjoy greater protection than in the US .
