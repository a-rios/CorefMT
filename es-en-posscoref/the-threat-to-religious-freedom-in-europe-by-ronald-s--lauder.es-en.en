Europe &apos;s New Jewish Question 
NEW YORK - In March 1936 , Poland &apos;s Sejm ( the lower house of parliament ) almost succeeded in outlawing shechita ( slaughter according to Jewish law ) . 
Only the Polish Constitution prevented an outright ban . 
Had the majority of legislators gotten their way , many of Poland &apos;s 3.2 million Jews would have gone meatless . 
A few days ago , the ghosts of the past returned to the Sejm , when deputies rejected a government bill intended to keep religious slaughter legal . 
Even many of the bill &apos;s supporters ( including Prime Minister Donald Tusk ) were concerned not with defending the rights of religious minorities , but rather with protecting meatpacking jobs . 
The vote was an assault on freedom of religion that flies in the face of Article 53 of the Polish Constitution , which states that &quot; Freedom of conscience and religion shall be ensured to everyone &quot; and specifies that the &quot; performing of rites &quot; is protected . 
It was also a slap in the face for Poland &apos;s Jewish community , which has been part of the country &apos;s social landscape for more than a thousand years , and which , despite the Holocaust , has witnessed a remarkable renaissance over the past two decades . 
Indeed , Poland , with its rich Jewish heritage and history , was believed to be among the most fertile environments for a Jewish revival after the fall of communism . 
Yet the Sejm &apos;s decision raises the question : Do Poles really want Jewish life to return to their country ? 
Or do they see Poland &apos;s Jewish legacy only as something that benefits their tourism and food industries ? 
Not every Jew keeps kosher , and some are vegetarians . 
Hence , not every Jew relies on kosher meat . 
Shechita is an indispensable , non-negotiable part of Jewish religious life . 
Today , Poland &apos;s Jewish population numbers only a few thousand . 
Everyone knows why . 
That , of course , makes it easier for today &apos;s politicians to ban shechita . 
The civil rights of small religious minorities do not matter much politically ; the perceived rights of animals ( and economic motivations ) do . 
But was this decision really motivated by concern for animal welfare ? 
For some deputies , it undoubtedly was ; but others discovered their love of animals only when it seemed popular to do so . 
As The Economist noted succinctly , &quot; Poland is not a country hitherto known for championing animal rights . &quot; 
Indeed , it is hypocritical that hunting for sport and unsupervised home slaughtering continue to be permitted , whereas shechita , which is carried out by experienced people according to well-established procedures , is not . 
In recent months , Polish politicians became agitated about &quot; ritual slaughter . &quot; 
Granted , the term sounds archaic ; but the Torah is the first systematic legislation that forbids cruelty to animals and mandates that they be treated with consideration and respect . 
Those who argue that ritual slaughter is &quot; foreign &quot; to Polish culture not only know nothing about their country &apos;s history ; they also exploit and reinforce anti-Semitic sentiment . 
Poland is not the only place where established religious practices are being questioned . 
In other Western countries , such as Germany , France , the Netherlands , and New Zealand , heated debates about religious slaughter and circumcision have taken place recently . 
A year ago , a German judge ruled that religious circumcision was a cruel practice that inflicted bodily harm on boys and was therefore illegal - a view supported by many commentators in the media . 
But German politicians strove to find a solution that accommodated the concerns of the Jewish and Muslim minorities . 
They demonstrated real leadership . 
Within weeks , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government proposed legislation that put religious circumcision on a solid legal basis , with the support of most members of the Bundestag . 
In the Netherlands , a covenant was signed that allowed religious slaughter . 
It received the backing of the legislature , which had previously favored a ban . 
Likewise , in Poland , following a Constitutional Court ruling in November 2012 that struck down on technical grounds a provision permitting religious slaughter , the government promised that the practice would remain legal . 
Yet when legislators voted on the government &apos;s bill earlier this month , following a sometimes-hysterical debate on ritual slaughter in the media , three dozen deputies from Tusk &apos;s Civic Platform , the largest faction in the Sejm , opposed it . 
By taking this step , Poland has become the ringleader for those in Europe who want to deny Jewish citizens the right to practice their religion freely . 
If not halted , such measures could call into question the Jewish presence on the Continent in the longer term . 
Yet Tusk has ruled out a reversal of the ban , and one of his ministers asked the Jewish and Muslim communities to challenge it before the Constitutional Court . 
The relationship between Central and Eastern European countries and the Jewish people has always been characterized by both triumph and tragedy . 
In recent years , it has been strengthening , especially in Poland . 
Encouraging developments have taken place , such as the construction of a new state-of-the-art Jewish Museum in Warsaw . 
A few months ago , I participated in the March of the Living at Auschwitz . 
As usual , it was a bittersweet experience . 
For my part , and for many years now , I have tried to highlight the sweet . 
But now I am left wondering : Can the Jewish renaissance in the heart of Europe continue if essential elements of Jewish life are declared illegal ? 
Or will Europe &apos;s leaders stand up for the civil rights of their Jewish compatriots ? 
As Pinchas Goldschmidt , President of the Conference of European Rabbis , recently remarked , one cannot be proud of the Jews of yesterday and tell the Jews of today that their religious practices are no longer welcome . 
The Jewish heritage is part of Europe &apos;s heritage . 
It should be protected , not restricted .
