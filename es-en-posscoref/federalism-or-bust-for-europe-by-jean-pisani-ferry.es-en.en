Federalism or Bust for Europe ? 
BRUSSELS - August was quieter than feared on the European bond markets . 
Is the eurozone sleepwalking into becoming a United States of Europe ? 
Is it exploring uncharted territory ? 
Or are its constituent nation-states drifting apart ? 
To answer these questions , the best starting point is the US . 
The model of a federal union that emerged from its history consists of a single currency managed by a federal agency ; closely integrated markets for products , labor , and capital ; a federal budget that partly , but automatically , offsets economic disturbances affecting individual states ; a federal government that assumes responsibility for tackling other major risks , not least those emanating from the banking sector ; and states that provide regional public goods but play virtually no role in macroeconomic stabilization . 
This model served as a template for the European Union &apos;s architects , notably for the creation of a unified market and a common currency . 
But , in several respects , Europe has diverged significantly from the American model . 
First and foremost , Europe has not established a federal budget . 
Back in the 1970 &quot; s , there was still hope that common spending would eventually amount to 5-10 % of EU GDP , but this dream never materialized . 
The EU &apos;s budget today is no larger than it was 30 years ago : a meager 1 % of GDP . 
Unlike in the US , where federal public spending grew as a consequence of the creation of new expenditure programs throughout the twentieth century , public spending was already high at the national level when Europe began to integrate . 
Significant federal spending programs could have emerged only from the transfer of existing national programs to the European level . 
More recently , the eurozone has begun to create a system of mutual insurance among member states . 
Since 2010 , assistance has been extended to Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and now Cyprus . 
Spain may soon follow suit , with a particular focus on support for its banking sector . 
So a specific pattern is emerging : states help each other . 
But solidarity is not free . 
Moreover , assistance requires that beneficiaries implement negotiated measures and accept close external monitoring of policy developments . 
In other words , the price of solidarity is limited sovereignty . 
Unlike in America , however , EU member states &quot; governments - and , increasingly , their parliaments - are calling the shots . 
Because assistance does not rest on federal resources , but rather on the pooling of national resources , creditor states inevitably demand more power in exchange for providing more support to their neighbors . 
As a result , currency unification has not brought Europe closer to the US ; on the contrary , it has pushed Europe further away . 
In the US , the federal government acts as an overall shield against common risks and provides automatic , unconditional support to states in trouble ; but , in the end , it does not come to the rescue of a defaulting state , nor does it take over its government . 
In Europe , by contrast , there is almost no aggregate shield and almost no automatic support for member states in trouble - better-off states simply extend a conditional helping hand to prevent default . 
So , while US states compete with the center for power , in Europe they increasingly compete with each other . 
This inter-state rivalry - at times bordering on acrimony - is what makes the politics of European integration difficult . 
All federations have experienced periods of tense relations between the federal and state governments . 
But to accept that your neighbors look over your shoulder and tell you what to do is one degree more dreadful than to accept oversight from the center . 
Indeed , a major problem with the current state of affairs is the weakness of EU institutions that are in charge of advancing the common interest and that are accountable to Europeans as a whole . 
Common European direction cannot emerge from the calculus of national interests by governments and parliaments that are accountable only to national voters . 
The big question to which nobody has a clear answer is whether Europe is in the process of inventing a model of its own , or has only taken a detour from the inevitable choice between disaggregation and convergence on the standard federal template . 
One solution could be to provide national representatives a venue to convene for European-wide debates . 
Another would be to transfer the insurance role to a federal institution accountable to the European parliament . 
Whatever route it takes , Europe in the coming years will have to address the weak representation of the common interest - or else admit that no such common interest can justify remaining on the path of integration .
