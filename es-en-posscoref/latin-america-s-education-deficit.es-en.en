Latin America &apos;s Education Deficit 
China &apos;s decision to end its decade-old policy of pegging the Yuan to the dollar has been greeted in Latin America with enthusiasm and optimism . 
It is argued across the continent that a more flexible exchange rate for the Yuan will reduce China &apos;s unfair advantage in international markets . 
This , we are told , will make Latin America &apos;s exports of manufactured goods more competitive internationally . 
But this optimism is misplaced . 
Despite the announced reforms , it is unlikely that there will be any significant exchange-rate flexibility in China &apos;s currency . 
Indeed , China &apos;s rulers have already stated that the new exchange-rate system will aim at maintaining currency stability . 
Its policy is tailored after that of Singapore , which has avoided large currency fluctuations - and has maintained a significantly more competitive exchange rate during the last three years than all of Latin America &apos;s countries . 
This means that in order to compete successfully with China , Latin American countries will need to increase productivity growth . 
Unfortunately , the continent is not well positioned for these challenges . 
The main problem is the extremely low quality of the region &apos;s educational system . 
According to several international educational studies conducted in recent years , Latin American countries rank at the bottom , particularly in mathematics and science . 
For example , tests administered by the OECD in 2003 found that Brazilian students ranked last in mathematics among 40 countries . 
In the same tests , Mexico was in 37th place , while Uruguay , the highest-ranked Latin American country , came in 35th . 
Latin American students performed especially poorly on the &quot; problem solving &quot; part of these tests . 
This reflects the old-fashioned nature of the region &apos;s educational systems , which still emphasize memorization and rote learning . 
Sadly , results are not much better in reading ability ; again , the Latin American nations were at the bottom of the 40-country sample . 
Similarly , according to the prestigious Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) , in 2003 Chile &apos;s eighth graders ranked 39th out of 44 countries in mathematics ; in science they did only slightly better , ranking 37th . 
Interestingly , many countries that performed better than Chile on these standardized tests have a lower income per capita . 
Latin America &apos;s educational performance is equally weak at the university level . 
According to a 2004 survey by The Times of London , not a single Latin American university is ranked among the top 200 in the world . 
This contrasts sharply with China and India , both of which have several world-class universities , especially in science and engineering . 
Thailand , Turkey , and Singapore also have first-rate universities in the sciences , including biotechnology . 
If Latin America is to succeed and move towards prosperity , it needs to reform its educational system . 
A sustainable economic growth rate that helps reduce poverty and inequality can be achieved only with a skilled and innovative labor force . 
Reforms must aim at making grade school and high school teachers accountable . 
In addition , paying teachers according to performance must become the norm , while ineffective teachers should be dismissed . 
Moreover , competitive funding for research at the university level must be increased substantially . 
Implementing these reforms will require political courage and vision . 
In particular , politicians need to be willing to confront teachers &quot; unions , which have traditionally resisted reforms that introduce competition and accountability .
