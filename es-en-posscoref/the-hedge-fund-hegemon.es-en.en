The Hedge Fund Hegemon 
The recent volatility in global capital markets should give pause to those who say German leaders , who have been arguing for greater transparency in global hedge funds , are just sore losers US and UK policymakers , in particular , say the German whining is nonsense , and that hedge funds , along with other new age financial entities such as private equity firms are key innovators in today &apos;s , global economy . 
This debate is at the cutting edge of today &apos;s globalization , yet it is clouded by a healthy dose of national self-interest . 
With New York and London the centers of global finance , the United States and Britain have enormous profits at stake . 
So it is convenient for them to downplay the likelihood that risks to the world &apos;s financial system will be spread more evenly than the benefits . 
German leaders , by contrast , must reckon with a populace that is deeply resistant to rapid change , particularly when it involves job cuts . 
Many German workers believe , as one trade unionist recently lamented , that takeovers are being driven by a philosophy of &quot; buy it , strip it , and flip it . &quot; 
To be sure , the profits currently being earned by the leading financial firms are dizzyingly high . 
Goldman Sachs , the venerable Wall Street firm at the epicenter of financial globalization , paid more than $ 16 billion dollars in compensation to its 25,000 employees in 2006 , and spun out another $ 9 billion for its shareholders - a total that is greater than the annual income of most African countries . 
The spectacular profits on Wall Street and elsewhere in the financial industry also have a huge macroeconomic impact . 
The US is running an $ 800 billion annual trade deficit in traditional goods and services . 
Yet , because Americans consistently earn a higher return on their investments abroad than foreigners earn on their US investments , US debt is rising at perhaps only half the rate that it might otherwise . 
Even we economists who believe that global financial innovation yields huge net benefits must admit that today &apos;s hedge fund boom is becoming like the tech bubble . 
My own recent experience is perhaps emblematic . 
An &quot; Eddie &quot; in Los Angeles sent me an email asking if I wanted to serve on the advisory board to his new hedge fund . 
Eddie &apos;s accompanying flattery aside , I would normally trash such a letter , figuring it was a fraud or scam of some kind . 
However , my curiosity was piqued when I noticed a missing attachment outlining the firm &apos;s planned investment strategy . 
I shot a line back , requesting the missing attachment . 
I should have stifled myself : Eddie , figuring he had a live one , sent the missing attachment with a note saying &quot; We are so glad someone of your stature might be interested and , by the way , if you have any friends or colleagues who might be interested , could you please forward this email to them also ? &quot; 
The point is that in today &apos;s go-go ultra-high liquidity environment , Eddie was probably successful in raising money with similar techniques . 
Of course , roughly 1,000 of the world &apos;s 9,000 hedge funds went out of business last year . 
The big question is whether this Wild West mentality poses broader risks to the global financial system , particularly given circumstances where a large number of firms are all collectively making the same bet . 
If they lose , a long string of bankruptcies can cut deeply into banking systems that had generated huge profits by lending to these same hedge funds . 
At the moment , the most glaring weakness is the so-called &quot; yen carry trade . &quot; 
Hedge funds have borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars at ultra-low interest rate in Japan , and invested the proceeds in countries like Brazil and Turkey , where interest rates are high . 
As long as the yen remains weak , this investment strategy will be a money machine . 
But if the yen appreciates sharply , as it easily could given Japan &apos;s huge current account surplus , some hedge funds will suffer huge capital losses and the yen carry trade will implode . 
And , while today &apos;s main risk is the yen , in a couple months it could be something completely different . 
So pressure outside the US and Britain to put the hedge fund industry on a tighter regulatory leash is hardly surprising . 
The Germans , for example , want to reduce risk by forcing hedge funds to adhere to stricter reporting requirements . 
The funds respond to such proposals by arguing that if they are required to reveal their investment strategies , they will lose their incentive to innovate , and a recent US government report - a multi-agency effort headed by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ( formerly of Goldman Sachs ) - supports that position . 
Greater regulation would be a mistake , the report argues , because the global economy &apos;s best defense against systemic risk is the exercise of common sense and &quot; due diligence &quot; by each and every person who invests or interacts with hedge funds . 
In other words , the US is telling investors to carry their own guns , because , as in the Wild West , there might not be a sheriff around to help . 
But frankly , as we are reminded by recent events , it is hard to see how at least a small increase in transparency can hurt . 
The Germans , in chairing the G8 this year , should not surrender on this issue . 
No country wants to put itself at the mercy of the likes of Eddie .
