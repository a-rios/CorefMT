Stage Three for the Euro Crisis ? 
BERKELEY - The first two components of the euro crisis - a banking crisis that resulted from excessive leverage in both the public and private sectors , followed by a sharp fall in confidence in eurozone governments - have been addressed successfully , or at least partly so . 
But that leaves the third , longest-term , and most dangerous factor underlying the crisis : the structural imbalance between the eurozone &apos;s north and south . 
First , the good news : The fear that Europe &apos;s banks could collapse , with panicked investors &quot; flight to safety producing a European Great Depression , now seems to have passed . 
Likewise , the fear , fueled entirely by the European Union &apos;s dysfunctional politics , that eurozone governments might default - thereby causing the same dire consequences - has begun to dissipate . 
Whether Europe would avoid a deep depression hinged on whether it dealt properly with these two aspects of the crisis . 
But whether Europe as a whole avoids lost decades of economic growth still hangs in the balance , and depends on whether southern European governments can rapidly restore competitiveness . 
The process by which southern Europe became uncompetitive in the first place was driven by market price signals - by the incentives those signals created for entrepreneurs , and by how entrepreneurs &quot; individually rational responses played out in macroeconomic terms . 
Northern Europeans with money to invest were willing to lend on extraordinarily easy terms to those in the south who wanted to spend , and ample pre-2007 spending made employers there willing to raise wages rapidly . 
As a result , southern Europe adopted an economic configuration in which its wage , price , and productivity levels made sense only so long as it spent € 13 for every € 12 that it earned , with northern Europe financing the missing euro . 
Northern Europe , meanwhile , adopted wage and productivity levels that made sense only as long as it spent less than one euro for every euro that it earned . 
Now , if , as appears to be the case , Europe does not want its south to spend more than it earns and its north to spend less , wages , prices , and productivity must shift . 
If we are not to look back in a generation and bemoan &quot; lost &quot; decades , southern European productivity levels need to rise relative to the north , and wage and price levels need to fall by roughly 30 % , so that the south can pay its way with exports and northern Europe can spend its earnings on those products . 
If the euro is to be preserved , and if stagnation is to be avoided , five policy measures could be attempted : 
· Northern Europe could tolerate higher inflation - an extra two percentage points for five years would take care of one-third of the total north-south adjustment ; 
· Northern Europe could expand social democracy by making its welfare states more lavish ; 
· Southern Europe could shrink its taxes and social services substantially ; 
· Southern Europe could reconfigure its enterprises to become engines of productivity ; 
· Southern Europe could enforce deflation . 
The fifth option is perhaps the least wise , for it implies the lost decades and EU collapse that Europe is trying to avoid . 
The fourth option would be wonderful ; but , if anyone knew how to bring southern Europe &apos;s enterprises up to the productivity levels of the north , it would have happened already . 
So we are left with a combination of the first three options , also known as &quot; policies to restore European growth &quot; - a phrase that appears in every international communiqué . 
But the communiqués never get more specific . Europe &apos;s technocrats understand what adoption of &quot; policies to restore European growth &quot; means . 
So do some of Europe &apos;s politicians . 
But if Europe does not adopt some combination of the first three options as policy goals over the next five years , it will face a stark choice : either lost decades for southern Europe ( and perhaps northern Europe as well ) , or continued north-south payment imbalances that will have to be financed through fiscal transfers - that is , by taxing the north . 
Northern Europe &apos;s politicians should become more explicit about what &quot; policies to restore European growth &quot; actually mean . 
Otherwise , ten years from now , they will be forced to confess that today &apos;s dithering imposed enormous additional tax liabilities on northern Europe . 
That might turn out to be the ultimate career bummer .
