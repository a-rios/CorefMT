Of Banks and Bailouts 
PALO ALTO - Early signs of a manufacturing rebound , already strong in Asia , lend hope for some modest recovery from today &apos;s deep global recession . 
But a strong and durable economic expansion is unlikely until progress is made in dealing with the toxic assets poisoning the balance sheets of financial institutions and bedeviling policymakers almost everywhere . 
The financial system is a complex interaction of lenders and borrowers , buyers and sellers , and savers and investors . 
When it functions well , it balances risk and reward , and innovation and safety . 
Banks and other financial firms borrow short - increasingly in recent years from the commercial securities market , not deposits - and lend long at higher interest rates , taking on both credit risk ( of default ) and interest-rate risk . 
Increasing leverage boosts returns on the upside but is very risky on the downside . 
No surprise , then , that the large financial firms that failed - Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , AIG , and Lehman Brothers - had the highest leverage , in the range of 30 or 40 times their capital . 
From 2002-2007 , trillions of dollars were loaned for sub-prime and prime mortgages , autos , credit cards , commercial real estate , private equity , and more , on the assumption by ( most ) borrowers and lenders that strong global growth , rising home prices and cheap , readily available short-term credit would continue for the foreseeable future . 
Once the music stopped , the assets plunged in value . 
The complexity of securitized pools of loans that were sold worldwide - bilaterally over the counter - as pieces of various tranches , meant that nobody was certain about who owned what or what it was worth . 
This difficulty in valuing the now so-called toxic assets remains at the core of today &apos;s credit difficulties . 
The immense response by central banks and finance ministries has eased the strain . 
The United States Federal Reserve &apos;s commercial paper facility was helpful in reopening the commercial paper market ( although other of its facilities have been less successful ) . 
The barometer of stress watched most closely by experts , the LIBOR-OIS ( Overnight Indexed Swap ) spread is down substantially from its stratospheric crisis levels . 
Some government programs are shrinking from lack of demand . 
The original idea for the US government to buy up ( some of the ) toxic assets with the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) gave way to capital infusions ( and auto bailouts ) . 
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner &apos;s new public-private investment program to buy toxic assets has few takers , despite subsidized non-recourse financing . So the toxic assets remain on bank ( and other ) balance sheets . 
Can banks generate enough profits for long enough to buy time to write down smaller losses and raise private capital later in a stronger economy ? 
Or are the losses so large -and in danger of mounting further as others ( such as commercial real estate ) are added - that a gradual workout is unlikely , if not impossible ? 
Estimates of the losses on US loans and securities range from under $ 1 trillion to almost $ 4 trillion . 
The IMF puts them at $ 2.7 trillion , but the range of uncertainty is enormous . More than half is held by banks and broker-dealers . 
And analogous problems exist in Western Europe ( e.g. , for loans to Eastern Europe ) and Asia . 
Gradualism and profitability , and eventually US Brady bonds , worked in the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980 &quot; s . 
But a difficult economy will drive down the value of toxic assets and make more assets toxic . 
For example , falling home prices put more families in negative equity - mortgages worth more than the home . 
This creates an incentive to default , which increases foreclosures and lowers the value of the mortgage-backed securities on financial firms &quot; books . 
Policymakers need a Plan B in the event that one proves necessary , modeled on America &apos;s rapid resolution of insolvent savings and loans in the early 1990s , together with sales of toxic assets in large blocks ( to prevent so-called adverse selection from unraveling any bidding process ) . 
History is instructive . 
Of the $ 500 billion that America required for the Resolution Trust Corporation ( equivalent to $ 1 Â¼ trillion today ) , $ 400 billion was returned from asset sales , for a net cost of $ 100 billion , one-tenth the worst-case private forecasts of $ 1 trillion . 
The final tab on the toxic mortgage bailout and other assets is likely to be a larger percentage of a larger amount , but still far less than the face value of the loans , because the underlying assets will in many cases retain considerable value . 
In addition to bailouts and toxic asset plans , governments worldwide want central banks to monitor macroeconomic and overall financial-sector risk ( as opposed to focusing on individual firms ) . 
Barack Obama &apos;s administration would anoint the Fed , whose history has been to recognize crises late . 
The Bank of England seeks similar powers . 
The European Union wants to establish a European Systemic Risk Board composed of the national central bank governors , chaired by the European Central Bank . 
What will these central bankers do to advise on macro-prudential risk ? 
Demand adjustments in large current-account imbalances ? 
Call for reductions in taxes , spending , and government debt , which are the primary systemic risks ? 
To do that could jeopardize monetary policy independence and heighten the threat of future inflation . 
Dealing with financial institutions deemed too big to fail won &apos;t be easy . 
The current system , which allows privatized gains from highly leveraged risk-taking but socializes losses in the event of failure , must be changed to avoid episodic financial meltdowns . 
To balance the benefits of scale and scope with the socialized losses to taxpayers , firms deemed too big to fail should be required to have more capital , and the amount should rise disproportionately with size . 
Converting some portion of debt to equity under predetermined solvency-threatening conditions would provide an extra layer of protection . 
Add a higher bar for government bailouts , and these stronger incentives would induce private financial institutions and investors to take responsibility before disaster strikes .
