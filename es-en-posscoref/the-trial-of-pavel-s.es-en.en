The Trial of Pavel S. 
STRASBOURG - On a cold winter day in 2004 , a young Russian named Pavel Shtukaturov discovered that a judge had stripped him of the right to speak for himself . 
Deprived of legal capacity , he was prohibited from acting independently , or at all , in most areas of life . 
He was no longer able to work , travel , choose his place of residence , buy or sell property , or even marry . 
The judge took away these rights without even informing him - indeed , Pavel only found out a year later . 
When he sought a lawyer to defend his rights , his mother , who had been made his legal guardian , had him locked up in a psychiatric hospital for seven months . 
This Kafkaesque turn of events was possible because Pavel has mental health issues in a system that refuses to protect his rights . 
In Russia , roughly 125,000 people with mental disabilities are confined to institutions - for life . 
There are another 165,000 beds in psychiatric hospitals , with some 650,000 hospitalizations per year . 
But these statistics don &apos;t tell the real story . 
Only rarely do stories like Shtukaturov &apos;s get out . 
It is astonishing how little is known about the treatment of people with mental health problems in Russia . 
There are no independent inspectorates monitoring these hospitals to protect patients &quot; rights , and there are no advocacy services on behalf of people with mental disabilities . 
Moreover , the minds of many hospital directors are as firmly closed as the institutions themselves . 
So Shtukaturov &apos;s victory before the European Court of Human Rights on March 27 provides hope that a turning point has been reached . 
Back in 2004 , when Shtukaturov by chance discovered the judge &apos;s decision , he Googled his way to the only lawyer in Russia who deals with mental health and human rights . 
The lawyer agreed to represent him . 
But when he was subsequently detained in a psychiatric hospital , the Russian government refused to allow the lawyer access to his client . 
Appeals in the Russian courts failed , and he filed a case with the ECHR in March 2006 . 
The court found that Pavel &apos;s ordeal violated several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , to which Russia is a signatory . 
This is the first case in which the ECHR has dealt seriously with the deprivation of legal capacity - which often facilitates abuses instead of protecting people from them . 
According to the court , depriving someone of legal capacity constitutes a &quot; very serious &quot; interference of a person &apos;s right to private life . 
In Russia , the only legal option in these cases is &quot; total guardianship , &quot; which is applied indefinitely and cannot be challenged by the adult in question . 
The court ruled that total guardianship was a &quot; disproportionate &quot; response in Shtukaturov &apos;s case , and its judgment recognized the importance of supplying tailor-made alternatives for people who require temporary or long-term care . 
Russian lawmakers should follow the lead of the ECHR decision and work to create in Russian law and practice alternative mechanisms such as advance directives , powers of attorney , and supported decision-making . 
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - a new human rights treaty that Russia helped draft , but has not yet signed - mandates these alternatives , and represents an opportunity for Russia to undertake crucial human rights reforms on this issue . 
Shtukaturov &apos;s story is unique only because he was able to find his way to a lawyer . 
The ECHR has now cleared a path for the tens of thousands of other people in Russia who suffer abuse at the hands of the very mental health system that is supposed to help them . 
On taking office , Russia &apos;s new president , Dmitry Medvedev , should order an independent review process to help end the country &apos;s pattern of stigmatizing and discriminating against people with disabilities .
