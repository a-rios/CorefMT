America &apos;s Arab Comeback 
AMMAN - Without much fanfare , the past few months have seen no anti-American demonstrations and no burning of American flags across the Arab world . 
Arabs seem increasingly willing to accept - and even applaud - the Obama administration &apos;s policy toward the region . 
Of course , Arabs are still unhappy with the United States &quot; continued bias towards Israel . 
Its inability to end the 44-year military occupation of Palestinian lands has not gone unnoticed . 
Arabs , especially young Arabs , who comprise the majority of the region &apos;s population , look up to America for its global power when it upholds democratic morals and values . 
There is high respect for the concept of rule of , by , and for the people , as well as for the US Constitution &apos;s guarantee of freedom of expression . 
It is precisely the failure to apply these values in areas such as Palestine or Iraq that has made - and can still make - countless Arabs vehemently anti-American . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s election two years ago positively shocked Arabs and empowered Arab democrats , who saw it as proof of America &apos;s true democratic nature . 
Obama &apos;s Cairo speech , delivered on one of his first foreign trips , promised a new US-Arab beginning , and certainly invigorated Arab democrats . 
But the first test of Obama &apos;s foreign leadership disappointed many Arabs . 
A US veto of a Security Council resolution - supported by the Council &apos;s 14 other members - to oppose Israeli settlements seemed to signal that Obama had crumbled under pressure from America &apos;s pro-Israel lobby . 
The US had not revised its policy , even with an African immigrant &apos;s son living in the White House . 
A more positive view of Obama emerged when the Arab revolts began in Tunisia and Egypt -countries with pro-US regimes . 
While the US initially demonstrated prudence in word and deed , it quickly understood that the revolts truly reflected the will of the people and acted to align itself with the democratic cause . 
The same people that Obama had called on in his Cairo speech to seek democracy had now formed the most important nonviolent movement the world had seen in decades . 
Arab youth had finally moved , and Obama and his team made the right statements to encourage them , while also making it clear to the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes that they could no longer hide behind the claim that they were fighting America &apos;s war in north Africa . 
Pulling away from dictators without trying to take credit for or hijack the revolt was exactly what was required . 
Arab youth had to fight and win democracy for themselves . 
All that what was wanted from America , most of the young people thought , was withdrawal of its support for allies like Hosni Mubarak and other Arab dictators . 
In Libya , however , the need was different . 
The same energy on display in Cairo and Tunis was evident among Libyan youth , but this time , America was able to do little diplomatically because it had no relationship with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
So , no surprise , the energy of Libyan youth ran head-on into Qaddafi &apos;s inclination toward brutality and , more importantly , into his paid mercenaries . 
America had a moral responsibility to protect the young people whom Obama had encouraged . 
Another type of help was needed , but deciding what form it should take was complicated . 
Arab countries , especially Egypt , had hundreds of thousands of their nationals working in Libya . 
Their governments saw themselves as Qaddafi &apos;s hostages . 
The Gulf countries , which have no citizens working in Libya , were the first to denounce Qaddafi . 
Then the Arab League met to follow the Gulf states &quot; lead . 
With angry young Arabs from different countries demonstrating outside its Cairo offices and demanding support for their Libyan brethren , the Arab League took an uncharacteristic position : it agreed to denounce a fellow Arab leader . 
Clearly , the Arab world was changing , and the US was suddenly no longer an enemy , but a friend . 
After gaining Security Council support , the US , Europe , and some Arab countries began doing exactly what should be expected of the international community when a government is preparing to butcher its own citizens : prevent the slaughter . 
Of course , America &apos;s problems with Arabs and its challenges in the Middle East are far from over . 
Obama must still fulfill his promises to celebrate with Palestinians their full membership of the UN this fall and to draw down its forces in Afghanistan . 
But , for the moment , Arabs are not demonstrating against America .
