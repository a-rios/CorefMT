Obama in Chains 
NEW YORK - It is hard for international observers of the United States to grasp the political paralysis that grips the country , and that seriously threatens America &apos;s ability to solve its domestic problems and contribute to international problem solving . 
America &apos;s governance crisis is the worst in modern history . 
Moreover , it is likely to worsen in the years ahead . 
The difficulties that President Barack Obama is having in passing his basic program , whether in health care , climate change , or financial reform , are hard to understand at first glance . 
After all , he is personally popular , and his Democratic Party holds commanding majorities in both houses of Congress . 
Yet his agenda is stalled and the country &apos;s ideological divisions grow deeper . 
Among Democrats , Obama &apos;s approval rating in early November was 84 % , compared with just 18 % among Republicans . 
Fifty-eight percent of Democrats thought the country was headed in the right direction , compared with 9 % of Republicans . 
Only 18 % of Democrats supported sending 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan , while 57 % of Republicans supported a troop buildup . 
In fact , a significant majority of Democrats , 60 % , favored a reduction of troops in Afghanistan , compared with just 26 % of Republicans . 
On all of these questions , a middle ground of independents ( neither Democrats nor Republicans ) was more evenly divided . 
Part of the cause for these huge divergences in views is that America is an increasingly polarized society . 
Political divisions have widened between the rich and poor , among ethnic groups ( non-Hispanic whites versus African Americans and Hispanics ) , across religious affiliations , between native-born and immigrants , and along other social fault lines . 
American politics has become venomous as the belief has grown , especially on the vocal far right , that government policy is a &quot; zero-sum &quot; struggle between different social groups and politics . 
Moreover , the political process itself is broken . 
The Senate now operates on an informal rule that opponents will try to kill a legislative proposal through a &quot; filibuster &quot; - a procedural attempt to prevent the proposal from coming to a vote . 
To overcome a filibuster , the proposal &apos;s supporters must muster 60 of 100 votes , rather than a simple majority . 
This has proven impossible on controversial policies - such as binding reductions on carbon emissions - even when a simple majority supports the legislation . 
An equally deep crisis stems from the role of big money in politics . 
Backroom lobbying by powerful corporations now dominates policymaking negotiations , from which the public is excluded . 
The biggest players , including Wall Street , the automobile companies , the health-care industry , the armaments industry , and the real-estate sector , have done great damage to the US and world economy over the past decade . 
Many observers regard the lobbying process as a kind of legalized corruption , in which huge amounts of money change hands , often in the form of campaign financing , in return for specific policies and votes . 
Finally , policy paralysis around the US federal budget may be playing the biggest role of all in America &apos;s incipient governance crisis . 
The US public is rabidly opposed to paying higher taxes , yet the trend level of taxation ( at around 18 % of national income ) is not sufficient to pay for the core functions of government . 
As a result , the US government now fails to provide adequately for basic public services such as modern infrastructure ( fast rail , improved waste treatment , broadband ) , renewable energy to fight climate change , decent schools , and health-care financing for those who cannot afford it . 
Powerful resistance to higher taxes , coupled with a growing list of urgent unmet needs , has led to chronic under-performance by the US government and an increasingly dangerous level of budget deficits and government debt . 
This year , the budget deficit stands at a peacetime record of around 10 % of GNP , much higher than in other high-income countries . 
Obama so far seems unable to break this fiscal logjam . 
To win the 2008 election , he promised that he would not raise taxes on any household with income of less than $ 250,000 per year . 
That no-tax pledge , and the public attitudes that led Obama to make it , block reasonable policies . 
There is little &quot; waste &quot; to cut from domestic spending , and many areas where increases in public spending are needed . 
Higher taxes on the rich , while justified , don &apos;t come close to solving the deficit crisis . 
America , in fact , needs a value-added tax , which is widely used in Europe , but Obama himself staunchly ruled out that kind of tax increase during his election campaign . 
These paralyzing factors could intensify in the years ahead . 
The budget deficits could continue to prevent any meaningful action in areas of critical need . 
The divisions over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could continue to block a decisive change in policy , such as a withdrawal of forces . 
The desire of Republicans to defeat the Democrats could lead them to use every maneuver to block votes and slow legislative reforms . 
A breakthrough will require a major change in direction . 
The US must leave Iraq and Afghanistan , thereby saving $ 150 billion per year for other purposes and reducing the tensions caused by military occupation . 
The US will have to raise taxes in order to pay for new spending initiatives , especially in the areas of sustainable energy , climate change , education , and relief for the poor . 
To avoid further polarization and paralysis of American politics , Obama must do more to ensure that Americans understand better the urgency of the changes that he promised . 
Only such changes - including lobbying reforms - can restore effective governance .
