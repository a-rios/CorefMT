Turn Left for Growth 
NEW YORK - Both the left and the right say they stand for economic growth . 
So should voters trying to decide between the two simply look at it as a matter of choosing alternative management teams ? 
If only matters were so easy ! 
Part of the problem concerns the role of luck . 
America &apos;s economy was blessed in the 1990s with low energy prices , a high pace of innovation , and a China increasingly offering high-quality goods at decreasing prices , all of which combined to produce low inflation and rapid growth . 
President Clinton and then-Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan deserve little credit for this - though , to be sure , bad policies could have messed things up . 
By contrast , the problems faced today - high energy and food prices and a crumbling financial system - have , to a large extent , been brought about by bad policies . 
There are , indeed , big differences in growth strategies , which make different outcomes highly likely . 
The first difference concerns how growth itself is conceived . 
Growth is not just a matter of increasing GDP . 
It must be sustainable : growth based on environmental degradation , a debt-financed consumption binge , or the exploitation of scarce natural resources , without reinvesting the proceeds , is not sustainable . 
Growth also must be inclusive ; at least a majority of citizens must benefit . 
Trickle-down economics does not work : an increase in GDP can actually leave most citizens worse off . 
America &apos;s recent growth was neither economically sustainable nor inclusive . 
Most Americans are worse off today than they were seven years ago . 
But there need not be a trade-off between inequality and growth . 
Governments can enhance growth by increasing inclusiveness . 
A country &apos;s most valuable resource is its people . 
So it is essential to ensure that everyone can live up to their potential , which requires educational opportunities for all . 
A modern economy also requires risk-taking . 
Individuals are more willing to take risks if there is a good safety net . 
If not , citizens may demand protection from foreign competition . 
Social protection is more efficient than protectionism . 
Failures to promote social solidarity can have other costs , not the least of which are the social and private expenditures required to protect property and incarcerate criminals . 
It is estimated that within a few years , America will have more people working in the security business than in education . 
A year in prison can cost more than a year at Harvard . 
The cost of incarcerating two million Americans - one of the highest per capita rates in the world - should be viewed as a subtraction from GDP , yet it is added on . 
A second major difference between left and right concerns the role of the state in promoting development . 
The left understands that the government &apos;s role in providing infrastructure and education , developing technology , and even acting as an entrepreneur is vital . 
Government laid the foundations of the Internet and the modern biotechnology revolutions . 
In the nineteenth century , research at America &apos;s government-supported universities provided the basis for the agricultural revolution . 
Government then brought these advances to millions of American farmers . 
Small business loans have been pivotal in creating not only new businesses , but whole new industries . 
The final difference may seem odd : the left now understands markets , and the role that they can and should play in the economy . 
The right , especially in America , does not . 
The New Right , typified by the Bush-Cheney administration , is really old corporatism in a new guise . 
These are not libertarians . 
They believe in a strong state with robust executive powers , but one used in defense of established interests , with little attention to market principles . 
The list of examples is long , but it includes subsidies to large corporate farms , tariffs to protect the steel industry , and , most recently , the mega-bail-outs of Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac . 
But the inconsistency between rhetoric and reality is long-standing : protectionism expanded under Reagan , including through the imposition of so-called voluntary export restraints on Japanese cars . 
By contrast , the new left is trying to make markets work . 
Unfettered markets do not operate well on their own - a conclusion reinforced by the current financial debacle . 
Defenders of markets sometimes admit that they do fail , even disastrously , but they claim that markets are &quot; self-correcting . &quot; 
During the Great Depression , similar arguments were heard : government need not do anything , because markets would restore the economy to full employment in the long run . 
But , as John Maynard Keynes famously put it , in the long run we are all dead . 
Markets are not self-correcting in the relevant time frame . 
No government can sit idly by as a country goes into recession or depression , even when caused by the excessive greed of bankers or misjudgment of risks by security markets and rating agencies . 
But if governments are going to pay the economy &apos;s hospital bills , they must act to make it less likely that hospitalization will be needed . 
The right &apos;s deregulation mantra was simply wrong , and we are now paying the price . 
And the price tag - in terms of lost output - will be high , perhaps more than $ 1.5 trillion in the United States alone . 
The right often traces its intellectual parentage to Adam Smith , but while Smith recognized the power of markets , he also recognized their limits . 
Even in his era , businesses found that they could increase profits more easily by conspiring to raise prices than by producing innovative products more efficiently . 
There is a need for strong anti-trust laws . 
It is easy to host a party . 
For the moment , everyone can feel good . 
Promoting sustainable growth is much harder . 
Today , in contrast to the right , the left has a coherent agenda , one that offers not only higher growth , but also social justice . 
For voters , the choice should be easy .
