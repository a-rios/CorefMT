America &apos;s Bickering Asian Allies 
ATLANTA - American diplomats like to portray their country &apos;s allies in glowing terms . 
So the world should take note when they do not - such as when US Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman , at a recent conference in Washington , DC , on Asian security , publicly scolded South Korea for its seemingly endless vilification of Japan . 
According to Sherman , South Korea &apos;s stance - reflected in its demand that Japan apologize , once again , for forcing Korean women to provide sexual services to the Imperial Army during World War II - has produced &quot; paralysis , not progress . &quot; 
But Sherman &apos;s criticism could also be leveled against Japan . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has rarely missed an opportunity to provoke Japan &apos;s Korean critics , whether by visiting Tokyo &apos;s Yasukuni shrine , where the &quot; souls &quot; of 14 Class A war criminals are interred , or embracing revisionist critiques of previous official apologies for Japanese aggression . 
Instead of working together to help their American ally confront the challenges posed by a rising China and the North Korean nuclear threat , South Korea and Japan have allowed their rancor to stymie effective action . 
This seemingly endless tension has been frustrating - and worrying - American leaders for years , especially as it has undermined the United States &quot; strategic &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia . 
Since President Barack Obama announced the pivot five years ago , the US has been attempting to bolster its forces and alliances in Asia , thereby reinforcing its strategic role in a region that China is increasingly attempting to dominate . 
But the relentless sniping by its two most important Asian allies has blocked the kind of concrete cooperation needed to help it achieve its main goals , including ensuring a durable , long-term military presence in the region . 
Intelligence sharing is a case in point . 
In December , US officials , seeking to better their understanding of North Korea &apos;s missile and nuclear programs - and enable commanders to react swiftly if potential threats materialize - announced a new information-sharing agreement with South Korea and Japan . 
But the deal could be a script for a situation comedy : Japan and South Korea refuse to provide intelligence data to each other , leaving the US to play the middleman . 
The US has accentuated the positive , calling the agreement an important step forward . 
But , though it does represent progress from 2012 , when popular opposition in South Korea to the idea of military cooperation with Japan caused a similar agreement to collapse , the latest effort is inefficient , at best . 
China has been eager to capitalize on the animosity between Japan and South Korea to undermine America &apos;s security interests in Asia . 
During a visit to South Korea last July , President Xi Jinping highlighted not only the two countries &quot; deepening economic relationship , but also their shared views regarding Japan &apos;s wartime past . 
Other Chinese officials have picked up the theme , dropping hints that China &apos;s 70th anniversary celebration of the end of World War II could exclude Japan - unless , that is , Japan is more contrite about its historic transgressions . 
It is time for the US to tell its Asian allies to get over it . 
As the underwriter of both Japan &apos;s and South Korea &apos;s national defense , the US simply cannot allow their historical animosities to impede action to address urgent threats in this critical region . 
The timing could not be better , as rising security fears are altering public perceptions . 
Recent opinion polls suggest that at least half of all South Koreans are worried enough about regional tensions to support closer military ties with Japan . 
And , indeed , the security risks facing Asia are only growing - exemplified in China &apos;s move from military expansion to blatant assertiveness . 
Most notably , in the South and East China Seas , China has been staking its claim to disputed island territories , deploying advanced military hardware , and aggressively patrolling an expanded security zone . 
Meanwhile , leaks from Chinese think tanks have suggested that if the North Korean regime collapses , China could well send troops to preserve the country &apos;s stability . 
Asia &apos;s new security landscape places a premium on seamless cooperation among US allies - a prospect that the sustained bickering between South Korea and Japan calls into question . 
It could even be said that their longstanding dispute makes America &apos;s Asian alliance system worth less than the sum of its parts . 
Repairing relations between South Korean and Japan could not be more urgent . 
Even with good will on both sides , it will take time to build a strong defense partnership . 
Effective military cooperation requires personal ties that take years to build , and , aside from some joint naval and air exercises , the two countries have little experience working together . 
Boosting technical interoperability also will take considerable time , though both countries maintain sophisticated defense forces with great potential to be linked together . 
Effective cooperation will also require a broader scope for joint action - an imperative that is not reflected in the recent intelligence-sharing agreement . 
The risks to stability in Northeast Asia extend well beyond North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons and missile programs , and a joint intelligence agenda should address them . 
How will the allies respond to the threat of a conventional military attack by - or instability in - North Korea ? 
What if the North Korean regime collapses , and China does intervene militarily ? 
After spending the last six decades defending South Korea and Japan , the US has every reason - and plenty of leverage - to demand that its two long-time allies enhance their military cooperation . 
Simply focusing on the positive - America &apos;s classic approach to alliance diplomacy - is no longer enough . 
Whatever their historical disagreements , South Korea and Japan both face serious risks in their immediate neighborhood . 
It is up to the US to ensure that they work together to protect themselves - and ensure long-term stability throughout Asia .
