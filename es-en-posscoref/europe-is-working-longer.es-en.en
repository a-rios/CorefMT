Europe is Working Longer 
France &apos;s decision effectively abolishing its 35-hour workweek by allowing employers to increase working hours - and pay - marks a reversal of a decades-old trend . 
In the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , most European countries reduced working hours : Germany went from more than 40 to 38 per week , the UK from 40 to 37 , Denmark from 39 to 37 , and France from 40 to 35 . 
Today , however , as Europeans struggle with high unemployment and stagnating living standards , they may have to work longer to cope with globalization . 
The French actions follow changes in Germany , where some recent wage settlements resulted in longer working times . 
The difference between the two countries is that , in Germany , working times were increased without compensating pay increases . 
Siemens was the forerunner , going from 35 to 40 hours per week . 
Bavaria &apos;s government increased the workweek from 38.5 to 40 hours for older employees and to 42 hours for younger employees . 
When Daimler-Chrysler increased work hours from 35 to 40 hours in its research and development center , the dam broke and other bargaining agreements fell into line . 
Germany primarily reacted to low-wage competition from ex-communist countries . 
Currently , the average wage of the ten countries that joined the EU in May 2004 is about one-seventh of the West German wage level , and the Chinese wage is one twenty-fifth . 
Those differences are so huge that some people consider efforts to compete futile . 
But , as productivity is much higher in Germany , an effective reduction of hourly labor costs by uncompensated increases in working hours seems worth trying . 
The next step for France could be unpaid increases in working times . 
Trade union opposition to extending working hours is based on the &quot; lump-of-labor &quot; theory . 
According to this view , there are no economic advantages of such a policy , because the total amount of labor in the economy is fixed . 
As a result , a 10 % increase in working time will merely reduce employment by 10 % percent . 
Despite its seeming plausibility , this view is wrong . 
Working longer for the same pay is a useful way of making Europe more competitive , and , when compared to reducing wages , it imposes a much lighter burden on workers and employees . 
Working longer will boost economic growth , for if people work longer , then so does capital . 
Except for where all 24 hours of the day are filled with shift work , increasing the daily working time of people extends daily capital utilization . 
There is a jump in wealth and an immediate production boom . 
The lump-of-labor theory assumes that working longer and employing more people is the same thing . 
Longer working time can be achieved nearly instantaneously , whereas employing more people is time consuming and expensive , as it typically requires new physical investment . 
Working longer is thus the ideal way to achieve growth and competitiveness . 
In fact , extending daily working times will , in the medium term , also result in higher employment , because it will increase productivity while labor costs remain constant . 
Some workers whose productivity was too low to cover their cost will now be hired , as firms will find it worthwhile to expand output above the level resulting from the increased working time itself by investing more capital and hiring more workers . 
Some fear that extending the workday will not produce more jobs because the resulting expansion of hours worked will reduce the capital-labor ratio . 
This would lower the marginal productivity of hours worked sufficiently to offset the positive effects of increasing the number of hours per worker . 
But , again , capital would also work longer . 
Because of the &quot; capital utilization effect , &quot; the capital-labor ratio would not , in fact , decline , and hence there would be no significant effect on the marginal productivity of hours worked . 
The theoretical effect on employment is unambiguously positive , because marginal workers will be more productive as they work longer . 
Would there be enough demand to absorb the additional output resulting from increasing the workday ? 
Advocates of the lump-of-labor view say no . 
But as more goods are produced while the wage per worker is fixed , profits increase by exactly the same amount as the value of output does . 
Thus , in principle , the purchasing power for the extra output would be available . 
The entrepreneur might buy his wife a new fur coat or his workers a new production plant . 
If all firms work longer , most will experience more demand , and the average firm will face as much extra demand as it provides extra supply . 
True , some extra demand will go abroad , but so will some of the extra supply . 
A slight devaluation would solve any remaining problem with export demand . 
This could be an explicit devaluation or an implicit one due to a price reduction , made possible by the reduction in unit production costs resulting from the extra working time at constant pay . 
The argument that working longer destroys jobs and that we need technological progress in order to become more competitive and maintain employment is inherently inconsistent , because working longer is nearly the same as technological progress that makes capital and labor more productive . 
Either one or the other view is correct , but both cannot be true simultaneously . 
In any case , only the second interpretation is correct . 
The fear that extending the workday will damage employment is unfounded . 
It is a tried and true path towards growth , competitiveness and employment .
