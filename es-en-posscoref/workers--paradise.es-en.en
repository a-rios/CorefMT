Workers &quot; Paradise ? 
CAMBRIDGE  -  
Or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ? 
One way or the other , unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond . 
Unions &quot; rising influence is evident in many recent events : German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several American presidential candidates &quot; open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the Chinese leadership &apos;s nascent concerns about labor standards . 
Along with their political clout , unions &quot; intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance . 
After decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth , the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman , who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization &apos;s worst excesses . 
The sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States , where private-sector union membership has fallen from 25 % in 1975 to 8 % today . 
From high-tech Google to mass retailer Wal-Mart , US companies have found ways to keep their shops union-free . 
Only the public sector , where the membership rate is 35 % , has remained a union bastion . 
One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike-happy Canada . 
Today , US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions . 
But there is good reason to be skeptical . 
For a relatively poor country like China , real unions could help balance employers &quot; power , bringing quality-of-life benefits that outweigh the growth costs . 
Factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth-century , pre-union US . 
Thousands of Chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions . 
But , for the US and rich countries in Europe , the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious . 
Nowadays , most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago . 
Instead , union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill . 
It is no surprise that the public sector , where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft , typically has the greatest union concentration . 
Teachers &quot; unions , especially , are a catastrophe , blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries &quot; education systems . 
Before the modern globalization era , unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale , giving them enormous bargaining power vis-Ã -vis both employers and consumers . 
Now , after the explosive post-war expansion of global trade , most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded , if not shattered . 
That is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free-trade negotiations that might erode their position further . 
Some of the issues that unions are promoting , such as human rights and environmental quality , are unassailable . 
When they try to connect these issues with trade , however , their motives become questionable . 
A case in point is union lobbying against the US-Colombia free-trade agreement , ratification of which would greatly advance US-Latin American relations . 
Legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug-financed rebels do not trump broader issues . 
So anti-pact activists have complained that Colombia is anti-union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence . 
Yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence - union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population . 
Unfortunately , this play is being re-enacted across a host of trade issues , including many involving China . 
For rich countries , income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system , rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions . 
The rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries , that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax , with a very high exemption level so that lower-income families pay nothing . 
For middle-income countries , it is a tougher call . 
But here , too , increasing workers &quot; legal and statutory rights , while allowing most unions to fade away , seems like the right approach . 
Unfortunately , we are far more likely to see unions &quot; growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth , with highly uncertain consequences . 
When we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead . 
That is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008 .
