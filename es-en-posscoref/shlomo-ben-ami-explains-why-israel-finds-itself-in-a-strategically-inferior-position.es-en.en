The Gaza Trap 
TEL AVIV - Israel &apos;s &quot; Operation Protective Edge &quot; against Hamas in Gaza is the kind of asymmetrical warfare that has characterized nearly all Middle East conflicts in recent years . 
Victories in such wars are always elusive . 
Whatever the achievements of Israel &apos;s superior army and its anti-missile systems , and however appalling the devastation of Gaza , Hamas will survive , if only because Israel wants it to . 
The alternative - jihadist anarchy that would turn Gaza into a Palestinian Somalia - is simply too unbearable to contemplate . 
Hamas leader Khaled Meshal &apos;s boastful rhetoric cannot hide the fact that Hamas &apos;s military power has been dealt a devastating blow . 
But , unless Israel is ready to pay an exceptionally high price in terms of its international standing by occupying Gaza and destroying its entire military hierarchy and arsenal , Hamas can still claim victory , having survived yet another onslaught by Israel &apos;s colossal military machine . 
The superior power in an asymmetrical conflict always has a problem defining its objectives . 
In this case , Israel aspires to achieve &quot; quiet &quot; with few enough Palestinian civilian casualties to minimize international criticism . 
But the failure to achieve this goal is precisely where the superior power is defeated in asymmetrical conflicts . 
Moreover , &quot; quiet &quot; is not a strategic goal ; nor is Israel &apos;s way of pursuing it - a war every two or three years - particularly convincing . 
The real question is this : Assuming that Israel gets the quiet that it wants , what does it intend to do with Gaza in the future ? 
And what does it intend to do with the Palestinian problem of which Gaza is an integral part ? 
The question of Palestine is at the root of the asymmetrical wars that Israel has been facing in recent years , not only against Hamas , Qatar &apos;s Palestinian client , but also against Hezbollah , Iran &apos;s proxy in the region . 
These wars are creating a new kind of threat to Israel , for they add to the conflicts &quot; strictly military dimension the domains of diplomacy , regional politics , legitimacy , and international law , in which Israel does not have the upper hand . 
As a result , in asymmetrical conflicts , Israel finds its military superiority vitiated . 
The asymmetry between the nature of the threats and Israel &apos;s response ends up putting the superior military power in a position of strategic inferiority . 
The spread of violence to the West Bank - and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s support of Hamas &apos;s objectives - means that Israel cannot avoid the conflict &apos;s political consequences . 
Hamas , a neglected opponent of Abbas &apos;s diplomatic strategy , is gradually becoming the avant-garde of Palestine &apos;s struggle for liberation . 
Contrary to what Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu believes , the main existential threat facing the country is not a nuclear-armed Iran . 
The real peril is to be found at home : the corrosive effect of the Palestinian problem on Israel &apos;s international standing . 
The devastation caused by Israel &apos;s periodic asymmetrical confrontations , combined with the continuing occupation of Palestinian lands and the ever-growing expansion of settlements , has fueled a growing campaign to undermine Israel &apos;s legitimacy . 
For example , the seemingly benign Boycott , Divestment , and Sanctions movement , viewed by many of its supporters as a legitimate form of non-violent resistance , has continued to gain ground . 
The Palestinian mainstream , represented by Abbas , made a strategic decision to opt for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders . 
Israel &apos;s strategic response would normally be that it aspires to be a &quot; Jewish democratic state , &quot; which presupposes a Jewish majority . 
But if the never-ending peace process continues to fail to produce a two-state solution , how can Israel avoid the reality of a single state in a continuous state of civil war ? 
There is only one way out of the Gaza tragedy that can provide justice to its many victims : The parties to the conflict and the regional actors now vying to act as mediators must leverage the ongoing calamity into a grand peace agenda . 
This would mean launching a Marshall Plan to upgrade Gaza &apos;s infrastructure and improve social conditions . 
It would also entail lifting the blockade and opening Gaza to the world . 
The price Hamas would have to pay is complete disarmament and demilitarization of Gaza under international supervision , with Abbas &apos;s Palestinian Authority controlling the border crossings into Israel and Egypt . 
Simultaneously , negotiations for a two-state solution should resume , with an unequivocal commitment by the United States and the other members of the so-called Middle East Quartet ( the United Nations , the European Union , and Russia ) to use all possible influence on the parties to prevent another failure . 
Israel is devoid of a convincing strategy ; what it has is a series of improvisations aimed at securing the nation &apos;s physical survival on as much land as the international community might allow . 
But improvisation is simply unsustainable in the long run . 
For example , Israel has reached out to those Arab countries that are willing to subordinate the Palestinian problem to discreet bilateral relations , essentially on security matters . 
But any such &quot; alliances &quot; that Israel might be able to develop - say , with Saudi Arabia and Egypt - can only be circumstantial and ephemeral . 
The challenge for Israel is to tie its military tactics and diplomacy to a clearly defined political goal . 
And a credible national strategy must recognize that as long as the Palestinian conflict remains unresolved , Israel &apos;s moral foundations and international standing will be dangerously compromised .
