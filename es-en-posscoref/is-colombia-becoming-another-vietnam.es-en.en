Is Colombia Becoming Another Vietnam ? 
BOGOTÁ : Cocaine production is rising ; peace talks with leftist guerrillas have stalled ; 
So alarming are conditions in Colombia nowadays that some Americans worry about the country becoming another Vietnam . 
How different it all seemed a decade ago ! 
Back then , Colombians rejoiced at the prospects for peace , political change and economic progress . 
Indeed , newly elected president Cesar Gaviria , a youthful Kennedyesqe figure , ended his inaugural address with : &quot; Colombians : welcome to the future . &quot; 
Demobilization of one large rebel army , the EPL , was so recent a memory that progress with the other two main guerrilla forces fighting in the country &apos;s seemingly endless guerrilla wars seemed certain . 
Both the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) were involved throughout 1991-92 in apparently serious conversations intended to end their revolts . 
Moreover , Colombian tolerance for the drug lords - Pablo Escobar , perhaps the most notorious , had been elected to Congress - was evaporating . 
The dismantling of the Medellin drug cartel , then taking place , stood in sharp contrast with the murders of three presidential candidates - Luis Carlos Galán , Bernardo Jaramillo and Carlos Pizarro - during the 1990 election . 
This public outrage also incited political change . 
Congress , which most Colombians saw as irredeemably corrupt , was sent packing and a broad-based Constitutional Assembly was elected to rewrite the country &apos;s 1886 Constitution . 
Even economic progress seemed near . 
Once deemed the &quot; Tibet of Latin America &quot; because of its excessive protectionism and intolerable isolation , Colombia embarked on market-based reforms - the &quot; apertura &quot; - which Chile , Mexico and Argentina were then experimenting with . 
This effort was to be the means through which a weary , dusty nation was to find a better economic future . 
The years since , however , were eaten by locusts . 
Many people see the country as on the edge of an abyss , with peace a distant dream . 
Today , the number of &quot; desplazados &quot; from Colombia &apos;s guerrilla wars ( 1.5 million refugees at the latest count ) is greater than the population of all but three of our largest cities and forms the third largest group of refugees in the world . 
Emigration is at historic highs , and a new rebel force has appeared in the form of an aggressive - and potent - rightwing paramilitary army . 
Indeed , much of Colombia &apos;s national territory is now dominated by one of three insurgent groups . 
In addition , the economy is in ruins . 
Having experienced practically zero growth from 1997-2000 , with unemployment at 20.5 % , Colombia &apos;s distress is so pronounced that a three year program was agreed with the IMF in late 1999 . 
The &quot; Colombia Problem , &quot; indeed , now threatens to destabilize the neighboring countries of Panama , Venezuela , Brazil , Peru and Ecuador . 
Churning this turmoil into frenzy is the illegal drug trade . 
Credible estimates put the total flow of income from production and distribution of cocaine at between US $ 2.5 and US $ 4 billion annually , or between 2.8 % and 4.4 % of Colombia &apos;s GDP . 
These resources feed armed insurgents , criminal bands and , increasingly , provide the lifeblood for many small peasants , who cultivate some 130 thousand hectares of coca plants . 
All this violence is incited by rebels who number barely 40,000 , not much in a nation of 40 million . 
The rebels lack any coherent political agenda and command little , if any , support among ordinary Colombians . 
Despite this , the income from drug trafficking is enough to keep the rebels well-armed and in the field . 
Although drug money plays a defining role in these rebellions , putting the blame solely on illegal narcotics is wrong . 
The truth is that Colombia lacks both the will and the ability to stem criminal activities and that the only effective cure for Colombia &apos;s illness is a root-and-branch redesign of its civil institutions . 
Here causes for optimism are limited but real . 
First , the world increasingly recognizes that Colombia &apos;s problems are international in nature , requiring international solutions . 
This &quot; internationalization &quot; includes more than America &apos;s &quot; Plan Colombia &quot; aid , for the EU has also coughed up $ 280 million for social and development projects , though much , much more is needed . 
Moreover , for the first time , Colombia &apos;s neighbors seem willing to abandon Latin America &apos;s traditional &quot; hands-off &quot; policy in order to offer assistance . 
A second , perhaps more important , cause for optimism is the fact that Colombians are more aware than ever that their political institutions are morally bankrupt . 
In that recognition may lay the political support needed for serious reform to take place . 
Here the case of Bogotá is telling , for amid all the national bleakness , the capital has witnessed real progress . 
Crime rates are falling , the public infrastructure revolutionized , corruption curtailed , and a sense of legitimate , transparent authority is being established . 
All this happened because an activist local administration enlisted the broad support of Bogatá &quot; s citizens . 
Chronically ill , Colombia has returned to the same critical juncture it faced a decade ago . 
Back then , the illusion of costless progress prevented the root and branch reform Colombia so desperately needed . 
Now , painfully , Colombians have learned that doing nothing costs even more than reforming , which makes it much more likely that Colombians will choose to persevere in reinventing and restoring their country .
