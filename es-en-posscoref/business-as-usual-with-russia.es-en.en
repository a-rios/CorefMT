Business as Usual with Russia ? 
BERLIN - Despite continuing tensions over Russia &apos;s invasion of Georgia this August , the European Union will reopen talks with Russia on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) . 
A PCA establishes a legal framework for negotiating specific agreements in such areas as trade , justice , and human rights . 
The current talks aim to replace the expired 1997 PCA , which remains in force by mutual consent pending a new accord . 
At an emergency meeting on September 1 , EU leaders refused to continue the PCA talks until Russia removed its combat units from the Georgian separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
The heads of the 27 EU governments also characterized the Kremlin &apos;s decision to recognize the independence of the two breakaway regions as &quot; unacceptable . &quot; 
Since then , EU governments have moderated their conditions , describing a simple Russian military withdrawal from Georgian territories outside the two regions as sufficient to resume a dialogue on the PCA , energy security , and other issues . 
The EU decision comes at a time when NATO has also sought to renew its engagement with Russia after the Georgia conflict led both parties to suspend many joint programs . 
In a speech on September 18 at the Royal United Services Institute in London , NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer argued that , despite differences over Georgia , Russia and the alliance should cooperate &quot; wherever our interests converge . &quot; 
He specifically cited continued cooperation in Afghanistan , where Russia is providing logistical support for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force , as &quot; a clear indication that common interests can transcend disagreements in other areas . &quot; 
In order not to appear intimidated by Russia &apos;s forceful dismemberment of Georgia , NATO governments have publicly reaffirmed their support for Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity and the country &apos;s desire to join NATO eventually . 
In private , however , many allied officials have told the media that they are even less inclined than they previously were to deepen NATO &apos;s ties with Georgia , given the risks of becoming entrapped in another Russian-Georgian war . 
At present , it seems most Western governments have decided to concentrate on helping Georgia recover economically from the war rather than on punishing Russia directly . 
At last month &apos;s International Donors &quot; Conference in Brussels , they pledged billions of dollars of reconstruction aid . 
The EU is also considering negotiating a free-trade area with Georgia and relaxing visa rules for Georgian citizens . 
NATO has established a special NATO-Georgian Commission to help coordinate allied support for Georgia &apos;s post-conflict reconstruction . 
Even so , Russian and Western officials continue to spar over American plans to deploy ballistic missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic . 
In his speech in November to the Russian parliament on the state of nation , President Dmitry Medvedev warned that Russia would deploy short-range Iskander missiles in the Baltic Sea port of Kaliningrad &quot; to neutralize if necessary the anti-ballistic missile system in Europe . &quot; 
Medvedev added that Russian electronic equipment would jam the American systems and that the Russian military was preparing additional countermeasures . 
NATO and EU leaders denounced the threats , which seemed especially gratuitous coming one day after the American people had elected a new President who has expressed interest in improving relations with Russia . 
Russia &apos;s government has also sought to showcase its growing military potential . 
In September and October , the country &apos;s strategic forces engaged in their largest nuclear weapons-related exercises since the Soviet Union &apos;s demise . 
On October 12 , the Russian Navy joined with the Strategic Rocket Forces to conduct a well-integrated exercise involving near-simultaneous testing of three long-range ballistic missiles from separate ground and submarine launch platforms . 
Last month , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also announced yet another increase in Russian defense spending . 
Russian military expenditures have increased by double-digit figures in recent years . 
This year , the Russian military will spend over $ 40 billion . 
The figure for 2009 could exceed $ 50 billion . 
Although superficially impressive , this surge obscures several key issues . 
Much of the growth merely compensates for the exceptionally high inflationary pressures in Russia &apos;s defense sector . 
In addition , it will take years for the recent budget increases to translate into new equipment . 
Although Russian designers can still develop first-class weapons , Russia &apos;s defense companies , which have yet to recover from the traumatic disintegration of the Soviet military-industrial complex , remain unable to manufacture large numbers of the most advanced systems . 
Russia &apos;s military also must compete with foreign customers for those few warplanes , tanks , and other sophisticated weapons that are produced . 
The long-term sustainability of Russia &apos;s military revival is also unclear . 
Russia &apos;s government remains dependent on oil and gas exports for revenue , but the prices of these commodities are falling sharply . 
Unlike the Soviet Union , Russia is tightly integrated into the world economy , rendering the country vulnerable to the current global financial crisis . 
Medvedev recently warned that Russia &apos;s &quot; military-industrial complex is starting to be affected by credit problems , &quot; stoking fears of a return to the paralyzing payment crises that plagued the defense sector during the 1990 &quot; s . 
Russia &apos;s continuing demographic problems will also make it difficult for the armed forces to become a fully professional military , one that does not depend on poorly motivated conscripts . 
Although Medvedev and Putin have apparently adopted a viable power-sharing arrangement , Russia &apos;s stunted political institutions lack the capacity to root out corruption and other inefficiencies . 
Comprehensive security-sector reform remains off the political agenda . 
Even in the high-priority defense sector , perhaps one-third of government spending is wasted or stolen - a condition that is not conducive to realizing Russia &apos;s great power ambitions .
