Financing Climate Safety 
NEW YORK - The purpose of the global financial system is to allocate the world &apos;s savings to their most productive uses . 
When the system works properly , these savings are channeled into investments that raise living standards ; when it malfunctions , as in recent years , savings are channeled into real-estate bubbles and environmentally harmful projects , including those that exacerbate human-induced climate change . 
The year 2015 will be a turning point in the effort to create a global financial system that contributes to climate safety rather than climate ruin . 
In July , the world &apos;s governments will meet in Addis Ababa to hammer out a new framework for global finance . 
The meeting &apos;s goal will be to facilitate a financial system that supports sustainable development , meaning economic growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sound . 
Five months later , in Paris , the world &apos;s governments will sign a new global agreement to control human-induced climate change and channel funds toward climate-safe energy , building on the progress achieved earlier this month in negotiations in Lima , Peru . 
There , too , finance will loom large . 
The basics are clear . 
Climate safety requires that all countries shift their energy systems away from coal , oil , and gas , toward wind , solar , geothermal , and other low-carbon sources . 
We should also test the feasibility of large-scale carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) , which might enable the safe , long-term use of at least some fossil fuels . 
Instead , the global financial system has continued to pump hundreds of billions of dollars per year into exploring and developing new fossil-fuel reserves , while directing very little toward CCS . 
Many investments in new fossil-fuel reserves will lose money - lots of it - owing to the recent fall in world oil prices . 
The simple fact is that the world has far more fossil-fuel resources than can be safely burned , given the realities of human-induced climate change . 
Though market signals are not yet very clear , this year &apos;s more successful investors were those who sold their fossil-fuel holdings , thereby avoiding the oil-price crash . 
Perhaps they were just lucky this year , but their divestment decision makes long-term sense , because it correctly anticipates the future policy shift away from fossil fuels and toward low-carbon energy . 
Several major pension funds and foundations in the United States and Europe have recently made the move . 
They have wisely heeded the words of the former CEO of oil giant BP , Lord Browne , who recently noted that climate change poses an &quot; existential threat &quot; to the oil industry . 
More governments around the world are now introducing carbon pricing to reflect the high social costs inherent in the continued use of fossil fuels . 
Every ton of carbon dioxide that is emitted into the atmosphere by burning coal , oil , or gas adds to long-term global warming , and therefore to the long-term costs that society will incur through droughts , floods , heat waves , extreme storms , and rising sea levels . 
While these future costs cannot be predicted with precision , recent estimates put the current social cost of each added ton of atmospheric CO2 at $ 10-100 , with the US government using a middle-range estimate of about $ 40 per ton to guide energy regulation . 
Some countries , like Norway and Sweden , long ago introduced a tax on CO2 emissions to reflect a social cost of $ 100 per ton , or even higher . 
Many private companies , including major oil firms , have also recently introduced an internal accounting cost of carbon emissions to guide their decisions regarding fossil-fuel investments . 
As more countries and companies introduce carbon pricing , the internal accounting cost of carbon emissions will rise , investments in fossil fuels will become less attractive , and investments in low-carbon energy systems will become more appealing . 
The market signals of CO2 taxation ( or the cost of CO2 emission permits ) will help investors and money managers steer clear of new fossil-fuel investments . 
Carbon taxes also offer governments a crucial source of revenue for future investment in low-carbon energy . 
With international oil prices dropping - by a whopping $ 40 per barrel since the summer - this is an ideal moment for governments to introduce carbon pricing . 
Rather than let the consumer price of oil fall by that amount , governments should put a carbon tax in place . 
Consumers would still come out ahead . 
Because each barrel of oil emits roughly 0.3 tons of CO2 , a carbon tax of , say , $ 40 per ton of CO2 implies an oil tax of just $ 12 per barrel . 
Moreover , new revenues from carbon taxes would be a boon for governments . 
High-income countries have promised to help low-income countries invest in climate safety , both in terms of low-carbon energy and resilience against climate shocks . 
Specifically , they have promised $ 100 billion in climate-related financing per year , starting in 2020 , up from around $ 25-30 billion this year . 
New revenues from a CO2 tax would provide an ideal way to honor that pledge . 
The math is simple . 
High-income countries emitted around 18 billion tons of CO2 this year - roughly half of all global emissions . 
If these countries earmarked just $ 2 per ton of CO2 for global financing organizations like the new Green Climate Fund and the regional development banks , they would transfer around $ 36 billion per year . 
By using part of that money to mobilize private-sector financing , the full $ 100 billion of climate financing could be reached . 
Both Big Oil and Big Finance have made major mistakes in recent years , channeling funds into socially destructive investments . 
In 2015 , these two powerful industries , and the world as a whole , can start to put things right . 
We have within our reach the makings of a new global financial system that directs savings where they are urgently needed : sustainable development and climate safety , for ourselves and for future generations .
