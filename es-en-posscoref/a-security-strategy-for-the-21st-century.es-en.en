A Security Strategy for the 21st Century 
MADRID - &quot; Time and again in our Nation &apos;s history , Americans have risen to meet -and to shape - moments of transition . 
This must be one of those moments . &quot; 
So begins the National Security Strategy of the United States of America , presented before Congress on May 27 . 
As with the politics pursued in the Obama administration &apos;s 16 months of office - dialogue , international commitment , nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament - the document &apos;s strength lies in the position that it takes . 
The Security Strategy is a clear departure from that of its predecessor and offers a wider conception of what national security represents for US President Barack Obama . 
In the face of the major challenges of our times , Obama has taken a stand with a comprehensive doctrine . 
Indeed , the Security Strategy is almost a &quot; National &quot; Strategy . 
Its thinking goes beyond the dominant , unilateral paradigm of its predecessor and includes a defense of international law . 
This is particularly noteworthy , given that none of the great treaties to create an international criminal court and a permanent war-crimes tribunal was signed by the US during George W. Bush &apos;s presidency . 
Obama &apos;s approach to security is broader as well , proposing the &quot; three Ds &quot; - defense , diplomacy , and development - as indivisible parts of a whole . 
The military dimension of intervention abroad loses its privileged role , making way for the prevention of conflict and for peace-keeping and stabilization missions . 
In the fight against terrorism , the Strategy abandons the predominantly military viewpoint underlying the war against terror , and embraces a more significant role for the intelligence services . 
For the first time , precise reference is made to people liable to be a threat to US security . 
The US is not waging a war against terrorism ; it is at &quot; war against a specific network , al Qaida , and its affiliates . &quot; 
In this war , information resources are particularly necessary . 
In order to guarantee national security , the Strategy is categorical - without giving in to the temptation of isolationism - in admitting the strategic value of the example and the importance of doing one &apos;s homework first . 
Obama steers clear both of interventions for humanitarian purposes and of attempting to export democracy by force . 
There is no better way of exporting the values of democracy than by strengthening the US internally . 
Thus , an economic policy that tackles America &apos;s debt and deficit makes up the main portion of the Strategy . 
Backing competitive education , innovation , technology , energy , and a more efficient and accessible health-care system complements and reinforces Obama &apos;s leadership approach of setting an example with one &apos;s own policies . 
An important example is removing the US prison at Guant√°namo Bay from international limbo - one of his first initiatives as president . 
This approach does not have unanimous support among international experts . 
The two main criticisms - lack of strategic clarity and less emphasis on the classical concepts of power - point to America &apos;s loss of influence , power , and leadership . 
But these criticisms reflect an inability to contemplate the current nature of armed conflict , which no longer follows the classical logic of military victory or defeat . 
The war in Afghanistan and the complex situation in Iraq have highlighted the importance of a comprehensive approach . 
Military action cannot be considered the only variable of success . 
A successful strategy should use civilian means - incidentally a model advocated by the European Union . 
We are faced with forging a new long-term policy that affects both states and societies . 
That task requires patience and strategic perseverance . 
Change will not occur from one day to the next , but the results obtained in the end will be better and more enduring . 
Obama maintains the idea of service to a historical mission for the US : the important job of guaranteeing global security . 
But , unlike his White House predecessors , Obama &apos;s National Security Strategy recognizes the value of partnerships ; attaches greater importance to the civilian dimension as opposed to the military ; and stresses the value of dialogue and the need to reinforce international institutions . 
This is a good sign for a world with different power centers and interests , with resources and legitimacy remaining tied to the nation-state , but in which challenges ( climate change , armed conflicts , pandemics , and transnational crime ) are global and , therefore , require cooperation among states . 
We are in a transition period : international interconnection is increasing , as the global economic crisis has shown , but the management tools and mechanisms to guarantee the smooth operation of governments are still not being shared . 
Obama &apos;s new National Security Strategy shows a political willingness to back an international order able to tackle these challenges . 
The road ahead is not free of difficulties , but the Strategy represents a decisive step towards solving the challenges of the twenty-first century and preparing us for the world of tomorrow .
