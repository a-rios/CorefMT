The IMF Fails Again 
It is six years since the IMF &apos;s fateful meeting in Hong Kong , just before the global financial crisis . 
I was there . 
What a peculiar meeting it was . 
To those paying attention , it was clear that a crisis loomed . 
Capital market liberalization was the culprit , exposing countries to the vagaries of international capital flows - to both irrational pessimism and optimism , not to mention the manipulation of speculators . 
Yet the IMF was still lobbying to change its charter in order to force countries to liberalize their capital markets , ignoring the evidence that this did not lead to enhanced growth or more investment , but only to more instability . 
The crises that erupted later that year undermined confidence in the IMF and led to discussions about &quot; reforming the global financial architecture . &quot; 
Now six years later , we can say that those discussions did not lead to much real change . 
Some suggest that the fancy term &quot; reforming the global financial architecture &quot; was a dead giveaway . 
The US Treasury and the IMF knew , or at least hoped , that with the passing of the crisis , global attention would turn elsewhere . 
While wrong about what to do in the crisis , on this point they were right . 
But change has occurred , though sometimes more in rhetoric than reality . 
Today the IMF is more aware of the impact its programs have on poverty - though it still does not produce a &quot; poverty and unemployment impact &quot; statement when it presents a program . 
The Fund has recognized the importance of participation and ownership . 
No longer are programs simply a matter between the IMF , central bank governors , and finance ministers . 
The IMF has recognized that there was excessive conditionality , and that these conditions led to a lack of focus . 
The IMF has not , however , fully grasped that the conditions were often dangerously misguided , and often dealt with political issues that were beyond its mission . 
After criticizing the East Asian countries for a lack of transparency , the IMF acknowledged that it , too , was insufficiently transparent , and made reforms - though sometimes it seems that it thinks that a better Web site is a substitute for real transparency . 
Unfortunately , it still has not recognized a basic principle underlying modern democracy : citizens &apos; right to know . 
After the failure of the Argentina bail out , the IMF recognized the need for an alternative approach . 
Earlier , it ignored calls for standstills and bankruptcy , saying that that would entail the abrogation of the debt contract . 
Finally , the IMF recognized that just as individuals need the right to a fresh start , so do governments . 
Unfortunately , it did not recognize that as a major creditor it could never be viewed as an impartial judge , and so could not have a pivotal role . 
It never fully grasped the political and economic issues underlying the design of bankruptcy laws . 
Under pressure from global civil society , the IMF finally did agree to an enhanced debt forgiveness program for the poorest countries . 
Regrettably , it set standards and procedures such that few countries achieve the debt relief they need . 
At least in East Asia , the IMF recognized that excessive fiscal stringency contributed to the downturn , though it still pushed excessive fiscal stringency in Argentina when that country went into crisis , with predictably disastrous results . 
It is good news that the IMF has recognized the limits of its policies and positions . 
Even without capital market liberalization , the world will continue to face enormous volatility . 
Crises will not be things of the past . 
Those who expected major reforms in the global financial architecture may well be sorely disappointed by what has happened in the past six years . 
For any fundamental reforms must address not only the difficult problems posed by the global reserve system and the burdens of risk borne by the developing countries , but also global governance . 
But there are strong vested interests in upholding the status quo . 
It is one thing to rearrange the chairs around the table , and quite another to change the table itself or those who have a seat at it . 
So it is no surprise that another annual meeting of the IMF passed without any major steps forward in &quot; reforming the global financial architecture . &quot; 
Instead , there was much discussion of another one of the symptoms that something is wrong . 
The issue of the day was whether China &apos;s exchange rate is overvalued , and if so , what should be done about it . 
Developing countries were told , once again , to get their houses in order , to address issues of governance , and to undertake &quot; painful &quot; structural reforms . 
It is , of course , always much easier to encourage others to undertake painful reforms than to look inward . 
The failed WTO meeting in Cancun of two weeks ago should serve as a warning : something is fundamentally wrong with how the global trading system is managed . 
So , too , is something fundamentally wrong with the global financial system . 
How many more meetings of the IMF will pass , how many more crises will occur , before this harsh truth sinks in ?
