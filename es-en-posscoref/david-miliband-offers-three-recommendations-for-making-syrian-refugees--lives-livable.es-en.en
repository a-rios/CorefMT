A Long-Term Plan for Syria &apos;s Refugees 
BEIRUT - After spending just three days with refugees and aid workers in Lebanon and Turkey , the apocalyptic nature of the Syria crisis is all too apparent : more than 100,000 deaths , nine million people displaced , two million children out of school , diseases like polio resurfacing , and neighboring countries struggling to cope with waves of refugees . 
Countless heartrending stories of lost husbands , wives , siblings , and children , to say nothing of homes and livelihoods destroyed , provide yet more troubling evidence of how Syria &apos;s civil war has become a regional conflict ( as the bombing of Iran &apos;s Beirut embassy suggests ) . 
Anti-Assad rebels are now fighting each other , as jihadists make gains . 
Experts no longer talk of the conflict lasting months ; they speak in terms of years , or even decades . 
Despite heroic efforts by aid agencies like the International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) to save lives and bring hope to the region , the terrible truth is that it is not possible to protect civilians , especially from snipers and stray missiles , never mind hunger and homelessness . 
Warring factions do not even recognize the notion of unaffiliated noncombatants , and flout international norms of war . 
In addition to the use of chemical weapons , the United Nations estimates that 2.5 million civilians lack food , water , and medicines , because some towns and villages are too hard to reach , with an estimated 250,000 people completely cut off from outside help . 
Syria &apos;s neighbors have been overwhelmed by calls for help . 
Lebanon is trying to accommodate nearly one million refugees . 
In Turkey , an estimated 200,000 refugees are in official camps , but at least twice that number are struggling alone in towns and cities . 
Support from around the world is fitful : only 60 % of aid pledges have come in , with only a fraction actually reaching the intended beneficiaries . 
Although some agencies have been able to get aid supplies across national borders , they cannot get through the frontlines of the fighting to reach those caught in the crossfire . 
International diplomatic efforts must therefore focus on achieving temporary ceasefires to bring in the most urgently needed help , such as polio vaccines for children . 
Aid should not be a mere side show to the seemingly endless peace talks taking place in Geneva ; as United Nations emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos insisted , it must be central to those negotiations . 
But , with the conflict and its impact expected to drag on for years , agencies must also plan for the longer term . 
This can be done in creative ways . 
The IRC , for example , is involved in three areas : 
· Innovative education : Mainstream school systems in neighboring countries cannot cope with the refugee influx ; and , with more than 80 % of refugees living in urban areas rather than in camps , there is little point to focusing on camp-based models of teaching . 
Instead , a more informal system , supported by networks of local and refugee teachers - a model that was successfully pioneered in Congo and Afghanistan - can provide accredited learning . 
· Exploiting technology : Syrians are generally literate , numerate , and technologically sophisticated . 
A pioneering social-networking platform called Tawasul ( &quot; Connection &quot; ) , established by the IRC and the non-profit news organization Internews , has been set up to help refugees help one another through the exchange of information and advice . 
· Doing business : Syrian refugees are accustomed to working in a market economy , so programs that allow them to trade , and therefore support themselves , should be encouraged . 
The IRC is investing in &quot; cash for work &quot; programs that will help refugees ( and their hosts ) build businesses . 
If we are to lessen the horrors of the Syrian conflict and its consequences , we must think not only about emergency action to save lives , but also about meeting longer-term needs that make those lives worth living . 
Bringing medical aid into conflict zones , setting up water and sanitation facilities , and protecting victims during harsh winters are crucial to saving lives ; but we must also think about how to safeguard the education and livelihoods of those who survive .
