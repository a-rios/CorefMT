China &apos;s Currency Conundrum 
PALO ALTO - The People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) , it seems , cannot win . 
In late February , the gradual appreciation of the renminbi was interrupted by a 1 % depreciation ( to $ 1 : ¥ 6.12 ) . 
Though insignificant in overall trade terms , especially when compared with the volatility of floating exchange-rate regimes , the renminbi &apos;s unexpected weakening sparked a global furor . 
The uproar was not surprising . 
After all , China has been under constant pressure from foreign governments to revalue , in the mistaken belief that a stronger currency would reduce China &apos;s large trade surplus . 
And , since July 2008 , when the exchange rate was $ 1 : ¥ 8.28 ( and had been held constant for ten years ) , the PBOC has more or less complied , with appreciations approximating 3 % per year through 2012 . 
However , the international outcry obscured an unintended but perhaps more troubling feature of China &apos;s exchange-rate policy : the tendency for sporadic renminbi appreciation ( even small movements ) to trigger speculative inflows of &quot; hot &quot; money . 
With short-term interest rates in the United States near zero , and the &quot; natural &quot; interbank interest rate in faster-growing China at near 4 % , an expected 3 % appreciation , for example , translates into an &quot; effective &quot; interest-rate differential of 7 % . 
This is an enticing spread for currency speculators who borrow in dollars and circumvent China &apos;s capital controls to buy renminbi assets . 
The hot-money problem is only made worse by the ongoing international pressure for further renminbi revaluation , usually from Western economists and politicians who blame the exchange rate for China &apos;s current-account surplus with the US and other developed economies . 
In reality , the trade imbalance reflects the difference between China &apos;s large savings surplus and the even bigger US saving deficiency ( largely explained by the US fiscal deficit ) . 
Indeed , the wholesale price index - the best measure of tradable-goods prices in China - has been falling by about 1.5 % annually , which suggests that the renminbi may even be slightly overvalued . 
Simply put , exchange-rate movements do not properly correct net trade ( saving ) imbalances between open economies ; but they can increase hot money flows . 
So the PBOC tried to keep speculators off guard by introducing more uncertainty into the exchange-rate system , as occurred with February &apos;s surprise devaluation . 
In mid-March , the PBOC announced that the daily movement in the renminbi / dollar rate would be increased from ± 1 % to ± 2 % , to further dampen hot-money speculators &quot; enthusiasm . 
While this is all well and good , speculative inflows would be further dampened if today &apos;s central rate , say , $ 1 : ¥ 6.1 , was stabilized into the indefinite future . 
There is another , less-discussed justification for holding the currency at a stable rate . 
The adjustment mechanism usually provided by exchange-rate movements could instead be delivered by wage changes . 
It is only in more sluggish industrial economies , where wages are assumed to be inflexible , that policymakers advocate exchange-rate movements as a means to overcome wage stickiness . 
However , in rapidly growing emerging markets , wages are often sufficiently flexible on the upside . 
For example , if an employer ( particularly an exporter ) fears future renminbi appreciation , he may hesitate to raise wages in line with productivity increases , in order to keep his costs under control . 
But if he can be confident that the exchange rate will remain stable , he will not need to restrain wages - and China has experienced 10-15 % annual wage growth already . 
With faster wage growth at a stable nominal exchange rate , and by encouraging unit labor costs to converge to those in developed economies , China &apos;s real international competitiveness would be better calibrated . 
As a result of policymakers &quot; heavy focus on the exchange rate , China &apos;s State Administration of Foreign Exchange has now accumulated more than $ 4 trillion in reserves - far exceeding the amount needed to cover any imaginable currency emergency . 
Worse , the very act of currency intervention can undermine the PBOC &apos;s control of monetary policy . 
Buying dollars increases the domestic base money supply , risking inflation and asset-price bubbles . 
Efforts to &quot; sterilize &quot; these purchases and dampen domestic credit expansion also have adverse consequences . 
The PBOC frequently does this by selling bonds to commercial banks or raising their reserve requirements . 
But this has reduced these banks &quot; effectiveness as financial intermediaries , while encouraging the rise of shadow banking to circumvent the restrictions . 
What , then , are the PBOC &apos;s options ? 
One approach might be simply to let the renminbi float without official intervention or controls on capital inflows . 
Again , this would inevitably trigger hot-money inflows , with speculators taking advantage of the spread between Chinese interest rates and the near-zero , short-term rates in developed economies , thereby driving up the renminbi further ( and creating yet more opportunities for speculation ) . 
There would be no well-defined market equilibrium , or upper bound , for the renminbi / dollar exchange rate . 
Even without hot-money inflows , the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate would face upward pressure , owing to the absence of corresponding outflows to finance the trade ( saving ) surplus . 
As an immature international creditor , China is unable to balance the inflows by making renminbi loans abroad . 
Nor would it want to make dollar-denominated loans . 
Private banks , insurance companies , pension funds , and so on have limited appetite for building up liquid dollar claims on foreigners when their own liabilities - deposits , insurance claims , and pension obligations - are denominated in renminbi . 
The potential currency mismatch would require the PBOC ( which cares little for exchange-rate risk ) to step in as the international financial intermediary and buy liquid dollar assets on a vast scale . 
Moreover , foreign investors remain reluctant to borrow from Chinese banks in renminbi , or to issue renminbi-denominated bonds in Shanghai . 
That will remain true as long as they fear continued outside political pressure to appreciate . 
China is therefore caught in a currency trap , owing to its own saving surplus ( and America &apos;s saving deficiency ) and near-zero interest rates on dollar assets . 
Although fully liberalizing China &apos;s domestic financial markets and &quot; internationalizing &quot; the renminbi may be possible one day , that day is far off . 
For now , if China tries to liberalize its financial markets , hot money will flow the wrong way - into the economy , rather than out . 
Thus , China must maintain controls on inflows of financial capital for the time being , with the PBOC intervening to stabilize the renminbi / dollar exchange rate . 
Until conditions in the world economy improve substantially , China &apos;s policymakers will have no easy way out . 
But , even if they are constrained , the economy can continue to grow .
