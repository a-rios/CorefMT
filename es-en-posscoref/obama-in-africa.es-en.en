Obama in Africa 
BERKELEY - On July 10 , one very important descendant of black Africa will make a triumphant return to the motherland . 
Scholars speak of &quot; the empire striking back , &quot; referring to former colonized peoples , such as immigrants from Africa and India , settling in Europe and North America and then challenging norms of race and identity . 
In his first official trip to Africa , US President Barack Obama is striking back in a novel way . 
His visit to Ghana highlights the desirability of prominent people from the diaspora making a positive contribution to African affairs . 
But Obama &apos;s visit , while heavy on symbolism , reveals the limits of his power . 
Burdened by economic problems in America and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , he can &apos;t act boldly in Africa or make big promises . 
Indeed , six months into his presidency , he has already undercut expectations . 
He has approached with great caution the task of settling the region &apos;s violent conflicts - in Darfur , eastern Congo , and Somalia . 
He has also kept a safe distance from Africa &apos;s political failures , notably in Zimbabwe , where he has resisted calls to assist in the removal of Robert Mugabe . 
Obama &apos;s caution is reasonable . 
He doesn &apos;t want to be pigeon-holed , after all , as &quot; the president of Africa . &quot; 
Like his predecessors , George W. Bush and Bill Clinton , Obama wants to avoid messy entanglements in Africa &apos;s internal politics . 
Bush did nothing to stop the killings in Darfur or hasten Mugabe &apos;s exit from power . 
Clinton , meanwhile , shamefully abandoned Somalia after the deaths of American soldiers in Mogadishu - and did nothing in the face of Rwanda &apos;s genocide . 
For Obama , Africa so far chiefly remains a backdrop against which he defines his American identity . 
As he explained in his memoir Dreams from My Father , visiting his father &apos;s native Kenya for the first time made him feel more American - and less African - than ever . 
In deciding to visit Ghana , a former British colony and a leading node in the global slave trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , Obama bypassed the Kenya of his father . 
Kenya is embroiled in bitter tribal disputes , and saddled with a brazenly corrupt government . 
By contrast , Ghana represents the sunny side Africa . 
The country recently completed a well-run election in which the opposition took power . 
Its economy is growing . 
Ethnic relations in this highly diverse nation are as good as they are anywhere in the world . 
Obama will be on African soil for a mere two days , during which time he is expected to emphasize America &apos;s role in promoting good governance and non-violence in Africa - goals long high on America &apos;s public agenda . 
Obama &apos;s one new priority - to expand US support for African farmers - reflects a shrewd appreciation of how the expansion of agriculture can quickly lift many rural Africans out of poverty . 
&quot; The administration plans over a number of years to put a substantial amount of money into agricultural development , &quot; Obama &apos;s choice for Secretary of State for African Affairs , Johnnie Carson , said in advance of the president &apos;s trip . 
Don &apos;t expect Obama to confront the most controversial aspect of US relations with Africa : the American military &apos;s new African command . 
Bush , who created the command , gave the US Department of Defense new powers to work on civilian issues in Africa and to expand its military partnerships with governments in the region . 
Obama isn &apos;t likely to say whether he &apos;ll scale back the US military role in the region , or whether America &apos;s growing reliance on African oil is the real reason - not Obama &apos;s heritage - for wooing Africans . 
Obama &apos;s lack of candor won &apos;t hurt him in the US , where domestic political calculations take precedence . 
In truth , his visit to Africa is a reward to his stalwart African-American supporters , who voted overwhelmingly for him in the November election and who remain one pillar of his base . 
For African-Americans , Ghana has special meaning . 
The country played an important role in the push for civil rights in America , for instance . 
In 1957 , when legal segregation seemed entrenched in the US , Ghana &apos;s first president , Kwame Nkrumah , used the occasion of his country &apos;s independence from Britain to highlight the injustices experienced daily by black Americans . 
He invited Martin Luther King , Jr. to his inauguration , giving the Atlanta-based civil rights leader a global platform for the first time . 
Malcolm X , the black nationalist leader , visited Ghana two years later , and again in 1964 . 
Nkrumah invited W.E.B. Du Bois , the most important black intellectual of the twentieth century , to Ghana in 1961 . 
Du Bois became a citizen and lived in Ghana until his death . 
Hundreds of African-Americans live year round in Ghana today , some within a short walk of Cape Coast Castle , the slaving fort that shipped human cargo until Britain halted the trade in 1807 . 
Learned and deeply reflective , Obama knows that black Americans will view his visit to Ghana very differently than white Americans will . 
His tendency to view Africa through an American lens is thus both understandable and inevitable . 
Yet his African roots give him a unique capacity to transform American relations with Africa , elevating the importance of African self-reliance and achievement , while striving to make American aid more intelligent and effective .
