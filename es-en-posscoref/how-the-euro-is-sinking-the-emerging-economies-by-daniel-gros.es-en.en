Emerging Markets &quot; Euro Nemesis 
BRUSSELS - Emerging markets &quot; currencies are crashing , and their central banks are busy tightening policy , trying to stabilize their countries &quot; financial markets . 
Who is to blame for this state of affairs ? 
A few years ago , when the US Federal Reserve embarked on yet another round of &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; some emerging-market leaders complained loudly . 
They viewed the Fed &apos;s open-ended purchases of long-term securities as an attempt to engineer a competitive devaluation of the dollar and worried that ultra-easy monetary conditions in the United States would unleash a flood of &quot; hot money &quot; inflows , driving up their exchange rates . 
This , they feared , would not only diminish their export competitiveness and push their external accounts into deficit ; it would also expose them to the harsh consequences of a sudden stop in capital inflows when US policymakers reversed course . 
At first sight , these fears appear to have been well founded . 
As the title of a recent paper published by the International Monetary Fund succinctly puts it , &quot; Capital Flows are Fickle : Anytime , Anywhere . &quot; 
The mere announcement that the Fed might scale down its unconventional monetary-policy operations has led to today &apos;s capital flight from emerging markets . 
But this view misses the real reason why capital flowed into emerging markets over the last few years , and why the external accounts of so many of them have swung into deficit . 
The real culprit is the euro . 
Quantitative easing in the US cannot have been behind these large swings in global current-account balances , because America &apos;s external deficit has not changed significantly in recent years . 
This is also what one would expect from economic theory : in conditions approaching a liquidity trap , the impact of unconventional monetary policies on financial conditions and demand is likely to be modest . 
Indeed , the available models tell us that , to the extent that an expansionary monetary policy actually does have an impact on the economy , its effect on the current account should not be large , because any positive effect on exports from a weaker exchange rate should be offset by larger imports due to the increase in domestic demand . 
This is what has happened in the US , and its recent economic revival has been accompanied by an expansion of both exports and imports . 
The impact of the various rounds of quantitative easing on emerging markets ( and on the rest of the world ) has thus been approximately neutral . 
But austerity in Europe has had a profound impact on the eurozone &apos;s current account , which has swung from a deficit of almost $ 100 billion in 2008 to a surplus of almost $ 300 billion this year . 
This was a consequence of the sudden stop of capital flows to the eurozone &apos;s southern members , which forced these countries to turn their current accounts from a combined deficit of $ 300 billion five years ago to a small surplus today . 
Because the external-surplus countries of the eurozone &apos;s north , Germany and Netherlands , did not expand their demand , the eurozone overall is now running the world &apos;s largest current-account surplus - exceeding even that of China , which has long been accused of engaging in competitive currency manipulation . 
This extraordinary swing of almost $ 400 billion in the eurozone &apos;s current-account balance did not result from a &quot; competitive devaluation &quot; ; the euro has remained strong . 
So the real reason for the eurozone &apos;s large external surplus today is that internal demand has been so weak that imports have been practically stagnant over the last five years ( the average annual growth rate was a paltry 0.25 % ) . 
The cause of this state of affairs , in one word , is austerity . 
Weak demand in Europe is the real reason why emerging markets &quot; current accounts deteriorated ( and , with the exception of China , swung into deficit ) . 
Thus , if anything , emerging-market leaders should have complained about European austerity , not about US quantitative easing . 
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s talk of &quot; tapering &quot; quantitative easing might have triggered the current bout of instability ; but emerging markets &quot; underlying vulnerability was made in Europe . 
The fickleness of capital markets poses once again the paradox of thrift . 
As capital withdraws from emerging markets , these countries soon will be forced to adopt their own austerity measures and run current-account surpluses , much like the eurozone periphery today . 
But who will then be able - and willing - to run deficits ? 
Two of the world &apos;s three largest economies come to mind : China , given the strength of its balance sheet , and the eurozone , given the euro &apos;s status as a reserve currency . 
But both appear committed to running large surpluses ( indeed , the two largest in the world ) . 
This implies that , unless the US resumes its role as consumer of last resort , the latest bout of financial-market jitters will weaken the global economy again . 
And any global recovery promises to be unbalanced - that is , if it materializes at all .
