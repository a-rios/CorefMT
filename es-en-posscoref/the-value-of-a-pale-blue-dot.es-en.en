The Value of a Pale Blue Dot 
Melbourne - The eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote : &quot; Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence , the more often and more steadily we meditate upon them : the starry firmament above and the moral law within . &quot; 
This year , the 400th anniversary of Galileo &apos;s first use of a telescope , has been declared the International Year of Astronomy , so this seems a good time to ponder Kant &apos;s first source of &quot; awe and reverence . &quot; 
Indeed , the goal of the commemoration - to help the world &apos;s citizens &quot; rediscover their place in the universe &quot; - now has the incidental benefit of distracting us from nasty things nearer to home , like swine flu and the global financial crisis . 
What does astronomy tell us about &quot; the starry firmament above &quot; ? 
By expanding our grasp of the vastness of the universe , science has , if anything , increased the awe and reverence we feel when we look up on a starry night ( assuming , that is , that we have got far enough away from air pollution and excessive street lighting to see the stars properly ) . 
But , at the same time , our greater knowledge surely forces us to acknowledge that our place in the universe is not particularly significant . 
In his essay &quot; Dreams and Facts , &quot; the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that our entire Milky Way galaxy is a tiny fragment of the universe , and within this fragment our solar system is &quot; an infinitesimal speck , &quot; and within this speck &quot; our planet is a microscopic dot . &quot; 
Today , we don &apos;t need to rely on such verbal descriptions of our planet &apos;s insignificance against the background of our galaxy . 
The astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that the Voyager space probe capture an image of earth as it reached the outer reaches of our solar system . 
It did so , in 1990 , and Earth shows up in a grainy image as a pale blue dot . 
If you go to YouTube and search for &quot; Carl Sagan - Pale Blue Dot , &quot; you can see it , and hear Sagan himself telling us that we must cherish our world because everything humans have ever valued exists only on that pale blue dot . 
That is a moving experience , but what should we learn from it ? 
Russell sometimes wrote as if the fact that we are a mere speck in a vast universe showed that we don &apos;t really matter all that much : &quot; On this dot , tiny lumps of impure carbon and water , of complicated structure , with somewhat unusual physical and chemical properties , crawl about for a few years , until they are dissolved again into the elements of which they are compounded . &quot; 
But no such nihilistic view of our existence follows from the size of our planetary home , and Russell himself was no nihilist . 
He thought that it was important to confront the fact of our insignificant place in the universe , because he did not want us to live under the illusory comfort of a belief that somehow the world had been created for our sake , and that we are under the benevolent care of an all-powerful creator . 
&quot; Dreams and Facts &quot; concludes with these stirring words : &quot; No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is ; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness . &quot; 
After World War II , when the world was divided into nuclear-armed camps threatening each other with mutual destruction , Russell did not take the view that our insignificance , when considered against the vastness of the universe , meant that the end of life on Earth did not matter . On the contrary , he made nuclear disarmament the chief focus of his political activity for the remainder of his life . 
Sagan took a similar view . 
While seeing the Earth as a whole diminishes the importance of things like national boundaries that divide us , he said , it also &quot; underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another , and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot; 
Al Gore used the &quot; pale blue dot &quot; image at the end of his film , An Inconvenient Truth , suggesting that if we wreck this planet , we have nowhere else to go . 
That &apos;s probably true , even though scientists are now discovering other planets outside our solar system . 
Perhaps one day we will find that we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe , and perhaps we will be able to discuss issues of interspecies ethics with such beings . 
This brings us back to Kant &apos;s other object of reverence and awe , the moral law within . What would beings with a completely different evolutionary origin from us - perhaps not even carbon-based life forms - think of our moral law ?
