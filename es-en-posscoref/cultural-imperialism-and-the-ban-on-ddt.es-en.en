Cultural Imperialism and the Ban on DDT 
The UN Environment Program ( UNEP ) is embarked on a misguided campaign to ban the pesticide DDT under its Persistent Organic Pollutants ( POPs ) Framework Convention . 
Tropical countries that sign this convention will seriously damage the health of their peoples . 
DDT is the most cost-effective agent ever produced for the control of diseases spread by flies and mosquitoes . 
The US National Academy of Sciences estimates that DDT saved 500 million lives from malaria before 1970 . 
In India , effective spraying virtually eliminated the disease by the 1960s . 
The number of malaria cases fell from 75 million in 1951 to 50,000 in 1961 , and the number of malaria deaths from a million in the 1940 &apos;s to a few thousand in the 1960s . 
The mosquito nets ubiquitous in my childhood disappeared from urban houses by the time I was at university in the late 1950s . 
Then , in the 1970s , largely as a result of an environmental scare promoted by Rachel Carson &apos;s book Silent Spring , foreign aid agencies and UN organizations stopped promoting DDT , and its usage declined . 
Mosquitoes soon hit back and endemic malaria returned to India . 
By 1997 the UNDP estimates that there were 2.6 million malaria cases . 
The same story can be told about kala-azar , which is spread by the sand fly . 
DDT largely rid India of kala-azar in the 1950s and 1960s . 
With the decline in DDT use it returned . 
According to the State minister of health in Bihar , kala-azar has since afflicted 12,000 people in 30 districts , killing 408 . 
Why did DDT fall into disfavor ? 
The DDT scare started with Carson &apos;s claim that its use had devastating effects on bird life . 
It was also blamed for causing hepatitis in humans . 
But numerous scientific studies showed that these fears were baseless . 
DDT was shown to cause death in humans only if eaten like pancakes ! 
Commission after commission , expert after Nobel prize-winning expert , gave DDT a clean bill of health . 
In 1971 , Philip Handler , then the president of the US National Academy of Science , called DDT is &quot; the greatest chemical that has ever been discovered . &quot; 
Yet in 1972 , President Nixon &apos;s head of the US Environmental Protection Agency banned it . 
Most developed countries followed America &apos;s lead , with developing countries proscribing its use in agriculture , and some for all purposes . 
If both science and economics favor DDT , why has the ban spread ? 
The environmental movement &apos;s supposedly key concept is &quot; sustainable development . &quot; 
This was endorsed in the report Our Common Future by the World Commission on Environment and Development , whose chair , Norway &apos;s then Prime Minister , Gro Harlem Bruntland , now heads the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . 
The notion of sustainability asserts that natural capital , such as forests , wildlife , and other natural resources cannot be substituted by manmade capital . 
As pesticides are assumed to have adverse effects on natural capital they are inconsistent with sustainable development . 
Instead of using them to control bugs , bed nets and drugs to fight the disease should be used . 
Advocates of this position go on to deploy the so-called &quot; precautionary principle &quot; to counter the argument that there is no scientific evidence that DDT spraying damages natural capital . 
The precautionary principle is a variant on Pascal &apos;s famous wager on the existence of God . 
As Paul Ehrlich put it in 1968 in his book The Population Bomb , &quot; If I &apos;m right , we will save the world &#91; by curbing population growth &#93; . 
If I &apos;m wrong , people will still be better-fed , better-housed , and happier thanks to our efforts . 
Will anything be lost if it turns out later that we can support a much larger population than seems possible today ? &quot; 
The late Julian Simon provided a tart response to this bit of weak reasoning . 
Simon noted that Pascal &apos;s wager was very different : &quot; Live as if there is God , because even if there is no God you have lost nothing . 
Pascal &apos;s wager applies entirely to one person . 
No one else loses if he or she is wrong . 
But Ehrlich bets what he thinks will be the economic gains that we and our descendants might enjoy against the unborn &apos;s very lives . 
Would he make the same wager if his own life rather than other lives were at stake ? &quot; 
Environmentalists ban DDT because they are willing to sacrifice human lives for those of birds . 
This underlying misanthropy is revealed by Ehrlich &apos;s statement about India : &quot; I came to understand the population explosion emotionally one stinking hot night in Delhi .... 
The streets seemed alive with people . 
People eating , people washing , people sleeping , people visiting , arguing , and screaming . 
People thrusting their hands through the taxi window , begging . 
People defecating and urinating . 
People clinging to buses . 
People herding animals . 
People , people , people . &quot; 
Not surprisingly , many environmentalists argue that , in the words of one : &quot; It may be unkind to keep people dying from malaria so that they could die more slowly of starvation . 
&#91; Malaria may even be &#93; a blessing in disguise , since a large proportion of the malaria belt is not suited to agriculture , and the disease has helped to keep man from destroying it - and from wasting his substance on it . &quot; 
The environmental movement is a new secular Christian creed , for which saving Spaceship Earth has replaced saving souls . 
It must be resisted as fiercely as the Christian crusaders of yore . 
There is no better place to begin than with countries refusing to join the UNEP Convention or kowtow to its ban on DDT use .
