The Solid but Regrettable Argument for Israel \ u0027s Security Fence 
The International Court of Justice has completed its hearings on the legality of the barrier Israel is building in the occupied West Bank . 
This is an isolated question among many larger issues that await a negotiated peace agreement . 
Who has the right to what land ? 
Do Palestinian refugees and their descendants have a right to go back to what is now Israel ? 
Do Jews have a right to settle in the West Bank ? 
Basic issues of justice  -  such as the right of each side to live with dignity and security  -  are , of course , important in any peace agreement . 
Even so , now that the issue has been put before the Court , it must be discussed . 
Although the world expects a negative decision , Israel can in fact muster a sound legal case . 
If the fence followed the 1967 boundary there would be few objections . 
The argument against the fence on the West Bank assumes that the settlers are there illegally and therefore are not entitled to the protection of a defensive barrier . 
As the Jordanians put it in their written submission , &quot; no right of self ‑ defense . . . can be invoked in order to defend that which is itself unlawful . &quot; 
There is something clearly wrong with that argument . 
As a political matter , I oppose the settlements . 
Most , if not all , of them will have to come down in the ultimate compromise that will emerge someday . 
To be sure , Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that an occupying government &quot; shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies . &quot; 
At least until recently , the international community assumed this to be the likely reading of Article 49 because , in drafting the crimes subject to prosecution in the International Criminal Court , the concept of transfer was expanded to include the Occupying Power &apos;s &quot; direct and indirect transfer &quot; of its population into occupied territories . 
This language , in force since July 2002 , arguably applies to official Israeli policies aimed at promoting &quot; indirect transfer &quot; by providing financial incentives to voluntary settlers . 
Suppose that in this limited sense the settlements are unlawful . 
Does that mean that the settlers are sitting ducks who can be attacked with impunity and have no right to defend themselves ? 
To say yes is to subscribe to a curious concept of collective responsibility . 
Even if some Israeli officials are guilty of a crime in encouraging settlements , does that mean that the settlers must be viewed as complicit ? 
True , some made an ideological choice to colonize &quot; Judea and Samaria , &quot; as they call it , but others are ordinary people seeking better housing and a better life for their families . 
Their motives are too diverse to be reduced to any single stereotype . 
Indeed , some settlements are more than 25 years old and many settlers are a second or third generation of people living in the region . 
Are they , as well as children brought there by their parents , collectively guilty just because some government officials might have violated the Rome Statute since July 2002 ? 
Further , even if the conduct of Israeli officials is judged to be illegal , and even if some settlers are willing tools of Israeli policy , civilian settlers cannot lose their right of self ‑ defense  -  certainly not against terrorists who are violating international law by targeting innocent people both inside of Israel and in the occupied territories . 
The only way in which civilians could ever lose the right of self ‑ defense would be if they , as individuals , were engaged in actions threatening imminent harm to others . 
Whatever one thinks of the settlers , they , in their daily routine , are not engaged in a pattern of threatening to kill or assault anyone . 
So if the settlers have a right to self ‑ defense , is the fence an acceptable means of realizing that right ? 
Although it imposes hardships on others , the fence is a plausible means of protection against suicide bombers . 
It is neither disproportionate nor excessive . 
The best argument that the Palestinians could make against the fence is to make it unnecessary by suppressing suicide bombings . 
Someday , Israel &apos;s adversaries will abandon their policy of homicidal self ‑ destruction . 
When they do , there will be a very good legal and moral case for the fence to come down . 
The legal case for the fence is solid but regrettable . 
The fence is not only a physical reminder of the divide between the area &apos;s peoples , but also a cause of suffering for innocent Palestinians who are cut off from their fields , their jobs , and their families . 
The fence assumes that they , as a people , are the source of the deadly threats to the settlers . 
Thus reigns the collectivist mentality that drives the unending feud between Jews and Palestinians . 
Not all Jews are guilty for the actions of a clique that might have violated international law . 
Nor should all Palestinians suffer as though they acted as a single entity , posing a collective terrorist threat . 
Only negotiations , not legal bickering , can put an end to this iniquity .
