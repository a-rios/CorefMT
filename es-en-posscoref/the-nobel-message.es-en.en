The Nobel Message 
Al Gore &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize is a fitting tribute to a world leader who has been prescient , bold , and skillful in alerting the world to the dangers of manmade climate change . 
Gore &apos;s co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize is less known , but no less deserving . 
The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) is the UN &apos;s global body for assessing the scientific knowledge on climate change and bringing that knowledge to the attention of the public and the world &apos;s policy makers . 
Its receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize sends three powerful messages . 
First , the world &apos;s leading climate scientists and most of the world &apos;s governments have brought climate science to the forefront of global policy debates . 
Climate change is complicated . 
Mastering the subject requires expertise in many scientific fields , including climatology , oceanography , atmospheric chemistry , ecology , engineering , politics , and economics . 
No lone scientist or national team can do this . 
A worldwide effort is needed to understand changes in all parts of the world . 
Since its inception in 1988 , the IPCC has harnessed the best scientific minds from around the world to document and explain what is known and not known about human-induced climate change . 
Various working groups prepare reports by scrupulously reviewing scientific publications . 
The review process is transparent and governments are invited to participate by nominating experts to various working groups , reviewing and commenting on IPCC draft documents , and approving final IPCC reports . 
This process builds accuracy and confidence . 
Years are required for each major IPCC report , including the &quot; Fourth Assessment Report , &quot; which was completed this year . 
One reason for the IPCC &apos;s notable success has been the skilled guiding hand of the IPCC Chairman , Dr. R. K. Pachauri , who will accept the prize on the body &apos;s behalf . 
The second message is that such a global process linking scientists and governments in a common effort is vital , because without it the airwaves can get clogged with the ignorance and misinformation peddled by special interest groups . 
For years , oil companies such as Exxon tried to pretend that climate change wasn &apos;t real or that the risks were exaggerated . 
Exxon and others sponsored misleading journalism and groups that masqueraded as &quot; think tanks . &quot; 
The IPCC faced down these vested interests . 
Today , ExxonMobil and other major oil companies are much more honest and constructive in their discussions of the issues . 
They could not , in the long-term , beat the science without gravely damaging their reputations . 
Finally , this year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize is a wake-up call to governments , starting with the United States , to get more serious about science and sustainable development . 
The Bush administration has been disastrously anti-scientific . 
It has been staffed with ideologues who reject or neglect climate science , and who set the US on a dangerous and irresponsible path . 
Today , Bush has begun to acknowledge the serious risks of climate change , though his administration has still failed to put forward any realistic proposals to reduce the rate of human-induced climate change . 
Most governments are in fact ill-equipped to understand the scientific issues , even when they are much less ideological and dogmatic than Bush . 
Governments tend to be organized according to nineteenth- or twentieth-century topics such as diplomacy , defense , internal security , and finance , not twenty-first century challenges such as sustainable development . 
They are mostly unable to harness advanced scientific knowledge to protect their citizens or participate in global negotiations on the challenges of climate , water , energy , biodiversity , and the like . 
The world should respond in three ways . 
First , we should take seriously the need for a new climate-change accord when global negotiations begin in Bali , Indonesia this December . 
The weak and only partly implemented Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 , and the world requires a much stronger framework , one that sets a strong target for stabilizing greenhouse gases by 2050 by including agreements on ending tropical deforestation , developing high-mileage automobiles , and shifting to low CO2-emitting power plants . 
Second , we should initiate IPCC-like scientific processes for other global challenges , including the global loss of biodiversity , desertification , and over-fishing of the oceans . 
In each area , the general public and the world &apos;s governments only dimly perceive a global crisis . 
Governments have signed treaties to limit the damage , but they are not acting on those promises with the urgency required , in part because they do not understand the underlying scientific challenges . 
Finally , we must revamp national governments so that they have processes and capabilities similar to the IPCC . 
Global processes like the IPCC are crucial , but the issues must also be &quot; brought home &quot; to the conditions and challenges facing each country . 
Virtually all countries will face a host of intersecting challenges from climate change , such as overhauling the energy sector and adjusting to changing patterns of rainfall , storms , droughts , and floods . 
The IPCC proved that science can contribute powerfully to meeting these challenges , and that scientists and policymakers can work together to help solve problems of critical importance for humanity .
