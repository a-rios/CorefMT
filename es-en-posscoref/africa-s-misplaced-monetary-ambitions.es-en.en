Africa &apos;s Misplaced Monetary Ambitions 
DAKAR - Sub-Saharan African is in the grip of currency-union mania . 
Regional groups of countries in eastern , southern , and western Africa are all giving priority to the idea of creating a monetary union . 
But haven &apos;t we heard this all before in Africa ? 
Indeed , today &apos;s enthusiasm for currency unions ignores the poor track record of previous attempts on the continent to establish them through peaceful means . 
A common currency requires unified and centrally agreed monetary and fiscal policies . 
But this necessitates political integration , which , as the troubles of the euro this year have demonstrated , is a hard sell among nation-states . 
Before the euro &apos;s arrival on the international financial scene in 1999 , the only examples of countries with common currencies were neo-colonial francophone Africa and nineteenth-century precedents like the Latin American and Scandinavian monetary unions . 
The creation of the CFA franc , which gives France control of 65 % of the CFA countries &quot; foreign-exchange reserves , combined currency convertibility with a grossly overvalued parity - pegged first to the French franc and now to the euro - as well as trade barriers . 
This led only to structural deficits , vast capital flight , and , in 1994 , a 100 % devaluation . 
Yet , despite the difficulties that have bedeviled the CFA ( and the euro of late ) - indeed , despite the absence of viable regional customs unions ( except in the East African Community ) , let alone a single market - Africans retain a strong allegiance to the idea of a currency union . 
That allegiance is misplaced . 
At this stage of their economic development , with its focus on commodity exports , the priority for Africa &apos;s countries should be long-term economic integration , not currency union . 
Here , the model to follow is not the euro , but Latin America &apos;s Southern Common Market ( Mercosur ) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) . 
Both regional groupings have , by lowering trade barriers , delivered a real catalyst to economic growth . 
Mercosur &apos;s member countries have adopted a strategy that prioritizes the creation of a free-trade area . 
They steered clear of establishing a heavy budget-fueled bureaucracy , leaving respective ministries to handle administering the accord . In 2008 , Mercosur intra-regional exports reached $ 41.6 billion , up by 28.4 % from 2007 . 
The external trade of Paraguay , Argentina , and Brazil within the area amounted , respectively , to 65 % , 33 % , and 15 % of their total exports . 
The other major advantage of such regional groupings has been their ability to attract foreign direct investment . Since the early 1990 &quot; s , Mercosur has managed to mobilize 5.9 % of world FDI inflows . 
In 2008 , it attracted a record $ 56 billion in FDI , an increase of 31.5 % from 2007 . Moreover , cross-investment between Mercosur member countries has led to greater economic integration . Argentina is now Brazil &apos;s second-largest trading partner , behind the United States , while Brazil is Argentina &apos;s largest trading partner , ahead of the US . 
The seven member countries of ASEAN decided to implement economic &quot; roadmaps &quot; defining integration priorities , a testimony to their determination to achieve a single economic community . 
A currency union , however , is not high on the agenda . 
In 2009 , ASEAN regional trade represented 24.6 % of its members &quot; total exports and 24.3 % of total imports . 
By contrast , trade among African countries accounts for only about 10-12 % of the continent &apos;s exports and imports . 
But , partly because several African countries have escaped the hang-over from the global credit crisis , more investors are focusing on business opportunities there . 
By 2050 , the combined GDP of the largest 11 African economies should reach more than $ 13 trillion , surpassing Brazil and Russia ( but not China or India ) . 
For some analysts , the emergence of countries like Brazil as economic powerhouses stems partly from successful demutualization of their stock exchanges . 
Twenty-three bourses are currently operating in Africa , and their combined market capitalization has soared from $ 245 billion in 2002 to $ 1 trillion ( 2 % of the world total ) at the end of 2009 - as high as the fifteenth-largest stock exchange in the world . 
With a volume of $ 800 billion , the Johannesburg Stock Exchange alone accounts for 80 % of the total and ranks 19th worldwide . 
Nigeria plans to demutualize its stock exchange in order to establish it among the prime destinations for frontier investors . 
Africa stands to benefit from a massive economic turnaround , provided that the right environment for sustainable growth and rising productivity is created . 
This requires consistent macroeconomic policies focused on economic integration , food self-sufficiency , low inflation , and reduced debt . 
It also requires political stability , eradication of corruption , enhanced rule of law , improvement of basic levels of education , and greater use of mobile telephones and the Internet . 
What it does not require is a currency union . 
When it comes to exchange rates , the members of Africa &apos;s economic groupings would be better off linking their currencies in regional monetary systems to prevent large fluctuations relative to one another .
