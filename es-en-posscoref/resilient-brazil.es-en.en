Resilient Brazil 
SÃO PAULO - Less than a decade ago , Brazil &apos;s economy faltered at the first sign of instability in international financial markets . 
Today , by contrast , the country seems immune from global market turbulence - or so Brazilian officials believe . 
&quot; The sub-prime crisis hasn &apos;t yet reached the beaches of Copacabana , &quot; Finance Minister Guido Mantega recently proclaimed . 
&quot; We are growing free of imbalances and , in fact , gradually reducing our dependence on inflows of foreign exchange - that &apos;s key . &quot; 
Indeed , the government has emphasized that Brazil will be even more insulated as efforts to cut spending reduce dependence on external capital flows . 
But Brazil &apos;s ability to escape the effects of a recession in the United States depends on the scale of the crisis . 
Brazilian officials do have some reasons to boast that Latin America &apos;s largest economy may be stronger than ever : macroeconomic indicators are healthier , solvency ratios have improved , and a mix of exports , investment , and domestic demand has been stimulating economic activity . 
During the recent years of abundant global liquidity , the real grew stronger and the central bank was able to pile up foreign reserves , creating a cushion that totaled roughly $ 185 billion in late January , an amount sufficient to cover the entire foreign debt for the first time in history . 
With foreign direct investment still flowing in , Brazil &apos;s lower external vulnerability leaves the country in a much better position than ever before to weather the global storm - at least for now . 
Nevertheless , government officials admit , off the record , that the impact of an expected US recession will not be insignificant , because Brazil is not fully protected from external events . 
Beyond the sub-prime crisis , concerns about the US financial system &apos;s stability carry serious implications for the global economy . 
Moreover , a recession or a slowdown in the US and Europe would hit Brazilian exports , narrowing Brazil &apos;s trade surplus considerably . 
In fact , although America &apos;s trade significance has diminished , accounting for only 16 % of Brazilian exports last year , Brazilian trade and growth typically go hand in hand with the US and Europe ; historically they have never decoupled . 
At the same time , an extended US slowdown could reduce foreign demand from other markets . 
The scenario could worsen if there is a breakdown in commodity prices - one of the most serious threats to Brazil from a global economic slump . 
Deceleration in India and China would lead to further cuts in prices for raw materials , weakening markets whose strength has underpinned Brazil &apos;s powerful trade performance in recent years . 
In any case , the central bank has already projected that Brazil &apos;s trade surplus will disappear this year , with a small deficit expected . 
Fortunately , Brazil &apos;s stock exchange has suffered less than other emerging-market bourses from the financial turbulence in the US and elsewhere . 
Recently , the exchange has become the prime source of financing for Brazilian companies , ahead of the state-owned National Development Bank , which grants loans at below-market rates . 
But Brazil &apos;s financial markets are much more sensitive than trade to international disturbances , and monetary flows could decrease in the long term . 
Indeed , should the global economy deteriorate further , outward portfolio investment could accelerate , reducing the financing available to Brazilian corporations and eventually affecting their ability to invest . 
So far , business confidence is still high in the industrial sector , according to internal surveys conducted by the São Paulo Association of Industries , and inward FDI hit a record-high US $ 34.6bn last year . 
Optimistically , Brazilian officials believe that the government &apos;s Growth Acceleration Program will serve as a vaccine against global turbulence and help reduce bottlenecks in the economy . 
The positive growth outlook , following an estimated 5.1 % GDP gain in 2007 , is presented as a reliable defense against external contagion . 
Nevertheless , the devil is in the details . 
Global turmoil could derail Brazil &apos;s expansion . 
New obstacles for the Brazilian economy could lead to softening domestic growth and the internalization of inflation , bringing the crisis home . 
Consequently , although the current crisis is expected to have a relatively minor effect compared to past upheavals , the possibility of contagion from turbulence in the US cannot be disregarded . 
It is therefore essential that Brazil &apos;s private and public sectors do their utmost to sustain long-term growth by making the economic environment more business-friendly . 
Beyond that , one can only hope that current external economic disturbances do not lead to a global disaster .
