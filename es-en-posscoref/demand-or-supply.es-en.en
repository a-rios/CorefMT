Demand or Supply ? 
CHICAGO - Economics is all about demand and supply . 
Typically , the two are equal , and , if not , powerful forces push them towards each other . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration seems to think that the problem is one of demand , and has passed stimulus measure after stimulus measure , reducing taxes and increasing transfers and government spending in order to boost consumption and investment . 
The Federal Reserve is of a similar mind , not only maintaining rock-bottom short-term interest rates , but also embarking on an adventurous policy targeting long-term rates . 
Some progressive economists want even more . 
Why have these policies not worked thus far in bringing down unemployment , even though the growth recovery is well under way ? 
The progressive economist says that stimulus worked , staving off a much deeper recession - if not worse - but that the measures were too timid to generate a robust recovery . 
The conservative economist responds that it is precisely because the government has become so free with taxpayers &quot; money that households , fearful of future taxes , are hunkering down and increasing savings . 
Moreover , the increasingly activist government has left businesses uneasy about future regulatory and tax measures , and thus reluctant to invest . 
The truth probably lies somewhere in between . 
Government spending - especially on unemployment benefits , aid to states , and some construction projects - probably helped avert a more wrenching downturn , but continued red ink worries households , which are also trying to rebuild savings and reduce debt after a spending binge . 
The regulatory uncertainty created in areas such as health care makes it difficult not only for the health-care industry to make long-term investment decisions , but also for businesses to make long-term hires . 
Nevertheless , before rushing to judgment about current policy , we should recognize the trend in recent US recoveries of slow job growth . 
From the trough of the recession , the economy recovered the lost jobs in eight months on average . 
The recoveries from the recessions of 1991 and 2001 were very different . 
For instance , in 2001 , it took just one quarter for output to recover , but 38 months for jobs to come back . 
Explanations abound . 
Some economists argue that , unlike past recessions , in which workers were temporarily laid off from an industry only to be rehired as the recovery picked up , job losses starting in 1991 were more permanent . 
Matters were exacerbated by firms &quot; postponement until a recession of hard choices about closing unviable plants and shedding workers . 
As a result , unemployed workers had to find jobs in new industries , which took more time and training . 
Others suggest that the Internet has made it easier for firms to hire quickly . 
So , rather than hire in a panic at the first sign of recovery , as they did in the past , for fear that they will be unable to do so later and lose sales , firms today would rather ensure that the recovery is well established before hiring . 
Hence also the growth in temporary hires today . 
Regardless of what the right explanation is , the history of recent recessions suggests that we should not be surprised that the job recovery is taking time . 
There is , however , an aspect of the problem that is different this time : layoffs in construction . 
In the last boom , construction jobs expanded significantly , with investment in housing as a share of GDP increasing by 50 % from 1997 to 2006 . 
As my colleague Erik Hurst and his co-authors have shown , states that had the largest rise in construction as a share of GDP in 2000-2006 tended to have the greatest contraction in that industry in 2006-2009 . 
These states also tended to have the largest rise in unemployment rates between 2006 and 2009 . 
The unemployed comprise not only construction workers , but also ancillary workers , such as real-estate brokers and bankers , as well as all those who work on houses , such as plumbers and electricians . 
So the job losses extend far beyond those in the construction industry . 
It is hard to believe that any increase in aggregate demand will boost the housing market - which , remember , was buoyed by visions of steady price appreciation that few seem likely to hold today - sufficiently to re-employ all these workers . 
Hurst estimates that this &quot; structural &quot; unemployment may account for up to three percentage points of total unemployment . 
In other words , were it not for construction , the US unemployment rate would be 6.5 % - a far healthier situation than today . 
Policymakers should remember that the housing boom was fueled by easy monetary policy , which sought to expand job growth as the US recovered from the last recession . 
Indeed , high-school graduation rates dropped in Las Vegas as people left school for readily available unskilled construction jobs . 
Now those uneducated unemployed are experiencing more than three times the unemployment rate of college graduates . 
The lesson for policymakers is clear : instead of constantly trying to boost spending and potentially creating problems for the future , a more sustainable way to improve job growth is to facilitate the &quot; re-skilling &quot; of the unemployed , especially those who were in construction-related jobs . 
Eventually , better labor-force supply will create healthier and more sustainable demand .
