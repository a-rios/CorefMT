The Next American Leader 
Cambridge  -  
The fact that the final three contenders included a woman , an African-American , and an older man who often challenged his own party suggests that the United States , after a decline in popularity during the Bush years , retains a capacity to reinvent itself . 
But the next president will need to recognize that the nature of leadership also is changing . 
The information revolution is transforming politics and organizations . 
Hierarchies are becoming flatter , and knowledge workers respond to different incentives and political appeals . 
Polls show that people today have become less deferential to authority in organizations and in politics . 
Soft power - the ability to get what you want by attraction rather than coercion or payment - is becoming more important . 
Even the military faces these changes . 
The Pentagon reports that American army drillmasters do &quot; less shouting at everyone , &quot; because today &apos;s generation responds better to instructors who play &quot; a more counseling-type role . &quot; 
Military success against terrorists and insurgents requires soldiers to win hearts and minds , not just break bodies . 
Leadership theorists speak of &quot; shared leadership &quot; and &quot; distributed leadership , &quot; and suggest images of leaders in the center of a circle rather than atop a hierarchy . 
Of course , the hard power of command remains important . 
Hard and soft power are related , because they are both approaches to achieving one &apos;s objectives by affecting the behavior of others . 
Sometimes people are attracted to others with command power by myths of invincibility . 
As Osama bin Laden put it in one of his videos , &quot; when people see a strong horse and a weak horse , by nature they will like the strong horse . &quot; 
Sometimes , intimidators have a vision , belief in their cause , and a reputation for success that attracts others despite their bullying behavior . 
Consider Admiral Hyman Rickover , the father of America &apos;s nuclear navy . 
Rickover was a small man , far from the top of his class at the US Naval Academy , who did not look like a warrior or swashbuckling sea captain . 
His leadership success came from his bureaucratic skill in cultivating Congressional support and obtaining resources , and from a rigid discipline that tolerated no failures among his officers . 
The result was an efficient and accident-free nuclear submarine force that developed a mystique of success and attracted bright young officers . 
Able people wanted to join him because Rickover was renowned for implementing an important strategic vision , not because he was a nice boss . 
Hard and soft power can reinforce or undermine each other . 
In response to al-Qaeda &apos;s terrorist attacks on the US , Vice President Dick Cheney argued that strong military action would deter further attacks . 
Certainly , the hard power of military and police force was necessary to counter al-Qaeda , but the indiscriminate use of hard power - illustrated by the invasion of Iraq , the Abu Ghraib prison photos , and detentions without trial - served to increase the number of terrorist recruits . 
The absence of an effective soft power component undercut the strategic response to terrorism . 
Almost every leader needs a certain degree of soft power . 
The great leadership theorist James McGregor Burns once argued that those who rely on coercion are not leaders , but mere wielders of power . 
Thus , in his view , Hitler was not a leader . 
But even tyrants and despots such as Hitler need a degree of soft power , at least within their inner circle . 
No individual is strong enough to coerce everyone else . 
A dictator must attract or induce henchmen to impose his coercive techniques on others . 
At the same time , except for some religious leaders , such as the Dalai Lama , soft power is rarely sufficient , while leaders who only court popularity may be reluctant to exercise hard power when they should . 
Alternatively , leaders who throw their weight around without regard to the effects on their soft power may find others placing obstacles in the way of their hard power . 
Indeed , psychologists have found that too much assertiveness by a leader worsens relationships , just as too little limits achievement . 
In the words of CEO Jeff Immelt , &quot; when you run General Electric , there are 7-12 times a year when you have to say , &quot; you &apos;re doing it my way . &quot; 
If you do it 18 times , the good people will leave . 
If you do it three times , the company falls apart . &quot; 
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved . 
He may have been correct , but we sometimes forget that the opposite of love is not fear , but hatred . 
And Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid . 
When the exercise of hard power undercuts soft power , leadership becomes more difficult - as President Bush found out after the invasion of Iraq . 
Soft power is not good per se , and it is not always better than hard power . 
Nobody likes to feel manipulated , even by soft power . 
On the other hand , soft power allows followers more choice and leeway than hard power does , because their views and choices matter more . 
And , in an age of flatter hierarchies and empowered knowledge workers , soft power is likely to increase in importance . 
Hard power has not become irrelevant , but leaders must develop the contextual intelligence that allows them to combine hard and soft power resources into a &quot; smart power &quot; strategy . 
Whoever the next president will be , he or she will need to learn that lesson .
