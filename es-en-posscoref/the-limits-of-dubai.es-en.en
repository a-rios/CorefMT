The Limits of Dubai 
Cambridge - Global investors are in a giant huff over Dubai &apos;s decision to allow its flagship private company Dubai World to seek a six-month standstill ( implying at least partial default ) on payments on some $ 26 billion in debt . 
What exactly did investors expect when they purchased bonds in companies with names like &quot; Limitless World , &quot; one of Dubai World &apos;s bankrupt real-estate subsidiaries ? 
Talk about a bubble mentality . 
The idea , I guess , was that the emirate &apos;s government would stand behind every loan , no matter how risky . 
And if the oil-poor Dubai government didn &apos;t have the money , then somehow its oil-rich sister state Abu Dhabi would cough up the cash . 
An absurd expectation , one might think . 
But it is hardly more improbable than many of the other massive bailouts we have seen around the world in the wake of the recent financial crisis . 
What really upset investors , of course , was the realization that , yes , some day untenable debt guarantees will have to be withdrawn . 
Eventually , an over-leveraged world is going to have to find a way to cut debt burdens down to size , and it won &apos;t all be pretty . 
There are those that revel in what they see as a come-uppance for brash Dubai &apos;s outsized ambitions . 
I , for one , do not share this view . 
Yes , Dubai , with its man-made islands , hotels simulating Venice , and roof-top tennis courts , is a real-world castle in the sand . 
Yet , Dubai has also shown the rest of the Middle East what entrepreneurial spirit can accomplish . 
Its airport has become a global hub of such significance that German regulators recently had to force Emirates Airlines to raise its rates to Frankfurt , lest national champion Lufthansa lose too much business . 
And , with its relatively open goods and capital markets , Dubai has become a trading hub not only for the entire Middle East , but also for parts of Africa and Asia . 
On the eve of the financial crisis , other Gulf states had started to look to Dubai for insight into how they might diversify their economies and continue to thrive when the oil wells run dry . 
Yes , Dubai is certainly an autocratic state where finances are tightly and secretively controlled . 
Indeed , lack of detailed information on the Emirates &quot; finances was a central reason why the Dubai World default came as such a shock . 
But , in many ways , Dubai &apos;s rulers have been remarkably tolerant of free expression . 
A year ago , I sat through an evening of presentations at the University of Dubai by local artists . 
One artist , an Emirati photographer , presented a visual time line of the construction of one of the stations of Dubai &apos;s new metro system . 
This local artist has lived through the stunning transformation of the city-state over the past 13 years , which has been driven by the kind of building boom that one associates with the fastest growing Chinese cities , not the Middle East . 
Rather than simply praising the government &apos;s new constructions , the artist emphasized how jarring the change was to long-time citizens . 
How does one relate to the inanimate objects rising out of the barren yet majestic desert sands ? 
Another artist presented a vision of how outside lighting could be used to transform minarets , and help them to stand out in the blur of modern buildings that characterizes the contemporary Middle Eastern city . 
His visions were magnificent , and apparently somewhat radical . 
One had to be impressed that such ideas could be expressed openly . 
Anyone familiar with Dubai understands that these are but small examples of a much broader embrace of creativity that has allowed the country to court elite foreign professionals in finance and other industries . 
Much as in the United States , elite foreigners have played a key role in developing Dubai &apos;s various service industries . 
Of course , other countries in the Gulf also have some stunning accomplishments to their credit . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s national oil company has achieved homegrown expertise in oil drilling that is widely admired in the West . 
Qatar has had success in media with Al Jazzera , while Abu Dhabi has helped sponsor remarkable advances in artificial intelligence though its support of computer chess . 
But Dubai , with very little black gold of its own , has done more with less than any other state in the region . 
Unfortunately , Dubai ultimately proved subject to the laws of financial gravity . 
This time was not different . 
Massive speculation and borrowing led to excessive debt burdens and ultimately , to default . 
Is this the end of the road for Dubai &apos;s epic growth ? 
I doubt it . 
Countries throughout the world and throughout history have defaulted on their debts and lived to talk about it , even prosper . 
There is no way around the need for Dubai to restructure and prune its excesses before it can resume a more sustainable growth trajectory , though achieving this will take time . 
Will there be contagion to vulnerable countries in Europe and elsewhere ? 
Not just yet . 
While the Dubai case is not different , it is special , so the effect on investor confidence should remain contained for now . 
But investors are learning the hard way that no country &apos;s possibilities and resources are limitless .
