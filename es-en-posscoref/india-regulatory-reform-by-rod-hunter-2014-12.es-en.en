Faster Growth Through Stronger Regulation 
WASHINGTON , DC - When India &apos;s prime minister , Narendra Modi , was on the campaign trail , he promised to improve the way the country is governed . 
Since taking office in May , he has strived to deliver . 
Recently , he declared that he wants to boost India &apos;s position in the World Bank &apos;s &quot; Doing Business &quot; survey , which assesses the regulatory climate in 189 countries . 
Modi &apos;s goal is to lift India into the top 50 - a bold ambition given that the country currently sits at 142 . 
Cutting bureaucratic red tape can help foster a culture of entrepreneurship and dynamism . 
In all countries - but especially in developing economies - a robust regulatory system is essential to building trust in the marketplace . 
Consumers need to know that the food they eat , the cars they drive , and the medicines they take are safe . 
Confidence in local products boosts domestic consumption and makes exports more attractive in foreign markets . 
By contrast , a country riddled with regulatory shortcomings will find its arteries of commerce clogged and foreign investors spooked by unpredictable quality and unfair competition from unscrupulous producers . 
In developing countries , &quot; poor quality regulation and implementation are formidable barriers to entrepreneurship and investment , &quot; according to a World Bank report . 
&quot; Regulatory failures expose people and the environment to horrific risks . &quot; 
As developing countries upgrade their regulatory systems , they should focus on closing legal gaps that put consumers at risk and undermine market credibility . 
In China , for example , the manufacturers of pharmaceutical ingredients can dodge drug regulation by claiming that their products will be used for non-medical purposes . 
Even as reputable firms ensure the quality of all their inputs , this loophole can allow unsafe products to enter the market , as occurred in 2008 , when at least 81 Americans died after receiving doses of the blood thinner heparin that contained adulterated Chinese material . 
By the same token , regulations should be based on international standards , where they exist . 
For example , American , European , Japanese , and other drug regulators have developed guidelines , through the International Conference on Harmonization , that take advantage of their collective expertise . 
Countries such as South Korea and Singapore are drawing on these guidelines to flesh out their own regulatory systems . 
As a result , their citizens will enjoy quick access to new medicines , and their researchers will find it easier to participate in global clinical research , a boon to domestic industries . 
Because a regulatory institution can only be as effective as the people who work for it , another area of focus for developing countries should be training skilled staff . 
In China , fewer than 200 people work at the Center for Drug Evaluation , the agency that reviews applications for new drugs . 
By contrast , the United States Food and Drug Administration employs 4,000 reviewers , and the European Medicines Agency has 3,000 . 
Predictably , China &apos;s approval process for new drugs is one of the world &apos;s slowest - eight years on average . 
As a result , patients are denied access to the medicines they need . 
Building intellectual capital and institutional competence can take years , but it can be done . 
A decade ago , Japan &apos;s drug-approval process was lethargic relative to that of other developed economies . 
The country made the safe acceleration of the approval process a high priority , and tremendous progress has followed . 
The median time taken to approve new drugs fell from 833 days in 2006 to 306 days in 2012 , according to the London-based Center for Innovation in Regulatory Science . 
For regulation to be truly effective , it must be backed by robust enforcement - with sanctions for noncompliance . 
For India , which has only 1.2 judges per 100,000 people ( compared to 10.8 in the US ) , this will be a difficult challenge . 
According to the Supreme Court of India , in March 2012 the country had 31.2 million cases pending , more than 80 % of them in lower courts . 
Such extraordinary backlogs have persisted - and can undermine the rule of law . 
The world &apos;s richer countries created their regulatory infrastructure over generations , during a time when there was little direct global competition . 
Emerging markets need to create theirs in a greatly compressed timeframe . 
This will not be easy anywhere . 
It will require significant resources , and the process risks angering domestic companies that have become accustomed to a lack of regulatory oversight .
