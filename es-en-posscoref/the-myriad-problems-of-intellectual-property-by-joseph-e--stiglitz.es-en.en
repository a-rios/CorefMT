Lives versus Profits 
NEW YORK - The United States Supreme Court recently began deliberations in a case that highlights a deeply problematic issue concerning intellectual-property rights . 
The Court must answer the following question : Can human genes - your genes - be patented ? 
Put another way , should someone essentially be permitted to own the right , say , to test whether you have a set of genes that imply a higher than 50 % probability of developing breast cancer ? 
To those outside the arcane world of intellectual-property rights , the answer seems obvious : No . 
You own your genes . 
A company might own , at most , the intellectual property underlying its genetic test ; and , because the research and development needed to develop the test may have cost a considerable amount , the firm might rightly charge for administering it . 
But a Utah-based company , Myriad Genetics , claims more than that . 
It claims to own the rights to any test for the presence of the two critical genes associated with breast cancer - and has ruthlessly enforced that right , though their test is inferior to one that Yale University was willing to provide at much lower cost . 
The consequences have been tragic : Thorough , affordable testing that identifies high-risk patients saves lives . 
Blocking such testing costs lives . 
Myriad is a true example of an American corporation for which profit trumps all other values , including the value of human life itself . 
This a particularly poignant case . 
Normally , economists talk about trade-offs : weaker intellectual-property rights , it is argued , would undermine incentives to innovate . 
The irony here is that Myriad &apos;s discovery would have been made in any case , owing to a publicly funded , international effort to decode the entire human genome that was a singular achievement of modern science . 
The social benefits of Myriad &apos;s slightly earlier discovery have been dwarfed by the costs that its callous pursuit of profit has imposed . 
More broadly , there is increasing recognition that the patent system , as currently designed , not only imposes untold social costs , but also fails to maximize innovation - as Myriad &apos;s gene patents demonstrate . 
After all , Myriad did not invent the technologies used to analyze the genes . 
If these technologies had been patented , Myriad might not have made its discoveries . 
And its tight control of the use of its patents has inhibited the development by others of better and more accurate tests for the presence of the gene . 
The point is a simple one : All research is based on prior research . 
A poorly designed patent system - like the one we have now - can inhibit follow-on research . 
That is why we do not allow patents for basic insights in mathematics . 
And it is why research shows that patenting genes actually reduces the production of new knowledge about genes : the most important input in the production of new knowledge is prior knowledge , to which patents inhibit access . 
Fortunately , what motivates most significant advances in knowledge is not profit , but the pursuit of knowledge itself . 
This has been true of all of the transformative discoveries and innovations - DNA , transistors , lasers , the Internet , and so on . 
A separate US legal case has underscored one of the main dangers of patent-driven monopoly power : corruption . 
With prices far in excess of the cost of production , there are , for example , huge profits to be gained by persuading pharmacies , hospitals , or doctors to shift sales to your products . 
The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York recently accused the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis of doing exactly this by providing illegal kickbacks , honoraria , and other benefits to doctors - exactly what it promised not to do when it settled a similar case three years earlier . 
Indeed , Public Citizen , a US consumer advocacy group , has calculated that , in the US alone , the pharmaceutical industry has paid out billions of dollars as a result of court judgments and financial settlements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and federal and state governments . 
Sadly , the US and other advanced countries have been pressing for stronger intellectual-property regimes around the world . 
Such regimes would limit poor countries &quot; access to the knowledge that they need for their development - and would deny life-saving generic drugs to the hundreds of millions of people who cannot afford the drug companies &quot; monopoly prices . 
The issue is coming to a head in ongoing World Trade Organization negotiations . 
The WTO &apos;s intellectual-property agreement , called TRIPS , originally foresaw the extension of &quot; flexibilities &quot; to the 48 least-developed countries , where average annual per capita income is below $ 800 . 
The original agreement seems remarkably clear : the WTO shall extend these &quot; flexibilities &quot; upon the request of the least-developed countries . 
While these countries have now made such a request , the US and Europe appear hesitant to oblige . 
Intellectual-property rights are rules that we create - and that are supposedto improve social well-being . 
But unbalanced intellectual-property regimes result in inefficiencies - including monopoly profits and a failure to maximize the use of knowledge - that impede the pace of innovation . 
And , as the Myriad case shows , they can even result in unnecessary loss of life . 
America &apos;s intellectual-property regime - and the regime that the US has helped to foist upon the rest of the world through the TRIPS agreement - is unbalanced . 
We should all hope that , with its decision in the Myriad case , the Supreme Court will contribute to the creation of a more sensible and humane framework .
