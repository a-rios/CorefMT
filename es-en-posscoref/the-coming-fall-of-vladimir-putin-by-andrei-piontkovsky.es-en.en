The Four Stages of Putinism 
MOSCOW - In 1970 , Soviet dissident Andrei Amalrik observed in Will the Soviet Union Survive until 1984 ? that &quot; all totalitarian regimes grow old without realizing it . &quot; 
Amalrik was right , and the regime established since 2000 by Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to fall apart - perhaps this year - for the same reason that the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 . 
The Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , it should be remembered , was not the result of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s reformist &quot; betrayal . &quot; 
Nor was it caused by falling oil prices or US President Ronald Reagan &apos;s military build-up . 
Soviet communism was doomed long before then , when , as Amalrik predicted , the communist myth finally died in the hearts and minds of ordinary people and officials alike . 
In a mere 13 years , Putin &apos;s regime , with its grand ideological style , has passed through all of the stages of Soviet history , becoming a vulgar parody of each . 
The first stage , that of creating the regime &apos;s legitimizing myth , generates a heroic demiurge , the father of the nation . 
Whereas the Bolsheviks had the 1917 Revolution , the Putinists had the second Chechen war of 1999 and the bombings of apartment buildings in Buynaksk , Moscow , and Volgodonsk that year . 
Thus was born the myth of the heroic intelligence officer who protects Russians in their homes while terrifying the nation &apos;s enemies . 
The second stage could be called the period of storms and stresses . 
Stalin thrived on the barbaric forced industrialization that planted the seeds of the communist system &apos;s destruction . 
Putin , for his part , &quot; built &quot; a great energy power , turning the country into a banana republic with hydrocarbons . 
The third stage extends the myth through heroic triumph . 
The Soviets had their victory in World War II , followed by the creation of a global superpower . 
Putinism claimed victory after invading tiny Georgia in 2008 . 
Finally , the regime suffers ideological exhaustion and death . 
This stage of Soviet communism took 40 years to run its course . 
But a simulacrum falls apart much faster . 
Putin &apos;s four-hour news conference in December recalled nothing so much as Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu &apos;s demise at a staged mass meeting in 1989 , when he was confronted by heckling and protests . 
Indeed , Russia is already living in the post-Putin era , because Putin can no longer perform his mission - providing security for a plutocracy . 
As in 1999 , when Boris Yeltsin had outlived his usefulness to the elite , the current infighting among elite factions means only one thing : a search is underway for a successor . 
The question is no longer whether Putin &apos;s regime will survive , but what will come after him . 
The coming transition will be markedly different from the 1999 transfer of power . 
It will not be a palace affair , replete with a &quot; patriotic , &quot; television-driven mobilization of the masses against terrorists and the Western nemesis . 
The current process is more like what happened in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989 and the USSR in 1991 , with protesters &quot; enthusiasm giving way to disappointment as individual members of the old regime retained economic and quasi-political power . 
Indeed , a potential heir today needs legitimacy , not only from the powerful oligarchs but also from the street . 
That is why so-called &quot; system liberals , &quot; or loyalists who stand for Kremlin-backed change , want to control the protest movement and use it as a lever in an ultimate fight with the &quot; siloviks &quot; ( Putin &apos;s military and security apparatus ) . 
System liberals believe that Russia has , on the whole , built an acceptable market economy . 
Its further development requires only the removal of some of Putin &apos;s cronies through controlled political reform . 
Until recently , the loyalists argued that the quest for change precludes criticizing the government , which should somehow be influenced through constructive suggestions . 
Demands for Putin &apos;s resignation would lead only to the marginalization of the protest movement . 
Today , however , the loyalists &quot; rhetoric is more aggressive . 
They now argue that Putin personally chose repression in responding to the protest movement that filled the streets of Moscow and other major cities in late 2011 and early 2012 . 
Politicians who see no alternative to tribunals and criminal prosecutions cannot be respected . 
The evolution of the loyalists &quot; position is not coincidental . 
They must consider the mood of the protest movement , as well as opinion polls , which suggest that their popular support lags behind the &quot; republicans &quot; by a nine-to-one margin . 
&quot; Republicans &quot; believe that uprooting the entire political and economic system that was established in the Yeltsin years - and consolidated under Putin - is a task of national salvation . 
More important , over the past few months , the loyalists &quot; strategic vision has changed . 
Back in October 2012 , they planned to negotiate with Putin about replacing him in a year or so . 
The idea was to appoint a more &quot; liberal &quot; factotum , such as Alexei Kudrin , a former finance minister , or oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov . 
But something went wrong : Putin could not be convinced . 
At the same time , he has become unable to control infighting among the elite . 
As his opponents have hardened their stance , Russia has become ripe for a peaceful anti-criminal revolution . 
Even if Putin left this year , that would not be enough . 
Russia and its people can triumph only if Kremlin loyalists seeking his successor leave with him .
