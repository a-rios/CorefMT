Debt and Delusion 
NEW HAVEN - Economists like to talk about thresholds that , if crossed , spell trouble . 
Usually there is an element of truth in what they say . 
But the public often overreacts to such talk . 
Consider , for example , the debt-to-GDP ratio , much in the news nowadays in Europe and the United States . 
It is sometimes said , almost in the same breath , that Greece &apos;s debt equals 153 % of its annual GDP , and that Greece is insolvent . 
Couple these statements with recent television footage of Greeks rioting in the street . 
Now , what does that look like ? 
Here in the US , it might seem like an image of our future , as public debt comes perilously close to 100 % of annual GDP and continues to rise . 
But maybe this image is just a bit too vivid in our imaginations . 
Could it be that people think that a country becomes insolvent when its debt exceeds 100 % of GDP ? 
That would clearly be nonsense . 
After all , debt ( which is measured in currency units ) and GDP ( which is measured in currency units per unit of time ) yields a ratio in units of pure time . 
There is nothing special about using a year as that unit . 
A year is the time that it takes for the earth to orbit the sun , which , except for seasonal industries like agriculture , has no particular economic significance . 
We should remember this from high school science : always pay attention to units of measurement . 
Get the units wrong and you are totally befuddled . 
If economists did not habitually annualize quarterly GDP data and multiply quarterly GDP by four , Greece &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio would be four times higher than it is now . 
And if they habitually decadalized GDP , multiplying the quarterly GDP numbers by 40 instead of four , Greece &apos;s debt burden would be 15 % . 
From the standpoint of Greece &apos;s ability to pay , such units would be more relevant , since it doesn &apos;t have to pay off its debts fully in one year ( unless the crisis makes it impossible to refinance current debt ) . 
Some of Greece &apos;s national debt is owed to Greeks , by the way . 
As such , the debt burden woefully understates the obligations that Greeks have to each other ( largely in the form of family obligations ) . 
At any time in history , the debt-to-annual-GDP ratio ( including informal debts ) would vastly exceed 100 % . 
Most people never think about this when they react to the headline debt-to-GDP figure . 
Can they really be so stupid as to get mixed up by these ratios ? 
Speaking from personal experience , I have to say that they can , because even I , a professional economist , have occasionally had to stop myself from making exactly the same error . 
Economists who adhere to rational-expectations models of the world will never admit it , but a lot of what happens in markets is driven by pure stupidity - or , rather , inattention , misinformation about fundamentals , and an exaggerated focus on currently circulating stories . 
What is really happening in Greece is the operation of a social-feedback mechanism . 
Something started to cause investors to fear that Greek debt had a slightly higher risk of eventual default . 
Lower demand for Greek debt caused its price to fall , meaning that its yield in terms of market interest rates rose . 
The higher rates made it more costly for Greece to refinance its debt , creating a fiscal crisis that has forced the government to impose severe austerity measures , leading to public unrest and an economic collapse that has fueled even greater investor skepticism about Greece &apos;s ability to service its debt . 
This feedback has nothing to do with the debt-to-annual-GDP ratio crossing some threshold , unless the people who contribute to the feedback believe in the ratio . 
To be sure , the ratio is a factor that would help us to assess risks of negative feedback , since the government must refinance short-term debt sooner , and , if the crisis pushes up interest rates , the authorities will face intense pressures for fiscal austerity sooner or later . 
But the ratio is not the cause of the feedback . 
A paper written last year by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , called &quot; Growth in a Time of Debt , &quot; has been widely quoted for its analysis of 44 countries over 200 years , which found that when government debt exceeds 90 % of GDP , countries suffer slower growth , losing about one percentage point on the annual rate . 
One might be misled into thinking that , because 90 % sounds awfully close to 100 % , awful things start happening to countries that get into such a mess . 
But if one reads their paper carefully , it is clear that Reinhart and Rogoff picked the 90 % figure almost arbitrarily . 
They chose , without explanation , to divide debt-to-GDP ratios into the following categories : under 30 % , 30-60 % , 60-90 % , and over 90 % . 
And it turns out that growth rates decline in all of these categories as the debt-to-GDP ratio increases , only somewhat more in the last category . 
There is also the issue of reverse causality . 
Debt-to-GDP ratios tend to increase for countries that are in economic trouble . 
If this is part of the reason that higher debt-to-GDP ratios correspond to lower economic growth , there is less reason to think that countries should avoid a higher ratio , as Keynesian theory implies that fiscal austerity would undermine , rather than boost , economic performance . 
The fundamental problem that much of the world faces today is that investors are overreacting to debt-to-GDP ratios , fearful of some magic threshold , and demanding fiscal-austerity programs too soon . 
They are asking governments to cut expenditure while their economies are still vulnerable . 
Households are running scared , so they cut expenditures as well , and businesses are being dissuaded from borrowing to finance capital expenditures . 
The lesson is simple : We should worry less about debt ratios and thresholds , and more about our inability to see these indicators for the artificial - and often irrelevant - constructs that they are .
