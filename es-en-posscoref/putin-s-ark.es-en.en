Putin &apos;s Ark 
Recently I visited Moscow after five years away . 
The city , which looked different and strange , impressed me by its ability to change . 
My days back in Russia were divided between official meetings , hours wasted in traffic jams , and nights spent with old friends who tried to show me the best of Moscow nightlife . 
On my first free evening , I was invited to a place called &quot; Shinok . &quot; 
The restaurant had many of the traits found in ethnic restaurants everywhere . 
Different bits of kitsch , this time Ukrainian , were richly represented . 
But the interior decoration had one unique element - an artificial wall with windows separating a part of the restaurant hall . 
Behind the wall was a stage set of a village yard . 
A real cow , as well as chickens and geese populated that ersatz farmyard . 
At times an old woman in traditional dress appeared to feed the animals . 
Visitors enjoying borscht and pirogi observed her efforts with satisfaction . 
&quot; She works for the restaurant , &quot; my acquaintance explained . 
&quot; She feeds animals and sits in the yard to create the rustic ambiance . &quot; 
Shinok was just an introduction to today &apos;s new wave of Moscow restaurant culture . 
A few days later , I visited &quot; The White Sun of the Desert , &quot; another ethnic hangout . 
The White Sun existed in Soviet times . 
Back then , it was called &quot; Uzbekistan &quot; and was nothing more than an obligatory culinary demonstration of the supposedly unbreakable union of the USSR &apos;s fifteen fraternal republics . 
Although the restaurant interior had completely changed since then , its decorative themes remained the same . 
Nowadays , however , the establishment is named after a popular Soviet borscht-western ( or &quot; eastern &quot; ) filmed in 1969 and set in Central Asia during the 1919 Civil War . 
The restaurant is decorated not only with oriental carpets , but with life-size figures of the movie &apos;s heroes firing machine guns or sitting on crates of dynamite . 
This Soviet &quot; orientalism &quot; is reinforced by pretty waitresses dressed in sexy outfits more inspired by the Arabian Nights than by any Central Asian reality - then or now . 
But the Soviet past , not ethnic motifs , are the biggest element in contemporary Muscovite restaurant design . 
The club-restaurant &quot; Major Pronin : &quot; is conveniently located in the vicinity of the KGB-FSB headquarters . 
It is named after the hero of bad Soviet-era spy novels , a figure who was also the butt of many underground jokes . 
The restaurant &apos;s interior is decorated with various pieces of espionage equipment . 
Targets depicting serial killers and drug dealers have mottos like &quot; Save a woman &quot; or &quot; Save a boy &quot; on them . 
In the middle of the wall is a target representing New York &apos;s World Trade Center being approached by an aircraft , with the inscription &quot; Save America . &quot; 
A new club called &quot; Zone &quot; - Russian slang for a concentration camp - is designed to reproduce the feeling of gulag life . 
Barking Alsatian dogs , stern guards , and waiters dressed in inmate uniforms work hard to recreate the gulag &apos;s sinister atmosphere . 
Russian literature is not forgotten . 
If the restaurant &quot; Pushkin &quot; on Tverskoy Boulevard not far from the monument to the great Russian poet is designed to recreate the &quot; aristocratic atmosphere &quot; of the early nineteenth century , the combined bar and diner called &quot; Gogol &quot; on Stoleshnikov Lane is an attempt to recreate a vanished Soviet institution called &quot; rumochnaia . &quot; 
A &quot; rumka &quot; is a vodka glass from which exhausted proletarians could revive themselves . 
Of course &quot; rumochnaia &quot; had nothing in common with Nikolai Gogol , but the establishment named after the famous writer does have a skating rink that is used once a day by a man dressed up as Gogol . 
After my return to Washington , I had a dinner with an American politician who had just visited Saint Petersburg . 
As a special honor , his Russian hosts organized an excursion to Strelna , the &quot; Russian Versailles , &quot; which was recently restored from ruin to become the Petersburg residence of President Vladimir Putin . 
The palace didn &apos;t impress the American . 
The amount of marble used for renovation seemed excessive , and the understanding of what constitutes luxury appeared to correspond to the standards of a Holiday Inn . 
The American &apos;s excited Russian hosts asked him constantly for his opinion of the palace . 
Throughout the tour , the American answered with polite exclamations like &quot; exquisite &quot; or &quot; striking . &quot; 
Finally , they reached the attic . 
At last , the American was excited . 
The attic of the presidential residence was designed as a belly of the seventeenth-century ship . 
&quot; The last time I saw something like this was in a Hamburg beer hall in the 1960 &quot; s , &quot; the politician told me . 
How perfect , I thought , as I imagined Russia &apos;s president climbing the stairs to the attic of his palace to play the role of Peter the Great . 
Like the customers in that Ukrainian-style village restaurant , perhaps Putin found his attic ark reassuring in some unconscious way . 
A historical wave beyond his control had lifted the former KGB lieutenant colonel from out of the shadows to the pinnacle of power . 
What could be better than to have an ark at hand if one day the political tides turn ?
