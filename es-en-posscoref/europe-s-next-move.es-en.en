Europe &apos;s Next Move 
Ever since France and the Netherlands rejected the European Union &apos;s proposed Constitutional Treaty , EU leaders have been busy pointing fingers at each other , or blaming French and Dutch citizens for misunderstanding the question they had been asked . 
But no amount of finger pointing can obscure the fact that , 50 years after the European Community &apos;s creation , Europe badly needs a new political framework , if not a new project , to shore up its unity . 
To be sure , French and Dutch citizens did not respond to the question that they were supposed to answer . 
Their vote was a protest against globalization , a rejection of the contemporary world , with its distant and incomprehensible governing mechanisms . 
Like the anti-globalization movement , the new anti-Europeanism can be regarded as a demand for a &quot; different world &quot; - in this case , an &quot; alter-Europeanism . &quot; 
The two world wars and the Cold War shaped European integration as a project of peace , defense of the West &apos;s fundamental values , and common economic prosperity . 
But the collapse of communism in 1989 , and the chance to overcome the Continent &apos;s historical divisions , now required a redefinition of the European project . 
The Treaties of Maastricht ( 1992 ) and Amsterdam ( 1997 ) created a new organizational structure for the EU and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to Europe &apos;s economic power . 
The Treaty of Nice ( 2000 ) was result of a rather poor compromise . 
Declarations by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , whose country assumed the European Union &apos;s rotating six-month presidency at the beginning of the year 2007 , are unambiguous : the period of reflection , approved by the European Commission in 2005 , has ended . 
The German presidency will seek to implement the Constitutional Treaty resolutions , and the Berlin Declaration of March 25 , 2007 - timed to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome - will offer a vision of the EU &apos;s future . 
The aim is to leave to Germany &apos;s successors in the EU presidency - Slovenia , Portugal , and France - a roadmap for future reform . 
In the past , when politicians debated the EU &apos;s future , they spoke of a definitive formula for European integration , as defined in a famous lecture in 2000 by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer . 
The accompanying intellectual debate , inaugurated by the philosophers JÃ¼rgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida , defined the nature of European identity , above all , against the foil of the United States , but also in terms of the challenges posed by globalization . 
A similar debate addressing key questions concerning the EU &apos;s future should be launched now . 
First , how should relations between national and common European interests be defined ? 
At issue is not only the allocation of competencies , but also the more fundamental matter of when to rely on national governments &quot; agreement and when to turn to common EU institutions , namely the European Commission and the European Parliament . 
The second question concerns the EU &apos;s scope . 
Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history , but the EU &apos;s boundaries - and thus the prospects for its further enlargement - are determined as much by its capacity to integrate candidate countries as by these countries &quot; own adaptive abilities . 
After the accession of Bulgaria and Romania , the EU has 27 members , with Turkey and Croatia , but also the other Balkan states , as well as Ukraine and Georgia , waiting in line . 
Is enlargement the only effective policy for stabilization and peace , or can the EU &apos;s &quot; neighborhood policy , &quot; falling short of full admission for some of the countries knocking at the door , become an instrument for supporting development and stabilization , much as the Marshall Plan once was for Western Europe ? 
Third , instead of a futile theoretical debate over &quot; liberal &quot; versus &quot; social &quot; models of economic development , we need to compare the experiences of such countries as Great Britain , Sweden , Germany and France . 
Are their experiences mutually exclusive , or is convergence possible ? 
Which policies in fact reduce unemployment ? 
Which measures can ensure the EU &apos;s global competitiveness ? 
How can we narrow the existing differences in development and material welfare within Europe ? 
Fourth , the EU &apos;s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be addressed . 
The threats facing the world today are supranational , so counteracting them must be supranational , too . 
But this is impossible without a clear European identity - and thus a common interest to be asserted and defended . 
Only then will a common approach to pressing issues , such as energy supplies , be possible . 
Such questions could be the topic of a consultative referendum held simultaneously in all member states . 
Its results would allow the treaty to be presented in a simplified version for ratification by the nine member states that have still not done so . 
The EU would then gain both a political dimension and clear rules of procedure . 
The alternative is paralysis . 
If the EU continues to be governed under the Treaty of Nice , there will be no room for further political integration or enlargement . 
Nor do the current rules ensure the effective functioning of the Union &apos;s institutions , as they exist now , while drafting a new constitutional treaty would probably require even more time than was needed for the current proposal . 
In these circumstances , pragmatism should prevail . 
Democracy may carry certain short-term costs , but they are always lower than the long-term damage that comes from a lack of popular participation . 
Only a new European debate that includes both Europe &apos;s citizens and its institutions can combat &quot; alter-Europeanism &quot; effectively . 
The time may not be ripe for a true European constitution , but confronting , rather than evading , the fundamental issues that the EU faces could create a context for reviving the constitutional treaty and preparing the Union for the challenges of our time .
