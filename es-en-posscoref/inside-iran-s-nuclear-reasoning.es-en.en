Inside Iran &apos;s Nuclear Reasoning 
MELBOURNE - Is Iran really hell-bent on becoming a nuclear-armed state ? 
Or will it settle for nuclear capability , able to make weapons but choosing not to ? 
Does the difference matter ? 
Few international questions involve higher stakes than these . 
An immediate concern , if deep pessimism about Iran &apos;s intentions prevails , is a preventive Israeli strike , leading to another major Middle East war - with catastrophic consequences for the global economy likely . 
No one should underestimate the difficulty of assessing Iran &apos;s real intentions . 
Mixed signals from competing power centers don &apos;t help ; nor does the recurring contrast between Iranian officials &quot; usually-strident public pronouncements and often-moderate private discourse . 
Pessimists and skeptics have plenty to point to in Iran &apos;s long record of obstruction and brinkmanship in addressing legitimate international concerns about its nuclear programs . 
That said , too many policymakers and commentators have rushed to judgment , insisting that Iran is irrevocably determined to build nuclear weapons , or that it wants a break-out capability that is just as dangerous . 
In fact , there is good reason to believe that the situation is less alarming and more containable than this . 
While a negotiated settlement acceptable to both Iran and the rest of the international community would be a hugely difficult undertaking , it is achievable . 
One does not need to look hard for Iran &apos;s reasons for testing the limits of international tolerance : to redeem the humiliations of the Mosaddeq era and beyond ; to demonstrate superior technological prowess to the region and the wider world ; and to make clear to the Western powers - whose perceived double standards abandoned Iran to Saddam Hussein &apos;s chemical warfare in the late 1980 &quot; s - that it would not compromise on its &quot; right &quot; to enrich uranium under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
By contrast , it has not been so easy for observers to see why Iran would stop short of building the nuclear weapons that it may soon have the capacity to produce . 
But in my many off-the-record discussions with senior officials in Iran and elsewhere over the last few years , I have heard five such reasons stated with clarity and consistency , and they deserve to be taken seriously . 
The first reason is concern that Israel will perceive the existence of one or two Iranian bombs as an existential threat , demanding a pre-emptive military attack - with or without US support , but in either case with resources that Iran knows it cannot match . 
Iranians think such an attack unlikely if they do not cross the red line of actual weaponization . 
Second , it is well understood that there is zero tolerance in Russia and China for an Iranian bomb , and all the rope that that these powers have so far given Iran in the Security Council will run out if Iran weaponizes . 
The writing on this wall became even clearer after the most recent round of sanctions negotiations . 
Third , following from this , there is a clear perception in Iran that acquiring an actual bomb would lead to impossibly stringent economic sanctions . 
Financial sanctions , direct and indirect , already are biting - including on the Revolutionary Guard and its significant economic interests - but have been tolerable in the context of asserting Iran &apos;s &quot; right to enrich &quot; under the NPT . 
Once in obvious breach of the NPT , universal participation in a much tougher sanctions regime is seen in Iran as inevitable . 
Fourth , Iranians acknowledge that any regional hegemony bought with nuclear weapons is likely to be short-lived . 
There is skepticism about the capacity of Egypt , Saudi Arabia , or Turkey to move quickly to build bombs of their own , and a belief that they would be under much international pressure , especially from the US , not to do so . 
But there is also a clear view that Arab-Persian , Sunni-Shia , or more straightforward regional power anxieties would make a nuclear-arms race inevitable . 
Finally , there is a religious reason : weapons of mass destruction simply violate the precepts of Islam . 
Few in the West are likely to find this line very compelling , but it has echoed strongly in every conversation that I have ever had with Iranian officials , senior or minor . 
And it is not without plausibility : Iran did not , after all , respond in kind when it was bombarded with chemical weapons by Iraq . 
None of this suggests that Iranian intentions can be taken on trust . 
There is too much history , and there are too many continuing grounds for suspicion , for that . 
Any agreement involving an end to sanctions and diplomatic isolation would need to be accompanied by intrusive monitoring , inspection , and verification arrangements , covering not only all sensitive stages of the nuclear fuel cycle , but also any suspected weapons design or engineering facilities . 
The international community requires real confidence that there would be enough lead time - 12 months or so - in which to respond to any evidence of real intent to move to weaponization . 
Frustrations will continue , like those over the last year as creative efforts by Security Council members - and more recently by Brazil and Turkey - to find interim confidence-building solutions were rebuffed , largely because the leaders of last year &apos;s democratic movement refused to support a compromise-inclined President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
But there is a solid foundation of rationality on which to build in keeping the door open for negotiations . 
Iran is an extraordinarily complex country . 
But , just as we cannot afford to underestimate the forces of extremism that persist there , we also fail at our peril to comprehend the currents of restraint and good sense that run within the country , including at high policymaking levels .
