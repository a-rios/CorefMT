America Confronts Old and New Europe 
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s petulant remark of last year about &quot; old and new Europe &quot; was right for the wrong reasons . 
He meant it to refer to Europe &apos;s divisions , but in May , ten additional states joined the European Union . 
The expanded Europe truly forms a new Europe . 
Should America be nervous ? 
Fifty-four years after the announcement of the Schuman Plan that began to knit together the economies of France and Germany , the EU now has 25 countries and a population larger than that of the United States . 
Eight of the new members are former Communist countries that were locked behind the Iron Curtain for nearly half a century . 
Their attraction to the Union is a sign of the appeal - the &quot; soft power &quot; - of the idea of European unification . 
Of course , this new Europe faces many problems . 
The per capita income of the new countries is less than half of that of the fifteen members they are joining . 
Concerns have been raised about the influx of cheap labor . 
Negotiations are underway to revise a draft EU constitution . 
Some Europeans worry that the constitution will enable courts to carry the integration process further and faster than public opinion in member states will tolerate . 
Lack of grassroots support might lead to rejection of the constitution in countries like Britain , where referenda have been promised before the new arrangements come into force . 
Across the Atlantic , most Americans ( to the extent they pay attention ) regard these changes with general approval . 
Not only do the remarks of French leaders about recreating a multi-polar world arouse alarm , but recent public opinion polls show a decline in the popularity of the US among Europeans and a desire for more independent policies . 
The Iraq War proved costly to American soft power , with the US losing about 30 percentage points of attractiveness on average in Europe , including in countries like Britain , Spain , and Italy , whose governments supported the war . 
The recent photographs of detainees being abused and sexually degraded in Baghdad &apos;s Abu Ghraib prison added fuel to the fire . 
Now some American neo-conservatives argue that the US should drop its longstanding support for European integration . 
Such a policy change would be a serious mistake . 
Not only would it add to anti-American attitudes and fail to accomplish its objectives , but it over-estimates the extent to which the new Europe is being formed in opposition to the US . 
Whatever the rhetoric in France , for example , the policies and attitudes in countries such as Britain or Poland demonstrate that good trans-Atlantic relations can be maintained . 
If anything , the risks of a US-Europe split will be reduced rather than increased by the EU &apos;s recent enlargement . 
Moreover , there are several objective reasons why the current friction between Europe and the US is unlikely to lead to divorce . 
For one thing , the divisive war in Iraq may turn out to be the last act of the twentieth century rather than a harbinger of the twenty-first . 
American unilateralism is much less in evidence in the world &apos;s other hot spots , such as North Korea and Iran , both because of the costs of the war in Iraq and the realities of the situation in those other regions . 
Moreover , while the common security threat from the Soviet Union has disappeared , both the US and Europe face a new common threat from radical 
Europe and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values . 
While trade produces frictions in democracies , it also enhances wealth . 
If one looks at foreign direct investment , it is clear that the two sides of the Atlantic are closely integrated . 
In terms of values , while some differences exist between Europe and America , at the fundamental level of democracy and human rights , no other two parts of the globe share more . 
As the writer Robert Kagan concluded in the revision of his book in which he declared Europeans to be from Venus and Americans from Mars , it turns out that Americans seeking democratic legitimization of their policies and self-images cannot escape Europe . 
In short , it is good for Americans - and for the world - that old and new Europe are becoming one . 
We can all benefit from the soft power of an enlarged Europe .
