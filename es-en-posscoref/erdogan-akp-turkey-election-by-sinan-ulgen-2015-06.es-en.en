Turkey &apos;s Critical Election 
ISTANBUL - In very few democracies could such a small shift in votes lead to outcomes as different as the ones that could result from Turkey &apos;s general election on June 7 . 
A swing of less than 1 % of the national vote could decide whether the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) is forced to form a coalition government - Turkey &apos;s first after 13 years of single-party rule - leaving it unable to fulfill President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s longstanding desire to strengthen the presidency . 
Turkish elections have been boring affairs since the AKP came to power in 2002 . 
This year , however , the outlook is different : the results are far from certain , and the stakes could hardly be higher . 
Riding on the outcome is not only Erdoğan &apos;s political future , but also the potential for a long-term settlement with the country &apos;s Kurds and the long-term soundness of Turkish democracy itself . 
The uncertainty this time around is attributable to the predominantly Kurdish Peoples &quot; Democratic Party ( HDP ) . 
Kurdish political parties shied away from contesting past elections , owing to their fear of failing to clear the 10 % popular-vote threshold needed to enter the parliament . 
Instead , Kurdish politicians would run as independent candidates , who are not subject to the threshold . 
This year , however , the Kurdish political movement has decided to field its candidates as members of a single party . 
This electoral strategy , though risky , could yield large rewards , with the outcome holding significant implications for the party &apos;s immediate fortune - as well as for Turkey &apos;s long-term prospects . 
The HDP &apos;s failure to clear the 10 % threshold would open the way for an overhaul of the country &apos;s political system . 
With the Kurds and their candidates excluded from the parliament , the AKP would have to do only slightly better than polls are predicting to maintain its political dominance . 
If the party is able to secure more than 45 % of the national vote , the quirks in Turkey &apos;s electoral law will give it more than 330 representatives in the country &apos;s 550-seat legislature . 
Such a result would give Erdoğan the power to put in place the presidential system of governance that he has long sought . 
The AKP &apos;s parliamentary majority would allow the party to draft a new constitution unilaterally and put it to a referendum within a year . 
At the same time , the country &apos;s southeastern regions could become vulnerable to civil unrest , as the Kurdish movement - faced with a total lack of national political representation during a time of institutional transition - agitates for greater local autonomy . 
If , on the other hand the HDP can reach the 10 % threshold , its fortunes - and Erdoğan &apos;s - will swing in the other direction . 
The party &apos;s candidates would command a sizable minority delegation in parliament , and the AKP would likely become the senior partner of a coalition government . 
Far from securing a dominant position , Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu would be forced to choose between aligning his party with the HDP or the conservative Nationalist Movement Party ( MHP ) . 
A grand coalition with the main opposition party , the center-left Republican People &apos;s Party ( CHP ) , though theoretically possible , is not congruous with Turkey &apos;s political culture . 
Such a result would empower the executive , headed by Davutoğlu , to the detriment of the presidency . 
With the possibility that Erdoğan could become an executive president no longer realistic , his power would quickly begin to wane . 
Even assuming that the AKP remained the country &apos;s largest party , the balance of power in Turkish politics would start to turn against him . 
In liberal democracies , national elections are intended to provide the winning side with a popular mandate to govern and to set policy priorities until the next election . 
Only rarely do they hold implications that will last longer than a single electoral cycle . 
But that is the case today in Turkey , where the outcome of the upcoming popular vote is likely to determine the rules of political life for years to come . 
The HDP is currently polling at around 10 % . 
A little nudge in either direction could make all the difference in the world .
