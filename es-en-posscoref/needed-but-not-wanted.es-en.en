Needed But Not Wanted 
NEW YORK - Baruch Spinoza , the seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher , Benjamin Disraeli , the nineteenth-century British prime minister , and Nicolas Sarkozy , the twenty-first century French president , have one thing in common : all were sons of immigrants . 
People have migrated to other countries for thousands of years - to escape , prosper , be free , or just to start again . 
Not a few enriched their adopted homelands by achieving great things , or producing children who did . 
New waves of immigrants are rarely , if ever , popular . 
But they are often needed . 
Many people have migrated to Western European countries from North Africa and Turkey during the last half-century , not because of Western generosity , but because they were required for jobs that natives no longer wanted . 
They were treated as temporary workers , however , not as immigrants . 
Once the job was done , it was assumed that the migrants would go home . 
When it became clear that most had elected to stay , and were joined by extended families , many were grudgingly allowed to become citizens of European states , without necessarily being treated as such . 
Xenophobes , as well as leftist multi-cultural ideologues , regarded these new Europeans as utterly different from the native born , albeit for different reasons . 
Multi-culturalists saw attempts to integrate non-Westerners into the Western mainstream as a form of neo-colonialist racism , while xenophobes just didn &apos;t like anything that looked , talked , or smelled foreign . 
We who live in rapidly aging societies , such as Western Europe or Japan , still need immigrants . 
Without them , necessary institutions , such as hospitals , would be unstaffed , and more and more elderly people would have to be supported by fewer and fewer young people . 
And yet many politicians , especially in Europe , now treat immigration as a disaster . 
New populist parties garner large numbers of votes simply by frightening people about the supposed horrors of Islam , or of clashing civilizations . 
For the populists , however , the real enemies - perhaps even more nefarious than the immigrants themselves - are the &quot; cosmopolitan elites &quot; who tolerate and even encourage these horrors . 
Mainstream politicians are so afraid of this populist demagoguery that they often end up mimicking it . 
The failure of integration of non-Western immigrants in such countries as France , Germany , or The Netherlands is often exaggerated by hysterical alarmists ; 
Europe , after all , is not about to be &quot; Islamized . &quot; 
But the fact that some young people of African , South Asian , or Middle Eastern descent feel so alienated in the European countries of their birth that they are happy to murder their fellow citizens in the name of a revolutionary religious ideology , means that something is amiss . 
Children of immigrants in the past , however unwelcome they were made to feel , rarely wished to blow up the places to which their parents had chosen to move . 
Politics in many Muslim countries is partly to blame . 
Islamist extremism is a handy revolutionary creed for vulnerable young people to latch onto , to gain a sense of power and belonging . 
Hindus , Christians , or Buddhists lack such a cause , which is why political terrorism is largely confined to Muslims . 
But , as the occasional riots in French immigrant areas show , violence is not confined to Muslims . 
National policies have something to do with this , but so do the deeply flawed immigration policies in all European Union countries . 
Apart from EU citizens , who in theory are allowed to seek work anywhere in the Union ( Romanian gypsies in France might argue otherwise ) , three other categories of people have been allowed to settle in Europe : former colonial subjects , such as Algerians in France , Indians and Pakistanis in Britain , or Surinamese in The Netherlands ; &quot; guest laborers &quot; who arrived in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s ; and political refugees , the so-called asylum-seekers . 
Unlike in Canada or the United States , economic immigrants are not allowed to become citizens in exchange for their necessary labor . 
Immigrants - not &quot; guest workers &quot; - who come for work are more likely to want to integrate to some degree , and to be treated as fellow citizens , than people who come with the baggage of empire , or simply as refugees , or , worse , people pretending to be refugees because they have no other way to gain access to wealthy countries &quot; job markets . 
But European welfare states are better equipped to deal with asylum-seekers and other newcomers as needy dependents than as people in need of a job . 
When European politicians claim that France , Britain , or The Netherlands are not traditional &quot; immigrant countries &quot; like the US , they are right only up to a point , as the examples of Spinoza , Disraeli , and Sarkozy show . 
What is true is that large numbers of de facto immigrants have accumulated in many countries in a very short time , in a haphazard way that makes it seem as though no government was ever in control . 
Children of guest workers feel unwanted . 
Refugees languish helplessly in welfare nets , or are suspected of being cheats . 
And former colonial subjects , though in many cases remarkably well integrated , still bear the scars of troubled imperial histories . 
Japan , and even the US , is not immune to these problems , either . 
The Japanese government simply got rid of its Iranian guest workers when jobs dried up . 
But it won &apos;t be as easy to deal with the hundreds of thousands of Chinese who live in Japan without the rights of citizenship . 
The same is true of Mexicans working in the US , often illegally . 
Millions of people around the world remain in limbo - often needed , or pitied , but nonetheless unwanted . 
There is no quick or easy way out of this problem , especially in bad economic times . 
But Europe - and Japan , for that matter - should start by making economic migration legitimate . 
This means working out what jobs need to be filled , and welcoming those who will fill them , not as guests , but as equal citizens .
