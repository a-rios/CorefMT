Japan &apos;s War Guilt Revisited 
&quot; It is our obligation as Japan &apos;s most influential newspaper to tell our readers who was responsible for starting the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War . &quot; 
So writes Tsuneo Watanabe , Editor-in-Chief of Japan &apos;s ( and the world &apos;s ) most widely circulated newspaper , Yomiuri Shimbun , in the introduction to the book From Marco Polo Bridge to Pearl Ha rbor : Who Was Responsible . 
Watanabe , who is now in his eighties and served in the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII , was bothered by the way unfinished business concerning the war continued to hinder Japan &apos;s progress . 
As a remedy , he set up a War Responsibility Re-Examination Committee at his newspaper to undertake a 14-month investigation into the causes of Japan &apos;s Pacific War . 
Watanabe tells us that the Committee concluded that , &quot; not only high-ranking government leaders , general , and admirals should shoulder the blame . &quot; 
According to the Committee , &quot; field officers were often more influential than even the Emperor , war ministers , and chiefs-of-staffs in making decisions to go to and escalate the wars , and were responsible for many atrocities . &quot; 
It has never been easy for a nation to face up honestly to the bitter fact of having committed war crimes , genocide , unjustified foreign aggression , or having mistreated and killed its own people . 
Japan is no exception . 
Although there have been numerous initiatives to investigate its war guilt , especially its occupation of China , there has not yet been an official effort comparable to what the Germans undertook to take collective responsibility for their war crimes . 
While Yomiuri &apos;s unique public effort is not a government initiative , it comes as close as Japan will probably ever get to conducting an acceptable &quot; official &quot; inquiry and offering an adequate apology . 
Its style is almost scientific - factual , staccato-like , and unemotional - and it goes a long way toward meeting China &apos;s demand for a convincing investigation and act of contrition that might allow the bitter and still poisonous past to be overcome . 
Watanabe laments the fact that after Japanese war criminals were tried by the Tokyo Tribunal of 1951 , &quot; No efforts were made in the name of Japan or the Japanese people to look into where responsibility for the war rested . &quot; 
As a result , &quot; there can be no genuinely honest and friendly dialogue with those countries that suffered considerable damage and casualties in the wars with Japan . &quot; 
Indeed , Yomiuri &apos;s report may well have helped convince Japan &apos;s new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , to go to China immediately after being elected in to seek better bilateral relations . 
China &apos;s leaders seem to have taken note of this moment of Japanese remorse . 
This implies a ray of hope for a bilateral relationship - the most important in Asia - that over the past two decades has been battered by Japan &apos;s reluctance to face its past , which has become a lightning rod for over-heated nationalist sentiment on both sides . 
But does the Yomiuri study go far enough ? 
While it assigns responsibility to Japan for WWII , and even unflinchingly names the political and military leaders who bear responsibility , one can still detect a whiff of reluctance in its failure to fully describe some of Japan &apos;s war-time actions . 
For example , the horrors of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 , when Japanese soldiers killed 45,000-250,000 Chinese - many of whom were civilians - are given little more than a brief mention . 
But it would be a pity if China &apos;s leaders did not endorse this acknowledgement of Japanese guilt as a manifestation of Japan &apos;s willingness to repent . 
The damaged bilateral relationship has only made China &apos;s desire for a &quot; peaceful rise &quot; more uncertain . 
At the same time , it has left Japan &apos;s long sought transcendence of its war guilt and quasi-pariah status incomplete . 
Watanabe and Yomiuri Shimbun have provided a rare opportunity that should be seized for the greater good of China and Japan and the world . 
Of course , it is always easier to export blame than to shoulder it . 
And , true , no Japanese prime minister has yet fallen to his knees in Nanjing the way Chancellor Willy Brandt did on the site of the Warsaw Ghetto , where he apologized for the crimes of Germany by saying , &quot; No people can escape from their history . &quot; 
But that was in 1970 , when memories of the war &apos;s ravages were fresh . 
Now , over half-a-century has elapsed . 
&quot; If things are left as they are , &quot; writes Watanabe , &quot; a skewed perception of history - without knowledge of the horrors of the war - will be handed down to future generations . &quot; 
It would be an immensely encouraging sign of China &apos;s growing maturity if its leaders used this moment to look beyond the bitter past toward a new future with Japan .
