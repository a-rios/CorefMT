America &apos;s Sputnik Moment in Beijing 
NEW YORK - August 8 , 2008 , may someday be remembered as the first day of the post-American era . 
Or it could be remembered as another &quot; Sputnik moment , &quot; when , as with the Soviet foray into outer space in 1957 , the American people realized that the country had lost its footing and decided it was time for the United States to get its act together . 
There was no mistaking the power and symbolism of the opening ceremonies for the Beijing Olympic Games on August 8 . 
That multimedia spectacular did far more than trace China &apos;s 5,000-year history ; it was a statement that China is a major civilization that demands and deserves its rightful place in the global hierarchy . 
There was also no mistaking the symbolism of seeing President Bush , waving cheerfully from his spot in the bleachers while Chinese President Hu Jintao sat behind what looked more like a throne . 
It is hard to imagine that China &apos;s government , which obsesses over every minute issue of diplomatic protocol , had not orchestrated this stark image of America &apos;s decline relative to the country to which it owes $ 1.4 trillion . 
It would be hard to imagine Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan accepting a similar relative position . 
At the very same time that Bush was waving from the stands , Russia was invading Georgia , America &apos;s closest partner in the Caucasus . 
Russia &apos;s message to other West-leaning countries in the former Soviet world was clear : America cannot protect you . 
Frighteningly , the Russians were likely correct . 
While the Iraq quagmire has made it difficult for America to project force around the world , America &apos;s growing debt , conflicts with friends and enemies alike , absence of any perceivable strategy for changing times , and its political system &apos;s seeming inability to take action to address these challenges have combined to turn America into a struggling giant . 
Today , from Iran to Darfur to Zimbabwe to Georgia , the world is witnessing the effects of a budding post-American world , and the picture does not look pretty . 
As much as we all value the rise of new powers like China and India , it remains to be seen whether these countries will become as benevolent a power as America , however flawed , has been over the past half-century . 
Neo-colonialism is returning to Africa , the global project of human rights is in retreat , and the world trade system is becoming far less open . 
Brutal dictators go unpunished because their interests are protected by large powers with stakes in their natural resources . 
Reversing this trend is not only in America &apos;s interest , but also in the world &apos;s interest . 
To do so , Americans must identify and address the great challenges the United States faces , starting from the ground up . 
Fixing America &apos;s campaign finance structure , which leads to massive misallocations of government funds , resuscitating America &apos;s wildly uneven and often moribund education system , building an immigration system that actively recruits the most talented people from around the world via a fast track to US citizenship , and developing a national energy policy that moves the US far more quickly toward energy independence would all be important steps in this direction . 
Working to rebuild the traditional bipartisan foreign-policy consensus would also make the US a far more predictable partner to friends and allies around the world . 
And America must be a respectful partner in order to encourage rising powers like India and China to play more constructive roles in international affairs . 
The world is not ready for the post-American era , and countries like China and India must play a far greater role in strengthening the existing institutions of world peace and , where appropriate , building new ones that can promote a positive agenda of security , dignity , rights , and prosperity across the globe . 
The world community is not there yet , and until it is , the world needs a new kind of American leader - a leader able to inspire Americans to fix their problems at home and work with partners across the globe in promoting a common agenda as bold and progressive as the order built from the ashes of World War II 60 years ago . 
The Beijing Olympics could be remembered as a new &quot; Sputnik moment &quot; for the US , inspiring the country to meaningfully face the music of a changing world . 
But America can make it so only by recognizing the great challenges it faces and taking bold steps towards addressing them , at home and with allies abroad .
