How to Beat Childhood Cancer 
PHILADELPHIA - For a parent , there is perhaps no greater fear than the prospect of losing a child to illness or accident . 
And it is childhood cancer that has the greatest potential to catapult a remote fear into an unimaginable reality . 
As a pediatric oncologist , having cared for children with cancer and their families for more than 25 years , I know that only a parent who has confronted such a diagnosis truly understands the depth of this fear , as it touches the core of who we are as parents . 
I also know that we are treating more children more effectively than ever before - and that we can do much better still . 
For a child born in the 1960 &quot; s , the diagnosis of the most common form of childhood cancer , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , meant almost certain death , with a survival rate of less than 10 % . 
A child with the same diagnosis today has a better than 80 % chance of being cured . 
Looking at the five-year survival rates for children with ALL from the 1970 &quot; s through the 1990 &quot; s , one sees an almost linear improvement in cure rates . 
This makes the 1970s , 1980 &quot; s , and 1990 &quot; s look like an era of accelerating discovery and therapeutic development . 
But virtually all of the drugs that we use today to cure children with cancer were discovered and approved in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s . 
So , if new drugs did not fuel four decades of progress , what did ? 
A major driver was a remarkable , sustained scientific collaboration . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , a group of clinical scientists recognized that , because childhood cancer was a rare disease , no single medical center could study enough patients to make the necessary advances across the spectrum of pediatric oncologic diseases . 
The decision to conduct collaborative research across multiple institutions resulted in the development of cooperative group research . 
In the fight against childhood cancer , this concept evolved into what is now the Children &apos;s Oncology Group ( COG ) , which unites more than 8,000 experts at more than 200 leading children &apos;s hospitals , universities , and cancer centers across North America , Australia , New Zealand , and parts of Europe . 
The COG conducts research across the spectrum of cancers that afflict children , and has approximately 100 clinical trials underway around the world . 
With an emerging infrastructure in place for cooperative research , sustained improvement in outcomes partly reflected an ever-increasing understanding that childhood cancers are diverse . 
Childhood ALL , for example , is not a single disease , but rather a spectrum of diseases . 
Recognition of this diversity led to the study of different treatment regimens in different sub-populations of children with pathologically similar cancers . 
Throughout this period , the ability to overcome the most common side effect of cancer drugs , myelosuppression ( a decrease in blood counts ) , improved dramatically . 
It began with the ability to transfuse not only red blood cells into anemic patients , but also platelets , reducing the threat of life-threatening bleeding that can accompany cancer therapy . 
Equally important , the risks and types of life-threatening infections that come with myelosuppression were increasingly recognized , leading to the development and better use of more effective antibiotics . 
Starting in the 1990 &quot; s , cytokines , drugs that stimulate bone marrow to produce infection-fighting white blood cells , began to be integrated into cancer treatments , further mitigating the risk of life-threatening infectious complications of care . 
As a result of these advances in science and supportive care , the same chemotherapeutic drugs could be delivered much more intensively for children with select types and sub-types of cancer . 
With selective intensification , cure rates began to increase steadily . 
And yet , while this strategy has indeed resulted in better outcomes , the acute and long-term morbidity of therapy has been substantial . 
Children with high-risk cancers who receive dose-intensive chemotherapy have a greater than 80 % chance of experiencing at least one severe , life-threatening , or fatal drug-related toxic event over the course of their treatment . 
The late effects of cancer treatment include permanent organ and tissue damage , hormonal and reproductive dysfunction , and second cancers . 
More than 40 % of the estimated 330,000 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States experience a significant health-related complication from childhood cancer and its treatment . 
And , despite our advances , cancer in developed countries remains the leading cause of death from disease in children older than one year . 
We are , however , entering an era of unprecedented discovery . 
The powerful research tools that we now have to uncover the underlying basis of childhood cancers could fundamentally change how we treat children with these dreaded diseases . 
For a limited number of childhood cancers , there are new drugs that can target the fundamental drivers of malignancy . 
The most notable example is the impact of Gleevec ( imatinib mesylate ) on outcomes for children with an uncommon subtype of leukemia - Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL . 
The addition of this inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy has dramatically improved the outlook for these children , increasing the rate of three-year event-free survival from 35 % to 80 % . 
The development of targeted new agents is likely to affect outcomes for other subtypes of childhood cancer , including anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and other types of leukemias . 
Given that childhood cancers are all rare or ultra-rare diseases , the ability of the biopharmaceutical industry to invest resources into development of new treatments is limited at best . 
Yet research is needed to identify potential targets for the entire spectrum of childhood cancers . 
For some potential targets , public-private partnerships will be needed to develop new therapeutic approaches . 
The past 40 years have demonstrated the remarkable return on investment to be gained in collaborative scientific research . 
Now we must leverage current scientific opportunities and invest the resources needed to develop more effective , less toxic therapies , thereby improving outcomes for all children with cancer .
