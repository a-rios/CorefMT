Egypt &apos;s Economic Siren 
NEWPORT BEACH - Facing a turbulent political situation and recurrent street protests , Egypt &apos;s political elite would be well advised to focus on the economic implications of the current turmoil , whether they are in government or in opposition . 
Doing so would lead them to recognize seven compelling reasons why a more collaborative approach to solving Egypt &apos;s problems is in the country &apos;s collective interest , as well as in their own individual interests . 
First , if the social and political disorder persists , Egypt &apos;s economy will end up with crippling inflation , severe balance-of-payments problems , and a budgetary crisis . 
The risk of a vicious , self-reinforcing downward spiral would rise sharply . 
But , rather than collapse ( in the style of Asian and Latin American economies during the debt crises of old ) , Egypt &apos;s economy would risk a return to stifling controls and black markets . 
Economic efficiency , investment , and employment would take a significant hit , while slower growth would be accompanied by higher prices , including for basic food items . 
Most segments of society would be harmed , with the poor , the unemployed , and the young suffering disproportionately . 
With that , the legitimate objectives of the revolution that began on January 25 , 2011 - inclusive growth , social justice , and human dignity - would prove even more elusive . 
Second , no durable economic and financial solutions are possible without cooperatively addressing the country &apos;s political quagmire . 
No matter how well intentioned and gifted , technocrats cannot ensure proper policies and deliver optimal outcomes . 
They need the backing of a unifying national vision , credible leadership , and citizens &quot; support . 
Third , faced with chronic economic disorder and political instability , Egyptians increasingly lament the &quot; hijacking &quot; of the revolution , fueling mistrust of the country &apos;s governing elites . 
Empowered by their success in ousting former President Hosni Mubarak , and then sending the country &apos;s armed forces back to the barracks , many are readily returning to the streets to hold leaders accountable . 
Fourth , repeated street protests , combined with a weak police force , fuel small pockets of criminal activity . 
Opportunistic thugs foment fear and chaos - real and perceived - that far exceed their number and power , amplifying the country &apos;s general sense of malaise . 
Fifth , external financial assistance cannot postpone the day of reckoning forever . 
Emergency support from a few friendly governments has so far limited the erosion of Egypt &apos;s foreign-currency reserves at a time of mediocre tourism earnings and growing imports of food and other basic necessities . 
Facing external payments obligations , and with the currency under pressure , the government will again seek a proposed $ 4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund and co-financing from other multilateral and bilateral sources . 
But securing this financing is becoming more complicated . 
Sixth , the Egyptian economy &apos;s potential , given the proper political context , should not be underestimated . 
Current conditions are keeping economic performance well below potential . 
This could be addressed promptly ; while eliminating inefficiencies and re-orienting institutions that were co-opted by the old system to serve the few rather than the many would increase potential output significantly . 
Finally , the country &apos;s political leaders can learn from other countries . 
Egypt is not the first country to struggle in the critical revolutionary pivot from a repressive past to a better and more just future . 
Nor is it the first country to combine an uncertain political transition with worrisome economic and financial conditions . 
It is tempting to dismiss other countries &quot; experiences , particularly after Egypt &apos;s youth-led grassroots movement delivered something that no one thought possible ( toppling in just 18 days a president that had ruled with an iron fist for 30 years ) . 
And some countries do indeed differ from Egypt to such an extent as to make potential lessons misleading . 
There is no single transition country that offers a guiding light for Egypt . 
But there may be a group of four countries - South Africa , Brazil , Indonesia , and Turkey - whose combined experience is relevant and would resonate among many segments of the Egyptian population when it comes to orderly economic and political transitions . 
Each of the four faced what many deemed overwhelming odds . 
Yet , by responding properly to their economic and political challenges , they all delivered poverty reduction , greater social justice , and expanded civil liberties . 
South Africa under President Nelson Mandela illustrated the upside of channeling popular sentiment away from retribution toward national renewal . 
While no single Egyptian leader can credibly convey Mandela &apos;s message of &quot; forgive but don &apos;t forget , &quot; together - working collaboratively and cooperatively - they can help to shift the country &apos;s focus from the rear-view mirror to the road ahead . 
Brazil under President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva demonstrated how basic reforms can be implemented in the context of turmoil caused by a major domestic political transition , fleeing investors , and an inhospitable global context . 
In 2004-2008 , Brazil , which had been perennially known as the country of the future - as in &quot; always has been and always will be &quot; - recorded 5.5 % annual average GDP growth . 
It reduced the proportion of citizens living in poverty from some 40 % to under 25 % . 
And it improved the 100-point Gini coefficient of income inequality by a full five points . 
Finally , both Indonesia ( after the Asian financial crisis of 1997 ) and Turkey ( after its 2001 crisis ) are recent examples of Muslim-majority countries that decisively overcame economic mishaps while dealing with major domestic political transitions . 
The longer Egypt &apos;s current disarray persists , the more its political elites will lose the battle for the hearts and minds of a population whose basic aspirations are summed up by four well-founded demands : bread , dignity , social justice , and democracy . 
But , with enlightened leadership and constructive cooperation , Egypt can overcome its current troubles . 
In the past , a growing gap between what the country &apos;s governing elites delivered and the population &apos;s legitimate aspirations would have been addressed by imposing further repression . 
The new Egypt will not allow this . 
The empowerment of ordinary Egyptians has fundamentally changed things . 
Egypt &apos;s political elites do not have unlimited time , and current economic trends are making the need to act increasingly urgent .
