China &apos;s American Bailout ? 
ZURICH - The twenty-first-century economy has thus far been shaped by capital flows from China to the United States - a pattern that has suppressed global interest rates , helped to reflate the developed world &apos;s leverage bubble , and , through its impact on the currency market , fueled China &apos;s meteoric rise . 
But these were no ordinary capital flows . 
Rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment , they came primarily from the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) , as it amassed $ 3.5 trillion in foreign reserves - largely US Treasury securities . 
The fact that a single institution wields so much influence over global macroeconomic trends has caused considerable anxiety , with doomsayers predicting that doubts about US debt sustainability will force China to sell off its holdings of US debt . 
This would drive up interest rates in the US and , ultimately , could trigger the dollar &apos;s collapse . 
But selling off US Treasury securities , it was argued , was not in China &apos;s interest , given that it would drive up the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate against the dollar , diminishing the domestic value of China &apos;s reserves and undermining the export sector &apos;s competitiveness . 
Indeed , a US defense department report last year on the national-security implications of China &apos;s holdings of US debt concluded that &quot; attempting to use US Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the &#91; US &#93; . &quot; 
To describe the symbiotic relationship between China &apos;s export-led GDP growth and America &apos;s excessive consumption , the economic historians Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick coined the term &quot; Chimerica . &quot; 
The invocation of the chimera of Greek mythology - a monstrous , fire-breathing amalgam of lion , goat , and dragon - makes the term all the more appropriate , given that Chimerica has generated massive and terrifying distortions in the global economy that cannot be corrected without serious consequences . 
In 2009 , these distortions led Ferguson and Schularick to forecast Chimerica &apos;s collapse - a prediction that seems to be coming true . 
With the reserves &quot; long-term effects on China &apos;s internal economic dynamics finally taking hold , selling off foreign-exchange reserves is now in China &apos;s interest . 
Over the last decade , the vast quantities of short-term capital that were being pumped into China &apos;s banking system drove commercial banks and other financial institutions to expand credit substantially , especially through the shadow-banking system , leading to a massive credit bubble and severe over-investment . 
In order to manage the resulting increase in risk , China &apos;s new leaders are now refusing to provide further liquidity injections , as well as curbing loans to unprofitable sectors . 
But these efforts could trigger a financial crisis , requiring China to initiate a major recapitalization of the banking system . 
In such a scenario , non-performing loans in China &apos;s banking system would probably amount to roughly $ 1 trillion . 
The most obvious means of recapitalizing China &apos;s banks would be to inject renminbi-denominated government debt into the banking sector . 
But China &apos;s total public debt , including off-balance-sheet local-government financing vehicles , probably amounts to around 70 % of GDP already . 
Despite debate over the details , the conclusion of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff - that a high debt / GDP ratio can inhibit economic growth - remains widely accepted ; so it is unlikely that raising the debt ratio to 100 % would be in China &apos;s long-term interest . 
Even if China &apos;s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy , they probably would not , owing to the risk of inflation , which , perhaps more than any other economic variable , tends to lead to social unrest . 
Given this , in the event of a crisis , China would most likely have to begin selling off its massive store of US debt . 
Fortunately for China , the negative consequences of such a move would probably be far less severe than previously thought . 
To be sure , an injection of US Treasuries into the banking sector , and their subsequent conversion to renminbi , would still strengthen China &apos;s currency . 
But the rise would most likely be offset by capital outflows , as looser capital controls would enable savers to escape the financial crisis . 
Moreover , even if the renminbi became stronger in the short term , China is no longer as dependent on maintaining export competitiveness as it once was , given that , excluding assembly and reprocessing , exports now contribute less than 5 % of China &apos;s GDP . 
Against this background , the US Federal Reserve , rather than focusing only on &quot; tapering &quot; its monthly purchases of long-term securities ( quantitative easing ) , must prepare itself for a potential sell-off of US debt . 
Given that a Fed-funded recapitalization of China &apos;s banking system would negate the impact of monetary policy at home , driving up borrowing costs and impeding GDP growth , the Fed should be ready to sustain quantitative easing in the event of a Chinese financial crisis . 
After spending years attempting to insulate the US economy from the upshot of its own banking crisis , the Fed may ultimately be forced to bail out China &apos;s banks , too . 
This would fundamentally redefine - and , one hopes , rebalance - US-China relations .
