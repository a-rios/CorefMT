Authoritarians at the Gate 
Last Thursday , judges at Indonesia &apos;s Central Jakarta Court sentenced me to one year in prison . 
As the editor-in-chief of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine , I am guilty , according to the court , of defaming a business tycoon named Tomy Winata by implying his possible involvement in a fire at Jakarta &apos;s South-East Asia textile market , and of fomenting riots by disseminating lies . 
Does my case , and others like it , portend the end of yet another short-lived experiment with democracy in Indonesia ? 
The &quot; riot &quot; that I allegedly fomented occurred in March last year , when almost two hundred thugs claiming to be Winata &apos;s followers attacked Tempo &apos;s office , threatened to burn down the building , harassed staff , and injured one reporter . 
Trying to help resolve the situation peacefully , I was persuaded to negotiate at the Central Jakarta Police Station , but found to my horror that the mob leaders controlled the station . 
I was punched and kicked as the police looked the other way . 
Fortunately , many journalists came to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras rolling . 
Their broadcasts caused a public outcry , which forced our parliament to organize a public hearing . 
The National and Jakarta police chiefs were called and , under massive public pressure , the leaders of the mob were criminally charged . 
But Winata himself eluded police investigation , merely by claiming publicly that his followers acted without his prior knowledge and consent . 
He then filed criminal charges of his own , against Ahmad Taufik , who wrote the article , Teuku Iskandar Ali , who edited it , and me . 
The yearlong court proceedings were marked by a series of suspicious developments , all favoring Winata . 
First , the case built by the police and state prosecutor contained documents that were so blatantly falsified that the police indicted two officers . 
But the court rejected our request that proceedings be delayed until the legality of the state &apos;s case could be clarified . 
The case against the officers involved appears to be going nowhere . 
On the contrary , one of them has been promoted to command the newly formed ( and US-funded ) Jakarta Anti-Terror Unit . 
The other has reportedly been sent to the police staff school for advanced training . 
Then , in the sixth month of the case , the Head Judge in the three-judge panel was suddenly promoted to become the head of a city court an hour from Jakarta . 
One of my lawyers noted that in his 35 years experience at the court , he had never seen a Head Judge replaced in an ongoing case . 
In fact , despite her promotion , the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building . 
A judge who had previously ruled against Tempo in Winata &apos;s civil suit filled her vacancy . 
Finally , when Winata testified , he perjured himself by denying that Tempo had interviewed him . 
A recording of the telephone interview was played in court ; sworn testimony was heard from the reporter who conducted the interview and from two editors who witnessed it ; the official record from the telephone company was submitted as evidence of the call ; and an expert witness concluded that the voice on the recording belonged to Tomy Winata . 
But the judges denied Tempo &apos;s request that Winata be arrested and tried for perjury , telling us to report it to the police , which we did . 
The judges then denied our request for a postponement of the court decision until Mr. Winata &apos;s perjury case was resolved . 
Given such flawed proceedings , my conviction and prison sentence come as no surprise . 
But I remain hopeful that we will prevail in the end , when higher courts hear Tempo &apos;s appeal . 
Indonesia &apos;s courts are cleaner at the top , and the Head of the Supreme Court is a staunch advocate of democracy and press freedom . 
Tempo &apos;s case could become a landmark victory for our democracy , like the US Supreme Court &apos;s famous decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan . 
By raising the bar for defamation charges , that decision ensures that American journalists can hold public officials accountable . 
No country knows better than Indonesia that free speech and a free press are proven indicators of democratic development , and that criminalizing journalists is an early symptom of authoritarianism . 
Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950 &apos;s , before President Sukarno , supported by the military , began a crackdown on the press in 1956 . 
With critical voices silenced , consolidating unchecked power became easier and , in July 1959 , Sukarno decreed the beginning of &quot; Guided Democracy . &quot; 
For the first few years after Sukarno &apos;s fall in 1966 , all the benefits of genuine democracy , including freedom of the press , were restored ( except for the communists ) . 
But President Suharto &apos;s regime began another press crackdown in the early 1970 &apos;s , ultimately banning various media and jailing many journalists . 
With the press under control , other political rights were quickly curtailed and Indonesian democracy failed again . 
Since Suharto &apos;s fall in 1998 , Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history . 
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the latest presidential run-off - have been free , fair , and peaceful , proving that Islam and democracy can coexist . 
Democracy &apos;s enemies , however , never rest . 
Radical Islamic groups have engaged in indiscriminate bombings , while groups with strong authoritarian tendencies have made inroads into President Megawati &apos;s inner circle . 
But Mrs Megawati has just been defeated in her bid for reelection . 
Will newly elected President Susilo continue to prosecute journalists ? 
Will my conviction , and the trials and convictions of other journalists , mark the beginning of the end of Indonesia &apos;s hard-won third democracy ? 
The answer lies in the support that Indonesian pro-democracy activists can generate domestically and internationally . 
To lose Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope to all pro-democracy activists in the world Muslim community - would be a terrible defeat .
