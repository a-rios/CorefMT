A New Dawn for Chinese Journalism ? 
A remarkable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists . 
Earlier this year , the government suspended publication of the newspaper Bing Dian Weekly , provoking unprecedented open protest , which received extensive media coverage worldwide . 
Even more surprisingly , the government , under the pressure of public opinion , has allowed Bing Dian to resume publication . 
The editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief were sacked , but the open questioning of the legitimacy of the government &apos;s authority to regulate journalism is bound to have a profound impact . 
Foreign observers are prone to associate the Bing Dian incident with other recent crackdowns on China &apos;s mass media , and to conclude that Chinese journalism freedom is hopeless under the present autocratic regulation . 
Undeniably , there has been no significant change in the government &apos;s system of journalism &apos;s regulation since China adopted its &quot; open door &quot; policy almost 30 years ago . 
On the contrary , it has become more rigorous and covert . 
But I still have faith that subtle changes are occurring . 
A prerequisite of effective control of the media is that the controlled accept the controller &apos;s ideology . 
After 1949 , the Communist Party cultivated a stable of &quot; theoretical experts &quot; and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating &quot; Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought . &quot; 
But nowadays , such writers are hard to find , and their work is received by readers with mockery and sarcasm . 
In fact , the Central Propaganda Department &apos;s ideological control can be maintained only through internal notices and telephone calls , which are widely scorned . 
More importantly , even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines . 
I recently met an official working for a provincial Department of Propaganda and was impressed by his bold and straightforward comments on current affairs . 
In private conversation , one might even take him for a liberal - one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity . 
For their part , producers of news have long since ceased to believe that news is propaganda . 
I started my career with 
Indeed , Western works are taught as &quot; models for writing &quot; to journalism students in China &apos;s universities . 
This is a crucial change , and it is the fundamental reason for an increasing number of genuine news items and commentaries in China &apos;s media today . 
Market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change . 
Contrary to foreign perceptions , only a handful of Chinese media - for example , 
To be sure , political information remains rigorously controlled , which puts a premium on &quot; harmless &quot; recreational , entertainment , and sports information - the reporting of which is basically free . 
This has resulted , in the short run , in an embrace of low journalistic standards . 
But many metropolitan newspapers that once thrived on infotainment have seen their circulation fall in recent years . 
Sooner or later , readers will start to buy newspapers that can truly inform them and give voice to their opinions . 
In fact , it is these tabloids , responding to market pressure , that have started to take on responsibility as public watchdogs . 
On many occasions in recent years , they have been the first to break sensitive news . 
As a result , mainstream media are being marginalized , and the previously marginalized media are becoming mainstream . 
Thus , even without any change in the current system of regulation , extensive coverage of disasters , judicial abuses , and citizens &quot; pursuit of their statutory rights , along with the questioning of policies from public perspectives , is now common . 
For example , reporting by the 
Such progress is slow and full of frustrations , for it reflects the incremental evolution of the system . 
But it is nonetheless real progress , indicating the growing influence of the Chinese media and pointing to China &apos;s becoming a country of &quot; free expression . &quot; 
According to an old Chinese saying , &quot; a just cause enjoys abundant support , while an unjust cause finds scant support . &quot; 
A &quot; just cause &quot; resides in people &apos;s hearts . 
Without the hearts of news producers - or , increasingly , of censors - the seemingly formidable edifice of journalistic regulation will , sooner or later , collapse like the Berlin Wall .
