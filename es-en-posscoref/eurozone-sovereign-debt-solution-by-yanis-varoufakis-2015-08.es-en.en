A New Approach to Eurozone Sovereign Debt 
ATHENS - Greece &apos;s public debt has been put back on Europe &apos;s agenda . 
Indeed , this was perhaps the Greek government &apos;s main achievement during its agonizing five-month standoff with its creditors . 
After years of &quot; extend and pretend , &quot; today almost everyone agrees that debt restructuring is essential . 
Most important , this is true not just for Greece . 
In February , I presented to the Eurogroup ( which convenes the finance ministers of eurozone member states ) a menu of options , including GDP-indexed bonds , which Charles Goodhart recently endorsed in the Financial Times , perpetual bonds to settle the legacy debt on the European Central Bank &apos;s books , and so forth . 
One hopes that the ground is now better prepared for such proposals to take root , before Greece sinks further into the quicksand of insolvency . 
But the more interesting question is what all of this means for the eurozone as a whole . 
The prescient calls from Joseph Stiglitz , Jeffrey Sachs , and many others for a different approach to sovereign debt in general need to be modified to fit the particular characteristics of the eurozone &apos;s crisis . 
The eurozone is unique among currency areas : Its central bank lacks a state to support its decisions , while its member states lack a central bank to support them in difficult times . 
Europe &apos;s leaders have tried to fill this institutional lacuna with complex , non-credible rules that often fail to bind , and that , despite this failure , end up suffocating member states in need . 
One such rule is the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s cap on member states &quot; public debt at 60 % of GDP . 
Another is the treaty &apos;s &quot; no bailout &quot; clause . 
Most member states , including Germany , have violated the first rule , surreptitiously or not , while for several the second rule has been overwhelmed by expensive financing packages . 
The problem with debt restructuring in the eurozone is that it is essential and , at the same time , inconsistent with the implicit constitution underpinning the monetary union . 
When economics clashes with an institution &apos;s rules , policymakers must either find creative ways to amend the rules or watch their creation collapse . 
Here , then , is an idea ( part of A Modest Proposal for Resolving the Euro Crisis , co-authored by Stuart Holland , and James K. Galbraith ) aimed at re-calibrating the rules , enhancing their spirit , and addressing the underlying economic problem . 
In brief , the ECB could announce tomorrow morning that , henceforth , it will undertake a debt-conversion program for any member state that wishes to participate . 
The ECB will service ( as opposed to purchase ) a portion of every maturing government bond corresponding to the percentage of the member state &apos;s public debt that is allowed by the Maastricht rules . 
Thus , in the case of member states with debt-to-GDP ratios of , say , 120 % and 90 % , the ECB would service , respectively , 50 % and 66.7 % of every maturing government bond . 
To fund these redemptions on behalf of some member states , the ECB would issue bonds in its own name , guaranteed solely by the ECB , but repaid , in full , by the member state . 
Upon the issue of such an ECB bond , the ECB would simultaneously open a debit account for the member state on whose behalf it issued the bond . 
The member state would then be legally obliged to make deposits into that account to cover the ECB bonds &quot; coupons and principal . 
Moreover , the member state &apos;s liability to the ECB would enjoy super-seniority status and be insured by the European Stability Mechanism against the risk of a hard default . 
Such a debt-conversion program would offer five benefits . 
For starters , unlike the ECB &apos;s current quantitative easing , it would involve no debt monetization . 
Second , the program would cause a large drop in the eurozone &apos;s aggregate interest payments . 
The Maastricht-compliant part of its members &quot; sovereign debt would be restructured with longer maturities ( equal to the maturity of the ECB bonds ) and at the ultra-low interest rates that only the ECB can fetch in international capital markets . 
Third , Germany &apos;s long-term interest rates would be unaffected , because Germany would neither be guaranteeing the debt-conversion scheme nor backing the ECB &apos;s bond issues . 
Fourth , the spirit of the Maastricht rule on public debt would be reinforced , and moral hazard would be reduced . 
After all , the program would boost significantly the interest-rate spread between Maastricht-compliant debt and the debt that remains in the member states &quot; hands ( which they previously were not permitted to accumulate ) . 
Finally , GDP-indexed bonds and other tools for dealing sensibly with unsustainable debt could be applied exclusively to member states &quot; debt not covered by the program and in line with international best practices for sovereign-debt management . 
The obvious solution to the euro crisis would be a federal solution . 
But federation has been made less , not more , likely by a crisis that tragically set one proud nation against another . 
Indeed , any political union that the Eurogroup would endorse today would be disciplinarian and ineffective . 
Meanwhile , the debt restructuring for which the eurozone - not just Greece - is crying out is unlikely to be politically acceptable in the current climate . 
But there are ways in which debt could be sensibly restructured without any cost to taxpayers and in a manner that brings Europeans closer together . 
One such step is the debt-conversion program proposed here . 
Taking it would help to heal Europe &apos;s wounds and clear the ground for the debate that the European Union needs about the kind of political union that Europeans deserve .
