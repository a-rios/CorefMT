Rouhani &apos;s Lost Chance 
ISTANBUL - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani &apos;s charm offensive has stalled . 
It worked well in the United Nations General Assembly last September , when he had something solid to offer - a deal on his country &apos;s nuclear program - raising hopes that Iran &apos;s hardline foreign-policy stance would finally soften . 
But UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon &apos;s withdrawal of Iran &apos;s invitation to the Geneva II conference on Syria suggests that Rouhani will need more than charm - or even a visit by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Tehran - to end his country &apos;s isolation . 
Rouhani has been largely successful in putting his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s tone-deaf leadership firmly in the past . 
The Iranian establishment has supported his attempts to open the country up to its regional neighbors , court foreign investment , call for moderation in religious and cultural matters , and even pursue the nuclear deal with the West . 
In fact , the nuclear agreement - which seems close to completion - is likely to be Iran &apos;s most important diplomatic achievement since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 , providing it with considerable relief both domestically and internationally . 
The fact that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei personally backed the effort makes it all the more promising . 
Nonetheless , the regime &apos;s possible rapprochement with the United States remains a source of concern in the Middle East , because it would empower Iran at a time when the US is gradually disengaging from the region . 
The question now is whether Rouhani &apos;s moderation toward the West will be accompanied by a change in Iran &apos;s Middle East policy , with all eyes on its policy toward Syria . 
Ban rescinded Iran &apos;s invitation to Geneva II under pressure from the US and the Syrian opposition . 
After all , since the civil war began in 2011 , Iran has provided essential financial and military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , while mobilizing its Lebanese proxy , the powerful Hezbollah militia , to fight against the rebels in Syria . 
Whatever concerns the opposition has about Iran &apos;s allegiances , the country is undoubtedly part of the Syrian equation ; indeed , its involvement is critical to reaching any accord . 
But Rouhani &apos;s failure to make a decisive statement on Syria - even after a series of leaked photographs of systematic torture and massacre raised the ire of the international community - has not helped the case for keeping Iran in the fold . 
Rouhani recently had an opportunity to discuss Iran &apos;s stance . 
But , addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos , he squandered it , sticking to platitudes about the need for governments in the region to listen to their citizens and provide young people with &quot; jobs and hope . &quot; 
On the subject of despotic rulers , Rouhani offered only the benign observation that they lack the ability to connect with and understand their people . 
Rouhani &apos;s recent rhetoric , however positive , falls far short of the expectations that his diplomacy has raised since his UN address last September . 
In Davos , the world expected a decisive statement on Syria and other regional problems - not hackneyed nationalist rhetoric about eliminating &quot; biases &quot; against Iran . 
Rouhani must have known that his failure to address the humanitarian disaster in Syria would damage his diplomatic strategy , which suggests that he must have had a strong reason . 
Two possibilities stand out : either there is no consensus within the Iranian elite for a policy change , or the elite remain united in their determination to continue backing Assad . 
Neither alternative is particularly charming , which would explain why he preferred to obscure his country &apos;s position . 
To be sure , Erdoğan &apos;s visit to Tehran this week could help to defuse tensions over Syria - a subject on which Turkey and Iran have diametrically opposing views . 
But it is unlikely to smooth the divisions among Iran &apos;s elite , much less convince hardliners to stop backing Assad , leaving the visit &apos;s significance uncertain , at best . 
In refusing to take a strong position on Syria , Rouhani - like so many other world leaders - is placing his own interests above those of the 2.3 million registered Syrian refugees , the millions more who have been internally displaced , the estimated 130,000 people killed , and the rest of Syria &apos;s long-suffering population . 
When he said in Davos , &quot; we cannot be indifferent to the pain and suffering of our fellow brethren in the region , &quot; he might as well have been referring to the Assad regime and its partners in crime . 
What Syria needs is not rhetoric or charisma ; it needs action . 
Iran appears incapable of providing it . 
That is why Rouhani &apos;s charm offensive will not be enough to persuade Iran &apos;s adversaries that the Islamic Republic is ready to come in from the cold .
