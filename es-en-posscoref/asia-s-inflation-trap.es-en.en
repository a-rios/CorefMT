Asia &apos;s Inflation Trap 
NEW HAVEN - Asia has an inflation problem . 
The sooner it comes to grips with its problem , the better . 
Unfortunately , the appropriate sense of urgency is missing . 
Willingness to tackle inflation is impeded by Asia &apos;s heavy reliance on exports and external demand . 
Fearful of a relapse of end-market demand in a still-shaky post-crisis world , Asian policymakers have been reluctant to take an aggressive stand for price stability . 
That needs to change - before it &apos;s too late . 
Excluding Japan , which remains mired in seemingly chronic deflation , Asian inflation rose to 5.3 % in the 12 months ending in November 2010 , up markedly from the 3.5 % rate a year earlier . 
Trends in the region &apos;s two giants are especially worrisome , with inflation having pierced the 5 % threshold in China and running in excess of 8 % in India . 
Price growth is worrisome in Indonesia ( 7 % ) , Singapore ( 3.8 % ) , Korea ( 3.5 % ) , and Thailand ( 3 % ) as well . 
Yes , sharply rising food prices are an important factor in boosting headline inflation in Asia . 
But this is hardly a trivial development for low-income families in the developing world , where the share of foodstuffs in household budgets - 46 % in India and 33 % in China - is 2-3 times the ratio in developed countries . 
At the same time , there has been a notable deterioration in underlying &quot; core &quot; inflation , which strips out food and energy prices . 
Annual core inflation for Asia ( excluding Japan ) was running at a 4 % rate in late 2010 - up about one percentage point from late 2009 . 
A key lesson from the Great Inflation of the 1970 &quot; s is that central banks can &apos;t afford a false sense of comfort from any dichotomy between headline and core inflation . 
Spillover effects are inevitable , and once a corrosive increase in inflationary expectations sets in , it becomes all the more painful to unwind . 
The good news for Asia is that most of the region &apos;s monetary authorities are , in fact , tightening policy . 
The bad news is that they have been generally slow to act . 
Financial markets appear to be expecting a good deal more Asian monetary tightening - at least that &apos;s the message that can be drawn from sharply appreciating Asian currencies , which seem to be responding to prospective moves in policy interest rates . 
Relative to the US dollar , an equal-weighted basket of 10 major Asian currencies ( excluding Japan ) has retraced the crisis-related distortions of 2008-2009 and has now returned to pre-crisis highs . 
Export-led economies , of course , can &apos;t take currency appreciation lightly - it undermines competitiveness and risks eroding the country &apos;s share of the global market . 
It also invites destabilizing hot-money capital inflows . 
Given the tenuous post-crisis climate , with uncertain demand prospects in the major markets of the developed world , Asia finds itself in a classic policy trap , dragging its feet on monetary tightening while risking the negative impact of stronger currencies . 
There is only one way out for Asia : a significant increase in real , or inflation-adjusted , policy interest rates . 
Benchmark policy rates are currently below headline inflation in India , South Korea , Hong Kong , Singapore , Thailand , and Indonesia . 
They are only slightly positive in China , Taiwan , and Malaysia . 
The lessons of earlier battles against inflation are clear on one fundamental point : inflationary pressures cannot be contained by negative , or slightly positive , real short-term interest rates . 
The only effective anti-inflation strategy entails aggressive monetary tightening that takes policy rates into the restrictive zone . 
The longer this is deferred , the more wrenching the ultimate policy adjustment - and its consequences for growth and employment - will be . 
With inflation - both headline and core - now on an accelerating path , Asian central banks can &apos;t afford to slip further behind the curve . 
Asia has far too many important items on its strategic agenda to remain caught in a policy trap . 
This is especially true of China , whose government is focused on the pro-consumption rebalancing imperatives of its soon-to-be-enacted 12th Five-Year Plan . 
So far , the Chinese leadership has adopted a measured approach to inflation . 
Its efforts focus mainly on increasing banks &quot; mandatory reserve ratios while introducing administrative measures to deal with food price pressures , approving a couple of token interest-rate hikes , and managing a modest upward adjustment in the currency . 
The mix of Chinese policy tightening , however , needs to shift much more decisively toward higher interest rates . 
With the Chinese economy still growing at close to 10 % per year , the government can afford to take more short-term policy risk in order to clear the way for its structural agenda . 
Indeed , China &apos;s dilemma is emblematic of one of developing Asia &apos;s greatest challenges : the need to tilt the growth model away from external toward internal demand . 
That can &apos;t happen without increased wages and purchasing power for workers . 
But , in an increasingly inflationary environment , any such efforts could fuel an outbreak of the dreaded wage-price spiral - the same lethal interplay that wreaked such havoc in the United States in the 1970 &quot; s . 
Asia can avoid this problem and get on with the heavy lifting of pro-consumption rebalancing only by nipping inflation in the bud . 
Much is made of Asia &apos;s Teflon-like resilience in an otherwise tough post-crisis climate . 
Led by China , the high-flying economies of developing Asia are increasingly viewed as the new and powerful engines of a multi-speed world . 
While the jury is out on whether there has really been such a seamless transition of global economic leadership , Asia must face up to the critical challenges that may come with this new role . 
Inflation , if not addressed now , could seriously compromise the region &apos;s ability to meet those challenges .
