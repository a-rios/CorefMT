Putin in the Dock 
STANFORD - To read the international press , one would think that the last two years have been good ones for Russian President Vladimir Putin . 
His campaign in Ukraine has largely achieved its main goals ; 
Russia has wrested control of Crimea and destabilized large portions of the rest of the country . 
Plunging oil prices may have wreaked havoc on Russia &apos;s finances , but so far Putin &apos;s popularity seems unaffected . 
But a long stream of little-remarked-upon legal defeats could have a dramatic impact on Putin &apos;s fortunes . 
In 2014 , for example , the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) delivered 129 judgments against Russia , and in January , the Council of Europe deprived Russia of its voting rights for its violations of international law . 
As the rulings pile up , they are starting to pose a threat to Russia &apos;s international standing , its financial health , and Putin himself . 
The rulings have not been merely symbolic . 
In July 2014 , the Permanent Court for Arbitration in The Hague ordered Russia to pay $ 50 billion to former shareholders of the oil company Yukos for having illegally bankrupted the firm and distributed its assets to Rosneft , a state-owned producer . 
At its peak in 2003 , Yukos was valued at $ 30 billion . 
The judgment is the largest ever awarded by the arbitration court , and it cannot be appealed . 
France and Belgium have begun seizing Russian assets to enforce the judgment . 
In a separate case , in June 2014 the ECHR ordered Russia to pay Yukos &apos;s shareholders more than $ 2 billion &quot; in respect of pecuniary damage . &quot; 
This judgment was also the largest in that court &apos;s history . 
Russia , which is in the midst of a liquidity crisis , will struggle to raise such huge sums ; failure to comply , however , would jeopardize future foreign investments . 
The Yukos case could be a sign of things to come . 
In April , the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to Russian gas giant Gazprom , charging it with violating Europe &apos;s antitrust laws by partitioning Central and Eastern European gas markets , forbidding cross-border resale , and closing its pipelines to third parties . 
Gazprom faces a fine of 10 % of its revenues , which totaled $ 177 billion in its last fiscal year . 
Already struggling with low gas prices , increased competition , and now falling production Gazprom will be hard pressed to come up with the necessary funds without sacrificing urgent infrastructure projects . 
Russia is also coming under increased pressure regarding alleged criminal conduct . 
Indeed , it recently vetoed a Security Council resolution , sought by Malaysia , Ukraine , the Netherlands , Australia , and Belgium , to establish a criminal tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014 over rebel-occupied territory in eastern Ukraine . 
Evidence gathered by the five countries points to a missile fired from a Russian BUK system operated by a Russian crew . 
Were Russian guilt for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 to be established , Putin &apos;s depiction of his country as a bystander in the Ukrainian conflict would be exposed as a lie . 
In any case , Russia &apos;s veto in the Security Council is a tacit admission of guilt , opening the door for the Netherlands - which lost the most citizens in the attack - to push for additional sanctions . 
Meanwhile , in July 2014 , the United Kingdom reinstated a legal inquiry into the November 2006 polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko , a former Russian state security officer who had become a UK citizen . 
Public hearings were held in London to identify &quot; where responsibility for the death lies . &quot; 
The inquiry devoted particular attention to a Russian law passed in March 2006 allowing the state to kill those , such as Litvinenko , deemed to jeopardize national security . 
A ruling by a British court that the Russian government ordered or abetted the murder of Litvinenko would have far-reaching consequences . 
The verdict would lend credibility to other charges of criminality , such as the bombing of four Russian apartment blocks in 1999 and the murders of several investigative journalists . 
It would also strengthen the European Parliament &apos;s call for an independent international investigation of the murder of the Russian opposition political leader , former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov , and bolster his family &apos;s petition for an international investigation . 
Finally , while Russia has established de facto control of Crimea , it is likely to find itself increasingly embroiled in legal challenges to its presence there . 
No credible government or international organization accepts Russia &apos;s description of the annexation as a legal democratic act by the Crimean people . 
The United Nations , the G-7 , the European Union , and the United States all characterize it as an illegal act . 
In May , German Chancellor Angela Merkel described it - in Putin &apos;s presence - as &quot; criminal and illegal under international law . &quot; 
In June , Ukraine presented Russia with a 17-volume calculation of its losses from the annexation of Crimea , totaling nearly $ 90 billion . 
Additional losses could be billed for the Russian-supported war in southeast Ukraine , which has led to 6,000 deaths and large-scale damage to infrastructure . 
Russia is certain to find itself mired in years of legal battles in venues like the ECHR and the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes . 
These endless legal challenges will scare off investment in Crimea , requiring Russia to subsidize its occupation for years to come . 
Putin has overplayed his hand . 
In addition to its exposure to liability for damage caused during the conflict in Ukraine , Russia faces legal penalties totaling roughly 4 % of its GDP - roughly what it spends on education . 
Putin may have been able to bring his country &apos;s legal system under his control , but he remains vulnerable to international rulings . 
With Russia too enmeshed in the international legal and financial system to cut ties and become a rogue state , its president is increasingly likely to face the consequences of his actions .
