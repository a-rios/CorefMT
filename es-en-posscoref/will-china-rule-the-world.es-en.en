Will China Rule the World ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Thirty years ago , China had a tiny footprint on the global economy and little influence outside its borders , save for a few countries with which it had close political and military relationships . 
Today , the country is a remarkable economic power : the world &apos;s manufacturing workshop , its foremost financier , a leading investor across the globe from Africa to Latin America , and , increasingly , a major source of research and development . 
The Chinese government sits atop an astonishing level of foreign reserves - greater than $ 2 trillion . 
There is not a single business anywhere in the world that has not felt China &apos;s impact , either as a low-cost supplier , or more threateningly , as a formidable competitor . 
China is still a poor country . 
Although average incomes have risen very rapidly in recent decades , they still stand at between one-seventh and one-eighth the levels in the United States - lower than in Turkey or Colombia and not much higher than in El Salvador or Egypt . 
While coastal China and its major metropolises evince tremendous wealth , large swaths of Western China remain mired in poverty . 
Nevertheless , China &apos;s economy is projected to surpass that of the US in size sometime in the next two decades . 
Meanwhile , the US , the world &apos;s sole economic hyper-power until recently , remains a diminished giant . 
Its credibility after the disastrous invasion of Iraq is at an all-time low , notwithstanding the global sympathy for President Barack Obama , and its economic model is in tatters . 
The once-almighty dollar totters at the mercy of China and the oil-rich states . 
All of which raises the question of whether China will eventually replace the US as the world &apos;s hegemon , the global economy &apos;s rule setter and enforcer . 
In a fascinating new book , revealingly titled When China Rules the World , the British scholar and journalist Martin Jacques is unequivocal : if you think China will be integrated smoothly into a liberal , capitalist , and democratic world system , Jacques argues , you are in for a big surprise . 
Not only is China the next economic superpower , but the world order that it will construct will look very different from what we have had under American leadership . 
Americans and Europeans blithely assume that China will become more like them as its economy develops and its population gets richer . 
This is a mirage , Jacques says . 
The Chinese and their government are wedded to a different conception of society and polity : community-based rather than individualist , state-centric rather than liberal , authoritarian rather than democratic . 
China has 2,000 years of history as a distinct civilization from which to draw strength . 
It will not simply fold under Western values and institutions . 
A world order centered on China will reflect Chinese values rather than Western ones , Jacques argues . 
Beijing will overshadow New York , the renminbi will replace the dollar , Mandarin will take over from English , and schoolchildren around the world will learn about Zheng He &apos;s voyages of discovery along the Eastern coast of Africa rather than about Vasco de Gama or Christopher Columbus . 
Gone will be the evangelism of markets and democracy . 
China is much less likely to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states . 
But , in return , it will demand that smaller , less powerful states explicitly recognize China &apos;s primacy ( just as in the tributary systems of old ) . 
Before any of this comes to pass , however , China will have to continue its rapid economic growth and maintain its social cohesion and political unity . 
None of this is guaranteed . 
Beneath China &apos;s powerful economic dynamo lie deep tensions , inequalities , and cleavages that could well derail a smooth progression to global hegemony . 
Throughout its long history , centrifugal forces have often pushed the country into disarray and disintegration . 
China &apos;s stability hinges critically on its government &apos;s ability to deliver steady economic gains to the vast majority of the population . 
China is the only country in the world where anything less than 8 % growth year after year is believed to be dangerous because it would unleash social unrest . 
Most of the rest of the world only dreams about growth at that rate , which speaks volumes about the underlying fragility of the Chinese system . 
The authoritarian nature of the political regime is at the core of this fragility . 
It allows only repression when the government faces protests and opposition outside the established channels . 
The trouble is that it will become increasingly difficult for China to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienced in recent years . 
China &apos;s growth currently relies on an undervalued currency and a huge trade surplus . 
This is unsustainable , and sooner or later it will precipitate a major confrontation with the US ( and Europe ) . 
There are no easy ways out of this dilemma . 
If China surmounts these hurdles and does eventually become the world &apos;s predominant economic power , globalization will , indeed , take on Chinese characteristics . 
Democracy and human rights will then likely lose their luster as global norms . 
That is the bad news . 
The good news is that a Chinese global order will display greater respect for national sovereignty and more tolerance for national diversity .
