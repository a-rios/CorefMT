Iran &apos;s Syrian Power Grab and Saudi Arabia 
RIYADH - Inviting Iran to the next round of talks on the Syria crisis in Vienna , Austria - an invitation that was reiterated last week - has far-reaching implications . 
In fact , Iran &apos;s current government is attempting to overthrow a balance of power that has endured for some 1,400 years - and Saudi Arabia , as the cradle of the Muslim world , will not allow it . 
The divide between Iran and Saudi Arabia , the Middle East &apos;s most prominent Shia and Sunni powers , respectively , has deep roots . 
If we are to understand what is really happening in the Middle East today - not just in Syria - one must consider the origins of the Sunni-Shia schism , the Arab-Persian divide , and past struggles over the governance of Islam . 
Islam was divided between Sunni and Shia after the prophet Muhammad died and a new successor had to be chosen . 
Most of his followers , who became known as Sunni Muslims , felt that the faithful should base their decision on ability , and supported the Muslim elders &quot; choice of Muhammad &apos;s father-in-law , Abu Bakr . 
But a small dissident group , who would eventually become known as Shia Muslims , were adamant that the new caliph should be a blood relative of the prophet , and thus decided that Muhammad &apos;s son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib ( the fourth caliph , according to Sunnis ) was his rightful successor . 
Today , 90 % of all Muslims are Sunni , and 10 % are Shia . 
While this disagreement was playing out , so was the Muslim conquest of Persia , which began just a year after the prophet &apos;s death in 632 . 
The Persian Sassanid Empire , exhausted financially and militarily from decades of warfare with the Byzantine Empire , endured a decisive defeat in the Battle of Qadisiyyah in 636 . 
The next year , the Persian emperor , Yazdegerd III , fled to the border province of Khorasan and the Arabization of Persia began , with Persians taking Arab names and converting to Islam . 
By 651 , almost all major urban centers in Persia were under Arab control , adding momentum to the process . 
The mass conversion to Islam among Persians was the first step toward the establishment of the first caliphate , a political-religious state comprising all Muslim lands . 
At various times in history , caliphates have extended into Asia , Africa , and parts of Europe . 
The effort by various forces seeking to control or restore the caliphate is a recurrent theme throughout Islam &apos;s history . 
The so-called Islamic State is only the latest example of this . 
Until the year 1500 , almost all Persians were Sunni Muslims . 
Then , Shah Ismail - the first Shah and the founder of the Safavid Dynasty - began a brutal policy of forcing Persian Muslims to become Shia , in order to distinguish his iteration of Persia &apos;s empire from the more powerful Constantinople-based and fervently Sunni Ottoman caliphate . 
This history clearly informs Iran &apos;s actions today . 
As Shia Muslims , Iranians are a minority within the Muslim community , a reality that has caused them to feel persecuted . 
Rather than accept their minority status , various Iranian governments have attempted to establish their country &apos;s hegemony in the Arab world . 
Of course , Iran not only represents only a tiny minority of Muslims ; 
But this has not stopped Iran &apos;s government from attempting to commandeer the main levers of Islam , both politically and theologically . 
Using Arab countries &quot; Shia communities , it is trying to wield control over them , with the ultimate objective of taking over Islam &apos;s two holiest sites , Mecca and Medina , over which the Saudi monarch exercises authority as the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques . 
As the Sunni world &apos;s most influential country , Saudi Arabia knows that it must do what it takes to limit Iran . 
In 2011 , a Saudi-led Gulf Cooperation Council coalition had to neutralize an Iran-sponsored Shia insurgency in Bahrain . 
This year in Yemen ( a predominantly Sunni country ) , a Saudi-led coalition is fighting the Zaydi Shia Houthi rebels , whom Iran armed in order to take over the country and gain a foothold on the Arabian Peninsula . 
In Syria - a Sunni-majority country where , incidentally , a Sunni Muslim caliphate , the Umayyads , once prospered - Iran is spending billions of dollars to prop up President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , dominated by members of a minority Shia sect , the Alawites ( historically known as Nusayris ) . 
Actions by Assad &apos;s supporters have so far caused more than 270,000 deaths , displaced over seven million people internally , forced nearly four million people to flee , and left close to 12 million in need of desperate assistance . 
They have enabled - indeed , fueled - the rise of the Islamic State , and with it a growing threat to the global order , as the successive terrorist attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh , Beirut , and Paris tragically have shown . 
Given this , Saudi Arabia &apos;s leadership - regardless of what temporary results are achieved through the Vienna talks - will continue to work hard to ensure that Assad is removed from power and that the mayhem is finally brought to an end . 
The terrorism , proxy wars , arms shipments , nuclear ambitions , and grandiose delusions emerging from Iran are part of an age-old struggle with which the Saudis have had enough . 
That is why King Salman is overseeing the greatest military acquisition and expansion program in Saudi Arabia &apos;s history .
