Last Chance for Ukraine and Europe 
LONDON - The European Union stands at a crossroads . 
The shape it takes five years from now will be decided in the coming 3-5 months . 
Year after year , the EU has successfully muddled through its difficulties . 
But now it has to deal with two sources of existential crisis : Greece and Ukraine . 
That may prove too much . 
Greece &apos;s long-festering crisis has been mishandled by all parties from the outset . 
Emotions now are running so high that muddling through is the only constructive alternative . 
But Ukraine is different . 
Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia is the aggressor , and Ukraine , in defending itself , is defending the values and principles on which the EU was built . 
Yet Europe treats Ukraine like another Greece . 
Putin is gaining ground in Ukraine , and Europe is so preoccupied with Greece that it hardly pays any attention . 
Putin &apos;s preferred outcome in Ukraine is to engineer a financial and political collapse that destabilizes the country , and for which he can disclaim responsibility , rather than a military victory that leaves him in possession of - and responsible for - part of Ukraine . 
He has shown this by twice converting a military victory into a ceasefire . 
The deterioration in Ukraine &apos;s position between the two ceasefire agreements - Minsk I , negotiated last September , and Minsk II , completed in February - shows the extent of Putin &apos;s success . 
But that success is temporary , and Ukraine is too valuable an ally for the EU to abandon . 
There is something fundamentally wrong with EU policy . 
How else could Putin &apos;s Russia have outmaneuvered Ukraine &apos;s allies , which used to lead the free world ? 
The trouble is that Europe has been drip-feeding Ukraine , just as it has Greece . 
As a result , Ukraine barely survives , while Putin has the first-mover advantage . 
He can choose between hybrid war and hybrid peace , and Ukraine and its allies are struggling to respond . 
The deterioration of Ukraine &apos;s situation is accelerating . 
The financial collapse of which I had been warning for months occurred in February , when the hryvnia &apos;s value plummeted 50 % in a few days , and the National Bank of Ukraine had to inject large amounts of money to rescue the banking system . 
The climax was reached on February 25 , when the central bank introduced import controls and raised interest rates to 30 % . 
Since then , President Petro Poroshenko &apos;s jawboning has brought the exchange rate back close to the level on which Ukraine &apos;s 2015 budget was based . 
But the improvement is extremely precarious . 
This temporary collapse has shaken public confidence and endangered the balance sheets of Ukrainian banks and companies that have hard-currency debts . 
It has also undermined the calculations on which Ukraine &apos;s programs with the International Monetary Fund are based . 
The IMF &apos;s Extended Fund Facility became insufficient even before it was approved . 
But EU member states , facing their own fiscal constraints , have shown no willingness to consider additional bilateral aid . 
At the same time , a radical reform program within Ukraine is gaining momentum , and slowly becoming visible to both the Ukrainian public and the European authorities . 
There is a stark contrast between the deteriorating external situation and the continuing progress in internal reforms . 
One plausible scenario is that Putin achieves his optimal objective and Ukraine &apos;s resistance crumbles . 
Europe would be flooded with refugees - two million seems to be a realistic estimate . 
Many people expect that this would mark the beginning of Cold War II . 
The likelier outcome is that a victorious Putin would have many friends in Europe , and that the sanctions on Russia would be allowed to lapse . 
That is the worst possible outcome for Europe , which would become even more divided , turning into a battleground for influence between Putin &apos;s Russia and the United States . 
The EU would cease to be a functioning political force in the world ( especially if Greece also left the eurozone ) . 
A more likely scenario is that Europe muddles through by drip-feeding Ukraine . 
Putin would find this almost as satisfactory as a complete collapse . 
But his victory would be less secure , as it would lead to a second Cold War that Russia would lose , just as the Soviet Union lost the first . 
Putin &apos;s Russia needs oil at $ 100 a barrel and will start running out of currency reserves in 2-3 years . 
The latest chapter in what I call the &quot; Tragedy of the European Union &quot; is that the EU will lose the new Ukraine . 
The principles that Ukraine is defending - the very principles on which the EU is based - will be abandoned , and the EU will have to spend a lot more money on defending itself than it would need to spend helping the new Ukraine succeed . 
There is also a more hopeful scenario . 
The new Ukraine is still alive and determined to defend itself . 
Though Ukraine , on its own , is no match for Russia &apos;s military might , its allies could decide to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to help , short of becoming involved in a direct military confrontation with Russia or violating the Minsk agreement . 
Doing so would not only help Ukraine ; it would also help the EU to recapture the values and principles that it seems to have lost . 
Needless to say , this is the scenario I advocate .
