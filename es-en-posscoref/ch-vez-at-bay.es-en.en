Chávez at Bay 
SÃO PAULO - The recent opposition victories in Venezuela &apos;s municipal and state elections , together with the international financial crisis , have begun to set limits on the powers of President Hugo Chávez for the first time in the decade he has been in power . 
Indeed , the elections demonstrated that Chávez &apos;s control of the country is no longer total . 
There is now a solid opposition in Venezuela and less distance between those who rule and those who want to rule . 
This is important progress , considering that the opposition is still paying a price for its boycott of the 2005 elections that gave Chávez absolute control of Parliament . 
The growing strength and coherence of the opposition is not due to the number of disaffected Chávez supporters alone . 
In fact , those who once hoped for the creation of a &quot; third pole &quot; in Venezuelan politics were pushed aside by the traditional polarization between Chávez &apos;s supporters and opponents . 
Instead , the opposition grew because of a return to its 1998 and 2001 levels of popular support - around 40 % - and because it was able to bring back into the fold some of the abstainers and undecided , including important popular factions . 
The opposition is now represented mostly by professional democratic politicians who not only united a wide group of factions , but also displaced the &quot; Salvadores de la Patria &quot; ( the Nation &apos;s Saviors ) - a group accustomed to leading the opposition from the reception rooms of the capital &apos;s hotels . 
The opposition &apos;s new leadership also displaced those who wanted to supplant &quot; populist &quot; leaders with an anti-political discourse . 
Thus , the opposition achieved its objective : a beachhead in Venezuelan politics with real and significant popular support . 
This political rebalancing - in terms of both votes and institutions - could create higher barriers against any authoritarian deviation , wherever it might come from . 
Chávez and his partisans must now learn what it is like to rule within limits . 
The president had hoped to repeat his role as Great Campaigner in previous elections , and so personally led his own campaign , ignoring criticism that he was unfairly taking advantage of the powers of his office . 
The paradox of this jolting election is that it will actually stabilize politics in Venezuela , at least for now , and will favor a renewal of democracy . 
This does not mean that Chávez &apos;s revolutionary and anti-imperialist rhetoric has lost all its appeal . 
Indeed , the shadows of militarism that have appeared over the Chávez regime may well have unnerved a majority of Venezuelans , who wonder who the next adversary to be pursued will be . 
Nevertheless , it is clear that Chávez will continue with his tropical socialism , proclaiming the value of Venezuela &apos;s participatory democracy and insisting on his anti-imperialist creed . 
The opposition , meanwhile , will try to expand on its victory , which , though partial , was significant in its political symbolism . 
Between these extremes , Venezuela &apos;s people will watch events develop , unwilling to compromise their democracy or lose the economic privileges they have attained . 
Chávez now faces a new electoral reality , one first established in December 2007 when he lost the advisory referendum he had called in order to secure a new Constitution . 
The electoral results of November 2008 , and a global financial crisis that has strained Chávez &apos;s ability to pay for his radical policies , may now limit his chances to continue dividing a country whose inhabitants , like most people , want to live in a peaceful and prosperous democracy .
