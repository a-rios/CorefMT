Containment Begins at Home 
NEW YORK - Earlier this month , Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez , a 24-year-old US citizen of Middle Eastern descent , opened fire at two military sites in Chattanooga , Tennessee , killing five . 
This act of local horror was also one of national significance , for it vindicated the late US diplomat and strategist George F. Kennan &apos;s warning that American foreign policymakers should hold in check their urge to act , especially militarily . 
One can never know when the blowback will come , Kennan warned , but it will . 
Indeed , unforeseeable consequences were precisely what concerned Kennan when the United States charged into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq two years later . 
After all , it was no coincidence that many of those the US was fighting in Afghanistan , including Osama bin Laden himself , had been associated with the Mujahedeen , the guerilla-style units of Muslim warriors whom US forces trained as insurgents during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation . 
Likewise , the US had armed Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq to go to war with Iran in the 1980s . 
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Americans asked , &quot; Why do they hate us ? &quot; 
Yet , though the US has experienced no attack on its soil since then , US President George W. Bush &apos;s administration pursued , virtually unchecked , the destruction of two Muslim countries - and the devastation has continued beyond Bush &apos;s tenure with an ever-intensifying campaign of drone strikes . 
These policies have helped push Afghanistan to the precipice of state failure , while opening the way for the Islamic State to take over more than one-third of Iraq &apos;s territory . 
The resulting discontent in those countries and across the Muslim world has increasingly been felt in Europe - and now is emerging in the US , too . 
To be sure , US criminal investigators have not officially identified the motives of the Kuwaiti-born Abdulazeez , who does not seem to have belonged to a terror network . 
But there is plenty of precedent for an alienated and disenchanted young man , brought up in the West ( Abdulazeez attended high school and college in Chattanooga ) , to seek a cause worth fighting for - and to find it in the perceived humiliation of Islam by America and the West . 
Of course , as soon as the word &quot; Islam &quot; appears , Western media start painting such &quot; lone wolves &quot; as agents of some vast Islamic conspiracy , rather than deeply wounded and desperate individuals . 
Such an interpretation makes the act easier to understand : a cog in a terrorist network would be compelled , even brainwashed , to mount such an attack . 
But when the attacker is a solitary individual - an American citizen , no less- it raises serious questions about the system from which he or she ( though almost always a he in these cases ) emerged . 
According to some press accounts , Abdulazeez felt a sense of failure at his inability to meet America &apos;s standard of success , of which money is the primary measure . 
Though he did not appear deeply religious , he allegedly praised the late Anwar al-Awlaki , a US-born al-Qaeda cleric and an advocate of attacks on &quot; hypocritical &quot; America , as a model of triumph over failure . 
Another question about the US system stems from the refusal of Abdulazeez &apos;s health insurer to approve his participation in an in-patient drug and alcohol program . 
This is far from the first time the US has experienced a mass murder by someone whose mental-health issues , including addiction , had been overlooked . 
Does this reflect a systemic failure ? 
More fundamentally , does it controvert America &apos;s principles ? 
Rather than considering such questions , the US remains focused on the external scourge of Islamic terrorism . 
Kennan recognized this tendency decades ago , when he warned that shortsighted policies at home and abroad had already put America in a vulnerable position . 
Instead of basking in its own superiority , he advised , the US should learn from the mistakes of its enemies , including Russia . 
In the 2000s , Kennan compared the Bush administration &apos;s &quot; global war on terror &quot; to Russia &apos;s wars against Chechen separatists in the North Caucasus . 
When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991 , Boris Yeltsin , Russia &apos;s first president , promised its subjects &quot; as much sovereignty as they can swallow . &quot; 
The Chechens , who had sought independence from Russia for centuries , took this promise as an opportunity for self-determination . 
But Yeltsin , unwilling to lose any more territories after the Soviet Union &apos;s initial breakup , reneged on his pledge . 
In 1993 , the first Chechen war erupted . 
Russia managed to defeat the separatists and maintain control over Chechnya . 
But it was a Pyrrhic victory , given that it drove many disillusioned and angry Chechens toward religious fundamentalism . 
As a result , when the second Chechen war began in 1999 , the fight was no longer just about Chechen independence from Russia ; it was a fight for Islam , waged against Christians everywhere . 
Russia , under Yeltsin &apos;s successor , Vladimir Putin , defeated the separatists again , restoring federal control over the territory . 
Fifteen years later , Chechen extremists are fighting alongside the Islamic State . 
One might object to comparing America &apos;s desire to export democracy at the barrel of a gun to Russia &apos;s imperial death spasms under Yeltsin and Putin . 
But , whether we like it or not , there is a strong parallel between them : both countries are perceived to be dictating to Muslims . 
And , in fact , it was Kennan who first drew my attention to this similarity , when in a private conversation about 9 / 11 , he noted that , for many Muslims , Russia and the West were becoming indistinguishable . 
Both were viewed as secular states antagonistic to Islam . 
Kennan warned that , just as the first Chechen war bred national and individual resentment , America &apos;s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq would only fuel more hatred and frustration - which would eventually blow back onto the US . 
&quot; The failure to fit the system makes people attack that system , &quot; he said , &quot; so it is never wise to bomb nations to freedom . &quot;
