Populists Can be Right 
Does the rise of left-leaning governments in Latin America , particularly the election of Evo Morales as President of Bolivia , presage a shift to the hard left across the continent ? 
Does it mark a repudiation of United States foreign policy in the region ? 
Will it , for example , lead to a re-nationalization of Bolivia &apos;s vast natural gas deposits ? 
These are vital questions , but they miss the larger significance of the rise of someone like Morales , for he is Bolivia &apos;s first indigenous elected head of state . 
His victory marks a step forward in Latin America &apos;s overall democratization , with positive long-term significance for economic and social development in the region . 
To understand why , it is helpful to take a broad view of Latin America &apos;s history and economic development . 
The societies of the Americas were forged by European conquests of indigenous populations , and by the racial and ethnic divisions that followed . 
Both the US and Latin America are still coming to terms with those historic divisions . 
The Europeans who conquered and colonized the Americas after 1492 did not find vast empty lands , as they sometimes proclaimed , but rather lands populated by communities dating back thousands of years . 
A large portion of the indigenous populations quickly succumbed to diseases and hardships brought by the European colonizers , but many survived , often in dominant numbers , as in Bolivia and much of the highlands of the Andes mountain region . 
Almost everywhere , these surviving indigenous populations became subservient members of European-led societies . 
The Europeans then brought millions of African slaves to the Americas . 
After emancipation in the nineteenth century , the African-American communities remained impoverished and largely bereft of political rights . 
Thus , vast inequalities of power , social standing , and economic well-being were part and parcel of the forging of the Americas . 
Indigenous , African-American , and mestizo ( mixed ) communities have been fighting for their social , political , and economic rights ever since . 
Democracy in Latin America has been a hard-won struggle . 
Even in the US , a country that fancies itself as a model of democracy , African-Americans were not truly enfranchised until the mid-1960 &quot; s . 
In Latin America , democracy has similarly been incomplete , unstable , and often inaccessible to indigenous , African-American , and mixed populations . 
Moreover , given the vast inequalities of power and wealth in Latin America , and with a large part of the population bereft of land and education , the region has long been vulnerable to populist politics and rebellions , with leaders promising quick gains for the dispossessed by seizing property from the elites . 
The elites have fought back , often brutally , to protect their property . 
Politics has therefore often been more a violent than an electoral struggle , and property rights have often been tenuous . 
A dominant pattern in both the US and Latin America has been the resistance of the dominant white communities to sharing in the financing of public investments in the &quot; human capital &quot; ( health and education ) of the black and indigenous communities . 
While European societies have developed social welfare states with universal access to public health and education services , elites throughout the Americas have tended to favor private-sector provision of health and education , in part reflecting white populations &quot; unwillingness to pay for social services for other ethnic and racial groups . 
Morales &quot; election in Bolivia - where indigenous groups are estimated to comprise around 55 % of the population and mixed-race people account for another 30 % - should be viewed against this historical backdrop . 
Moreover , Bolivia is not alone : the shift from military rule to democratic politics in Latin America during the past 20 years is gradually , fitfully , but consistently , broadening political empowerment beyond the traditional elites and dominant ethnic groups . 
In Peru , for example , Alejandro Toledo is that country &apos;s first indigenous president . 
In the longer term , the spread of democracy in Latin America promises not only fairer societies , but also economically more dynamic societies , through increased public investments in health , education , and job skills . 
The region &apos;s chronic under-investment in education , particularly in science and technology , is partly responsible for its economic stagnation during the past quarter-century . 
Unlike East Asia and India , most of Latin America did not make a breakthrough to high-technology industries , instead suffering a period of low GDP growth , debt crises , and macroeconomic instability . 
This can now change , at least gradually . 
Bolivia would do well to follow the example of its eastern neighbor , Brazil , which has experienced a surge in educational and scientific investments since its democratization in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Rising educational attainment is helping to promote more technologically sophisticated exports as well . 
Of course , Morales &quot; election also raises many important short-term doubts and questions . 
Will the new government follow responsible economic policies , or will Bolivia flirt yet again with destabilizing populist measures , as it has done so often in the past ? 
Will Morales renegotiate the laws and contracts governing Bolivia &apos;s vast natural gas reserves , as his government is rightly committed to do , in a way that does not scare away urgently needed foreign investment ? 
Bolivia has entered a new era of mass mobilization of its long-suffering but now victorious indigenous communities . 
The short-term outlook is uncertain . 
In the longer run , however , it &apos;s right to bet on the economic benefits of democratization .
