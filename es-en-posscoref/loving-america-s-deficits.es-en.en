Loving America &apos;s Deficits 
With the weak dollar hanging like the sword of Damocles over the global economy , almost everyone laments America &apos;s spendthrift habits . 
Thanks to America &apos;s gaping trade deficits , the biggest headache of every developing country finance minister nowadays is trying to keep his or her country &apos;s currency from going up too fast against the dollar . 
When was the last time that happened ? 
Chronic debt-crisis countries from Mexico to Russia to South Korea are all fighting off capital inflows from investors looking for an exit as the dollar collapses . 
Ordinarily , as the world comes out of a downturn and global interest rates rise , at least one or two emerging market countries suffers a spectacular blowup . 
Not likely this time , at least for the next year . 
True , policy in some countries has improved markedly . 
Brazil and Turkey , for example , have each instituted market-friendly policies that have made their economies more flexible and growth more durable . 
But can the same be said for Mexico , where reform has stalled , or for Russia , where reforms have been reversed ? 
America &apos;s reckless deficit spending is making all their currencies look like good investments for 2005 . 
So non-Americans should be more appreciative of America &apos;s deficits . 
Do people think it is easy for a 12-trillion-dollar economy to spend beyond its means year after year just to prop up other countries &quot; reputations for stability ? 
It isn &apos;t . 
Going deep into debt when you have that much money to spend takes a lot of hard work . 
Start with the American consumer , who consumes everything on earth ( helping the United States eat up 25 % of world oil production ) but saves essentially nothing . 
Thanks to America &apos;s gold-plated financial system , its consumers can buy fancy cars with almost no down payment . 
They can borrow more and more each year against the value of their homes , and spend every cent . 
They can retire earlier and earlier on their smaller and smaller savings . 
It takes nerve and energy to live like that . 
Of course , the US government does its share , too , and more . 
When President George W. Bush took office in 2001 , he was staring at giant budget surpluses as far as the eye could see . 
It was hard work engineering a five-trillion-dollar deterioration in America &apos;s fiscal position . 
Cutting taxes was easy , but hiking spending on virtually every program involves a lot of legislation . 
Sure , the decision to invade Iraq was a big help in pushing the country &apos;s finances off a cliff , but that is far from the whole story . 
So why is the world so ungrateful ? 
Maybe some Europeans and Japanese are upset that they have consistently earned such poor returns on their US investments . 
Part of the problem has been the sinking dollar , which makes dollar investments look bad when translated into yen or euro . 
Part of the blame also lies with bad market timing . 
Many Europeans bought into the US stock market at its peak in 1999 and 2000 , only to find themselves selling at steep discounts after the collapse of 2001 . 
The same happened to the Japanese in real estate . 
These investment failures have been great for Americans , who owe a lot less to foreigners than they would otherwise . 
Unfortunately , this cannot go on forever . 
Foreigners are either going to start earning much better returns in the US , pushing American debt levels into unsustainable territory , or else they will pull back and invest elsewhere . 
Either way , the dollar collapse has to continue . 
So how low can the dollar sink ? 
By my calculations , the dollar still needs to go down another 15 % if the US trade deficit is to go back towards balance . 
Unfortunately , there is a real danger that we may see the opposite , with the euro going to $ 1.50 or beyond . 
Governments may try to resist the fall of the dollar , but in today &apos;s world of deep and fluid capital markets , they will not succeed indefinitely , even in Asia . 
Moreover , although US policy is making everyone else look good for now , things might not be so comfortable if the dollar collapse leads to skyrocketing interest rates and a sustained global slowdown . 
Some of the countries that look so strong today may suddenly experience the kind of financial crises that they thought they had left behind . 
Even if countries avoid the immediate blow of a dollar collapse , they still have to watch for a boomerang effect . 
Exchange rates have a nasty habit of overshooting their equilibrium values , then knifing back on countries , especially those who have been spending too much based on inflated income valuations . 
OK , so maybe it is too soon for the world to start toasting America &apos;s insane consumption patterns .
