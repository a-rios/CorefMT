Is NATO the War on Terrorism \ u0027s Greatest Victim ? 
As wars end , diplomatic and political autopsies begin . 
It is too soon to draw firm conclusions about the &quot; war on terrorism &quot; as waged in Afghanistan . 
But it is not too early to draw other preliminary conclusions . 
One concerns the almost revolutionary changes now being contemplated in NATO &apos;s relations with Russia . 
Less visible is the deep and self-inflicted wound that , I suspect , has opened within NATO itself . 
From the beginning of this crisis , on September 11 th , NATO &apos;s European members ( as well as other countries , of course ) promptly lined up with the US in moral and political solidarity , and with offers of cooperation . 
For the first time since NATO &apos;s founding , Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was invoked . 
The Washington Treaty was signed half a century ago to meet the Soviet threat at the Cold War &apos;s outset . 
Article 5 is the Treaty &apos;s keystone , because it says that an attack against one member of the alliance shall be considered an attack against them all . 
This article distinguishes NATO from virtually any other defensive alliance in human history , in the sense that it incorporated an open-ended guarantee of collective defence . 
Until September 11 th , it had never been activated . 
Here was a momentous event in NATO &apos;s 52-year history , and you might think that its activation would lead to a process of collective defence by NATO . 
Britain and a number of European NATO allies , including France , Italy and even Germany , quickly offered to provide military forces . 
But the Bush Administration did not want collective defence and it did not want NATO to get involved : apart from a small , essentially marginal military contribution by Britain , in essence the US intended to fight this war by itself . 
A number of conclusions follow . 
First , it has become clear that President George W. Bush &apos;s administration , by inclination , remains as unilateralist as it seemed when it came to power 11 months ago . 
From the beginning , its first actions were to denounce or opt out of a number of multi-lateral engagements , such as the Kyoto protocol on climate change . 
During the following months , it sometimes seemed that this attitude , of systematic disengagement from its friends overseas , might soften under the influence of Secretary of State Colin Powell . 
Events since September 11 th , however , confirmed that the unilateralist instinct of this US Administration is in fact unmodified . 
The second conclusion , following from the first , is that the attempt by the British , on this occasion once again , to secure influence and advantage by playing on the &quot; special relationship &quot; with the US , is being exposed , yet again , for the myth it is . 
Prime Minister Tony Blair has made heroic efforts to exert influence on the US , first by total military commitment to support for the US campaign in Afghanistan , second by arguing out loud that the war against terrorism can only be won if it addresses political and economic as well as military issues . 
But Mr Blair &apos;s problem is that since Britain &apos;s military contribution to the US military campaign in Afghanistan is marginal , his influence on US military strategy is also marginal . 
The more the British government proclaims its loyalty to the US , the more marginal its influence will be . 
This dilemma is being played out inside the British cabinet , where Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , has argued for an international peace-keeping force to help stabilize Afghanistan , but has been opposed by Geoff Hoon , the British defence secretary , who is totally aligned with the Pentagon &apos;s hostility to any such proposal . 
The third conclusion is that it is now extremely difficult , perhaps impossible , to imagine that Article 5 can be invoked again . 
You cannot say to your allies that this is the supreme moment when we call on the Alliance for collective defence , and then in the next breath say , we don &apos;t need you for collective defence , we &apos;re going to do it our way . 
In that sense , the centerpiece of the Atlantic Alliance has been seriously , perhaps fatally damaged . 
The fourth conclusion mirrors the third . 
European members of NATO have been deeply moved by the shock of the Twin Towers attacks , and have been falling over themselves and each other to offer help to the US . 
But the US has been patently reluctant to accept the help offered by France , Germany and Italy . 
The fact that European offers of military help have been treated with disdain has not yet back-fired . 
But the support of public opinion in European NATO will be vulnerable if the military campaign does not produce fairly quick political successes , and even more if the US moves to a wider military war against &quot; state sponsors of terrorism . &quot; 
The fifth conclusion is that this crisis may have seriously damaged efforts to create a common foreign and security policy between members of the European Union . 
Blair &apos;s first response after September 11 th was to rush to Washington ; but everything else that he has done since then , has seemed designed to prevent any collective , integrated EU response . 
His systematic promotion of meetings of the &quot; big &quot; countries in Europe , independent of EU institutions or mechanisms , culminated in the recent farce over a dinner at Downing Street ( the Prime Minister &apos;s residence ) . 
Intended as one between Europe &apos;s Big Three ( Britain , France and Germany ) , it ended up with all kinds of determined but unwelcome gate-crashers from the EU &apos;s other governments . 
Suspicions of the EU &apos;s smaller members toward the Big Three is now palpable . 
Britain , France , and Germany have often resented being forced to tag along behind the US on defence issues , the EU &apos;s smaller members now fear being forcibly co-opted into an EU foreign policy when they have had no say in its development . 
It will be a bitter irony if the war against terrorism ends by shattering trust among the members of both NATO , the most successful alliance in human history , and the EU .
