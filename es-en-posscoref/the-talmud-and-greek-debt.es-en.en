The Talmud and Greek Debt 
BUENOS AIRES - There are two ways to look at Greece &apos;s majestically unsustainable sovereign-debt mountain . 
There is , first , a pragmatic and short-term perspective , which focuses on ensuring some form of orderly restructuring ( possibly for other vulnerable European states as well ) without bringing down the eurozone . 
And there is a &quot; moral &quot; perspective , which focuses on the nature of debt and on the long-term economic consequences of failing to honor it . 
Neither perspective is wrong ; on the contrary , the problem is how to reconcile them . 
Indeed , failure to do so appears to explain why the official response to the Greek debt crisis has been so inadequate . 
In these circumstances , the Talmud , the ancient repository of Jewish legal commentary - and one of the oldest sources of human thought on morality and economic activity - might hold the key . 
An oft-quoted passage provides a fresh , if not exactly new , perspective on Greece &apos;s debt and the best way to address it . 
The passage concerns sales , divorces , and offerings , and specifies that these acts are legally valid only if a person performs them voluntarily . 
Nevertheless , under certain circumstances , courts may force an individual until he says that he is , indeed , willing . 
The verse says , literally , &quot; We ( the court ) force him until he says that he wants to do it willingly . &quot; 
So , &quot; in divorces ( if the man refuses to grant it ) , we exercise force on him until he says &quot; I want to do it voluntarily . &quot; &quot; 
Similarly , if a court forces a person to sell his property , the sale is valid because it is considered to have been carried out voluntarily . 
Understanding this apparent contradiction sheds light on the controversy surrounding the question of private bondholders &quot; involvement in the Greek rescue package . 
It is argued that , to avoid a default , private creditors should agree to shoulder part of the cost of the bailout . 
But how does one impose a financial loss on bondholders without it being classified by credit-rating agencies as a default ? 
The prevailing answer is that one coerces bondholders to accept the deal &quot; voluntarily . &quot; 
One could dismiss this dispute as being mere rhetoric . 
But , using the Talmudic logic , one can also show that there are mechanisms that can - and should - be used to place pressure on the parties in the interest of obtaining superior voluntary outcomes . 
There are two preponderant interpretations of the Talmudic passage . 
One argues that coercion can change minds . 
When a court forces an individual until he surrenders and says that he wants to follow orders , his compliant actions are to be considered voluntary , because , ultimately , he has made the conscious decision to agree . 
While technically correct , this is a ruthless interpretation , since this type of &quot; willing &quot; behavior is bound to leave resentment . 
A more benign interpretation , based on the collective-action principle , envisages the court as instrumental in attaining a superior welfare equilibrium . 
Individuals know fundamentally what is good for them and for society , but they are often hesitant to act accordingly , owing to fear , embarrassment , or , very often , the belief that their actions will not be worthwhile if others do not follow in their footsteps . 
The court , according to this view , provides the coordinating mechanism , eliminating free riders and forcing all parties to an outcome that makes everybody better off . 
Thus , individual decisions , though extracted under pressure , become , when assessing the outcome , truly voluntary . 
Seen in this light , unilateral schemes , such as the original German proposal ( forcing maturities on Greek debt to be voluntarily extended for several years ) are only voluntary under the ruthless interpretation . 
In initiatives of this sort , agreement is obtained reluctantly and pressure could provoke harsh responses . 
Rating agencies are right in considering them a &quot; selective &quot; default that is bound to result in contagion - and , eventually , in widespread debt restructuring . 
The alternative is to seek a cooperative resolution , consistent with the benign interpretation of &quot; forced willingness . &quot; 
Some of the current proposal to deal &quot; voluntarily &quot; with the Greek debt goes some way in this direction . 
But the initiative is insufficient , because the three pillars of the Vienna model are basically missing . 
The first pillar of that model is simultaneous involvement of all parties - the sovereign , bondholders and their governments , the European Central Bank , and international organizations - in designing the scheme from the start . 
The second ingredient is proper incentives to participate , including direct financing from bondholders &quot; governments , using the resources that today finance the transfer of Greek debt from private to official hands . 
The third component is the exercise of suasion on bondholders to achieve maximum participation , obtain binding pre-commitments , and eliminate free riders . 
Since this scheme would imply losses for bondholders , substantial official muscle and peer pressure is needed . 
But gaining time for a more orderly resolution , mitigating contagion , and reducing the size of an eventual write-down do indeed add up to a superior outcome . 
Therefore , under this model - and despite the initial pressure - the behavior of bondholders could be considered truly voluntary . 
And , while rating agencies might still regard a Vienna-type outcome as a default , the Talmudic sages show us why a more thoughtful classification is required .
