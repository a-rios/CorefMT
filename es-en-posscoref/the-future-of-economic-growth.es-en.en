The Future of Economic Growth 
CAMBRIDGE - Perhaps for the first time in modern history , the future of the global economy lies in the hands of poor countries . 
The United States and Europe struggle on as wounded giants , casualties of their financial excesses and political paralysis . 
They seem condemned by their heavy debt burdens to years of stagnation or slow growth , widening inequality , and possible social strife . 
Much of the rest of the world , meanwhile , is brimming with energy and hope . 
Policymakers in China , Brazil , India , and Turkey worry about too much growth , rather than too little . 
By some measures , China is already the world &apos;s largest economy , and emerging-market and developing countries account for more than half of the world &apos;s output . 
The consulting firm McKinsey has christened Africa , long synonymous with economic failure , the land of &quot; lions on the move . &quot; 
As is often the case , fiction best reflects the changing mood . 
The émigré Russian novelist Gary Shteyngart &apos;s comic novel Super Sad True Love Story is as good a guide as any to what might lie ahead . 
Set in the near future , the story unfolds against the background of a US that has slid into financial ruin and single-party dictatorship , and that finds itself embroiled in yet another pointless foreign military adventure - this time in Venezuela . 
All the real work in corporations is done by skilled immigrants ; 
Ivy League colleges have adopted the names of their Asian counterparts in order to survive ; the economy is beholden to China &apos;s central bank ; and &quot; yuan-pegged US dollars &quot; have replaced regular currency as the safe asset of choice . 
But can developing countries really carry the world economy ? 
Much of the optimism about their economic prospects is the result of extrapolation . 
The decade preceding the global financial crisis was in many ways the best ever for the developing world . 
Growth spread far beyond a few Asian countries , and , for the first time since the 1950 &quot; s , the vast majority of poor countries experienced what economists call convergence - a narrowing of the income gap with rich countries . 
This , however , was a unique period , characterized by a lot of economic tailwind . 
Commodity prices were high , benefiting African and Latin American countries in particular , and external finance was plentiful and cheap . 
And , of course , rapid growth in the advanced countries generally fueled an increase in world trade volumes to record highs . 
In principle , low post-crisis growth in the advanced countries need not impede poor countries &quot; economic performance . 
Growth ultimately depends on supply-side factors - investment in and acquisition of new technologies - and the stock of technologies that can be adopted by poor countries does not disappear when advanced countries &quot; growth is sluggish . 
So lagging countries &quot; growth potential is determined by their ability to close the gap with the technology frontier - not by how rapidly the frontier itself is advancing . 
The bad news is that we still lack an adequate understanding of when this convergence potential is realized , or of the kind of policies that generate self-sustaining growth . 
Even unambiguously successful cases have been subject to conflicting interpretations . 
Some attribute the Asian economic miracle to freer markets , while others believe that state intervention did the trick . 
And too many growth accelerations have eventually fizzled out . 
Optimists are confident that this time is different . 
They believe that the reforms of the 1990 &quot; s - improved macroeconomic policy , greater openness , and more democracy - have set the developing world on course for sustained growth . 
A recent report by Citigroup , for example , predicts that growth will be easy for poor countries with young populations . 
My reading of the evidence leaves me more cautious . 
It is certainly cause for celebration that inflationary policies have been banished and governance has improved throughout much of the developing world . 
By and large , these developments enhance an economy &apos;s resilience to shocks and prevent economic collapse . 
But igniting and sustaining rapid growth requires something more : production-oriented policies that stimulate ongoing structural change and foster employment in new economic activities . 
Growth that relies on capital inflows or commodity booms tends to be short-lived . 
Sustained growth requires devising incentives to encourage private-sector investment in new industries - and doing so with minimal corruption and adequate competence . 
If history is any guide , the range of countries that can pull this off will remain narrow . 
So , while there may be fewer economic collapses , owing to better macroeconomic management , high growth will likely remain episodic and exceptional . 
On average , performance might be somewhat better than in the past , but nowhere near as stellar as optimists expect . 
The big question for the world economy is whether advanced countries in economic distress will be able to make room for faster-growing developing countries , whose performance will largely depend on making inroads in manufacturing and service industries in which rich countries have been traditionally dominant . 
The employment consequences in the advanced countries would be problematic , especially given an existing shortage of high-paying jobs . 
Considerable social conflict could become unavoidable , threatening political support for economic openness . 
Ultimately , greater convergence in the post-crisis global economy appears inevitable . 
But a large reversal in the fortunes of rich and poor countries seems neither economically likely , nor politically feasible .
