Saddam and the Arabs 
With the end of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime , the scope of his brutalization of the Iraqi people is becoming clear . 
Mass graves are unearthed , torture chambers opened . 
Countless Iraqis now openly recount horrifying stories of the murder and disappearance of loved ones . 
In the other Arab states , the political leadership and the media have not dwelled much on these aspects of Saddam &apos;s rule . 
They have good reason for avoiding such close scrutiny . 
Many of them benefited directly from Saddam &apos;s rule . 
Examining what he did in Iraq means examining their own role in supporting more than three decades of brutality . 
The heyday of Saddams &apos;s relations with the Arab world came during the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s . 
Saddam &apos;s attack on Iran allayed the fears of Arab regimes that Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s Iran would export its Islamic revolution . 
The late Jordanian monarch King Hussein would join Saddam in inspecting the frontlines . 
The Gulf states , especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , offered Saddam massive financial and media support . 
Egypt &apos;s centers of power , such as its army , businessmen , journalists , and ideological parties , played a prominent role in supporting Saddam &apos;s war against Iran . 
Syria was the sole exception to this chorus of Arab approval for Saddam , because its late leader , President Hafez al Assad , had aligned himself with Iran . 
Saddam &apos;s brutality within Iraq also served his neighbors &apos; purposes . 
He repressed the Shiites , the traditional opponents of Sunni-dominated regimes in the region . 
He suppressed the Kurds , reassuring both Turkey and Syria , countries with sizeable - and restive - minority populations of their own . 
Indeed , by stifling any hint of democracy or political opposition in Iraq , Saddam &apos;s police state eliminated all risk of possible contagion of neighboring states . 
Outside Iraq , Saddam understood the uses of wealth and influence as a means of gaining friends . 
He put his oil reserves to good use , providing Jordan and Syria - each a failing economy - with deeply discounted supplies , assuring their goodwill . 
Saddam also focussed his attention on the media in the Arab world , understanding their power in controlling and regimenting an audience . 
Saddam spent unreservedly , buying off politicians , journalists , writers , and artists in Iraq , the Arab world , and beyond . 
Through a large and interlocking network of security and media organizations , Saddam financed scores of newspapers and magazines , lavishing on their hack writers sums of money that were unimaginable to ordinary Arab journalists . 
A political-intelligence-media network was constantly at work . 
Arab writers and artists invited to Saddam-sponsored cultural events would invariably find a pleasant surprise when opening brief cases distributed as presents - wads of dollars would be stuffed inside . 
For favored supporters , the rewards could be much greater : mansions , luxurious apartments , the latest cars . 
Dozens of Arab intellectuals engaged in this kind of business with Saddam . 
In the Arab world many of these people are literary celebrities , film idols , and media stars . 
Recently discovered documents reveal that hundreds of them received money and gifts from Saddam or his henchmen . 
At the center of this network were the cultural organizations that Saddam established in Arab and other capitals . 
Iraqi embassies acted as media centers , along with their despicable role in hunting dissidents of all political stripes . 
The sole concern of these lavishly-funded front organizations was to sell Saddam Hussein abroad and discredit his opponents . 
I experienced directly the difficulty of trying to offer an alternative view of Iraq and its cultural life . 
With a group of colleagues , I established a modest cultural group , with no external support whatsoever . 
We had a terrible time trying to publish our writings or getting coverage of the society &apos;s activities . 
I remember how much we agonized before we could print our first literary review , Al-Badeel ( The Alternative ) , early years in our forced exile more than twenty years ago , starting in Lebanon . 
In the Arab region , Saddam manipulated people &apos;s sentiments by feeding them an ever-changing diet of secular , Islamist , and nationalist slogans . 
He crowned these with his call to liberate Palestine &quot; from the river to the sea , &quot; that is , the destruction of Israel , outdoing the Palestinian leaders themselves . 
Indeed , it was Saddam who added the words &quot; God is great &quot; in his own handwriting to the Iraqi flag . 
Saddam also assigned his deputy Izzat Ibrahim to lead a so-called &quot; faith drive . &quot; 
The campaign was designed to serve several purposes , including the suppression of any free , secular thinking . 
On a wider scale , it was meant to influence and win over Arab and Muslim minds by hollow but bombastic rhetoric . 
Unfortunately , many Arabs , rulers and ruled alike , fell for it . 
With the end of Saddam &apos;s regime , Iraq faces a reckoning for decades of physical brutality and cultural intimidation . 
Iraqis will have to revisit concepts - like nationalism , sovereignty , and Islamic community - that have never come under critical examination . 
How the Arab world reacts to Iraq &apos;s reckoning , and whether other Arabs will face their own complicity in Saddam &apos;s legacy , will tell us a great deal about what sort of Arab societies the future will bring .
