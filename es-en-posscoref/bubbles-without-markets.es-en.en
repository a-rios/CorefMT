Bubbles without Markets 
NEW HAVEN - A speculative bubble is a social epidemic whose contagion is mediated by price movements . 
News of price increase enriches the early investors , creating word-of-mouth stories about their successes , which stir envy and interest . 
The excitement then lures more and more people into the market , which causes prices to increase further , attracting yet more people and fueling &quot; new era &quot; stories , and so on , in successive feedback loops as the bubble grows . 
After the bubble bursts , the same contagion fuels a precipitous collapse , as falling prices cause more and more people to exit the market , and to magnify negative stories about the economy . 
But , before we conclude that we should now , after the crisis , pursue policies to rein in the markets , we need to consider the alternative . 
In fact , speculative bubbles are just one example of social epidemics , which can be even worse in the absence of financial markets . 
In a speculative bubble , the contagion is amplified by people &apos;s reaction to price movements , but social epidemics do not need markets or prices to get public attention and spread quickly . 
Some examples of social epidemics unsupported by any speculative markets can be found in Charles MacKay &apos;s 1841 best seller Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.The book made some historical bubbles famous : the Mississippi bubble 1719-20 , the South Sea Company Bubble 1711-20 , and the tulip mania of the 1630 &quot; s . 
But the book contained other , non-market , examples as well . 
MacKay gave examples , over the centuries , of social epidemics involving belief in alchemists , prophets of Judgment Day , fortune tellers , astrologers , physicians employing magnets , witch hunters , and crusaders . 
Some of these epidemics had profound economic consequences . 
The Crusades from the eleventh to the thirteenth century , for example , brought forth what MacKay described as &quot; epidemic frenzy &quot; among would-be crusaders in Europe , accompanied by delusions that God would send armies of saints to fight alongside them . 
Between one and three million people died in the Crusades . 
There was no way , of course , for anyone either to invest in or to bet against the success of any of the activities promoted by the social epidemics - no professional opinion or outlet for analysts &quot; reports on these activities . 
So there was nothing to stop these social epidemics from attaining ridiculous proportions . 
MacKay &apos;s examples may seem a bit remote to us now . 
To be sure , events in these economies might seem attributable simply to their leaders &quot; commands . 
But social contagions took hold in these countries even more powerfully than they have in our &quot; bubble &quot; economies . 
China &apos;s Great Leap Forward in 1958-61 was a market-less investment bubble . 
The plan involved both agricultural collectivization and aggressive promotion of industry . 
There were no market prices , no published profit-and-loss statements , and no independent analyses . 
At first , there was a lot of uninformed enthusiasm for the new plan . 
Steel production was promoted by primitive backyard furnaces that industry analysts would consider laughable , but people who understood that had no influence in China then . 
Of course , there was no way to short the Great Leap Forward . 
The result was that agricultural labor and resources were rapidly diverted to industry , resulting in a famine that killed tens of millions . 
The Great Leap Forward had aspects of a Ponzi scheme , an investment fraud which attempts to draw in successive rounds of investors through word-of-mouth tales of outsize returns . 
Ponzi schemes have managed to produce great profits for their promoters , at least for a while , by encouraging a social contagion of enthusiasm . 
Mao Zedong , on visiting and talking to experts at a modern steel plant in Manchuria , is reported to have lost confidence that the backyard furnaces were a good idea after all , but feared the effects of a loss of momentum . 
He appears to have been worried , like the manager of a Ponzi scheme , that any hint of doubt could cause the whole movement to crash . 
The Great Leap Forward , and the Cultural Revolution that followed it , was a calculated effort to create a social contagion of ideas . 
Some might object that these events were not really social epidemics like speculative bubbles , because a totalitarian government ordered them , and the resulting deaths reflect government mismanagement more than investment error . 
Still , they do have aspects of bubbles : collectivization was indeed a plan for prosperity with a contagion of popular excitement , however misguided it looks in retrospect . 
The recent and ongoing world financial crisis pales in comparison with these events . 
Modern economies have free markets , along with business analysts with their recommendations , ratings agencies with their classifications of securities , and accountants with their balance sheets and income statements . 
And then , too , there are auditors , lawyers and regulators . 
All of these groups have their respective professional associations , which hold regular meetings and establish certification standards that keep the information up-to-date and the practitioners ethical in their work . 
The full development of these institutions renders really serious economic catastrophes - the kind that dwarf the 2008 crisis - virtually impossible .
