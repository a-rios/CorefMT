Crowdfunding or Crowdphishing ? 
NEW HAVEN - If one were seeking a perfect example of why it &apos;s so hard to make financial markets work well , one would not have to look further than the difficulties and controversies surrounding crowdfunding in the United States . 
After deliberating for more than three years , the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) last month issued a final rule that will allow true crowdfunding ; and yet the new regulatory framework still falls far short of what &apos;s needed to boost crowdfunding worldwide . 
True crowdfunding , or equity crowdfunding , refers to the activities of online platforms that sell shares of startup companies directly to large numbers of small investors , bypassing traditional venture capital or investment banking . 
But , unlike allowing individuals to offer their furniture to the whole world , crowdfunding is supposed to raise money fast , from those in the know , for businesses that bankers might not understand . 
It certainly sounds exciting . 
Regulators outside the US have often been more accommodating , and some crowdfunding platforms are already operating . 
For example , Symbid in the Netherlands and Crowdcube in the United Kingdom were both founded in 2011 . 
But crowdfunding is still not a major factor in world markets . 
And that will not change without adequate - and innovative - financial regulation . 
There is a conceptual barrier to understanding the problems that officials might face in regulating crowdfunding , owing to the failure of prevailing economic models to account for the manipulative and devious aspects of human behavior . 
Economists typically describe people &apos;s rational , honest side , but ignore their duplicity . 
The risks consist not so much in outright fraud - big lies that would be jailable offenses - as in more subtle forms of deception . 
It may well be open deception , with promoters steering gullible amateurs around a business plan &apos;s fatal flaw , or disclosing it only grudgingly or in the fine print . 
It is not that people are completely dishonest . 
It &apos;s just that their integrity suffers little lapses here and there - and not always so little in aggregate . 
In my new book with George Akerlof , Phishing for Phools : The Economics of Manipulation and Deception , we argue that unscrupulous behavior has to be factored into economic theory in a fundamental way . 
The economic equilibrium we live should be regarded , above all , as a phishing equilibrium , in which small-time individual dishonesty can morph into something more systemically important when it is carried on by business organizations under intense competitive pressure . 
Yes , competition rewards the sharp and hardworking . 
But it also often compels them to keep the frontiers of subtle deception in view . 
The SEC &apos;s new rules for crowdfunding are complex , because they address a complicated problem . 
The concept underlying crowdfunding is the dispersal of information across millions of people . 
Most people , even the cleverest , cannot grasp the next breakthrough business opportunity . 
The economist Friedrich Hayek put it well in 1945 : 
&quot; &#91; T &#93; here is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules : the knowledge of particular circumstances and place . 
It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made , but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation . &quot; 
The problem is that the promise of genuine &quot; unique information &quot; comes with the reality of vulnerability to deception . 
That &apos;s why channeling dispersed knowledge into new businesses requires a regulatory framework that favors the genuinely enlightened and honest . 
Unfortunately , the SEC &apos;s new crowdsourcing rules don &apos;t go as far as they should . 
The 2012 US legislation that tasked the SEC with rulemaking for crowdfunding platforms specified that no startup can use them to raise more than $ 1 million a year . 
This is practically worthless in terms of limiting the scope for deception . 
In fact , including this provision was a serious mistake , and needs to be corrected with new legislation . 
A million dollars is not enough , and the cap will tend to limit crowdfunding to small ideas . 
Some of the SEC rules do work against deception . 
Notably , crowdfunding platforms must provide communication channels &quot; through which investors can communicate with one another and with representatives of the issuer about offerings made available . &quot; 
That is a good rule , fundamental to the entire idea of crowdfunding . 
But the SEC could do more than just avow its belief in &quot; uncensored and transparent crowd discussions . &quot; 
It should require that the intermediary sponsoring a platform install a surveillance system to guard against interference and shills offering phony comments . 
The SEC and other regulators could go even further . 
Indeed , why not pay commenters who accumulate &quot; likes &quot; or whose comments on issuers turn out to be valuable in light of evidence of those enterprises &quot; subsequent success ? 
For the financial system as a whole , success ultimately depends on trust and confidence , both of which , like suspicion and fear , are highly contagious . 
That &apos;s why , if crowdfunding is to reach its global potential , crowdphishing must be prevented from the outset . 
Regulators need to get the rules right ( and it would help if they hurried up about it ) .
