A Leader is Born in Venezuela 
CARACAS - The election that just gave Hugo Chávez his fourth term as president was about more than who would lead Venezuela . 
The former is inspired by the example of Fidel Castro &apos;s Cuba , the latter by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and her predecessor , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva . 
Chávez &apos;s latest triumph appears to consolidate the authoritarian and populist model of government that he has brought to Venezuela . 
Even though he won decisively , gaining 54.4 % of the popular vote , his margin of victory over his challenger , Henrique Capriles , was much less than in 2006 , when Chávez took 63 % of the vote . 
After that election , perhaps heady with the magnitude of his support , he proposed deepening his revolution with new laws on the organization of society and the economy . 
These laws , already approved but not fully implemented , should be the catalyst for a new institutional arrangement within the country , one supposedly premised on a direct relationship between leader and people and a progressive hollowing out of democratic institutions . 
Meanwhile , all bodies of public power - all of them - now obey Chávez . 
Given this history , it is noteworthy that , in his speech the day after his victory , Chávez called for coexistence , dialogue , debate , and for everyone to work together for the good of Venezuela . 
But he congratulated the opposition for having accepted the results , and he committed himself to being a better president than he had been previously and to insisting on greater efficiency from his officials . 
But Chávez has made similar offers of cooperation before , so Venezuelans will have to wait and see what more their president has to say about his future mode of governance once the euphoria of victory has passed . 
The election followed a memorable campaign . 
Capriles , a young politician who was first a mayor and then a governor of a state , was elected in open primaries in which more than three million Venezuelans participated . 
In contrast to Chávez , whose movements were limited by his health ( he has cancer ) , Capriles visited more than 300 towns in three months , campaigning in the streets and before large crowds in the 24 state capitals . 
The large crowds that turned out at Capriles &apos;s gatherings are proof of the enthusiasm that he inspired and , above all , of the opposition &apos;s renewed hope that Chávez could be defeated . 
Capriles fell short of that objective , but he has emerged as the opposition &apos;s unquestioned leader . 
The 44.4 % of the popular vote that went to Capriles represents Venezuelan society &apos;s capacity for resistance against Chávez &apos;s authoritarian project , and its abuses with respect to universities , the media , and workers . 
Nearly half of the country has expressed its rejection of the model that is being thrust on it . 
Conserving a democratic system , although damaged , has been possible thanks to the efforts of Venezuelan civil society , which helped the opposition receive two million votes . 
The Mesa de la Unidad Democrática , which comprises the majority of Venezuelan parties , must now unite the opposition , organize and participate actively in the gubernatorial and mayoral elections to be held in December , and act as the political vanguard in defense of democracy and the rule of law . 
In Capriles , opposition forces now have a national leader , which they lacked when challenging Chávez in the past . 
Both inside the country and abroad , many are interested in the impact that Chávez &apos;s new mandate might have on Venezuela &apos;s foreign policy - an area in which he has been particularly active . 
The close alliances with Cuba and the populist governments of Bolivia , Ecuador , and Nicaragua , have been strengthened : all of them - as well as Argentina &apos;s President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner - stand to benefit to different degrees from Chávez &apos;s victory , but not as much as they would have been harmed had the president been defeated . 
Venezuela will continue to participate in all of the regional organizations , pursuing its goal of regional integration to the exclusion of the United States and Canada . 
As a result , relations with the US will probably remain tense , although Chávez recently stated that he would like to improve ties if Obama is re-elected - a surprising turn of events , given that he has expelled one US ambassador and rejected another . 
Having been able to reestablish relations with Colombia under its new president , Juan Manuel Santos , Chávez could well try to do the same with the US . 
But , even if that really is his aim , there is no guarantee that the US will reciprocate .
