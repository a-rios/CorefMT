How Should China Respond to the Slowdown ? 
BEIJING - China &apos;s annual GDP growth slowed to 7.6 % in the second quarter of 2012 , down from 8.1 % in the first quarter and the lowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2009 . 
The newly released growth data may have dispelled fears of a hard landing for China , but have nonetheless prompted many to argue that China must stimulate its economy further to guarantee 8 % annual growth . 
Since early 2010 , in order to contain inflation and property bubbles , the Chinese government has tightened monetary policy . 
As a result , inflation fell in June to 2.2 % , a 29-month low , and house prices , for which the National Bureau of Statistics unfortunately has stopped issuing official data , seem to be stabilizing , and may even have fallen , albeit modestly . 
The slowdown in China &apos;s growth rate is , to a certain extent , a reflection of the success of the government &apos;s effort to rein in the real-estate bubble , as well as of other official policies aimed at rebalancing the economy . 
The growth rate of investment in real-estate development , which directly accounts for more than 10 % of GDP , plummeted by 16.3 percentage points year on year in the first half of 2012 . 
The trend for household consumption is less clear . 
The slowdown of the economy in 2012 should have been anticipated in 2011 by the government . 
In early 2012 , in his speech to the annual People &apos;s Congress , Premier Wen Jiabao , explaining why the government &apos;s indicative target for economic growth in 2012 was 7.5 % , pointed out that the purpose was &quot; to guide people in all sectors to focus their work on accelerating the transformation of the pattern of economic development and making economic development more sustainable and efficient . &quot; 
In fact , in order to create adequate space for changing the GDP-centered growth pattern , China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan set an indicative target of 7 % annual average GDP growth in 2010-2015 . 
China &apos;s investment rate is about 50 % of GDP , while real-estate investment accounts for more than 10 % of GDP . 
Given the prevalence of repetitive constructions and ubiquitous waste , investment efficiency is deteriorating quickly . 
With an annual growth rate of 10 % , an investment rate of 50 % implies a capital-output ratio of five , which is unusually high relative to other countries . 
China &apos;s consumption rate is 36 % . 
If government statistics are not entirely unreliable , this rate is simply too low . 
While huge amounts of money have been poured into physical infrastructure , public expenditure on human capital and social security is below the world average . 
More resources should be reallocated from physical capital formation to human capital formation . 
Thanks to persistent current-account and capital-account surpluses for two decades , China has accumulated $ 3.2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves . 
Since 2008 , China &apos;s current-account surplus as a proportion of GDP has fallen significantly . 
Indeed , China needs to accelerate its economic adjustment , even at the expense of growth . 
Otherwise , it will have to pay an even higher adjustment cost later . 
For many years , the government has maintained an implicit minimum growth target of 8 % per year , which was considered necessary to create ten million new jobs annually . 
The question now is whether the government will be unnerved by the poorest quarterly growth performance in three years and usher in a large stimulus package , with the consequences that China has experienced whenever such a package is implemented . 
Wen said recently that China &quot; should continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy , while giving more priority to maintaining growth . &quot; 
Moreover , in recent months , the government has approved some large steel and energy projects , and more such approvals may come . 
It is certainly appropriate for a government to respond to changing circumstances in a timely fashion . 
China must choose between higher growth and faster structural adjustment . 
It cannot have both at the same time . 
Faced with the current slowdown , China can afford to stay the course , at least for the time being .
