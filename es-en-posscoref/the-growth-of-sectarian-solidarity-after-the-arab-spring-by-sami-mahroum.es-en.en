Democracy in Arabia ? 
PARIS - In Democracy in America , Alexis de Tocqueville argued that the public &apos;s trust alleviates pressure on the state , allowing it to function more effectively . 
This should give some comfort to governments in the Arab world , where a 2012 survey of young people showed 72 % of the respondents expressing greater trust in their governments . 
But what , then , accounts for the continuing civil turmoil and government paralysis in the Arab-Spring countries ? 
A more recent version of the survey provides some clues . 
A large majority of Arab youths , around 70 % , say that they are most influenced by parents , family , and religion , whereas only about a third report that elite groups - writers , business leaders , community leaders , and media outlets - have any influence on their outlook on life . 
Indeed , just 16 % reported that pop stars influenced their outlook . 
These figures provide some useful insights into the evolving social fabric of Arab societies . 
Normally , people are open to influence from those whom they trust and wish to emulate . 
The fact that a large majority of Arabs turns to family and religion is highly revealing . 
Arab societies , particularly those in turmoil , are regressing to what another French social theorist , Ã‰mile Durkheim , called &quot; mechanistic solidarity . &quot; 
Durkheim contrasts this phenomenon with the more progressive &quot; organic solidarity &quot; that evolves in modern societies according to people &apos;s professional and functional relationships . 
In times of elevated risk , real or perceived , people begin to organize increasingly on the basis of homogenous identities . 
As a result , &quot; mechanistic solidarity &quot; grows stronger at the expense of &quot; organic solidarity . &quot; 
The trend is often accelerated by the loss of jobs , which often leads people to abandon their professional and functional identities in favor of identities based on ethnicity , kinship , or religion . 
In culturally diverse societies , such as Iraq and Lebanon , networks of social solidarity are based almost entirely on religious and ethnic affinity . 
In more homogenous societies , such as Libya , social solidarity tends to follow tribal and partisan lines . 
In Tunisia , too , there has been a similar regression to mechanistic types of solidarity organized around tribal , regional , and religious identities . 
A dramatic manifestation of the mechanistic pattern of solidarity is now emerging in Syria , as well . 
While Syrians have been facing death , violence , and displacement for more than two years , the international community has been busy debating the nature of the Syrian rebels . 
Left to its fate , Syrian society began to disintegrate and reorganize on a sectarian basis . 
As the conflict intensified , established profession-based identities began to disappear , giving way to family , regional , and religious solidarities . 
Civil-society and professional groups have been unable to respond in a way that maintains organic social cohesion , owing to a lack of resources , weak capacity , or both . 
Mechanistic solidarity has emerged as a more effective means to mobilize people and resources . 
At the heart of the crisis is a strong element of indifference . 
For example , the role of the Arab middle class has been notably muted in efforts to support Syrian refugees . 
The American actress Angelina Jolie &apos;s highly publicized visits to Syrian refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey underscored the near-absence of similar awareness campaigns by Arab celebrities . 
Indeed , while millions of Arabs tune in weekly to watch and vote for their favorite singers on the Arabic version of The Voice and Arab Idol , a fund-raising campaign for the benefit of Syrian refugees has yet to be organized . 
By contrast , TV channels with specific religious and sectarian affiliations have been very active , including on social media , in fundraising efforts . 
It is perhaps not surprising , then , that most Arab youth do not see role models beyond their close social circles . 
In short , Arab countries are hemorrhaging social capital , which can significantly derail economic recovery and state-building . 
As the Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow argued in 1972 , &quot; much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence . &quot; 
Against this background , the recently announced Arab Stabilization Plan , an Arab-led private-sector initiative aimed at creating tens of thousands of jobs through large-scale infrastructure investment , is exactly the type of action needed to preserve social cohesion . 
International efforts , led by the World Bank and other international donors , have tended to focus on strengthening relations between the state and its citizens in order to achieve &quot; Tocquevillian &quot; gains - that is , operational democracy and effective government . 
But what is urgently needed is a strong complementary focus on job creation to preserve and foster Durkheim &apos;s organic solidarity .
