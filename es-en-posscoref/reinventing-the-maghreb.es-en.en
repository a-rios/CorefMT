Reinventing the Maghreb 
At a time when the European Union and the United States are anxious to promote political and economic reform in the Arab world , they should not overlook the Maghreb . 
The EU cannot ignore the political , social , and security challenges that confront this huge swathe of northern Africa , and the US cannot afford to neglect this region in its global fight against terrorism . 
New and bold - yet pragmatic - initiatives are therefore needed that combine the efforts of local actors and external actors . 
The overall situation in the region is far from satisfactory . 
Algeria &apos;s economy is massively dependent on oil and gas exports , Morocco &apos;s is largely based on agricultural production ( on which the weather has a huge impact ) and remittances from expatriates , while Tunisia depends on European consumer demand and tourism . 
Education and labor policies in all Maghreb countries are under constant pressure from increasingly youthful populations . 
In addition , the controversy over who should rule Western Sahara remains an obstacle to full normalisation of Algerian-Moroccan relations . 
The EU is the region &apos;s most important partner , accounting for over two-thirds of its external trade . 
Intense bilateral exchanges between states north and south of the Western Mediterranean have accompanied the &quot; Barcelona process , &quot; which created a comprehensive dialogue between the Union and its Mediterranean neighbors , including association agreements . 
Finally , a political forum for debate called the 5 + 5 Group periodically brings together representatives from Algeria , France , Italy , Libya , Malta , Mauritania , Morocco , Portugal , Spain , and Tunisia . 
For its part , the US has sponsored a number of specific actions to promote democracy and good governance in the region . 
Yet , despite these international initiatives and efforts by Maghreb governments , the situation is fragile ; stability and security cannot be taken for granted . 
The UN Human Development Report , for instance , consistently puts the Maghreb countries below the global average . 
One key explanation for the Maghreb &apos;s malaise is its lack of integration . 
In Europe and elsewhere , regional integration is gradually changing the political environment , increasing self-confidence in societies and bringing international trust . 
Indeed , some of the conditions necessary to launch a regional integration process are present in the Maghreb , but a new approach is needed . 
The only way to jump-start integration is by creating a new regional body . 
The Arab Maghreb Union could be revived . 
The European neighborhood policy recently reinforced the bilateral dimension of the Barcelona process . 
But while the EU is emphasizing its bilateral relations with Maghreb countries , not enough attention - or funding - is being given to the sub-regional dimension . 
To establish a new institutional dynamic in the Maghreb , three elements are needed : active engagement of the Maghreb states , who should be the initiative &apos;s protagonists ; determined EU support , which could be obtained only with the mediation of the Union &apos;s Mediterranean members ; and political backing from the US . 
Creation of a new institution , a &quot; Maghreb Common Market , &quot; would be in everyone &apos;s interest . 
The Algerian , Moroccan , and Tunisian governments would show their engagement with their peoples &quot; future , and Europeans would demonstrate that they are ready to implement the principles they proclaim . 
It seems obvious that the US would be supportive of such an initiative , as it is in line with its global policy of promoting liberty , good governance , and free trade . 
Resolution of political disputes - both internal and international - in the Maghreb can be dealt with either directly , through thorny negotiations , or indirectly , starting with cooperation on issues , however modest , that could attract consensus . 
In Europe after World War II , the &quot; small steps &quot; policy , also called the &quot; Monnet method , &quot; enabled former enemies to put the past behind them and unite . 
Adapting this method to their needs , the Maghreb countries should open internal frontiers , facilitate exchanges , and embark on ambitious public works and infrastructure projects ( such as highways , communications , and dams ) , all of which could ensure real progress via small steps . 
Finally , new regional arrangements , as well as specific projects , will require diversified funding sources . 
Neither the fiscal budgets in the Maghreb nor existing levels of debt currently allows the necessary public investments to be made . 
Although EU assistance from the Barcelona process is significant , it does not have a decisive impact on Maghreb economies . 
Therefore , an ad hoc funding mechanism must be defined , in the form , say , of a donor conference . 
In such a mechanism , Europeans should allocate funds not only from within the Barcelona process and the European Investment Bank , but also from the states most concerned - France , Italy , and Spain . 
In addition , international contributions from the World Bank could be supplemented with those from the US , which is keen to stabilize the region , and other donor countries , such as Canada , Japan , Norway , Switzerland , and some Arab countries . 
Boosting regional integration in the Maghreb promises much and would cost relatively little . 
But outside help is essential .
