The Best Investments 
KOLKATA - On the eastern edge of Kolkata , Dulu Bibi , a 25-year-old mother of four , worries about the cost of treating her two sick boys . 
Her husband earns 80-90 rupees ( $ 1.90 or â‚¬ 1.40 ) a day . 
The family &apos;s basic diet is low in the essential micronutrients that children need to thrive . 
Dulu &apos;s two sons , aged three and one , are weak and feverish , lack appetite , and cry a lot . 
&quot; If I have to spend 150-200 rupees on medicine , &quot; she asks , &quot; what will I eat and feed my children with ? &quot; 
Dulu &apos;s story is heartbreaking - and heartbreakingly common - in the developing world : three billion people survive on diets that lack micronutrients like vitamin A and Zinc , and are at increased risk of illness from common infections like diarrheal disease , which kills nearly two million children annually . 
Micronutrient deficiency is known as &quot; hidden hunger . &quot; 
This is a fitting description , because it is one of the global challenges that we hear relatively little about in the developed world . 
It draws scant media attention or celebrity firepower , which are often crucial to attracting charitable donations to a cause . 
But there is a larger point here : billions of dollars are given and spent on aid and development by individuals and companies each year . 
Despite this generosity , we simply do not allocate enough resources to solve all of the world &apos;s biggest problems . 
In a world fraught with competing claims on human solidarity , we have a moral obligation to direct additional resources to where they can achieve the most good . 
And that is as true of our own small-scale charitable donations as it is of governments &quot; or philanthropists &quot; aid budgets . 
In 2008 , the Copenhagen Consensus Center , which I direct , asked a group of the world &apos;s top economists to identify the &quot; investments &quot; that could best help the planet . 
The experts - including five Nobel Laureates - compared ways to spend $ 75 billion on more than 30 interventions aimed at reducing malnutrition , broadening educational opportunity , slowing global warming , cutting air pollution , preventing conflict , fighting disease , improving access to water and sanitation , lowering trade and immigration barriers , thwarting terrorism , and promoting gender equality . 
Guided by their consideration of each option &apos;s costs and benefits , and setting aside matters like media attention , the experts identified the best investments - those for which relatively tiny amounts of money could generate significant returns in terms of health , prosperity , and community advantages . 
These included increased immunization coverage , initiatives to reduce school dropout rates , community-based nutrition promotion , and micronutrient supplementation . 
This last initiative , which could do so much to help Dulu Bibi &apos;s family in Kolkata , is extraordinarily cheap . 
Providing Vitamin A for a year costs as little as $ 1.20 per child , while providing Zinc costs as little as $ 1.00 . 
By highlighting the areas in which even small investments can accomplish a great deal , the project influenced philanthropic organizations and governments . 
This month , the Copenhagen Consensus Center releases the Guide to Giving ( www.copenhagenconsensus.com ) so that those of us without a government treasury or charitable foundation at our disposal can also consider how to use the experts &quot; lessons . 
Some reject the need to set priorities . 
But it happens whether we like it or not . 
A few causes and issues get the most airtime , attention , and money . 
The Copenhagen Consensus provides a framework on which we can build informed decisions , based on what can be achieved with similar &quot; investments &quot; in different areas . 
Should we contribute to organizations that focus on saving lives today , immediately making the world a better place ( with spin-offs lasting longer ) , or fund education to benefit future generations ? 
Often we hear catchphrases like &quot; without an education there is no future &quot; or &quot; without water one cannot survive , &quot; as if it is obvious that we should focus first on one or the other . 
But many people go without proper education and access to clean drinking water . 
The difficult task that the expert panel undertook was to look at the extra good that an additional donation - even as little as $ 10 - could achieve with respect to many good causes . 
The contrast between saving lives today and aiming at tomorrow becomes clear when efforts to tackle global warming are included in the comparison . 
How could $ 10 best be spent ? 
Should we , say , buy carbon offsets , or donate to a charity providing micronutrient supplements ? 
By putting all benefits to individuals , communities , and countries in monetary terms , we can compare the two options . 
Expert researchers for the Copenhagen Consensus found that carbon offsets are a relatively ineffective way of reining in global warming and reducing its effects - $ 10 would avoid about $ 3 of damage from climate change . 
By contrast , $ 10 spent on Vitamin A supplements would achieve more than $ 170 of benefits in health and long-term prosperity . 
One lesson we can draw is that while global warming may exacerbate problems like malnutrition , communities bolstered by adequate nutrition will generally be less vulnerable to climate-based threats . 
Overall , we can typically best help through direct interventions , including micronutrient supplements , fortification , biofortification , and nutritional promotion . 
There are billions of stories like Dulu Bibi &apos;s and billions of other stories that demand our attention . 
By embracing simple lessons from economics , all of us - individuals , governments , and philanthropies - can ensure that our generosity yields the greatest benefit possible .
