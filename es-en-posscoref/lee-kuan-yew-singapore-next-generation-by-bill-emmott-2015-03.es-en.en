What Comes After Lee Kuan Yew ? 
LONDON - All political leaders worry about their legacies . 
Lee Kuan Yew , who presided over Singapore either directly or indirectly for more than a half-century - remaining influential right up to his death at 91 - had more time in power than most to do so . 
Several volumes of memoirs attest to Lee &apos;s concern about his legacy , although Singapore &apos;s extraordinary success under his leadership speaks for itself . 
Like him or not - and many did not - there is no denying the city-state &apos;s remarkable and enduring prosperity and stability . 
Yet the effort put into those memoirs by the man who called himself &quot; Minister Mentor &quot; during his later years offers a clue about Lee &apos;s ultimate concern . 
His legacy in terms of Singapore &apos;s past success may be clear , but what about the future ? 
That , of course , is one of the few things he could not control , beyond offering his teachings to future generations . 
Yet in one crucial respect - determining who Singapore &apos;s new generation of leaders will be - the tight control that Lee exercised in the past may now make that future more difficult . 
The issue is certainly solvable , especially given an excellent education system and high-quality institutions of all kinds . 
But Lee &apos;s own actions suggest that he harbored doubts . 
The succession to Lee was clear : after handing over the premiership in 1990 ( at the surprisingly young age of 66 ) to a trusted associate , Goh Chok Tong , he groomed his eldest son , Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong , for the job . 
After serving as Singapore &apos;s trade minister , finance minister , and deputy prime minister , Lee Hsien Loong took over the top post in 2004 . 
What is unresolved is where power goes next , and how . 
Perhaps the answer will simply be that the ruling People &apos;s Action Party will choose a successor in the conventional way . 
Certainly , Singapore &apos;s cadre of talented and experienced officials and ministers is deep . 
Still , the question is an open one , owing to Lee Kuan Yew &apos;s somewhat paradoxical sensitivity to the prominence of his family members in some of the country &apos;s most senior posts . 
Lee fought many battles with the international media over their coverage of Singapore , especially from the mid-1980s onward , by which point the country &apos;s success had become abundantly clear . 
As a Cambridge-trained lawyer , he was especially keen on using the law to browbeat his media ( and political ) critics , knowing full well that he had no serious chance of losing in Singapore &apos;s own courts . 
During my time as the editor-in-chief of The Economist ( 1993-2006 ) , I received such browbeatings on many occasions . 
What eventually became clear was that under no circumstances could Lee Kuan Yew countenance one particular word or concept : nepotism . 
After all , he had set up Singapore as an intensely meritocratic society , in which competition , under clear and accepted rules , was king . 
So when his own son became Prime Minister , and his daughter-in-law , Ho Ching , took the helm at Temasek , one of the state &apos;s huge investment companies , any insinuation that they had done so on anything other than their own merit was unacceptable . 
Lee established a high-minded committee to establish that nepotism was not the reason , and then set about suing anyone who dared to suggest otherwise . 
Yet this abhorrence of nepotism was illogical - and Lee was generally nothing if not logical , even ruthlessly so - because in this case a perfectly good justification for it followed smoothly from his own analysis of Singapore . 
A tiny , multi-racial society ejected from Malaysia in 1965 , Singapore was born in an atmosphere of vulnerability , lack of legitimacy and trust , and ethnic conflict . 
Up through the 1980s and 1990s , Lee often justified the continuation of authoritarian policies by reference to those communal riots , and to the ever-present possibility of a loss of social trust and a return to conflict . 
So , in passing the baton to his eldest son , he could be said to have dealt with that risk in the most logical way possible . 
If you trusted the founder of Singapore and thought him legitimate , who better to trust than the founder &apos;s own son ? 
Indeed , the father would remain on the scene , first as &quot; Senior Minister &quot; and then in his mentor role , and had made his son prove his abilities openly in a series of prominent positions . 
It worked , and Lee Hsien Loong has by all accounts done a good job as Prime Minister , whatever the explanation for his rise . 
There is no current risk to Singapore &apos;s political stability , and the younger Lee is only 63 years old ; he could remain in office for a long time to come . 
The question , though , remains : What happens next ? 
Lee Kuan Yew dealt with the question of succession by deferring it . 
His son will need to provide the answer .
