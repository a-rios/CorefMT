Ebola and Inequality 
NEW YORK - The Ebola crisis reminds us , once again , of the downside of globalization . 
Not only good things - like principles of social justice and gender equality - cross borders more easily than ever before ; so do malign influences like environmental problems and disease . 
The crisis also reminds us of the importance of government and civil society . 
We do not turn to the private sector to control the spread of a disease like Ebola . 
Rather , we turn to institutions - the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in the United States , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , and Médecins Sans Frontières , the remarkable group of doctors and nurses who risk their lives to save those of others in poor countries around the world . 
Even right-wing fanatics who want to dismantle government institutions turn to them when facing a crisis like that caused by Ebola . 
Governments may not do a perfect job in addressing such crises , but one of the reasons that they have not done as well as we would hope is that we have underfunded the relevant agencies at the national and global level . 
The Ebola episode holds further lessons . 
One reason that the disease spread so rapidly in Liberia and Sierra Leone is that both are war-ravaged countries , where a large proportion of the population is malnourished and the health-care system has been devastated . 
Moreover , where the private sector does play an essential role - vaccine development - it has little incentive to devote resources to diseases that afflict the poor or poor countries . 
It is only when advanced countries are threatened that there is sufficient impetus to invest in vaccines to confront diseases like Ebola . 
This is not so much a criticism of the private sector ; after all , drug companies are not in business out of the goodness of their hearts , and there is no money in preventing or curing the diseases of the poor . 
Rather , what the Ebola crisis calls into question is our reliance on the private sector to do the things that governments perform best . 
Indeed , it appears that with more public funding , an Ebola vaccine could have been developed years ago . 
America &apos;s failures in this regard have drawn particular attention - so much so that some African countries are treating visitors from the US with special precautions . 
But this just echoes a more fundamental problem : America &apos;s largely private health-care system is failing . 
True , at the top end , the US has some of the world &apos;s leading hospitals , research universities , and advanced medical centers . 
But , though the US spends more per capita and as a percentage of its GDP on medical care than any other country , its health outcomes are truly disappointing . 
American male life expectancy at birth is the worst of 17 high-income countries - almost four years shorter than in Switzerland , Australia , and Japan . 
And it is the second worst for women , more than five years below life expectancy in Japan . 
Other health metrics are equally disappointing , with data indicating poorer health outcomes for Americans throughout their lives . 
And , for at least three decades , matters have been getting worse . 
Many factors contribute to America &apos;s health lag , with lessons that are relevant for other countries as well . 
For starters , access to medicine matters . 
With the US among the few advanced countries that does not recognize access as a basic human right , and more reliant than others on the private sector , it is no surprise that many Americans do not get the medicines they need . 
Though the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) has improved matters , health-insurance coverage remains weak , with almost half of the 50 US states refusing to expand Medicaid , the health-care financing program for America &apos;s poor . 
Moreover , the US has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty among the advanced countries ( which was especially true before austerity policies dramatically increased poverty in several European countries ) , and lack of nutrition and health care in childhood has lifelong effects . 
Meanwhile , America &apos;s gun laws contribute to the highest incidence of violent deaths among advanced countries , and its dependence on the automobile underpins a high rate of highway fatalities . 
America &apos;s outsize inequality , too , is a critical factor in its health lag , especially combined with the factors mentioned above . 
With more poverty , more childhood poverty , more people without access to health care , decent housing , and education , and more people facing food insecurity ( often consuming cheap foods that contribute to obesity ) , it is no surprise that US health outcomes are bad . 
But health outcomes are also worse in the US than elsewhere for those with higher incomes and insurance coverage . 
Perhaps this , too , is related to higher inequality than in other advanced countries . 
Health , we know , is related to stress . 
Those striving to climb the ladder of success know the consequences of failure . 
In the US , the rungs of the ladder are farther apart than elsewhere , and the distance from the top to the bottom is greater . 
That means more anxiety , which translates into poorer health . 
Good health is a blessing . 
But how countries structure their health-care system - and their society - makes a huge difference in terms of outcomes . 
America and the world pay a high price for excessive reliance on market forces and an insufficient attention to broader values , including equality and social justice .
