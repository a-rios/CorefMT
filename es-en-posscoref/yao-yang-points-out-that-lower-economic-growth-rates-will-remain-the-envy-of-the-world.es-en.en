In Praise of China &apos;s New Normal 
BEIJING - China &apos;s economy is , at long last , undergoing a rebalancing , with growth rates having declined from more than 10 % before 2008 to roughly 7.5 % today . 
Is this China &apos;s &quot; new normal , &quot; or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade ? 
China &apos;s rebalancing is apparent , first and foremost , in the export sector . 
Export growth has slowed from its 2001-2008 average of 29 % annually to below 10 % , making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth . 
Moreover , manufacturing employment and output , as a share of the total , began to decline last year . 
In fact , in the first half of this year , services accounted for more than half of total economic growth . 
It is no surprise , then , that China &apos;s current-account surplus has shrunk rapidly , from its 2007 peak of more than 10 % of GDP to about 2 % of GDP today . 
This rebalancing has helped to improve China &apos;s income distribution . 
Indeed , in recent years , labor &apos;s share of national income has been on the rise - a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services . 
That has meant greater regional balance as well : The coastal provinces , which produce more than 85 % of the country &apos;s exports , are experiencing the most pronounced slowdown , while inland provinces have maintained relatively high growth rates . 
As a result , China &apos;s Gini coefficient ( a 100-point index of inequality , in which zero signifies absolute equality and one absolute inequality ) fell to 0.50 in 2012 , from 0.52 in 2010 . 
Two principal factors are driving this shift . 
The first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated . 
The second is China &apos;s ongoing demographic transformation . 
The share of working-age people ( 16-65 years old ) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72 % . 
And the absolute number of working-age people has been falling since 2012 . 
At the same time , China is undergoing rapid urbanization , with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001-2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs . 
More recently , however , the pace of migration has slowed substantially , with rural areas retaining 35 % of China &apos;s total labor force . 
All of this implies lower growth rates for China - though perhaps not as low as the 6-7 % rates that economists like Liu Shijing and Cai Fang are predicting for the next decade . 
In fact , relying on China &apos;s past growth record to predict future performance is inherently problematic , owing not only to important shifts in the labor force , but also to the fact that the speed and scale of China &apos;s pre-2008 growth was unprecedented . 
For starters , it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working-age people prior to 2010 was overestimated . 
That makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance . 
Moreover , this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years , as the younger generation replaces older workers . 
As it stands , the rate of return-adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50-60 is half that of those aged 20-25 . 
In other words , young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement . 
Indeed , the level of educational attainment in China continues to improve . 
By 2020 , the share of those aged 18-22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40 % , compared to 32 % today . 
This improvement in human capital is bound to offset , to some extent , the net loss of labor . 
Furthermore , China &apos;s low retirement age - 50 for women and 60 for men - provides policymakers with considerable room to maneuver . 
Increasing the retirement age by just a half-year for each of the next ten years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labor force , which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period . 
Other trends are boosting China &apos;s prospects further . 
Though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP , it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40 % - still robust by international standards . 
Meanwhile , the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate . 
Finally , China &apos;s capacity for innovation is improving steadily , owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development . 
By next year , Chinese R D expenditure , at 2.2 % of GDP , will be closing in on advanced-country levels . 
Based on these trends - and assuming a constant labor-participation rate - China &apos;s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6 % , averaging 7.27 % . 
This may be much lower than the 9.4 % average growth rate in 1988-2013 , but it is more than adequate by global standards . 
If this is China &apos;s &quot; new normal , &quot; it would still be the envy of the rest of the world .
