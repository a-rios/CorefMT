A Roosevelt Moment for America &apos;s Megabanks ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - Just over a hundred years ago , the United States led the world in terms of rethinking how big business worked - and when the power of such firms should be constrained . 
In retrospect , the breakthrough legislation - not just for the US , but also internationally - was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 . 
The Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill , which is about to pass the US Senate , does something similar - and long overdue - for banking . 
Prior to 1890 , big business was widely regarded as more efficient and generally more modern than small business . 
Most people saw the consolidation of smaller firms into fewer , large firms as a stabilizing development that rewarded success and allowed for further productive investment . 
The creation of America as a major economic power , after all , was made possible by giant steel mills , integrated railway systems , and the mobilization of enormous energy reserves through such ventures as Standard Oil . 
But ever-bigger business also had a profound social impact , and here the ledger entries were not all in the positive column . 
The people who ran big business were often unscrupulous , and in some cases used their dominant market position to drive out their competitors - enabling the surviving firms subsequently to restrict supply and raise prices . 
There was dominance , to be sure , in the local and regional markets of mid-nineteenth-century America , but nothing like what developed in the 50 years that followed . 
Big business brought major productivity improvements , but it also increased the power of private companies to act in ways that were injurious to the broader marketplace - and to society . 
The Sherman Act itself did not change this situation overnight , but , once President Theodore Roosevelt decided to take up the cause , it became a powerful tool that could be used to break up industrial and transportation monopolies . 
By doing so , Roosevelt and those who followed in his footsteps shifted the consensus . 
Roosevelt &apos;s first case , against Northern Securities in 1902 , was immensely controversial . 
Why are these antitrust tools not used against today &apos;s megabanks , which have become so powerful that they can sway legislation and regulation massively in their favor , while also receiving generous taxpayer-financed bailouts as needed ? 
The answer is that the kind of power that big banks wield today is very different from what was imagined by the Sherman Act &apos;s drafters - or by the people who shaped its application in the early years of the twentieth century . 
The banks do not have monopoly pricing power in the traditional sense , and their market share - at the national level - is lower than what would trigger an antitrust investigation in the non-financial sectors . 
Effective size caps on banks were imposed by the banking reforms of the 1930 &quot; s , and there was an effort to maintain such restrictions in the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 . 
Now , however , a new form of antitrust arrives - in the form of the Kanjorski Amendment , whose language was embedded in the Dodd-Frank bill . 
Once the bill becomes law , federal regulators will have the right and the responsibility to limit the scope of big banks and , as necessary , break them up when they pose a &quot; grave risk &quot; to financial stability . 
This is not a theoretical possibility - such risks manifested themselves quite clearly in late 2008 and into early 2009 . 
It remains uncertain , of course , whether the regulators would actually take such steps . 
And Kanjorski probably is right that not much would be required . 
&quot; If just one regulator uses these extraordinary powers &#91; to break up too-big-to-fail banks &#93; just once , &quot; he says , &quot; it will send a powerful message , &quot; one that would &quot; significantly reform how all financial services firms behave forever more . &quot; 
Regulators can do a great deal , but they need political direction from the highest level in order to make genuine progress . 
Teddy Roosevelt , of course , preferred to &quot; Speak softly and carry a big stick . &quot; 
The Kanjorski Amendment is a very big stick . 
Who will pick it up ?
