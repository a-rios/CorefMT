Haiti &apos;s Moment 
NEW YORK - Fortune has not been kind to Haiti . 
The pain and suffering arising from last year &apos;s earthquake was already enormous , and has since been compounded by Hurricane Tomas and an outbreak of cholera . Now there is growing tension surrounding the just completed election . 
That epidemic has spread to all ten departments of the country , as well as to the capital , Port au Prince . 
The Haitian Ministry of Public Health reports that the number of deaths is approaching 2,000 , with the number of infections exceeding 80,000 . 
Because many people do not have easy access to hospitals and clinics , these figures are rough estimates at best . 
United Nations teams fear that the actual number of deaths and current infections may in fact be up to twice as high . 
Clearly , the epidemic will continue to spread . 
This is a function of a particularly virulent strain of cholera and underlying issues : a weak national health system , poor sanitary conditions , and a lack of clean water and other basic services . 
The World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization ( PAHO ) estimate that the outbreak could affect some 400,000 people . 
As the international community mobilizes to respond , we have two priorities : first , bringing down the fatality rate through effective treatment , and , second , informing the population about how to care for themselves , their families , and their communities . 
There is some positive news , however grim the overall picture . 
While the epidemiological statistics are alarming , the death rate has declined in recent weeks , from 7.6 % to 3.6 % . 
The Haitian government , UN agencies , and the humanitarian community are moving quickly to put treatment and preventive measures in place . 
They are providing water-purification materials , carrying out large-scale public-information campaigns , and helping to build treatment centers . 
Yet one thing is clear . 
Without a massive and immediate international response , the lives of hundreds of thousands of people will be at risk . 
It is up to us to act , with maximum speed and full deployment of resources . 
Most immediately , there is an urgent need for more cholera treatment centers . 
More trained medical and non-medical personnel are needed to run these facilities . 
PAHO and WHO estimate that an additional 350 doctors , 2,000 nurses , and 2,200 support staff will be required over the next three months . 
Approximately 30,000 community health workers and volunteers are also needed to help staff an estimated 15,000 oral re-hydration points . 
Still others are required to educate and promote better hygiene in camps and communities . 
It is vital that the Haitian people in all communities are fully informed about how to deal with this disease , and that they understand that cholera is quickly cured when diagnosed and treated quickly . 
Essential medicines and materials are in short supply : water purification tablets , chlorine disinfectant , antibiotics , jerry cans , soap , water cisterns , and construction material for latrines . 
Stocks of oral re-hydration salts must be constantly replenished . 
Not surprisingly , the incidence of cholera is highest in Haiti &apos;s slums and rural areas , where people are farthest from assistance . 
In the camps where an estimated 1.3 million took refuge after this year &apos;s earthquake , ironically , incidence is relatively low . 
The reason : we are there with what is required - medical aid , sanitation , and clean water . 
To help Haiti help itself , we must extend our reach . 
That is why the UN and its partners issued the Cholera Inter-Sector Response Strategy for Haiti , a $ 164 million funding appeal to support the international community &apos;s efforts to contain the outbreak . 
So far , it is only 20 % funded . 
This will not be a short-term crisis , so we cannot think only in the short term in formulating our response . 
Millions of people look to the international community for immediate survival . 
At the same time , our response must be viewed within the broader context of recovery and long-term development . 
Investment in basic infrastructure is critical - clean water , sanitation , healthcare , education , and durable shelter . 
Along the way , we must help strengthen Haitian institutions . 
Haiti needs a strong and legitimate government to overcome the challenges ahead . 
The recent elections were a milestone in the country &apos;s long and very hard road . 
Tensions are on the rise . 
Political leaders must put the national interest ahead of personal and partisan ambitions . 
The UN and its many international partners will help Haiti to get back on its feet . 
As a people , they are singularly resilient and brave . 
They need , and deserve , our support . 
This is Haiti &apos;s moment .
