The Year of Rational Pessimism 
NEW YORK - Someone recently quipped that the best thing about 2011 was that it was likely better than 2012 . 
By the same token , while there has been much concern about America &apos;s political gridlock , something worse for America , and for the world , could have happened : the Republicans could have prevailed in their program of austerity-cum-redistribution to the wealthy . 
Automatic cuts won &apos;t happen until 2013 , which means that the economy in 2012 will be spared , ever so slightly . 
Two more positive notes for 2011 : America seems finally to have awakened to the yawning gap between the rich and the rest - between the top 1 % and everyone else . 
The likelihood , though , is that the economic and political problems that were so manifest in the US and Europe in 2011 - and which have so far been tremendously mismanaged - will only grow worse in 2012 . 
Any forecast for the coming year depends , more than usual , on politics - on the outcome of the US gridlock , and on European leaders &quot; ability to respond to the euro crisis . 
Economic forecasts are difficult enough ; but when it comes to political forecasts , our crystal balls are even cloudier . 
That said , here is my best guess . 
European leaders repeatedly proclaim their commitment to saving the euro , but those who could have repeatedly said that they are committed to not doing what is needed . 
They have recognized that austerity will mean slower growth - indeed , a recession is increasingly likely - and that , without growth , the eurozone &apos;s distressed countries will not be able to manage their debts . 
But they have done nothing to promote growth . 
They are on a death spiral . 
Like it or not , the ECB is effectively financing the sovereigns . 
German leaders have frowned on this , and the ECB has felt uncomfortable , limiting its purchases and saying that political leaders , not central bankers , should save the euro . 
But the political response has been too little , too late , to say the least . 
The most likely scenario is more of the same : austerity , weaker economies , more unemployment , and continuing deficits , with European leaders doing the minimum to fend off crisis for the moment . 
In short : more turmoil . 
The day of reckoning - when the euro breaks up or Europe takes the kind of definitive action that would make a single currency work - may come in 2012 , but , more likely than not , Europe &apos;s leaders will do whatever they can to postpone that day of reckoning . 
Europe will suffer , and so will the rest of the world . 
The United States had hoped for an export-led recovery , but , with economic growth slowing in Europe , its largest customer ( and impeding growth in much of the rest of the world ) , that is unlikely . 
That , combined with cutbacks at the state and local level , means that the first real manifestations of austerity &apos;s impact will appear in 2012 . 
( Already , though , public employment is around 700,000 below its pre-crisis level ; government , rather than acting counter-cyclically , offsetting weak private demand , has been acting pro-cyclically , exacerbating the economy &apos;s problems . ) 
Meanwhile , the consequences of failure to deal with the housing crisis - which triggered financial markets &quot; near-meltdown in 2008 - are continuing to be felt : further decline in real-estate prices , more foreclosures , and thus even greater stress on US households . 
No one in either US political party seems willing to face the fact that fixing the banking system , though necessary , was not sufficient to restore the economy to health ( or that the financial system was never really fixed ) . 
The American economy before the crisis was being maintained on artificial life support by a housing bubble that led to unsustainable consumption . 
There is no way back to 2007 . 
But neither party has been willing to admit what is really wrong , or advance an agenda that would address the underlying ills . 
Platitudes and placebos - vapid calls for more job creation , fiscal restraint , reining in entitlement programs , and so forth - will characterize America &apos;s election year . 
Neither side will step forward with a program for restructuring the economy and reducing the inequality that is sapping the country &apos;s strength . 
I have been a big critic of markets , but even America &apos;s market participants now sense that political leaders are not up to the task . 
If investors suffered from irrational exuberance in the 1990 &quot; s , they are likely to suffer from rational pessimism in the coming year . 
After all , Americans will have to choose between a leader who has proven that he can &apos;t lead the US out of its economic morass , and one who has not yet proven his inability to do so - but who could make matters even worse through policies that increase inequality and slow growth . 
I hope that events prove me wrong , and that my pessimism turns out to have been excessive . 
Indeed , 2012 could prove to be the year in which the experiment with the euro , the culmination of a 50-year process of economic and political integration in Europe , comes to an end . 
In that case , rather than bringing the hoped-for end of the Great Recession of 2008 , a downturn that has lasted too long and caused too much suffering , 2012 may mark the beginning of a new and more frightening phase of the world &apos;s worst economic calamity in three-quarters of a century .
