Japan &apos;s New Model Political Leadership 
AMSTERDAM - Amid the horrifying news from Japan , the establishment of new standards of political leadership there is easy to miss - in part because the Japanese media follow old habits of automatically criticizing how officials are dealing with the calamity , and many foreign reporters who lack perspective simply copy that critical tone . 
This time , Prime Minister Naoto Kan &apos;s DPJ ( Democratic Party of Japan ) government is making an all-out effort , with unprecedented intensive involvement of his cabinet and newly formed specialized task forces . 
The prime minister himself is regularly televised with relevant officials wearing the work fatigues common among Japanese engineers . 
In 1995 , Kobe citizens extricated from the rubble were looked after if they belonged to corporations or religious groups . 
Those who did not were expected to fend mostly for themselves . 
This reflected a &quot; feudal &quot; like corporatist approach , in which the direct relationship between the citizen and the state played no role . 
This widely condemned governmental neglect of the Kobe earthquake victims was among the major sources of public indignation that helped popularize the reform movement from which Kan emerged . 
Unfortunately , today &apos;s Japanese media are overlooking that historical context . 
For example , the newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun recently lamented the shortcomings of the Kan government &apos;s response , emphasizing the poor lines of command running from the cabinet to officials carrying out rescue and supply operations . 
When the DPJ came to power in September 2009 it ended half-a-century of de facto one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) . 
But even more significantly , its intentions addressed a cardinal question for Japan : who should rule , bureaucratic mandarins or elected officials ? 
The LDP , formed in 1955 , had not done much actual ruling after helping to coordinate postwar reconstruction , which extended without debate into an unofficial but very real national policy of , in principle , unlimited expansion of industrial capacity . 
Other possible priorities hardly ever entered political discussions . 
The need for a political steering wheel in the hands of elected politicians was highlighted in 1993 , when two major political figures bolted from the LDP with their followers . 
By doing so , they catalyzed the reformist political movement that resulted in the DPJ , the first credible opposition party that - unlike the Socialists who engaged in mere ritualistic opposition - was prepared to win elections and actually govern rather than merely maintain the fa√ßade of government that had become the norm under the LDP . 
Lowering the prestige of the government right now is the fact that Kan has not shown any talent for turning himself into a TV personality who can project a grand image of leadership . 
The efforts of Kan &apos;s government are obviously hampered by a rigid and much fragmented bureaucratic infrastructure . 
The DPJ has had scant time to make up for what the LDP has long neglected . 
Its seventeen months in power before the current catastrophe have been a saga of struggle with career officials in many parts of the bureaucracy , including the judiciary , fighting for the survival of the world they have always known . 
Other countries could learn much from the DPJ &apos;s attempt to alter a status quo of political arrangements that has had half a century to form and consolidate . 
But it was the United States that first undermined the DPJ administration , by testing the new government &apos;s loyalty with an unfeasible plan - originally the brainchild of the George W. Bush-era US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld - to build a new base for the US Marines stationed on Okinawa . 
The first DPJ prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , miscalculated in believing that a face-to-face meeting with the new American president to discuss long-term matters affecting East Asia could settle the issue . 
He was steadily rebuffed by the American government . 
As Hatoyama could not keep his promise to safeguard the interests of the Okinawan people , he followed up with a customary resignation . 
Japan &apos;s main newspapers have mostly backed the status quo as well . 
Indeed , they now appear to have forgotten their role in hampering the DPJ &apos;s effort to create an effective political coordinating body for the country . 
A half-century of reporting on internal LDP rivalries unrelated to actual policy has turned Japan &apos;s reporters into the world &apos;s greatest connoisseurs of political factionalism . 
It has also left them almost incapable of recognizing actual policy initiatives when they see them . 
The rest of the world , however , has marveled at the admirable , dignified manner in which ordinary Japanese are dealing with terrible adversity . 
I am repeatedly asked why there is no looting or signs of explosive anger . 
The term &quot; stoicism &quot; appears over and over in media coverage of Japan &apos;s calamity . 
But , in my half-century of close acquaintance with Japanese life , I have never thought of the Japanese as stoic . 
Rather , the Japanese behave as they do because they are decent people . 
Being considerate , they do not burden each other by building themselves up as heroes in their own personal tragedies . 
They certainly deserve the better government that the DPJ is trying to give them .
