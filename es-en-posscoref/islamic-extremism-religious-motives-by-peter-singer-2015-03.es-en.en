Countering Islamic Extremism 
PRINCETON - Last month , US President Barack Obama hosted a three-day summit on &quot; Countering Violent Extremism . &quot; 
That term has already spawned a new abbreviation , &quot; CVE , &quot; used no fewer than 12 times in a Fact Sheet released by the Obama administration on February 18 . 
The Fact Sheet also uses the term &quot; violent extremism &quot; 21 times . 
How many times do terms like &quot; Islam , &quot; &quot; Islamic , &quot; or &quot; Muslim &quot; appear ? 
Zero . 
There is not even a reference to the &quot; Islamic State . &quot; 
That entity is referred to only by the initials &quot; ISIL . &quot; 
This is not an accident ; it is part of a strategy to win the support of mainstream Muslims . 
Riham Osman , speaking on behalf of the Muslim Public Affairs Council , which participated in the summit , said that using terms like &quot; radical Islam &quot; harms the cause of stopping the violence . 
This may partly reflect the Muslim community &apos;s understandable fears that associating Islam with terrorism and violence would contribute to an increase in attacks on , or discrimination against , all Muslims . 
Another reason that has been offered for not referring to &quot; Islamic radicalism &quot; or the &quot; Islamic State &quot; is that to do so concedes the terrorists &apos; claims that they are acting in accordance with Islam &apos;s teachings . 
That might draw others , who regard themselves as pious Muslims , to join them . 
Finally , the repeated use of &quot; Islamic &quot; as part of the description of enemy groups may make it appear that the West is &quot; at war with Islam . &quot; 
That could lead more moderate Muslims to fight alongside the extremists , thus broadening the conflict and making it more difficult to end . 
Yet there are also problems with seeking to avoid these terms . 
The first problem is political . 
The conservative US Senator Ted Cruz , who may be about to announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination , has said , &quot; You cannot defeat an enemy if you refuse to acknowledge what it is . &quot; 
That line could win votes . 
Indeed , it is never a good idea for a politician to appear to be denying what we can all see before our eyes . 
Moreover , because it is obvious to everyone that most violent extremism is being carried out in the name of Islam , avoiding the word is unlikely to prevent attacks on Muslims in response to this violence . 
A further problem becomes apparent as soon as we ask why it is important that mainstream Muslim leaders stand up in public and say that their religion opposes killing innocent people , or that those who die when committing such acts are not &quot; martyrs &quot; and will not be rewarded in the afterlife . 
Why should Muslim leaders , in particular , make such statements , rather than Christian , Buddhist , Jewish , or Hindu leaders ? 
The answer , once again , is obvious . 
But it is obvious only because we already know that groups like Al Qaeda , the Islamic State , and the Taliban are not obeying the precepts of Christianity , Buddhism , Judaism , or Hinduism . 
At the Washington summit , Obama said that &quot; all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam , because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative . &quot; 
At least this statement , unlike the White House Fact Sheet , acknowledges that groups like the Islamic state claim to be Islamic . 
Otherwise , what would be the relevance of this statement to &quot; countering violent extremism &quot; ? 
Nonetheless , Obama &apos;s assertion that &quot; all of us &quot; have this responsibility needs to be more narrowly directed . 
If I tried to get into a debate with any moderately well-educated Islamic State supporter about whether that organization is true to the teachings of Islam , I would lose the argument . 
I am not sufficiently expert in the Islamic tradition to be confident that extremists are misinterpreting it , and few of us are . 
The responsibility to which Obama was referring rests with those who are much more learned in Islam than &quot; all of us . &quot; 
Even for people who are learned in Islam , discharging the responsibility Obama has placed on them will not be easy , as a reading of Graeme Wood &apos;s revealing recent account demonstrates . 
Wood presents a picture of people driven by a firm belief in Islam , and knowledgeable about its key texts . 
Anyone familiar with Christian fundamentalism in the United States should be able to discern a pattern in the attitudes taken by religious fundamentalists , independently of the religion to which they adhere . 
The Islamic State &apos;s spokesmen insist on following the original precepts laid down by the Prophet Mohammed and his earliest followers , understood literally and with no adjustment for different circumstances . 
Like Christian fundamentalists , they see themselves as preparing for - and helping to bring about - the apocalypse . 
Let me emphasize that I am not saying that the beliefs of today &apos;s Christian fundamentalists are morally on a par with those of today &apos;s Muslim fundamentalists . 
There is a vast moral difference between those who oppose the taking of innocent human life and those who kill people because of their nationality , or what they say , or because they are &quot; apostates . &quot; 
But the fundamentalists &apos; worldviews are similar in important respects , regardless of the religion to which they adhere . 
By now , the problem with trying to counter those who seek new recruits for &quot; violent extremism &quot; without focusing on this extremism &apos;s Islamic basis should be clear . 
Those considering joining an extremist Islamic group should be told : You believe every other religion to be false , but adherents of many other religions believe just as firmly that your faith is false . 
You cannot really know who is right , and you could all be wrong . 
Either way , you do not have a sufficiently well-grounded justification for killing people , or for sacrificing your own life . 
Granted , some people are not open to reasoning of any kind , and so will not be swayed by such an argument . 
But others may be . 
Why rule it out in advance by denying that much extremist violence is religiously motivated ?
