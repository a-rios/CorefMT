1929 or 1989 ? 
PARIS - As the economic crisis deepens and widens , the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening . 
At the start of the crisis , many people likened it to 1982 or 1973 , which was reassuring , because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns . 
Today , the mood is much grimmer , with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound , even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional . 
The tendency is either excessive restraint ( Europe ) or a diffusion of the effort ( the United States ) . 
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms . 
For geo-strategists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 . 
Of course , the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
Indeed , on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis : the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism . 
Yet 2008-2009 , like 1989 , may very well correspond to an epochal change , whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades . 
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points . 
And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989 , including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist , if not xenophobic , tendencies . 
In 1989 , liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc . 
For many of his supporters , it was President Ronald Reagan who , with his deliberate escalation of the arms race , pushed the Soviet economy to the brink , thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets . 
Of course , there are obvious differences between 1989 and now . 
First , and perhaps above all , the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity . 
By contrast , 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity , but with China substituting for the Soviet Union . 
Second , whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear - if more fragile than expected - winners in 1989 , it is difficult in 2009 , with the spread of the global crisis , to distinguish winners from losers . 
Everyone seems to be a loser , even if some are more affected than others . 
Yet , history is unfair , and the US , despite its greater responsibility for today &apos;s global crisis , may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass . 
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT , I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes . 
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe . 
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard , Asians - Chinese and Indians , in particular - are everywhere , like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC : full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much , and whom they would overcome in the coming decades . 
But before this new order appears , the world may be faced with spreading disorder , if not outright chaos . 
What , for example , will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries ? 
When the rich get less rich , the poor get poorer . 
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the &quot; European dream &quot; and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe &apos;s supposedly open countries ? 
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers , including me , would have assumed . 
We can only hope that , in the end , the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now - intuitively and in our historical reflexes - feel them to be .
