The Business Case for Sustainability 
BERKELEY - Investors worldwide are increasingly seeking investment opportunities that promise to bring environmental and social benefits , in addition to market rates of return . 
If this trend continues , with the advancement of environmental or social objectives enhancing an investment &apos;s value , it will strengthen the commitment to sustainability that is already gaining momentum among businesses around the world . 
Last year , one out of every six dollars of assets under professional management in the United States - a total of $ 6.6 trillion - was allocated toward some form of sustainable investment , especially public equities . 
Some 1,260 companies , managing $ 45 trillion worth of assets , are signatories of the United Nations &quot; &quot; principles for responsible investment , &quot; which recognize environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) factors - and thus the long-term health and stability of companies and markets - as critical to investors . 
One signatory , CalPERS , one of the world &apos;s largest institutional investors , has gone a step further : it will require all of its investment managers to identify and integrate ESG factors into their decisions - a bold move that could transform capital markets . 
The number of companies issuing sustainability reports has grown from fewer than 30 in the early 1990s to more than 7,000 in 2014 . 
To be sure , a major barrier to incorporating ESG criteria into investment decisions remains : many investors - including 54 % of the respondents in the Morgan Stanley survey - believe that doing so could lower the financial rate of return . 
A seminal 2012 study that analyzed two groups of companies - similar in terms of industry , size , financial performance , and growth prospects - found that those in the &quot; high sustainability group &quot; had superior share-price performance . 
Many ESG factors come into play when evaluating sustainable investment options . 
For example , the Generation Foundation - the think tank of Generation Investment Management ( on whose advisory board I serve ) - identifies 17 environmental factors , 16 social factors , and 12 governance factors relevant to sustainability . 
The challenge is to distinguish between the ESG factors that have a material influence on company performance and those that do not . 
The non-profit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ( SASB ) is attempting to change that by developing material sustainability accounting standards for 80 industries , consistent with the US Security and Exchange Commission &apos;s compliance regulations . 
More than 2,800 participants - including companies with market capitalization totaling $ 11 trillion and investors with $ 23.4 trillion in assets under management - have been involved in the SASB process . 
Using the SASB &apos;s proposed standards for 45 industries , as well as other metrics , a new study - the most definitive so far - has found that companies that perform well on material sustainability factors have better operational performance , are less risky , and earn significantly higher shareholder returns than companies that perform poorly . 
Similarly , a new framework recently proposed by Morgan Stanley for valuations of companies in 29 industries includes ESG factors that pose material risks or opportunities . 
Whereas a company is traditionally valued based exclusively on how it deploys financial capital to generate returns , the new framework incorporates how it deploys natural , human , and social capital , as well as the transparency of its governance practices . 
This new approach to company valuation reflects the view that the most successful companies will be those that deploy all four kinds of capital responsibly . 
Material ESG factors can affect a company &apos;s financial performance and shareholder returns through several channels . 
For example , more efficient energy and resource use can lower costs ; better management of human talent can boost productivity ; stricter safety , health , and environmental rules can reduce the risk of serious accidents ; and new green or fair-trade products that appeal to consumers can increase revenues . 
Consider investments that improve the energy efficiency of data centers , which use 10-20 times more energy than average commercial buildings , and thus are responsible for considerable greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Decisions about data-center specifications are important for managing costs , obtaining a reliable supply of energy and water , and lowering reputational risks , particularly given the increasing global regulatory focus on climate change . 
Google &apos;s construction of data centers that use 50 % of the energy of an average data center has brought it considerable savings . 
Similar success stories have played out across sectors . 
Since 2011 , the US chemical company DuPont has invested $ 879 million in research and development of products with quantifiable environmental benefits ; it has recorded $ 2 billion in annual revenue from products that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , and an additional $ 11.8 billion in revenue from renewable resources like wind and solar power . 
Likewise , the multinational consumer goods company Procter and Gamble reported $ 52 billion in sales of &quot; sustainable innovation products &quot; from 2007 to 2012 . 
There are good reasons to believe that , by investing in improving material sustainability , companies can increase shareholder value . 
In fact , if a company is to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to its investors , it has little choice but to go beyond financial returns to incorporate ESG factors that are likely to have a material impact on its performance over time . 
This is precisely the kind of incentive that could propel the world toward a more sustainable future .
