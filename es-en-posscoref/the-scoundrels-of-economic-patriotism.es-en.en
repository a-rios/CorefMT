The Scoundrels of Economic Patriotism 
Samuel Johnson called patriotism &quot; the last refuge of a scoundrel . &quot; 
If that is true , what should we think of today &apos;s mounting economic nationalism , sometimes euphemistically described as &quot; economic patriotism &quot; ? 
Indeed , economic nationalism is exceptionally vigorous at the moment . 
Vigorous popular opposition to a Dubai company &apos;s plan to take over ports in the United States shocked the American government . 
Poland is witnessing a populist backlash against foreign ownership of banks . 
France is blocking the acquisition of French utilities by the Italian electricity company Enel . 
Together with other European governments , France is also agitating against the takeover of the Luxembourg-based steel company Arcelor by a Netherlands company largely controlled by an Indian steel magnate . 
Defenders of these ill-fated cross-border takeovers worry that a sinister whiff of the twentieth century &apos;s worst moments is in the air . 
An outraged Italian minister warned of a new mobilization of populist nationalism in an &quot; August 1914 &quot; scenario . 
The better analogy is from the 1930 &quot; s : in 1933 , the year in which Hitler came to power , the world &apos;s most famous economist , John Maynard Keynes , produced a plea for &quot; national self-sufficiency . &quot; 
Both the 1914 and the 1933 analogies point to the most striking characteristic of the current debate : the key role of security worries in justifying protectionism . 
Nobody worried about foreign ownership of US ports as long as the owner was a British company ; the new fears reflect the belief that Dubai might be a channel for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism . 
Likewise , the deterioration of international relations before World Wars I and II was marked by governments &quot; increased propensity to use economics as a tool of power politics . 
In 1911 , the diplomatic crisis over Morocco was accompanied by a French speculative attack on German financial markets . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , both France and Germany used this kind of technique as a way to bolster their own security . 
The US tried to control Japanese expansion in Asia by limiting Japan &apos;s energy ( especially petroleum ) imports . 
The most obvious reason for increased worries about security in America is the challenge of meeting the threat of terrorism after the attacks of September 2001 . 
But that can scarcely explain European nervousness and the protectionist reaction . 
In Europe &apos;s case , two contrasting explanations exist . 
The first is that the new worries are a strange case of psychological transference . 
People in places like France and Poland who worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside the country . 
There was certainly a great deal of this type of sentiment in the 1930 &quot; s , when the populist response to the Great Depression attributed it to the sinister forces of &quot; international capital . &quot; 
The modern version of this explanation holds that the world is changing so quickly that national security and , indeed , national identity , are under threat . 
An alternative scenario suggests that these fears emanate from a real problem . 
Modern economic growth still depends in almost every advanced industrial country on imported energy ( Norway is an exception ) . 
Because of fears about pollution , or about the safety of nuclear energy , most countries neglected to build up their own capacity . 
The resulting vulnerability was highlighted by the Russian reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine in January , which resulted in reduced flows to central and western Europe . 
The experience made Poles particularly jittery , and pushed the country &apos;s populist right-wing government down the road of economic nationalism . 
But West Europeans remember their own traumas , including electricity grid failures and widespread blackouts . 
Wouldn &apos;t an Italian company facing grid failure prefer to shut down French rather than Italian consumers ? 
These two scenarios of the origins of economic nationalism , one irrational and the other not , are not real alternatives , but describe responses that intertwine : the more rational the fear , the more that fear can be used as an instrument of politics . 
Fear creates a demand for state action . 
Politicians like this because it increases demand for their services . 
They point out the potential problem and then attempt to sell solutions that lie within their nationally defined spheres of competence . 
One modern politician , in particular , has been effective in placing nervousness about energy supply at the center of a new political vision . 
According to Vladimir Putin , the need to control and secure energy justifies a massive extension of state intervention in the economy . 
Putin &apos;s vision was apparently vindicated by the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US . 
Since then , Putin has projected his vision of politicized energy in a way that makes all Europeans , not just Russians , nervous . 
That bolsters his strength in the Russian setting . 
But a Putin in one country has a tendency to produce Putin imitators elsewhere . 
We should be concerned about the efficiency losses in markets where restrictions stemming from economic nationalism have so far been imposed . 
But we should be far more worried that fear about the collapse or manipulation of markets creates a demand for action that makes such a collapse more rather than less likely . 
Fear generates a demand for more security that is in the end paralyzing .
