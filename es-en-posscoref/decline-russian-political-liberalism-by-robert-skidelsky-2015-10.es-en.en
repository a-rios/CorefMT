From Memory to Denial in Russia 
LONDON - My most painful experience in Russia was a visit to Perm-36 , the only one of Stalin &apos;s forced-labor camps to have been preserved , in 1998 . 
I was in Perm , a city in the Urals , to take part in a seminar of the Moscow School of Political Studies . 
Founded by the remarkable Lena Nemirovskaya , the school &apos;s purpose was to introduce young post-communist Russians to democracy , self-government , and capitalism . 
One bitterly cold March day , I joined a few friends on a trip to the former camp . 
Built in the early 1940s as a &quot; regular &quot; labor camp , Perm-36 was converted into a concentration camp for political prisoners in 1972 . 
The last prisoners were released in 1987 , three years into Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s rule . 
Now it was being restored as a Gulag Museum by Memorial , a human-rights group founded by the dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov , to remind Russians of their totalitarian past . 
We were shown around the maximum-security wing . 
Surrounded by a barbed-wire perimeter , it had housed the political prisoners , mostly from the non-Russian Soviet republics , who were considered to be &quot; particularly dangerous recidivists . &quot; 
After a Ukrainian television crew filmed the site in 1989 , part of it was deliberately destroyed . 
It was obvious that the prisoners had been subject to psychological torture and extreme physical hardship . 
The tiny radiator in each cell could hardly have dented the October-to-April frost . 
The prisoners slept on wooden planks or iron bunks . 
Their clothes and bedcovers were made of cotton , not wool , and an open hole served as the cell &apos;s lavatory . 
Our guide , Maya , explained that the authorities liked to put together prisoners who got on each other &apos;s nerves . 
During the day , they were moved across the corridor to identical cells in which they uselessly worked making iron implements . 
For one hour each day , they were allowed into an &quot; exercise block , &quot; a nine-foot ( 2.7 meters ) , tin-lined cube , with a barbed-wire roof and a guard post on top . 
The only other &quot; recreation &quot; was a weekly show of propaganda films . 
Of the 56 &quot; dangerous recidivists &quot; held in Perm-36 in the 1980s , seven died . 
One was the Ukrainian poet and nationalist Vasyl Stus . 
The authorities called it a suicide , but survivors say that , for fun , the guards unscrewed one of the wooden planks from the wall and dropped it on Stus &apos;s head as he lay sleeping . 
As Maya recounted the grisly story , I watched the faces of the two young male guards who accompanied us . 
Their expressions were as frozen as the ground outside . 
Were they thinking about football or about making love to their girlfriends ? 
Given enough vodka , would they , too , have been capable of murder for fun ? 
The answer , I fear , is probably yes . 
Evil systems never seem to struggle to find the zombie henchmen they need . 
Organizations like Memorial and the Moscow School of Political Studies have no place in Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Officially , they are deemed &quot; foreign agents &quot; and have been subject to so much legal harassment that it is almost impossible for them to function . 
Today , the Gulag Museum is under different management . 
&quot; The new presentation , &quot; write Mikhail Danilovich and Robert Coalson , &quot; is devoted not to the repressive forced-labor practices of the Stalin era but to the timber production at the plant and to its contribution to the Soviet victory in World War II . &quot; 
And , after 20 years , the Moscow School of Political Studies has been forced to suspend its Russian operations . 
The fate of the museum and the school is part of the wider clampdown on freedom of expression and behavior in Putin &apos;s third presidential term . 
Dissidents are routinely dubbed deviants , fifth columnists , and traitors , as the regime leads a drive for national unity based on religion , tradition , and paranoid rhetoric . 
This represents a major shift from Russia &apos;s early post-Soviet days . 
The liberal Russia &apos;s Choice party , led by the country &apos;s first democratic prime minister , Yegor Gaidar , received 15.5 % of the vote in the 1993 general election , and with its allies formed the largest bloc in the Duma . 
At the time , this was regarded as a catastrophic failure . 
Today , liberal candidates cannot even get into the Duma . 
How has this come to pass ? 
Why have the hopes of Gorbachev &apos;s glasnost been so cruelly snuffed out ? 
A widespread view is that Russia is simply reverting to type : freedom was never more than a fleeting vowel in its historical alphabet . 
But this is a facile explanation . 
True , Russian liberalism has contributed to its own demise , by its incompetence and factionalism . 
But the West did not help . 
In the 1990s , it failed to put money behind the economic reforms that it sponsored . 
Expanding NATO into the Baltic States in 2002 - the Alliance &apos;s first enlargement into former Soviet territory - was a catastrophic mistake , which made it almost impossible for a Russian to be both patriotic and pro-Western . 
By both omission and commission , the West cut the ground from under Russian political liberalism , enabling the ascendancy of Putinism . 
So far , Putin has displayed an accurate sense of limits . 
He allows Russians to dream of greatness without getting them into serious trouble . 
Under his leadership , Russia has shrugged off sanctions , forged a new alliance with China , and annoyed - but not openly challenged - the West in Syria . 
But those who know Putin say that he brooks no argument ; he is the only one setting the limits . 
And no one can maintain supreme power for as long as he has without being corrupted . 
For the moment , Putinism is the only game in town . 
But , although the forces represented by Memorial and the Moscow School of Political Studies have been marginalized , they have not been eradicated .
