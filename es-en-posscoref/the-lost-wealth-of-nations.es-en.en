The Lost Wealth of Nations 
The phrase &quot; sustainable development &quot; is commonplace , but economic commentators offer no guidance on how we are to judge whether a nation &apos;s economic development is , indeed , sustainable . 
The famous Brundtland Commission Report of 1987 defined sustainable development as ... &quot; development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . &quot; 
Sustainable development therefore requires that , relative to their populations , each generation should bequeath to its successor at least as large a productive base as it inherited . 
But how is a generation to judge whether it is leaving behind an adequate productive base ? 
Economists argue that the correct measure of an economy &apos;s productive base is wealth , which includes not only the value of manufactured assets ( buildings , machinery , roads ) , but also &quot; human &quot; capital ( knowledge , skills , and health ) , natural capital ( ecosystems , minerals , and fossil fuels ) , and institutions ( government , civil society , the rule of law ) . 
Development is sustainable so long as an economy &apos;s wealth relative to its population is maintained over time . 
In other words , economic growth should be viewed as growth in wealth , not growth in GNP . 
There is a big difference between the two . 
There are many circumstances in which a nation &apos;s GNP ( per capita ) increases even while its wealth ( per capita ) declines . 
In broad terms , these circumstances involve growing markets in certain classes of goods and services ( natural-resource intensive products ) , concomitant with absent markets and collective policies for natural capital ( ecosystem services ) . 
As global environmental problems frequently create additional stresses on the local resource bases of the world &apos;s poorest people , GNP growth in rich countries can fuel downward pressure on the wealth of the poor . 
Of course , a situation where GNP increases while wealth declines can &apos;t last forever . 
When an economy eats into its productive base in order to raise current production , eventually GNP will decline , too , unless policies were to so change that wealth begins to accumulate . 
For example , using World Bank data on the depreciation of a number of natural resources at the national level , economists estimate that , although GNP per capita has increased in the Indian sub-continent over the past three decades , wealth per capita has declined somewhat . 
The decline has occurred because , relative to population growth , fixed-capital investment , knowledge and skills , and improvements in institutions have not compensated for the degradation of natural capital . 
In sub-Saharan Africa , both GNP per capita and wealth per capita have declined . 
Economists have also found that in the world &apos;s poorest regions ( Africa and the Indian sub-continent ) , areas that have experienced higher population growth have also lost wealth per capita at a faster rate . 
The economies of China and the OECD countries , by contrast , have grown both in terms of GNP per capita and wealth per capita . 
The latter regions have more than substituted for the decline in natural capital by accumulating other capital assets . 
In other words , during the past three decades the rich world seems to have enjoyed &quot; sustainable development , &quot; while development in the poor world ( barring China ) has been unsustainable . 
These are early days in the quantitative study of sustainable development . 
Even so , one can argue that current estimates of wealth are biased . 
As for natural capital , the World Bank has so far limited itself to the atmosphere as a sink for carbon dioxide , oil , and natural gas , and forests as sources of timber . 
Many types of natural capital , however , have not been included : fresh water , soil , forests as providers of ecosystem services , and the atmosphere as a sink for such pollution as particulates and nitrogen and sulphur oxides . 
If these missing items were included , the poor world &apos;s economic performance over the past three decades , including China &apos;s , would look far worse . 
But the estimates of wealth accumulation in recent years in the rich world are biased upward too . 
Empirical studies by earth scientists have revealed all too often that the capacity of natural systems to absorb disturbances is not unlimited . 
When their absorptive capacities are reached , natural systems are liable to collapse into unproductive states . 
Recovery is then costly , in terms of both time and material resources . 
On the other hand , if , say , the Atlantic current that keeps northern Europe warm were to shift direction or to slow down on account of global warming , the change would be essentially irreversible . 
In short , we know that up to some unknown set of limits , knowledge , institutions , and manufactured capital can substitute for natural resources , so that even if an economy loses some of its natural capital , in quantity or quality , its wealth would increase if it invested sufficiently in other assets . 
The remarkable increase in agricultural productivity over the past two centuries demonstrates this clearly . 
But there are limits to substitutability : the costs of substitution ( including human ingenuity ) often increase in previously unknown ways as key resources are degraded . 
Global warming is a case in point . 
When the downside risks associated with such limits and thresholds are brought into estimates of sustainable development , the growth in wealth among the world &apos;s wealthy nations will probably turn out to have been less than we now think .
