The Dutch Jobs Miracle 
PARIS : Unemployment in the Netherlands dipped below 3 % recently , a figure for the most part unheard of in Europe since the oil shocks of the 1970s . 
Indeed , not so long ago unemployment in the Netherlands stood above 10 % . 
Have the Dutch invented a Fourth Way to improved economic performance and are there lessons for the rest of Europe in the Dutch experience ? 
For some observers across Europe , the economic performance of the Netherlands is so surprising that they believe it a product of smoke and mirrors , or of some statistical trick . 
But as with those who doubted the reality behind American economic growth five years ago , this view is also emphatically wrong . 
Not only is unemployment way down in the Netherlands , but the rate of participation by the entire population in the labour market is growing sharply as well . 
True , the proportion of workers who remain classified by the state as sick or invalid - currently 12 % - remains much too high , to be frank . 
But this proportion is less today than it was in the 1980s ; so a higher unemployment rate is not being disguised by medical certificates . 
Other disbelieving observers say that what we are seeing in the Netherlands is the effect of a shortening of the work week . 
The average work week in the Netherlands ( counting both those who work full-time and those who work part-time ) is 27 hours , compared to 29 hours in France . 
Advocates of a shorter work week as the road to full employment , indeed , often cite the Dutch example to declare victory for their arguments . 
Those against a shortened work week , however , dismiss the increase in the number of jobs that results from shorter working hours as a false solution - a crude swap of working hours for an increase in the number of workers . 
Both hostile camps are wrong . 
There is a significant increase in part-time work in the Netherlands , to be sure , but it is due , primarily , to a large increase in labor participation among women . 
Thus part-time work does not mechanically explain the country &apos;s lower unemployment rate . 
So what is the secret of successful job creation in the Netherlands ? 
The immediate reason is easy to identify . 
Since the beginning of the 1980s , wage increases have been smaller than technological progress would have allowed . 
Company profits have thus gone up , leading to new investment and the creation of new jobs . 
This is a classic mechanism , but one which has worked perfectly . 
The more delicate question is to identify those factors that made wage moderation in the Netherlands possible . 
I see two principal reasons : 
• The first is a reform of unemployment insurance . 
The Netherlands has put into effect a reform that links unemployment compensation to searching for a new job . 
Refusal by an unemployed person to take an &quot; acceptable &quot; job offer automatically results in the end of state support for him or her . 
The longer an individual remains unemployed , the wider the definition of what constitutes an &quot; acceptable &quot; becomes . 
In practice what this means is that an unemployed person must accept a &quot; comparable &quot; job for the first six months of unemployment , and must take any job on offer after eighteen months on the dole or lose state benefits . 
• The second factor is cooperation among social partners . 
The Dutch harp on this point , but they are right . 
For at the root of the Dutch miracle lies the by now quasi-mythological Wassenaar Agreement , signed in 1982 , among employers , unions , and the government . 
At the time , it was clear to all concerned that the Dutch economy was in bad shape . 
The Wassenaar Agreement was a plan of action : moderation of wage demands was assured in exchange for measures designed to alleviate the human cost of unemployment , from the financing of early retirement to the shortening of the work week . 
By and large , this strategy has been adhered to ever since . 
Important lessons are to be found in the Dutch experience for all of Europe . 
Today , economic conditions in Western Europe are good - in some places , better than that even - and they are improving in many countries of Eastern Europe that are seeking EU membership . 
But Europe &apos;s economies are regularly subject to new recessions . 
These recessions will require painful adjustments . 
Without a mechanism for social cooperation , the adjustments that any recession will impose are likely to result in high unemployment . 
With a solid mechanism of social cooperation , however , there is at least a chance to avoid it . 
It is now , when economies are doing better , that such a structure for social cooperation must be considered and constructed .
