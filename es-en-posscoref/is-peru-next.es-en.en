Is Peru Next ? 
On April 9 , when Peruvians elect a new President , they will choose between Ollanta Humala Tasso , a nationalist former army commander who proposes radical economic and social change , and Lourdes Flores Nano , who would maintain the country &apos;s current neo-liberal policies . 
Whoever wins , the results will echo across Latin America . 
A victory for Humala would seem to confirm the waning appeal of the neo-liberal policies that have dominated the continent since the 1980 &quot; s . 
It would bolster the informal axis of Venezuela &apos;s populist Hugo Chávez ( also a former soldier ) and Evo Morales in Bolivia , but also the line supported by Brazil &apos;s Lula da Silva and Argentina &apos;s Kirchner who combine administrative efficiency and left-leaning rhetoric . 
On the other hand , a victory for Lourdes Flores would stand out as an exception in the area , together with Alvaro Uribe in Colombia , whose reelection at the end of May seems certain today . 
Flores , a Social Christian candidate representing a rightist alliance , wants to maintain present President Alejandro Toledo &apos;s neo-liberal policies , which have boosted economic growth , foreign investment , and exports spectacularly over the past four years . 
The problem for Flores is that half the population has not yet benefited from Toledo &apos;s policies and lives under the poverty line , giving Humala his political opening . 
Humala calls for overhauling Peru &apos;s economic policy in particular by revising foreign companies &quot; concession contracts , increasing taxes on the rich , and lowering the salaries paid to congressmen and government members - &quot; old fashioned populism that will ruin the country , &quot; claim his opponents . 
Flores , who was the favorite for most of the campaign , has now lost support as a result of popular frustration over the distribution of wealth and because of her links with powerful domestic and foreign business interests . 
Her running mate , Arturo Woodman , is an old associate of the richest man in Peru , Dionisio Romero , a businessman who had no qualms about asking favors from Vladimiro Montesinos , the loathed adviser to President Alberto Fujimori , who is now in jail on corruption charges . 
But Humala is hardly a saint . 
He concealed information about his military past when the election campaign started , and is now under investigation for alleged human rights violations . 
In 1983 , he attended a course at the infamous School of the Americas , the counterinsurgency training institute where many of the region &apos;s most brutal military officers learned their craft . 
In 1992 , he commanded a military base in an Amazon village where coca leaf was grown - and where Sendero Luminoso guerrillas and drug trafficking bands worked together . 
Families of the disappeared , killed , and tortured told the press that Humala ordered the atrocitie 
In November 2000 , Ollanta Humala led a small-scale military uprising against Fujimori &apos;s dying regime . 
But Humala &apos;s detractors claim he took up arms to help the escape of Montesinos , who was already wanted by the law , but managed to flee aboard a sailboat towards Galapagos on the day of the coup . 
Humala denies everything , and none of the allegations has harmed him . 
Even so , not only foreign investors and local big businesses are worried by his rise in opinion polls . The United States is also concerned . 
In its most recent report on the global trade in illegal drugs , the US State Department stressed the increase in coca leaf crops in Peru and Bolivia last year . 
It attributed the rise to the &quot; nationalistic preaching &quot; that has taken root in both countries . 
Washington believes anti-drug policies will fail , to the benefit of drug dealers , if coca growers continue to identify themselves with nationalists who vindicate the leaf &apos;s production . 
Ollanta Humala opposes compulsory and mass coca eradication , claiming that he would industrialize and export the product to keep it from falling into drug dealers &quot; hands . 
In a meeting with Evo Morales , he spoke of a joint agenda to discuss the issue with US officials . 
But for the US , an anti-drug policy designed by nationalist leaders whose countries account for more than half of America &apos;s cocaine market hardly inspires confidence . 
The same is true for investors , particularly those from Chile , who have assets worth $ 1.5 billion in Peru . 
Humala glorifies two Peruvian military dictators : Cáceres , who fought against Chile , and Velasco Alvarado , who nationalized oil and mining companies , redistributed land , and controlled the press . 
In fact , Humala has singled out Chilean contracts and investments as targets for revision . 
At the same time , he has spoken of reinforcing the armed forces , which implies buying weapons . 
Flores , by contrast , offers legal security for businessmen and investors . 
At the same time , acknowledging that in Peru there has made little progress in fighting poverty , she is promising to create 650,000 jobs a year . 
Regardless of whether that promise is realistic , many consider her candidacy important for maintaining democratic continuity , whereas Ollanta Humala proposes to overhaul the political system by drafting a new constitution . 
When Peruvians vote on April 9 , after many years of poverty and inequality , it is likely that popular indignation will prevail . 
That emotion has led many candidates to victory in Latin America . 
The last of them was Evo Morales , an explicit and staunch soporter of Humala &#91; APC1 &#93; .
