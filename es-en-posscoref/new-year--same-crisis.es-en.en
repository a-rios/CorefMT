New Year , Same Crisis 
DAVOS - The measures introduced by the European Central Bank last December , especially the Long Term Refinancing Operation ( LTRO ) , have relieved the liquidity problems of European banks , but have not cured the financing disadvantage of the highly indebted member states . 
Since high-risk premiums on government bonds endanger the capital adequacy of banks , half a solution is not enough . 
Indeed , that supposed solution leaves half the eurozone relegated to the status of Third World countries that have become highly indebted in a foreign currency . 
Instead of the International Monetary Fund , it is Germany that is acting as the taskmaster imposing tough fiscal discipline on them . 
I have proposed a plan that would allow Italy and Spain to refinance their debt by issuing treasury bills at around 1 % . 
I named it in memory of my friend Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa , who , as Italy &apos;s central banker in the 1990 &quot; s , helped to stabilize that country &apos;s finances . 
The plan is rather complicated , but it is legally and technically sound . 
I describe it in detail in my new book Financial Turmoil in Europe and the United States . 
European authorities rejected my plan in favor of the LTRO . 
The difference between the two schemes is that mine would provide instant relief to Italy and Spain . 
By contrast , the LTRO allows Italian and Spanish banks to engage in a very profitable and practically riskless arbitrage , but has kept government bonds hovering on the edge of a precipice - although the last few days brought some relief . 
My proposal is to use the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) and the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) to insure the European Central Bank against the solvency risk on any newly issued Italian or Spanish treasury bills that it may buy from commercial banks . 
Banks would then find it advantageous to hold their surplus liquidity in the form of T-bills as long as these bills yielded more than bank deposits held at the ECB . 
Italy and Spain would then be able to refinance their debt at close to the ECB &apos;s deposit rate , which is currently 1 % on mandatory reserves and 25 basis points on excess-reserve accounts . 
This would greatly improve the sustainability of these countries &quot; debt . 
Italy , for instance , would see its average borrowing cost decline from the current 4.3 % . 
Confidence would gradually return , yields on outstanding bonds would decline , banks would no longer be penalized for owning Italian government bonds , and Italy would gradually regain access to the market at more reasonable interest rates . 
One obvious objection to this strategy is that it would reduce the average maturity of Italian and Spanish debt . 
I believe that , on the contrary , this would be an advantage in the current exceptional circumstances , because it would keep the Italian and Spanish governments on a short leash ; no country concerned could afford to lose the ECB facility . 
In the case of Italy , the short leash would dissuade former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from seeking to topple Mario Monti &apos;s new government ( which has only a fragile majority ) , because if Berlusconi precipitated an election , the electorate would punish him . 
My proposal fulfills both the letter and the spirit of Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty . 
The ECB &apos;s task is to provide liquidity to banks , while the EFSF and ESM are designed to absorb solvency risk . 
The ECB would not be facilitating additional borrowing by member countries ; it would merely allow them to refinance their debt at a lower cost . 
Together , the ECB and the EFSF could do what the ECB cannot do on its own . 
The EFSF would have practically unlimited capacity to insure eurozone T-bills in this way , because no country could default as long as the scheme was in operation . 
Nor could a country abuse the privilege , lest it be automatically withdrawn , causing the country &apos;s cost of borrowing to rise immediately . 
For the first time in this crisis , the European authorities would undertake an operation for which they have more than sufficient resources . 
Coming as a positive surprise to the markets , it would reverse their mood . 
After all , markets do have moods ; indeed , that is what the authorities have to learn in order to deal with financial crises . 
Contrary to the current discourse , the long-term solution must provide a stimulus to get Europe out of a deflationary vicious circle - structural reform alone will not do it . 
The stimulus must come from the EU , because individual countries will be under strict fiscal discipline . 
It will have to be guaranteed jointly and severally - and that means eurobonds in one guise or another .
