Latin America &apos;s Leftist Mirage 
Ever since Deng Xiao Ping &apos;s remark that &quot; it &apos;s not the color of the cat that matters , but whether it catches mice , &quot; it has been clear that the old Cold War divisions of left and right , communism and democracy , were obsolete . 
Indeed , the China that Deng began to build in 1978 is now communist politically and capitalist economically . 
But the tendency to apply old labels remains strong , so that everyday we hear gross simplifications like the current one that holds that Latin America is now undergoing a powerful leftist wave . 
The basis for this idea is that the rise to power of Lula da Silva in Brazil , Hugo Chávez in Venezuela , Néstor Kirchner in Argentina , Tabaré Vásquez in Uruguay , and , most recently , Evo Morales in Bolivia and Michelle Bachelet in Chile show a socialist trend . 
Or do they practice old style populism ? 
Just what is happening in Latin America ? 
To start , we can rule out Chile from the supposed leftist surge , for it is a country ruled by a centrist coalition of Ricardo Lagos &apos;s European-style socialists and the country &apos;s historic Christian democrats . 
That President Bachelet comes from socialist roots does not change the nature of her government , which will follow the parameters of its predecessors , and will preside over the most open economy in the region , one integrated into the global market by free-trade agreements that extend from the United States to China . 
Nor can one argue that Brazil &apos;s government under President Lula has not been characterized by moderation , following a more orthodox economic policy even than that of its predecessor , one based on fiscal discipline , budget surpluses , and an anti-inflationary monetary policy . 
In contrast to old leftist slogans against repaying foreign debt , Lula &apos;s government has hurried to settle all of its IMF obligations in advance . 
The rallying call against paying foreign debt , which was ubiquitous in Latin America in the 1980 &quot; s , was buried when the Argentinean government did the same thing , committing one-third of its reserves to pay in advance its debts to the IMF . 
Uruguay &apos;s government , too , has not deviated from the basic tenets of the policies of the conservative government that preceded it . 
It maintains the country &apos;s improved relations with the IMF , and it has even approved an agreement with the US to guarantee investments . 
Even Bolivia &apos;s government should not be regarded as a reincarnation of the continent &apos;s old populism . 
President Evo Morales &apos;s rise to power was inspired by historic discrimination against the indigenous majority , with the coca leaf as an emblem of an ancestral grudge . 
Although Morales campaigned on a promise to nationalize mineral resources , this has not happened yet , and , indeed , he now seems to be leaning towards partnerships with big state-owned energy companies , in the manner of Venezuela &apos;s Pedevesa or Brazil &apos;s Petrobras . 
Morales might yet turn more radical , but , for now , he represents a deep , ethnically inspired demand for historic justice , not a hard-left ideology . 
None of these governments openly speaks of socialism , much less Marxism . 
There is no planned collectivist economy , foreign investment is still sought , and , in general , the rules of liberal democracy still apply . 
Leaders may still think that &quot; another world is possible , &quot; but , while they use anti-globalization rhetoric , they pursue serious economic policies , even if more out of resignation than conviction . 
What all this means is that Latin America is not shifting left , but settling in the center . 
Even traditionally leftist parties like Brazil &apos;s Partido dos Trabalhadores or Uruguay &apos;s Frente Amplio have abandoned old Marxist ideals . 
Naturally , they declare friendship with Fidel Castro and seek his embrace to prevent old comrades from accusing them of betraying their legacy . 
But they go no further : Castro is fine for photo opportunities , but not for policy advice . 
Venezuela &apos;s Chávez is another story . 
No doubt , his regime revels in all the historic forms of populism : messianic leadership , anti-American rhetoric , disregard for constitutional forms , drunken spending , and state-orchestrated popular mobilization to fill squares and jeer at supposed enemies . 
Chávez is riding a wave of high oil prices and is determined , with torrential verbosity , to exercise some sort of continental demagogic leadership . 
But , while Chávez-style populism appears to have made some headway in Peru , it is far from succeeding . 
In Colombia , everything indicates that President Álvaro Uribe , erroneously labeled a rightist because of his fight against his country &apos;s guerrillas , will be re-elected . 
Oscar Arias is winning in Costa Rica . 
In Mexico , the presidency is up for grabs . 
In the meantime , Latin America &apos;s economies will continue to benefit from the world boom in commodity markets , elections will remain normal , and life will go on in the political middle of the road .
