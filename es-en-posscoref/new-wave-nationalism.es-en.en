New Wave Nationalism 
PARIS - Could the world be on the verge of a new period of re-ordering itself , similar to the one experienced nearly 20 years ago ? 
In the 1990 &quot; s , the fall of the Soviet empire and the brutal implosion of Yugoslavia led to a spectacular increase in the number of independent states . 
To follow the Olympic Games or the World Cup , the world had to learn to recognize new flags and new national anthems . 
Now a new wave of identity fragmentation , spanning Africa and perhaps Europe , may be approaching . 
In January , a referendum on independence is scheduled to be held in South Sudan . 
If it does actually take place , there is little doubt that it will lead to the creation of a new state within the African continent , a first since the breakup of Ethiopia in 1993 . 
Somalia , Côte d &apos;Ivoire , and even Nigeria may also give birth to new states . 
For decades , Africa &apos;s boundaries have been denounced as the artificial and arbitrary work of ignorant and cynical colonial officers , which has contributed to a long train of tribal rivalries , if not ethnic cleansings . 
The more fragile and unstable the balance , the more imperative it is to maintain the status quo . 
So , is a new Pandora &apos;s box about to be opened in Africa , freeing demons that should be contained ? 
Or is it the artificial status quo itself that has caused organized violence to explode with fateful regularity ? 
The brutal behavior of the Sudanese regime based in Khartoum has made the country &apos;s evolution towards partition both inevitable and legitimate . 
The main question now is whether partition will be held up as a model and a precedent elsewhere in Africa . 
In Côte d &apos;Ivoire , for example , former President Laurent Gbagbo takes inspiration from Zimbabwe &apos;s autocratic President Robert Mugabe , clinging to power after his clear defeat in the last presidential elections . 
As a result , the country &apos;s division on a partly ethnic and religious basis along north-south lines is no longer unthinkable ; on the contrary , it is increasingly likely . 
This trend towards identity fragmentation is not only an African phenomoenon . 
Much closer to where I write , in Europe , it affects Belgium , a country that seems resigned to live with absolute political paralysis as the price of its survival . 
But , like supporters of the Northern League in Italy , a significant number of Catalans are starting to oppose their supposedly serious , hard-working character and relative success to the &quot; laziness of the Spaniards . &quot; 
Why should they work for &quot; them &quot; ? 
And , of course , a growing number of Germans speak about the rest of Europe the way Catalans speak about Spaniards . Of course , Europe is not Africa , where violence and despair are the engines of fragmentation . 
In Europe today , if there is violence , it is only economic in nature . 
But , as the economic crisis persists - and perhaps even worsens - we may witness further explosions of populism and nationalism that could translate into a new wave of fragmentation . 
A Europe of 27 states is already very difficult to manage . 
The European Union , which is in the midst of a profound identity crisis , does not need new states , but rather new ideas and a new narrative - a qualitative , not quantitative , change . 
Of course , one can dream , as some once did , of a &quot; Europe of Regions &quot; based on the model of the city-states of Renaissance Italy . 
The American sociologist Daniel Bell once famously said that the state is too big for the small problems and too small for the big ones . 
At the same time , the quest for identity that is causing some states to fragment is pushing others to envision neo-imperial vistas . 
The imperial nature of identity in Russia , for example , is deeply ingrained . 
And Turkey , encouraged by the power vacuum that exists all around it , as well as by the obstinate resistance of most EU members to admit the Turks to their &quot; Christian club , &quot; is starting to think in neo-Ottoman terms . 
Imperial traditions never fade away completely . 
Maybe one day people will look at the first decade of the twenty-first century as the logical continuation of the last decade of the twentieth century . 
If so , ours will be an era worthy of careful study , a moment when the world was in the midst of a difficult and uncertain process of re-composition .
