Europe &apos;s Next Nightmare 
CAMBRIDGE - As if the economic ramifications of a full-blown Greek default were not terrifying enough , the political consequences could be far worse . 
A chaotic eurozone breakup would cause irreparable damage to the European integration project , the central pillar of Europe &apos;s political stability since World War II . 
It would destabilize not only the highly-indebted European periphery , but also core countries like France and Germany , which have been the architects of that project . 
The nightmare scenario would also be a 1930 &quot; s-style victory for political extremism . 
Fascism , Nazism , and communism were children of a backlash against globalization that had been building since the end of the nineteenth century , feeding on the anxieties of groups that felt disenfranchised and threatened by expanding market forces and cosmopolitan elites . 
Free trade and the gold standard had required downplaying domestic priorities such as social reform , nation-building , and cultural reassertion . 
Economic crisis and the failure of international cooperation undermined not only globalization , but also the elites that upheld the existing order . 
As my Harvard colleague Jeff Frieden has written , this paved the path for two distinct forms of extremism . 
Faced with the choice between equity and economic integration , communists chose radical social reform and economic self-sufficiency . 
Faced with the choice between national assertion and globalism , fascists , Nazis , and nationalists chose nation-building . 
Fortunately , fascism , communism , and other forms of dictatorships are pass√© today . 
But similar tensions between economic integration and local politics have long been simmering . 
Europe &apos;s single market has taken shape much faster than Europe &apos;s political community has ; economic integration has leaped ahead of political integration . 
The result is that mounting concerns about the erosion of economic security , social stability , and cultural identity could not be handled through mainstream political channels . 
National political structures became too constrained to offer effective remedies , while European institutions still remain too weak to command allegiance . 
It is the extreme right that has benefited most from the centrists &quot; failure . 
In Finland , the heretofore unknown True Finn party capitalized on the resentment around eurozone bailouts to finish a close third in April &apos;s general election . 
In the Netherlands , Geert Wilders &quot; Party for Freedom wields enough power to play kingmaker ; without its support , the minority liberal government would collapse . 
In France , the National Front , which finished second in the 2002 presidential election , has been revitalized under Marine Le Pen . 
Nor is the backlash confined to eurozone members . 
Elsewhere in Scandinavia , the Sweden Democrats , a party with neo-Nazi roots , entered parliament last year with nearly 6 % of the popular vote . 
In Britain , one recent poll indicated that as many as two-thirds of Conservatives want Britain to leave the European Union . 
Political movements of the extreme right have traditionally fed on anti-immigration sentiment . 
Their Euro-skepticism certainly appears to be vindicated by events . 
When Marine Le Pen was recently asked if she would unilaterally withdraw from the euro , she replied confidently : &quot; When I am president , in a few months &quot; time , the eurozone probably won &apos;t exist . &quot; 
As in the 1930 &quot; s , the failure of international cooperation has compounded centrist politicians &quot; inability to respond adequately to their domestic constituents &quot; economic , social , and cultural demands . 
The European project and the eurozone have set the terms of debate to such an extent that , with the eurozone in tatters , these elites &quot; legitimacy will receive an even more serious blow . 
Europe &apos;s centrist politicians have committed themselves to a strategy of &quot; more Europe &quot; that is too rapid to ease local anxieties , yet not rapid enough to create a real Europe-wide political community . 
They have stuck for far too long to an intermediate path that is unstable and beset by tensions . 
By holding on to a vision of Europe that has proven unviable , Europe &apos;s centrist elites are endangering the idea of a unified Europe itself . 
Economically , the least bad option is to ensure that the inevitable defaults and departures from the eurozone are carried out in as orderly and coordinated a fashion as possible . 
Politically , too , a similar reality check is needed . 
What the current crisis demands is an explicit reorientation away from external financial obligations and austerity to domestic preoccupations and aspirations . 
Just as healthy domestic economies are the best guarantor of an open world economy , healthy domestic polities are the best guarantor of a stable international order . 
The challenge is to develop a new political narrative emphasizing national interests and values without overtones of nativism and xenophobia . 
If centrist elites do not prove themselves up to the task , those of the far right will gladly fill the vacuum , minus the moderation . 
That is why outgoing Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou had the right idea with his aborted call for a referendum . 
That move was a belated attempt to recognize the primacy of domestic politics , even if investors viewed it , in the words of a Financial Times editor , as &quot; playing with fire . &quot; 
Scrapping the referendum simply postpones the day of reckoning and raises the ultimate costs to be paid by Greece &apos;s new leadership . 
Today , the question is no longer whether politics will become more populist and less internationalist ; it is whether the consequences of that shift can be managed without turning ugly . 
In Europe &apos;s politics , as in its economics , it seems there are no good options - only less bad ones .
