The Message from Boston 
PRINCETON - America has grown up . 
Public reaction to the Boston Marathon bombings and the identity of the perpetrators reveals a very different nation from the one reflected in the traumatized and occasionally hysterical responses to the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
The magnitude of the two attacks was , of course , very different - thousands were killed and major national landmarks destroyed in 2001 , whereas the Boston bombing killed three people and injured roughly 260 . 
Still , it was the first major attack on the United States since 2001 , and the contrast between now and then is instructive . 
Consider the social-media buzz within minutes of the bombing . 
The New York Post , a tabloid , emitted a stream of sensational reportage claiming that 12 people had been killed and that a Saudi national was &quot; under guard &quot; at a Boston hospital . 
Veteran reporters and columnists immediately countered with questions about the Post &apos;s sources and the lack of confirmation for what it was reporting . 
Kerri Miller of Minnesota Public Radio tweeted that she had covered the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 , which was first reported as a gas explosion , then as an attack by foreign terrorists , and finally as the work of domestic extremists . 
This caution and restraint stemmed directly from a collective awareness of the many innocent Muslim-Americans who suffered from Americans &quot; ignorance and wrath following the 2001 attacks . 
Indeed , equally striking was the number of pundits who suggested that the Boston bombing was homegrown , more similar to the Oklahoma City attack or the mass shooting last December of first graders in Newtown , Connecticut , than to the 2001 plot . 
The America of 2013 , unlike the America of 2001 , is willing to recognize its own pathologies before looking for enemies abroad . 
Moreover , even amid the shock and grief fueled by images of the bombing and the many victims with shattered , shredded limbs , Americans found at least a little bandwidth to comprehend that bombs are still a feature of daily life in Iraq and Syria . 
Today &apos;s America is one that recognizes that it is not the world &apos;s only country , and by no means the worst off . 
Many commentators remarked on Americans &quot; resilience , and that of Bostonians in particular . 
Much like Londoners after the attacks on their public-transport system in July 2005 , Boston &apos;s citizens were determined to prove that life goes on . 
American flags flew at half-mast ; 
But even amid a massive police manhunt and a citywide lockdown , planners were already focusing on ensuring that next year &apos;s marathon will redeem the tragedy of this one . 
Likewise , when it became clear that the bombing suspects , Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , were Chechens who had emigrated from the Russian province of Dagestan , the reaction - at least among regular participants in public debate - was far more nuanced than a decade ago . 
Back then , Fareed Zakaria &apos;s cover story for Newsweek - entitled &quot; The Politics of Rage : Why Do They Hate Us ? &quot; - painted a broad-brush portrait of Muslim youth in the Middle East raging against brutal and oppressive dictatorships funded and supported by the US government . 
Zakaria was right in many ways , but he had to bring his readers up to speed on six decades of history in a few short pages . 
By contrast , David Remnick , the editor of The New Yorker , weighed in with a piece on the Tsarnaev brothers that opened with Stalin &apos;s banishment of the Chechen people &quot; from their homeland in the northern Caucasus to Central Asia and the Siberian wastes . &quot; 
Remnick &apos;s lead-in was intended not to introduce a summary account of the brutal and violent history of the Chechen people , but to frame a detailed account of the specific history of the Tsarnaev family . 
Remnick included a series of tweets from the younger brother , Dzhokhar , only 19 , beginning with a message from March 12 , 2012 ( &quot; a decade in America already - I want out &quot; ) . In Remnick &apos;s words , the tweets show &quot; a young man &apos;s thoughts : his jokes , his resentments , his prejudices , his faith , his desires . &quot; 
Even amid Americans &quot; anger and grief at the senselessness of what the Tsarnaev brothers did , we can see them not as faceless embodiments of Islamic rage , but as individuals , as human - even as sad . 
The ability to distinguish individual features from the mass , to reach nuanced judgments , and to control initial impulses of rage and revenge are hallmarks of maturity in societies and people alike . 
But America has also grown up in another way , learning to choose transparency over secrecy , and to rely on the power of its citizens . 
After September 11 , 2001 , the security expert Stephen E. Flynn called on the government to &quot; engage the American people in the enterprise of managing threats to the nation . &quot; 
A decade later , the FBI immediately called on all who attended the Boston Marathon to send photos and videos of the area around the finish line - anything that could help investigators identify the bombers . 
The resulting flood of information enabled the authorities to identify the two suspects far sooner than would have been possible had they relied on traditional police methods . 
The US of 2013 is both more reflective than it was a decade ago and more consciously connected to the world . 
The result is a citizenry that is less likely to interpret events , even attacks , in simplistic and often counter-productive us-versus-them terms . 
The cancer of violence is all too often found within the US , fed in part by the same inequality , alienation , lack of opportunity , and fervent search for absolute truth that we discern abroad . 
The brutal repression of Chechnya , violent Islamic extremism , an American cult of violence , immigrants &quot; dashed dreams , and plenty of other factors still to be uncovered create a complex pattern of risk that is difficult to unravel and even harder to minimize . 
But seeing it clearly is an important first step .
