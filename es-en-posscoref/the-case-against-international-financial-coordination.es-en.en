The Case Against International Financial Coordination 
CAMBRIDGE - When US President Barack Obama announced in late January his intention to seek tough new rules for banks , he wasn &apos;t expecting to make friends on Wall Street . 
We will henceforth prevent banks from trading on their own account and from growing too large , Obama declared . 
The internal battle within the Obama administration seemed to have been won by Paul Volcker , the impressive and outspoken former Federal Reserve chairman who has long been a critic of financial innovation . 
Unsurprisingly , Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms are dubious about the &quot; Volcker rules . &quot; 
So , too , are the Republicans in Congress , along with some Democrats who feel that the scheme has come too late and may interfere with other reform efforts under way , as watered-down as those initiatives may be . 
Such domestic opposition weakens the prospect that Obama &apos;s proposals will ever become law . 
But the international reaction was less expected . 
Obama &apos;s announcement received a decidedly unsympathetic reception from Europeans , who perceived his initiative as a unilateral move that would undermine international coordination of financial regulation . 
The announcement had come without international consultation . 
It also seemed to violate earlier agreements to cooperate with other nations through the G-20 , the Financial Stability Board , and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision . 
At the World Economic Forum in Davos , US Congressman Barney Frank was surprised to discover that the greatest opposition to American plans came from international regulators . 
The Obama administration &apos;s proposed measures would simply create &quot; regulatory confusion , &quot; one of them complained . 
This is a widely shared concern . 
Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf accused the US of injecting &quot; new and unsettling ideas &quot; into the discussion of financial reform . 
Continental European countries like big banks , and therefore will never go along with the Volcker rules , he wrote . 
Accordingly , these reforms &quot; are going to prove inapplicable outside the US and so create difficulties of international coordination . &quot; 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the managing director of the International Monetary Fund , was uncharacteristically blunt for an international official . 
Taking direct aim at Obama &apos;s proposals , he argued that reform of the global financial system should not be driven by what each country sees fit for itself . 
&quot; We need to have coordination , &quot; he said . 
The chiefs of major European banks such as Deutsche Bank , Barclays , and Société Générale were naturally also unanimous in their hostility . Regulation that is not globally coordinated , they warned , would create unnecessary uncertainty , prolong financial distress , and threaten economic recovery . 
And oh , of course , it would cut into their profits , too ! 
Global coordination , like global governance , sounds good . 
But the practical reality is that it cannot deliver the tough regulations , closely tailored to domestic economic and political requirements , which financial markets badly need in the aftermath of the worst financial upheaval the world economy has experienced since the Great Depression . 
In a world of divided political sovereignty and diverse national preferences , the push for international harmonization is a recipe for weak and ineffective rules . 
That is one reason why international bankers love international coordination . 
Many scholars of international relations consider the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the international body of regulators charged with devising a new set of global standards , as the apogee of international rule-making . 
Yet it is surely telling that this will be the third version of its guidelines in as many decades . 
The last big idea the Basel committee had was that large banks should calibrate their capital requirement based on their own internal risk models . 
But the dangers of permitting banks to police themselves were made amply clear in the latest crisis . 
When financial regulations are devised by a coterie of global regulators in distant venues , it is bankers and technocrats who gain the upper hand . 
Returning the process to national capitals would shift the balance of power to domestic legislatures and national stakeholders . 
Bankers and their economist allies may rue this , but it is as it should be . 
Politicization is the necessary antidote to technocrats &quot; tendency to be captured by banks . Democratic accountability is our only safeguard against a return to light regulation . 
Democratic accountability would also result in regulatory diversity - different countries doing their own thing - and that is not a bad thing , either . 
If the US wants to place size limits and tighter capital requirements on banks , it should be free to do so . 
If Europe wants to devise its own rules for credit-rating agencies and hedge funds , it should simply go ahead . 
Naturally , regulatory diversity would require cross-border financial controls to ensure that banks do not evade national regulations by operating from foreign jurisdictions . 
The rule would have to be : if you want to serve my market , you must play by my rules . 
It is easy to be swayed by arguments about how costly such market fragmentation would be . 
Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann has gone so far as to warn that moving in this direction would &quot; leave us all poor . &quot; 
Regulatory diversity is indeed costly for bankers , who would have to adjust to differences in regulations across national borders . 
But the rest of us suffer from too much financial globalization , not too little . 
Some financial segmentation is a price well worth paying for stronger regulations that are solidly backed by domestic politics .
