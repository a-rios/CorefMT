Sarkozy and the Euro &apos;s Perfect Storm 
The more French president Nicolas Sarkozy attacks the European Central Bank and the strong euro , the more he is criticized in the European media , by European finance ministers , European Union officials and the ECB itself . 
The critics are right . 
The fundamental reason behind France &apos;s current economic weakness is its lack of competitiveness even in other euro-zone economies where the euro is not a factor . 
But Sarkozy has a point . 
A perfect storm is forming in the foreign exchange markets that threatens to catapult the euro to levels that will make even the euro-zone &apos;s most efficient exporter - Germany - unable to compete in world markets . 
If German exporters can &apos;t compete at 1.50 euros to the dollar , what chances do French exporters have ? 
The euro is gaining ground for several reasons . 
A precipitating factor is that the Federal Reserve has had a dramatic change of heart about the strength of the US economy . 
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is now extremely concerned that the economy &apos;s housing market and mortgage problems will cause a recession unless interest rates are aggressively cut even if this means taking some risks with inflation . 
This new &quot; no recession &quot; Fed policy has started the US dollar down the path to new lows . 
The decline will likely be sustained by the substantial US current account deficit , which found in Bernanke &apos;s cuts the spark it needed to make its impact fully felt in foreign exchange markets . 
Of course , if interest rates also were being cut in the euro-zone , the fall in the dollar against the euro would be moderated . 
This is Sarkozy &apos;s major point . 
But the ECB has made it clear not only that interest rate cuts are not on the table - it is merely postponing , not abandoning , the interest rate increase originally planned for September . 
The perfect storm is forming because both Europe and America , for different reasons , are following monetary policies that encourage the euro to rocket to dangerous levels . 
The anti-inflation hawks in Frankfurt are not at all happy with Bernanke &apos;s aggressive 50 basis point cut and the promise of more to come . 
Some are recalcitrant and are more than willing to see the euro rise because , with rate hikes off the table , the strong euro may be the only way left for fighting the incipient inflation they fear . 
But this policy is unsustainable . 
The ECB should drop its inflationary bias because the European economy is weakening , and the weaker economy will contain whatever inflationary pressures now exist . 
The anti-inflationary bias , which made sense until recently , now is seriously out of whack with current economic realities . 
But European officials - and not only the ECB -  seem very reluctant to admit that their economy is faltering , fearing that it will further weaken confidence and add to the slowdown pressures . 
Every soft number - and there have plenty lately - is given a positive spin ( &quot; euro-zone economic fundamentals remain strong &quot; or &quot; the economy remains robust &quot; )  -  and the media goes along with the deception . 
The Ifo business confidence indicator in Germany has been down four months in a row but , according to Ifo , &quot; the ECB does not have to change policy . &quot; 
The European Commission &apos;s economic index is plummeting , purchasing managers indices are down and so are German retail sales . 
Ordinary Europeans will pay a high price for their leaders self -deception and mistaken policies . 
The longer the ECB maintains its inflationary bias , the steeper the consequent economic decline as the economy crumbles under the weight of the skyrocketing euro and interest rates that are too high for current economic realities ( though lower than where the ECB hawks had planned to go before the current financial crisis hit ) . 
Ironically , the ECB will have to cut interest rates sooner , and by greater amounts , because its inflationary bias is sending the euro to dangerous levels for the current state of its economy . 
It will not do ECB credibility any good if takes an economic collapse to convince it that the coast is clear on the inflation front . 
The ECB is not the old Bundesbank , which had such public support and trust in Germany that it could get away with almost anything . 
The ECB &apos;s margin for error is much narrower - the support of its constituents less deep . 
A major policy mistake and the same public officials now criticizing Sarkozy for attacking the ECB will be joining him . 
Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty , loss of public support for the ECB will diminish its independence .
