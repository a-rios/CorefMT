Redeeming the United Nations 
For a United Nations official to discuss reform of the international system is rather like an Englishman talking about the weather : it is a staple of daily conversation , but it always seems that real change remains just over the horizon . 
On Wednesday , 166 heads of state and government will gather in New York for a summit that we hope will take the reform process a major step forward . 
Ambassadors in New York are now working day and night to hammer out the details of the current reform proposals . 
But whatever they manage to agree upon , as a long-time UN official I am conscious of how much the UN has already changed since I joined 27 years ago . 
If I had suggested to my superiors at that time that the UN would one day observe and even run elections in sovereign states , conduct intrusive inspections for weapons of mass destruction , impose comprehensive sanctions on the entire import-export trade of a member state , or set up international criminal tribunals and coerce governments into handing over their citizens to be tried by foreigners under international law , they would have told me that I did not understand what the UN was all about . 
Yet the UN has done all of these things , and more , during the last two decades . 
It has administered territory , conducted huge multi-dimensional peace-keeping operations with nearly 80,000 soldiers in the field , and deployed human rights monitors to report on the behavior of sovereign governments . 
In short , the UN has been a highly adaptable institution , one that has evolved in response to changing times . 
Today &apos;s reform imperatives can be traced to international divisions over the Iraq war . 
In the summer of 2003 , a poll conducted by the Pew Organization in 20 countries revealed that the UN &apos;s standing had declined in all of them . 
The UN &apos;s reputation suffered in the US because it did not support the Bush administration on the war - and in the 19 other countries because it was unable to prevent the war . 
We got hit from both sides of the debate and disappointed both sets of expectations . 
Some famous and rather powerful voices began to speak of the UN &apos;s irrelevance . 
It was at the peak of this unprecedentedly intense scrutiny that Secretary-General Kofi Annan seized the moment . 
In an historic speech to the General Assembly , he said that we could either continue with business as usual , potentially leading to disaster , or we could review the entire post-1945 architecture of the international system and construct a more effective structure of global governance . 
Annan named a high-level panel of eminent persons to look into issues of peace and security , while a parallel group of economists , led by Jeffrey Sachs , studied what was needed to fulfill the development commitments made by world leaders at the Millennium Summit in 2000 . 
In March , Annan synthesized their key recommendations in a report entitled In Larger Freedom . 
The title comes from the preamble to the UN charter , which speaks of striving &quot; to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom . &quot; 
By that magnificent phrase , the UN &apos;s founders meant that human rights , development , and security are mutually interdependent . 
Of course , the UN often falls short of its noble aspirations , since it reflects the realities of world politics , even while seeking to transcend them . 
At its best and at its worst , the UN is a mirror of our world : it reflects our differences and our convergences , our hopes and aspirations , and our limitations and failures . 
But the cause of political freedom has been making headway . 
When I joined the UN , it was almost unthinkable for the organization to take sides between democracy and dictatorship , or to seek to intervene in members &quot; internal affairs . 
Even on the meaning of human rights there was no universal agreement , with some states regarding them as a tool of Western neo-imperialism.Today , by contrast , the UN does more than any other single organization to promote and strengthen democratic institutions and practices around the world . 
In the past year alone , it has organized or assisted in elections in over 20 countries - often at decisive moments in their history - including Afghanistan , Palestine , Iraq , and Burundi . 
The UN is setting up a Democracy Fund to increase assistance for building democracy , and we have proposed establishing a Peace-Building Commission to help countries move from war to durable peace . 
Annan is also pressing for a more effective and credible international machinery for defending human rights . 
As we face the new challenges of our time , let us not forget the old ones , especially the persistent horror of underdevelopment . 
The combination of poverty , drought , famine , and HIV / AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa threatens more human lives than terrorism or tsunamis ever did . 
This summit must reaffirm the Millennium Development Goals and recommit the world to achieving these targets by 2015 . 
There is no longer any excuse for leaving well over a billion people in abject misery . 
As Mahatma Gandhi put it , &quot; You must be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot; 
The UN is no exception . 
To change the world , we must change too . 
The UN can be a much more effective instrument if its member states in the General Assembly and the Security Council are better organized and give clearer directives to us in the Secretariat - along with the flexibility to carry them out - and then hold us clearly accountable . 
This week &apos;s summit will be the largest single gathering of world leaders in human history . 
If world leaders rise to their responsibilities , the rebirth and renewal of the UN will be at hand . 
With its renewal , we will also renew our hope for a fairer and safer world .
