Jurassic Park for Sale 
One bright day last September , Icarosaurus , the famous fossil of a Triassic Age gliding reptile , which had exited the halls of the American Museum of Natural History a decade earlier , was brought back to New York to roost . 
Its return was a wake-up call for public education and science everywhere . 
Unless action is taken , fossils will continue to be sold to the highest bidder . 
Sad to say , the US is not the only country with this problem . 
The story begins in 1961 with three teenagers combing the New Jersey Palisades , the cliffs surrounding the Hudson River across from New York City , searching for ancient fossils . 
An old quarry was being widened and leveled , and the boys followed the bulldozers as they scraped away a stratum of earth to reveal fragile , fossil-bearing shale underneath . 
One day they found an ancient reptile with long ribs that enabled it to glide between trees . 
The boys brought the specimen to the Museum of Natural History , where its curator recognized the importance of the find and named it after one of the boys . 
Three decades later , one of them , now a man , became sick and needed money . 
He asked the Museum for compensation for the fossil . 
When his multimillion-dollar demand was refused , he spoke of legal action and claimed the specimen was only on loan to the Museum . 
The papers proved him correct . 
So the Museum let Icarosaurus go . 
The fossil was offered to the highest bidder . 
After nearly ten years , when no museum or private buyer met his price , the man put Icarosaurus up for sale at auction - a shock to the world of paleontology . 
When should individuals have the right to buy and sell such a fossil ? 
The boys who found the specimen didn &apos;t own the fossil quarry . 
So why do they have any rights to it ? 
Why does it not belong to everyone ? 
Why not put it in a public institution where scientists can study it and the public can admire it in perpetuity ? 
American policy on fossil artifacts is more benighted than those of most third world countries . 
Each year , uncounted skeletons of dinosaurs and fossil mammals and fishes are whisked through airport customs and sold to the highest bidder . 
International commercial fossil collectors flock to the American West to vacuum up duckbills , carnivores , ceratopsians , and everything that will fetch a price . 
They pay landowners for exclusive collecting rights on ranches , displacing paleontologists and ruining publicly funded research and graduate dissertations . 
Fossil bones are harvested and made into mounted skeletons , often with little regard for accuracy . 
Some are sawn and polished to be made into clock faces , gewgaws , and souvenirs . 
If these were trees , we could grow more . 
But Jurrasic Park is fiction , dinosaurs will be no more . 
Icarosaurus was rescued from the auction block by a philanthropic and conservation-minded businessman repelled by the thought that such valuable treasures could be lost to science and education . 
Such individuals should not be pivotal to preserving the natural heritage . 
The US is not alone in this problem . 
China , Argentina , Brazil , and many other countries are losing their fossil resources to marketplaces , fossil conventions , and internet dealers . 
International cooperation is one way to stem this tide ; stronger internal laws another . 
Practices vary among countries and even within them . 
In Bavaria , for example , there are no regulations on the ownership of fossils found on private land , while landowners in Baden-WÃ¼rttember are given finder &apos;s fees for important specimens , which must be turned over to the state . 
Commercial fossil collectors are trying to get US public lands - national parks and wildernesses - as open for business as private lands are . 
Why should such people control the fate of irreplaceable natural resources ? 
What are the limits of land ownership when nature &apos;s legacy is in the balance ? 
Public lands should continue to be closed to commercial exploitation . 
Valuable scientific specimens , no matter who happens to own the land , should not be at the disposition of those who see only dollar signs in nature . 
On the other hand , commercial collectors could work with scientists and the public . 
They could excavate specimens on private lands , and on public lands , too , under the supervision of scientists who know how to recover important information about what their surroundings , such as what the rocks say about the fossil when it was alive . 
Original and unique specimens would be remanded to museums for permanent care , common or incomplete specimens still be bought and sold . 
Businessmen could make casts and mounted skeletons of the specimen and market them to other museums , schools , companies , and shopping centers . 
In this way everyone benefits . 
Whether commercial collectors will agree to such a plan without legislative coercion remains to be seen . 
So scientists , educators , and the international public must hold the line against commercial exploitation of public lands , and push for laws and treaties that stop the flow of valuable fossils across international borders - both physical borders , and those of common sense .
