France Is Back In Europe , But On What Terms ? 
When Nicolas Sarkozy became President of France , he declared that his country was back in mainstream Europe . 
Since then , Sarkozy has thrown himself into the European political fray . 
His energy - combined with the negotiating talents of German Chancellor Angela Merkel - overcame antagonism toward the new reform treaty that EU leaders just ratified in Lisbon , putting the European Union back on its feet after two years of crippling indecision . 
The French must now resolve their own ambiguous attitudes about Europe , which have affected national policies for decades . 
For half a century , France has mixed two radically different approaches to Europe . 
Some French see the EU as a community where national interests inexorably converge . 
At the other extreme is the Gaullist belief that the EU is nothing more than a &quot; power multiplier &quot; for France to defend its own national interests . 
Rather than using Europe to project French ideas across the continent , France needs to develop a culture of genuine power-sharing and compromise . 
Such a sea change would have profound implications for French policies across a broad spectrum , from internal EU issues and economics to foreign policy and Europe &apos;s role in the world . 
Consider the French executive . 
The president and government ministers treat Europe as their political preserve . 
Meanwhile , other ministers circumvent government instructions to get from Brussels what has been refused in Paris . 
Clearly , a better EU policymaking system needs to be found . 
For a start , the French parliament must be given a greater role and government ministers must drop their habit of blaming Brussels whenever they want to introduce unpopular economic or social reforms . 
Sarkozy is particularly eager for France to be heard on economic policy . 
His election victory relied heavily on his plans to reform the labor market and to promote work and innovation . 
He will need to demonstrate that France no longer treats Europe as a scapegoat for its own economic troubles - a ploy that merely marginalizes France in economic debates . 
Thus , polemics against the European Central Bank &apos;s independence and the damaging effect of &quot; the high euro &quot; will have to stop . 
France &apos;s financial credentials also will have to improve if ministers &quot; views on EU monetary issues are to be taken seriously . 
For years , France has funded some of the highest public spending in Europe through budget deficits , despite its commitment to balance the books as part of the EU &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact . 
Many EU members fear that Sarkozy &apos;s government will again break French budget promises , as his demands for growth-boosting tax cuts imply pushing back the deadline for eliminating France &apos;s deficit until 2012 . 
Similarly , French prudence will be under scrutiny during discussions of a new European financial framework , which will test France &apos;s capacity to view EU budgets as something other than a means of redistributing EU cash , particularly to farmers . 
The Common Agricultural Policy still accounts for more than 40 % of Community expenditure , even though the farm sector accounts for only 2 % of employment . 
As for global security , it is clear that EU countries can exert international influence only when they speak with one voice . 
France must sort out its relations with NATO and the role it intends to play in transatlantic forums . 
French and German disagreements with the United States in 2003 generated deep divisions in the EU . 
Next , France and the EU must find a new model for dealing with Russia . 
Here , the Union is confronted with a dilemma . 
Does it consider Russia a powerful partner or a hostile neighbor ? 
If France wants to take the lead on EU relations with Moscow , it must become far more sensitive to eastern and central European fears about Russia . 
French politicians underestimate the negative impact they have in these countries when they repeatedly refer to a Paris-Berlin-Moscow axis and criticize &quot; excessive &quot; enthusiasm for the transatlantic alliance . 
Sarkozy will need to take all this into account if he wants France to play a full part in shaping the EU &apos;s future . 
France &apos;s elites need to own up to the mistakes of the past and find better ways to confront today &apos;s challenges . 
Ordinary French people also have much to consider : our attitudes toward the market , our relations with the rest of Europe , and our views about the world beyond the EU &apos;s borders . 
If we come to terms with today &apos;s complex realities , France could be back in Europe .
