Last Tango in Argentina ? 
BUENOS AIRES - Argentina and economic crisis , it can sometimes seem , have been conjoined since the country &apos;s birth , like Siamese twins . 
In fact , Argentina is the only developed country that has succeeded , in the period from World War II until today , in mismanaging its way out of the First World . 
But , for all their failings , Argentina &apos;s ruling elites have never been short on &quot; attitude , &quot; viewing their country as the equal of the world &apos;s strongest , and thus never afraid to stand up to them all . 
It is fighting words in Buenos Aires , for instance , to suggest that Argentine soccer is not the best in the world , though it has managed to win the World Cup only twice , behind Brazil ( five ) , Italy ( four ) , and Germany ( three ) - and matched by its tiny neighbor , Uruguay . 
While many experts , players , and fans rank Brazil &apos;s Pelé as the best soccer player of all time , it is wise not to dispute the local insistence that either Maradona or Lionel Messi , two local boys , is better . 
Recently , in a taxi in Hong Kong , of all places , a young tango dancer from Buenos Aires was visibly agitated at his host when Brazilian football was put ahead of his country &apos;s game . 
Such bravura , or chutzpah , has enabled current President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to insist that inflation in Argentina - currently rampaging well above 20 % - remains in the single digits . 
In 2007 , Fernández replaced professional statisticians at the National Statistics and Censuses Institute with political appointees when the Institute began to publish inflation rates that were accelerating alarmingly . 
Ever since , official numbers and reality have parted ways . 
Moreover , academic and private-sector economists have been warned that publishing different figures could result in criminal prosecution for spreading false rumors . 
In fact , one academic was fined $ 125,000 for publishing inflation figures that were substantially higher than official data indicated . 
Of course , when you control the official statistics office , you can claim any inflation rate you want ; but that does not lower the price of bread . 
Anyone who buys food in supermarkets or uses a taxi knows that the true rate of annual inflation over the past several years has been 20-30 % . 
Clearly , the market has reached its own verdict , reflected in the gap between the official exchange rate of 4.6 Argentine pesos to the dollar and the black-market rate , which recently reached 6.8 , with some economists whispering that an eight-peso dollar is likely before too long . 
Not only has Argentina repudiated the $ 100 billion in foreign debt on which it defaulted a decade ago ; it has also shrugged off criticism of its expropriation in April of the Spanish oil company Repsol . 
Argentina has offered to compensate the company at &quot; fair &quot; market value , to be determined at some future date - presumably when the floor has dropped out of Repsol &apos;s share price , which initially plunged nearly 60 % from its previous high , and is still down 40 % . 
Even as evidence of economic crisis continues to mount - the latest sign being that supermarket shoppers are limited to one bottle of cooking oil per customer - the government gives no indication of concern . 
The authorities have defied the International Monetary Fund , defaulted on debts , and proudly proclaimed that Argentina has transcended traditional economics . 
The government is still &quot; negotiating &quot; with the IMF on how best to collect , measure , and report inflation , as if this were not done routinely by trained statisticians throughout the world . 
Argentina &apos;s prideful attitude may have led it to become a second-rate economy , but the same attitude has served it well in its one great and unique contribution to world culture : tango , recognized by UNESCO as part of the world &apos;s &quot; intangible cultural heritage . &quot; 
Year after year at the annual World Tango Competition , Argentine dancers dominate the top ranks of Stage Tango , more glamorous and difficult than the other category , Salon Tango . 
This year was no different . 
Dancing tango well is not just a matter of technical skill , which can be learned by others . 
The Japanese are unequaled masters of such skills , and have been competing since the beginning of international tango competitions in 2003 . 
In 2009 , a Japanese couple , Hiroshi and Kyoko Yamao , made history by winning the championship in Salon Tango , in which a loving connection between the dancers is more important than a haughty attitude . 
In Stage Tango , where that attitude is paramount , only once has a Japanese woman , Chizuko Kuwamoto , managed to reach the top - and only by dancing with an Argentine partner . 
Juan Fabbri , the owner of Tango Porteno and Esquina Carlos Gardel , the two most expensive and important tango clubs in Buenos Aires , believes that what foreigners ( including me , a student of tango for years ) are missing is the &quot; El Cachafaz &quot; factor . 
El Cachafaz was the nickname of a legendary early-twentieth-century dancer - José &quot; Benito &quot; Bianquet . 
The word , from the ghetto dialect of &quot; lunfardo , &quot; evokes &quot; impudence , danger , manliness , mischief , and shamelessness . &quot; 
Mario Morales , a top tango choreographer , who has trained a string of tango champions , put it to me slightly differently . 
&quot; To dance tango well , you need corazon ( heart ) and passion . 
Foreigners are more circumspect . 
That insight arguably provides the best explanation of why Argentina excels at tango - and why it is failing to remain in the First World , where it once belonged .
