Can the Sun Save Greece ? 
BRUSSELS - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has proposed that developing green-energy resources could be a good way for Greece to generate much-needed economic growth . 
On paper , it sounds like a perfect solution to the country &apos;s dire fiscal problems : Greece , according to Schäuble , could export solar electricity to Germany . 
At first glance , monetizing an abundant natural resource ( solar energy ) to strengthen the national accounts sounds like a straightforward idea , particular given that electricity in central and northern Europe is becoming more scarce and expensive , owing to Germany &apos;s decision earlier this year to phase out nuclear power . 
Yes and no . 
First , the bad news : electricity currently produced in photovoltaic installations is far from price competitive with conventional technologies . 
&quot; Grid parity &quot; - meaning that the cost of electricity produced by a rooftop solar panel is equal to that of electricity from the wall socket - will only be reached in the middle of this decade . 
Even then , solar power will still be more expensive than conventionally produced electricity , because &quot; grid parity &quot; excludes transmission and distribution costs , which typically account for about half of the final electricity price . 
Moreover , even if solar power were competitive , exporting it to Germany would not make economic sense : the required transmission lines do not exist , and the power losses incurred in transporting electricity over long distances is a disincentive to building them . 
Indeed , electricity prices in Germany are not systematically higher than in Greece , which nowadays is an electricity importer . 
As a result , Greek solar electricity would , above all else , merely replace more expensive conventional generation in Greece . 
Even the reduced need for fuel imports ( a quarter of Greece &apos;s electricity is produced from oil and gas ) would not have a large impact on the Greek current account . 
After all , because solar panels are unlikely to be produced domestically , they will have to be imported . 
The problem , in a nutshell , is that solar-electricity production does not promise high returns . 
It is very capital-intensive , and only a relatively small number of jobs would be created ( for mounting the panels ) . 
Even if Greece were able to produce surplus solar electricity , exports would yield little revenue , because standardized technology means that companies and countries can develop almost no productivity advantage . 
As soon as solar electricity becomes competitive in Greece , other countries with similar levels of irradiation ( Spain , Italy , Portugal , Bulgaria , etc . ) will enter the market . 
But , while Greece cannot reasonably hope that large-scale deployment of photovoltaic systems will turn it into the Saudi Arabia of solar electricity , Schäuble is right to point out that producing it in Greece makes more sense than producing it in Germany . 
Indeed , German support for solar power is aimed at lowering the cost of solar panels , which is the main justification for paying a high feed-in price ( currently about € 200 / MWh , compared to current electricity prices of roughly € 55 / MWh ) . 
Of course , whether the cost is lowered does not depend on where the deployment takes place : using German money to support solar deployment in sunny Greece would be more efficient than using it to support deployment in gloomier Germany . 
A photovoltaic system installed in Greece would be able to cover a higher share of its cost , thus requiring fewer subsidies . 
The best way to ensure that German money and the Greek sun support the development of solar-energy technology would be to implement a European &quot; green certificate system . &quot; 
Under such a system , every European electricity supplier would have to guarantee that a certain share of the electricity that it sells comes from renewable energy sources . 
Suppliers &quot; targets could be differentiated , reflecting countries &quot; varying potential for deploying renewables or developing renewable-technology industries . 
The countries that are able to deploy more renewables ( for example , Greece ) could then sell the certificates to countries that need more of them ( say , Germany ) .
