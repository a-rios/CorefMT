A Marshall Plan for the Arab World 
ROME - US President Barack Obama &apos;s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe . 
Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective , as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe &apos;s division , can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings . 
The crisis in Europe &apos;s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences - for the region , for Europe , and for the world . 
The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe &apos;s peace , stability , and economic growth . 
The continent &apos;s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner . 
Current events , not just in Libya , but also in Tunisia , Egypt , Syria , Yemen , and Bahrain , mirror the political complexity of these countries . 
They also spring from different factors , such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption , coupled with demands for greater democratization , reduction of economic and social inequalities , and job creation . 
Europe &apos;s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition . 
Proposals for some sort of &quot; partnership for transformation , &quot; based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms , should bear in mind that the region &apos;s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months . 
No surprise , then , that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans . 
Chaos , a resurgence of terrorism , the rise of radical Islamism , and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated . 
Given this , the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region &apos;s security . 
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe &apos;s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability , the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs . 
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia - and possibly a peaceful Libya - to strengthen their political stability through democratization . 
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing . 
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace . 
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage . 
The broad planks of a partnership are already there , so what is now needed is to enhance Europe &apos;s integration with its southern neighbors . 
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU &quot; Plan for the Mediterranean &quot; aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources . 
The Union for the Mediterranean , launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008 , must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) . 
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services . 
Let us , together with the US , tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies . 
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU &apos;s internal market and participate in EU programs . 
To achieve all of this , a clear set of principles is required . 
We Europeans must favor stability , create a real spirit of co-ownership , and promote political responsibility.In this new framework , the EU should avoid excessive conditionality , especially during the transition period . 
Europe &apos;s strong support for the region &apos;s economic development must remain the top priority , as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms . 
Moreover , a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task . 
One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank &apos;s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership ( FEMIP ) , which would become an autonomous institution , perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa , with shares held by the region &apos;s governments ( or other institutions ) and other willing parties . 
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region , which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises . 
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe ; there &apos;s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean . 
At the same time , the EU must launch a &quot; dialogue among equals &quot; on political and security matters , aimed at confidence-building across the region . 
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East ( CSCM ) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development . 
In short , we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability . 
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of &quot; mare nostrum . &quot; 
They are part of our collective history , and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build .
