The False Promise of Green Jobs 
COPENHAGEN - Political rhetoric has shifted away from the need to respond to the &quot; generational challenge &quot; of climate change . 
Investment in alternative energy technologies like solar and wind is no longer peddled on environmental grounds . 
Instead , we are being told of the purported economic payoffs , above all , the promise of so-called &quot; green jobs . &quot; 
Unfortunately , that does not measure up to economic reality . 
The Copenhagen Consensus Center asked Gürcan Gülen , a senior energy economist at the Center for Energy Economics , Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin , to assess the &quot; state of the science &quot; in defining , measuring , and predicting the creation of green jobs . 
Gülen concluded that job creation &quot; cannot be defended as another benefit &quot; of well-meaning green policies . 
In fact , the number of jobs that these policies create is likely to be offset - or worse - by the number of jobs that they destroy . 
On the face of it , green-job creation seems straightforward . 
Deploying more wind turbines and solar panels creates a need for more builders , technicians , tradespeople , and specialist employees . 
Voilà : simply by investing in green policies , we have not only helped the climate , but also lowered unemployment . 
Indeed , this is the essence of many studies that politicians are eagerly citing . 
So what did those analyses get wrong ? 
In some cases , Gülen finds that proponents of green jobs have not distinguished between construction jobs ( building the wind turbines ) , which are temporary , and longer-term operational jobs ( keeping the wind turbines going ) , which are more permanent . 
Moreover , sometimes advocates have assumed , without justification , that the new jobs would pay more than careers in conventional energy . 
In other cases , the definition of a &quot; green &quot; job is so fuzzy that it becomes virtually useless . 
If a sustainability adviser quits a concrete factory and goes to work instead for a renewable energy project , can we really conclude that the number of green jobs has actually increased ? 
More disturbing is Gülen &apos;s finding that some claims of job creation have rested on assumptions of green-energy production that go far beyond reputable estimates . 
Of course , if you assume that vast swaths of the countryside will be covered in wind turbines and solar panels , you will inevitably predict that a large number of construction jobs will be required . 
But the biggest problem in these analyses is that they often fail to recognize the higher costs or job losses that these policies will cause . 
Alternative energy sources such as solar and wind create significantly more expensive fuel and electricity than traditional energy sources . 
Increasing the cost of electricity and fuel will hurt productivity , reduce overall employment , and cut the amount of disposable income that people have . 
Yet many studies used by advocates of green jobs have not addressed these costs at all - overlooking both the cost of investment and the price hikes to be faced by end users . 
The companies calling for political intervention to create green jobs tend to be those that stand to gain from subsidies and tariffs . 
But , because these policies increase the cost of fuel and electricity , they imply layoffs elsewhere , across many different economic sectors . 
Once these effects are taken into account , the purported increase in jobs is typically wiped out , and some economic models show lower overall employment . 
Despite a significant outlay , government efforts to create green jobs could end up resulting in net job losses . 
Even if that is true , proponents might argue , investment in green jobs is nonetheless a good way to stimulate a sluggish economy . 
But Gülen shows that there are many other economic sectors , such as healthcare , that could actually create more jobs for the same amount of government investment . 
In addition to job creation , some researchers have blithely claimed that all sorts of other economic benefits will accrue from investment in alternative energy , including increased productivity , higher disposable incomes , and lower operating costs for businesses . 
Here , too , Gülen concludes that the assertions are &quot; not backed up by any evidence and are inconsistent with the realities of green technologies and energy markets . &quot; 
The fundamental problem is that green-energy technologies are still very inefficient and expensive compared to fossil fuels . 
Deploying less efficient , more expensive alternative-energy sources will hurt businesses and consumers , not help them . 
In order for the whole planet to make a sustainable shift away from fossil fuels , we need to make low-carbon energy both cheaper and more efficient . 
That requires a substantial increase in research and development into next-generation green-energy alternatives . 
Today &apos;s research budgets are tiny , and that desperately needs to change . 
In the meantime , the public should be cautious of politicians &quot; claims that deploying today &apos;s inefficient , expensive technology will result in windfall benefits at no cost .
