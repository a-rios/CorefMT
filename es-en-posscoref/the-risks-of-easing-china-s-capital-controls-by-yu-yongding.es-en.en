The Temptation of China &apos;s Capital Account 
BEIJING - Despite fluctuations , China &apos;s overall economic growth has been stable over the last three decades , owing not only to the economy &apos;s strong fundamentals , but also to the government &apos;s successful management of cross-border capital flows . 
Capital controls enabled China to emerge from the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 largely unscathed , even though its financial system was at least as fragile as those of the affected countries . 
The Asian financial crisis persuaded China &apos;s leaders to shelve plans , launched in 1994 , to liberalize the capital account . 
In 2002 , China reinitiated liberalization efforts , lifting restrictions on Chinese enterprises &quot; ability to open foreign-currency bank accounts , and allowing residents both to open foreign-currency accounts and to convert the renminbi equivalent of $ 50,000 annually into foreign currencies . 
The authorities also introduced the &quot; qualified domestic institutional investors &quot; ( QDII ) program to enable residents to invest in foreign assets - one of many initiatives aimed at easing upward pressure on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate by encouraging capital outflows . 
At the same time , the &quot; qualified foreign institutional investors &quot; ( QFII ) scheme allowed licensed foreign entities to invest in domestic capital markets . 
In early 2012 , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) released a report calling for policymakers to take advantage of a &quot; strategic opportunity &quot; to accelerate capital-account liberalization . 
Shortly after the release , QFII quotas were relaxed significantly . 
In fact , such an acceleration has been underway since the government initiated renminbi internationalization in 2009 . 
Although currency internationalization is not tantamount to capital-account liberalization , progress on the former presupposes progress on the latter . 
By allowing enterprises to choose currencies for trade settlement , and creating renminbi &quot; recycling mechanisms , &quot; the government effectively eased the restrictions on short-term cross-border capital flows . 
Most economists in China seem to support the PBOC &apos;s stance , citing the potential benefits of capital-account liberalization . 
But Chinese policymakers should also recognize the significant risks inherent in relaxing capital controls . 
First , China needs capital controls to retain monetary-policy independence until it is ready to adopt a floating exchange-rate regime . 
As Barry Eichengreen has pointed out in the context of the post-WWII Bretton Woods system , capital controls weaken &quot; the link between domestic and foreign economic policies , providing governments room to pursue other objectives . &quot; 
Because capital controls capped &quot; the resources that the markets could bring to bear against an exchange-rate peg , &quot; they &quot; limited the steps that governments had to take in its defense . &quot; 
With current- and capital-account surpluses , the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate is still under upward pressure . 
Without adequate controls on short-term cross-border capital inflows , the PBOC will find it difficult to maintain monetary-policy independence and exchange-rate stability at the same time . 
Second , China &apos;s financial system is fragile , and its economic structure rigid . 
Hence , the Chinese economy is highly vulnerable to capital flight . 
In recent years , China &apos;s financial vulnerability has been rising , with enterprise debt estimated to exceed 120 % of GDP , and broad money supply ( M2 ) amounting to more than 180 % of GDP . 
At the beginning of 2012 , China &apos;s concerns centered on local-government debt , underground credit networks , and real-estate bubbles . 
Now , growth in shadow-banking activities has been added to the list . 
Without capital controls , an unforeseen shock could trigger large-scale capital flight , leading to significant currency devaluation , skyrocketing interest rates , bursting asset bubbles , bankruptcy and default for financial and non-financial enterprises , and , ultimately , the collapse of China &apos;s financial system . 
A third reason to go slow on easing capital controls is that China &apos;s economic reforms remain incomplete , with property rights not yet clearly defined . 
Amid ambiguity over ownership and pervasive corruption , the free flow of capital across borders would encourage money laundering and asset-stripping , which would incite social tension . 
Finally , with more than $ 3.3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , China is a particularly attractive target for international speculators . 
Owing to its underdeveloped financial system and inefficient capital markets , China would be unable to withstand an attack akin to those that triggered the Asian financial crisis without the protection of capital controls . 
Already , even without a major speculative attack , the exchange-rate and interest-rate arbitrage facilitated by renminbi internationalization have imposed significant losses on China . 
To be sure , a cautious approach should not be allowed to impede incremental progress toward capital-account liberalization . 
But a broad framework for determining the timing of each policy step , based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis , is essential . 
While some measures that the PBOC has taken under the banner of capital-account liberalization have turned out to be both necessary and appropriately moderate , others may need to be reassessed and rescinded . 
Today , as all major developed economies resort to expansionary monetary policy , the global economy is being flooded with excess liquidity , and a &quot; currency war &quot; is looming large . 
As a result , short-term capital inflows , whether seeking a safe haven or conducting carry trades , are bound to become larger and more volatile . 
In these circumstances , with China &apos;s financial system too fragile to withstand external shocks , and the global economy mired in turmoil , the PBOC would be unwise to gamble on the ability of rapid capital-account liberalization to generate a healthier and more robust financial system . 
On the contrary , policymakers should tread carefully in their pursuit of financial liberalization . 
Given China &apos;s extensive reform agenda , further opening of the capital account can wait ; and , in view of liberalization &apos;s ambiguous benefits and significant risks , it should .
