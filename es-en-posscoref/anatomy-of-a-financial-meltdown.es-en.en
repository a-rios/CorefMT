Anatomy of a Financial Meltdown 
NEW YORK - A vicious circle is currently underway in the United States , and its reach could broaden to the global economy . 
America &apos;s financial crisis has triggered a severe credit crunch that is making the US recession worse , while the deepening recession is leading to larger losses in financial markets - thus undermining the wider economy . 
There is now a serious risk of a systemic meltdown in US financial markets as huge credit and asset bubbles collapse . 
The problem is no longer merely sub-prime mortgages , but rather a &quot; sub-prime &quot; financial system . 
The housing recession - the worst in US history and worsening every day - will eventually see house prices fall by more than 20 % , with millions of Americans losing their homes . 
Delinquencies , defaults , and foreclosures are now spreading from sub-prime to near-prime and prime mortgages . 
Thus , total losses on mortgage-related instruments - include exotic credit derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) - will add up to more than $ 400 billion . 
Moreover , commercial real estate is beginning to follow the downward trend in residential real estate . 
After all , who wants to build offices , stores , and shopping centers in the empty ghost towns that litter the American West ? 
In addition to the downturn in real estate , a broader bubble in consumer credit is now collapsing : as the US economy slips into recession , defaults on credit cards , auto loans , and student loans will increase sharply . 
US consumers are shopped-out , savings-less , and debt-burdened . 
With private consumption representing more than 70 % of aggregate US demand , cutbacks in household spending will deepen the recession . 
We can also add to these financial risks the massive problems of bond insurers that guaranteed many of the risky securitization products such as CDOs . 
A very likely downgrade of these insurers &quot; credit ratings will force banks and financial institutions that hold these risky assets to write them down , adding another $ 150 billion to the financial system &apos;s mounting losses . 
Then there is the exposure of banks and other financial institutions to rising losses on loans that financed reckless leveraged buy-outs ( LBOs ) . 
With a worsening recession , many LBOs that were loaded with too much debt and not enough equity will fail as firms with lower profits or higher losses become unable to service their loans . 
Given all this , the recession will lead to a sharp increase in corporate defaults , which had been very low over the last two years , averaging 0.6 % per year , compared to an historic average of 3.8 % . 
During a typical recession , the default rate among corporations may rise to 10-15 % , threatening massive losses for those holding risky corporate bonds . 
As a result , the market for credit default swaps ( CDS ) Â­ - where protection against corporate defaults is bought and sold - may also experience massive losses . 
In that case , there will also be a serious risk that some firms that sold protection will go bankrupt , triggering further losses for buyers of protection when their counterparties cannot pay . 
On top of all this , there is a shadow financial system of non-bank financial institutions that , like banks , borrow short and liquid and lend to or invest in longer-term and illiquid assets . 
This shadow system includes structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) , conduits , money market funds , hedge funds , and investment banks . 
Like banks , all these financial institutions are subject to liquidity or rollover risk - the risk of going belly up if their creditors do not rollover their short-term credit lines . 
But , unlike banks , they do not have the safety net implied by central banks &quot; role as lender of last resort . 
Now that a recession is underway , US and global stock markets are beginning to fall : in a typical US recession , the S P 500 index falls by an average of 28 % as corporate revenues and profits sink . 
Losses in stock markets have a double effect : they reduce households &quot; wealth and lead them to spend less ; and they cause massive losses to investors who borrowed to invest in stock , thus triggering margin calls and asset fire sales . 
There is thus a broader risk that many leveraged investors in both equity and credit markets will be forced to sell illiquid assets in illiquid markets , leading to a cascading fall in asset prices to below their fundamental values . 
The ensuing losses will aggravate the financial turmoil and economic contraction . 
Indeed , adding up all these losses in financial markets , the sum will hit a staggering $ 1 trillion . 
Tighter credit rationing will then further hamper the ability of households and firms to borrow , spend , invest , and sustain economic growth . 
The risk that a systemic financial crisis will drive a more pronounced US and global recession has quickly gone from being a theoretical possibility to becoming an increasingly plausible scenario .
