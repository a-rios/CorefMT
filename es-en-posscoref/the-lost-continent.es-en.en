The Lost Continent 
LONDON - Home to one-sixth of the world &apos;s people , but contributing only one-fortieth of world GDP , Africa is the most conspicuous victim of the global recession . 
After a half-decade of 5 % growth , the continent &apos;s growth rate is expected to halve in 2009 . 
Some countries , like Angola , are contracting . 
Elsewhere , the crisis has swept away the benefits of several years of economic reform . 
Many Africans will fall back into desperate poverty . 
Development economists wring their hands in despair : Africa defies their best efforts to create a miracle . 
On the eve of decolonization in 1960 , real GDP per head in Sub-Saharan Africa was almost three times higher than in Southeast Asia , and Africans were expected to live two years longer on average . 
In the 50 years since , African real GDP per head grew by 38 % and people lived nine years longer , while in Southeast Asia GDP per head grew by 1000 % and people lived 32 years longer . 
At first , the solution for Africa &apos;s under-development seemed obvious . 
Africa needed capital , but lacked savings . 
Therefore , money had to be provided from outside - by institutions like the World Bank . 
Since extracting commercial interest rates from starving people seemed like usury , the loans had to be offered on a concessionary basis - in effect , aid . 
Throwing money at poverty became a panacea . 
It was easy to sell , and it appealed to people &apos;s humanitarian instincts . 
It also assuaged the guilt of colonialism , as with parents who give their children expensive gifts to make up for neglecting or mistreating them . 
But it did no good . 
Most aid was stolen or wasted . 
Despite the eight-fold increase in aid per head to the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1960 and 2007 , real GDP per head decreased by two-thirds in the same period . 
&quot; Trade not Aid &quot; became the new watchword . 
Spearheaded by the economist Peter Bauer in the 1980 &quot; s , it became the nostrum of the Washington Consensus . 
Africa , it was fashionable to say , would catch up only if it deregulated its economies and embraced export-led growth like the &quot; miracle &quot; economies of East Asia . 
Advisers from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund told African governments to stop subsidizing &quot; national champions &quot; and drop their trade barriers . 
Provision of a reduced volume of aid was to be conditioned on dismantling the public sector . 
By 1996 , only 1 % of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa was civil servants , compared to 3 % in other developing regions and 7 % in the OECD . 
Yet despite the rollback of the state , Africa has not made the leap to prosperity . 
In a complete affront to economic theory , the little capital there is in Africa is fleeing the continent to be invested in already capital-rich societies . 
The problem with Africa , economists then started to say , was that it lacked effective states . 
Many countries had &quot; failed &quot; states that could not provide even the minimum conditions of security and health . 
With 15 % of the world &apos;s population , sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 88 % of the world &apos;s conflict-related deaths and 65 % of AIDS victims . 
What historians have known for 2,000 years - and what the eighteenth century &apos;s classical economists also knew - suddenly struck the new breed of mathematical economists in the 1990 &quot; s like a flash of lightning : prosperity depends on good government . 
So how to get good government ? 
Restoring or securing it conjures up the dreaded specter of colonialism . 
After all , for all its other failings , colonialism provided the essential precondition of economic development : peace and security . 
The development discussion today is essentially about how such preconditions of poverty reduction and economic growth can be achieved without colonialism . 
The most interesting contemporary contribution is by the Oxford economist Paul Collier . 
He argues that many African states have fallen into one or several development traps that are extremely difficult to escape . 
Moreover , once a country is mired in one of them , it is easy to fall into the next . 
Being poor makes you prone to conflict , and being in conflict makes you poor . 
So what hope is there for a poor country torn by civil war ? 
Citing the British mission to Sierra Leone , Collier argues for military intervention , when feasible , to secure peace . 
He supports international involvement to enforce post-conflict peace . 
But ongoing international assistance should be limited to providing voluntary good-governance templates . 
Frameworks for how governments should make public spending transparent or how foreign resource-extracting companies should report their profits would make yardstick comparisons easier for local political activists , as well as providing a source of legitimacy for the government . 
The much-discussed Kimberly Process is a pilot project . 
Diamond companies volunteer not to buy from conflict areas in an attempt to prevent diamonds from funding warlords . 
This would be good for business , as affluent Western customers are now put off by the thought of buying blood-soaked jewelry . 
Regional integration has featured prominently only in the last 50 years in Europe , but it has already resulted in a host of political and economic benefits to Europeans . 
Considerable evidence indicates that integration could be beneficial for Africa as well , given a framework suitable for African conditions . 
This is a project worth supporting . 
Other efforts worthy of attention include formalizing the huge informal economy in states such as Ghana . 
Typically , these are projects that employ international expertise under domestically issued mandates . 
It is a sign of the poverty of development economics that proposals such as these are regarded as cutting edge . 
However , as long as there is a roadblock every 14 kilometers between Lagos and Abidjan - two of West Africa &apos;s leading cities - progress on the ground will be slow . 
With refugees spilling over borders , pirates hijacking ships , and terrorists finding shelter , it is clear that , although Africa &apos;s solutions are its own , its problems are not . 
The rest of the world can no longer afford Africa &apos;s poverty . 
But the evidence of 50 years of failed efforts is that it hasn &apos;t a clue what to do about it .
