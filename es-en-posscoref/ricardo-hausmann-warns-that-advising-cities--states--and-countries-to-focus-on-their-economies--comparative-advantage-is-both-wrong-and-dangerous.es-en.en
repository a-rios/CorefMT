The Specialization Myth 
CAMBRIDGE - Some ideas are intuitive . 
Others sound so obvious after they are expressed that it is hard to deny their truth . 
They are powerful , because they have many nonobvious implications . 
They put one in a different frame of mind when looking at the world and deciding how to act on it . 
One such idea is the notion that cities , regions , and countries should specialize . 
Because they cannot be good at everything , they must concentrate on what they are best at - that is , on their comparative advantage . 
They should make a few things very well and exchange them for other goods that are made better elsewhere , thus exploiting the gains from trade . 
But , while some ideas are intuitive or obvious , they can also be wrong and dangerous . 
As is often the case , it is not what you don &apos;t know , but what you mistakenly think you know , that hurts you . 
And the idea that cities and countries actually do specialize , and that therefore they should specialize , is one of those very wrong and dangerous ideas . 
When an idea is both intuitively true and actually false , it is often because it is true on one level but not on the level at which it is being applied . 
Yes , people do specialize , and they should specialize , too . 
Everyone benefits from each of us becoming good at different things and exchanging our knowhow with others . 
It is not efficient for a dentist and a lawyer , for example , to be the same person . 
But specialization at the individual level actually leads to diversification at a higher level . 
It is precisely because individuals and firms specialize that cities and countries diversify . 
Consider a rural medical facility and a major city hospital . 
The former probably has a single general practitioner who is able to provide a limited suite of services . 
In the latter , doctors specialize in different areas ( oncology , cardiology , neurology , and so on ) , which enables the hospital to offer a more diverse set of interventions . 
Specialization of doctors leads to diversification of hospital services . 
The scale at which specialization of individuals leads to diversification is the city . 
Larger cities are more diversified than smaller cities . 
Among cities with similar populations - say , Salvador and Curitiba in Brazil , or Guadalajara and Monterrey in Mexico - more diversified cities are richer than less diversified cities . 
They tend to grow faster and become even more diversified , not only because they have a larger internal market , but also because they are more diversified in terms of what they can sell to other cities and countries . 
What is true at the level of cities is even more applicable at the level of states and countries . 
The Netherlands , Chile , and Cameroon have a similar population size , but the Netherlands is twice as rich as Chile , which is 10 times richer than Cameroon . 
Looking at their exports shows that the Netherlands is three times more diversified than Chile , which is three times more diversified than Cameroon . 
As my colleagues and I recently argued , one way to understand this is to think of industries as stitching together complementary bits of knowhow , just as words are made by putting together letters . 
With a greater diversity of letters , the variety of words that can be made increases , as does their length . 
Likewise , the more bits of knowhow that are available , the more industries can be supported and the greater their complexity can be . 
Cities are the places where people that have specialized in different areas congregate , allowing industries to combine their knowhow . 
Rich cities are characterized by a more diverse set of skills that support a more diverse and complex set of industries - and thus provide more job opportunities to the different specialists . 
In the process of development , cities , states , and countries do not specialize ; they diversify . 
They evolve from supporting a few simple industries to sustaining an increasingly diverse set of more complex industries . 
Achieving this implies solving important coordination problems , because an industry that is new to a city will not find workers with industry experience or specialized suppliers . 
But policymakers can do a lot to solve these coordination problems . 
This is why the idea that cities , states , or countries should specialize in their current areas of comparative advantage is so dangerous . 
Focusing on the limited activities at which they currently excel would merely reduce the variety of capabilities - or &quot; letters &quot; - that they have . 
The challenge is not to pick a few winners among the existing industries , but rather to facilitate the emergence of more winners by broadening the business ecosystem and enabling it to nurture new activities . 
This is all the more important today , because the globalization of value chains is delocalizing supplier-customer relations . 
Cities and countries would be ill-advised to focus on a few &quot; clusters &quot; and consolidate the value chains in their location , as is so often recommended . 
Instead , they should worry about being a node in many different value chains , which requires finding other industries that can use their existing capabilities if they were somehow expanded and adjusted to new needs . 
Competition inevitably tends to winnow out the less efficient firms and industries . 
It is not the policymakers &quot; role to hasten their death . 
Their task is to identify productivity-enhancing interventions that can harness economies of agglomeration by adding new activities and productive capabilities , making the whole bigger than the sum of the parts .
