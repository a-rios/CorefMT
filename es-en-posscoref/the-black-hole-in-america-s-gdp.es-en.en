The Black Hole in America &apos;s GDP 
CAMBRIDGE - The massive downturn in American &apos;s economy will last longer and be more damaging than previous recessions , because it is driven by an unprecedented loss of household wealth . 
Although the fiscal stimulus package that President Obama recently signed will give a temporary boost to activity sometime this summer , the common forecast that a sustained recovery will begin in the second half of 2009 will almost certainly prove to be overly optimistic . 
Previous recessions were often characterized by excess inventory accumulation and overinvestment in business equipment . 
The economy could bounce back as those excesses were absorbed over time , making room for new investment . 
Those recoveries were also helped by interest rate reductions by the central bank . 
This time , however , the fall in share prices and in home values has destroyed more than $ 12 trillion of household wealth in the United States , an amount equal to more than 75 % of GDP . 
Previous reactions to declines in household wealth indicate that such a fall will cut consumer spending by about $ 500 billion every year until wealth is restored . 
While a higher household saving rate will help to rebuild wealth , it would take more than a decade of relatively high saving rates to restore what was lost . 
The decline in housing construction has added to the current shortfall in aggregate demand . 
The annual number of housing starts has fallen by 1.2 million units , cutting annual GDP by an additional $ 250 billion . 
While this will eventually turn around as the inventory of unsold homes shrinks , the recovery will be slow . 
So the US economy faces a $ 750 billion shortfall of demand . 
Moreover , the usual automatic stabilizers of unemployment benefits and reduced income tax collections will do nothing to offset this fall in demand , because it is not caused by lower earnings or increased unemployment . 
Although the recently enacted two-year stimulus package includes a total of $ 800 billion of tax reductions and increased government spending , it would be wrong to think that this will add anything close to $ 400 billion a year to GDP in each of the next two years . 
Most of the tax reductions will be saved by households rather than used to finance additional spending . 
Moreover , a substantial part of the spending will be spread over the following decade . 
And some of the government spending in the stimulus package will replace other outlays that would have occurred anyway . 
An optimistic estimate of the direct increase in annual demand from the stimulus package is about $ 300 billion in each of the next two years . 
The stimulus package would thus fill less than half of the hole in GDP caused by the decline in household wealth and housing construction , with the remaining demand shortfall of $ 450 billion in each of the next two years causing serious second-round effects . 
As demand falls , businesses will reduce production , leading to lower employment and incomes , which in turn will lead to further cuts in consumer spending . 
To be sure , an improvement in the currently dysfunctional financial system will allow banks and other financial institutions to start lending to borrowers who want to spend but cannot get credit today . 
This will help , but it is unlikely to be enough to achieve positive GDP growth . 
A second fiscal stimulus package is therefore likely . 
However , it will need to be much better targeted at increasing demand in order to avoid adding more to the national debt than the rise in domestic spending . 
Similarly , the tax changes in such a stimulus package should provide incentives to increase spending by households and businesses . 
Although long-term government interest rates are now very low , they are beginning to rise in response to the outlook for a sharply rising national debt . 
The national debt held by US and foreign investors totaled about 40 % of GDP at the end of 2008 . 
It is likely to rise to more than 60 % of GDP by the end of 2010 , with the debt-to-GDP ratio continuing to increase . 
The resulting increase in real long-term interest rates will reduce all forms of interest-sensitive spending , adding further to the economy &apos;s weakness . 
So it is not clear what will occur to reverse the decline in GDP and end the economic downturn . 
Will a sharp dollar depreciation cause exports to rise and imports to fall ? 
Will a rapid rise in the inflation rate reduce the real value of government , household , and commercial debt , leading to lower saving and more spending ? 
Or will something else come along to turn the economy around . 
Only time will tell .
