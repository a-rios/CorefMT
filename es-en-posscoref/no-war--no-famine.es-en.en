No War , No Famine 
STOCKHOLM : Two hundred years ago in his essay &quot; Perpetual Peace &quot; Immanuel Kant imagined a future &quot; union of liberal republics . &quot; 
In 1795 , however , liberal republics were abstract ideas . 
Yet Kant imagined our present reality of flourishing liberal democracies . 
Moreover , Kant &apos;s idea of perpetual peace seems even less far-fetched because no democracy has ever made war on another . 
Indeed , &quot; No War Between Democracies &quot; is as close as we are likely to get to an immutable diplomatic law . 
Scholars have demonstrated the truth of this . 
Professor R J Rummel of the University of Hawaii investigated 353 pairs of combatants between 1816 and 1991 . 
Democracy fought non-democracy in 155 cases . 
He found no examples of democracies at war with each other . 
Some pedants quibble , claiming that exceptions exist . 
Study the details , however , and you find that the conflict in question was either some type of civil war or in which one participant was not a real democracy ( Germany in 1914 ) , or that the number of people killed was too low to call the conflict a war at all . 
This is no mere statistical error or lucky coincidence . 
In a democracy it would be almost impossible to secure sufficient public support for a military confrontation with another democracy . 
Democratic peoples know and trust each other . 
Democratic governments find it natural to negotiate with one another . 
The costs humanity has paid in waiting for Kant &apos;s vision to near reality is horrific and was exacted in places other than the battlefield . 
Between 1900 and 1987 about 170 million people were killed for political reasons not involving war . 
Totalitarian states murdered 138 million out of those 170 million . 
Authoritarian countries killed another 28 million . 
Democracies killed about 2 million people , primarily through intentional bombing of civilian targets . 
No matter how controversial examples of democratic excess are , however , they do not change the overall picture . 
Most of this slaughter was triggered by Marxism / Leninism &apos;s fusion of absolutist ideology with absolute power . 
To paraphrase Lord Acton &apos;s dictum : power kills and absolute power kills absolutely . 
Many people reached other conclusions . 
When Marxists were strong and liberalism weak , writers , politicians , political parties , and newspapers often told us : democracy is unimportant for the Third World . 
Freedom in such countries is a &quot; formality . &quot; 
Far more urgent is not going hungry . 
So , we were lectured : liberalism is no solution for developing countries . 
&quot; Don &apos;t measure others by our yardsticks , &quot; a leading Swedish playright / novelist wrote as Pol Pot &apos;s regime exterminated a quarter of Cambodia &apos;s population . 
What he meant was that the mass murder of Cambodians was not deplorable in the same way as the mass murder of Europeans is . 
This is inverted racism : you pretend to respect other peoples when , in fact , you despise them . 
Indeed , those in the West who praised Mao , Castro or Honecker seldom wanted to import their terror . 
Try introducing the slightest limitation on free speech in any Western country and you will meet storms of protest from those who seldom champion it in Third World nations . 
Oppression is only acceptable for others . 
Hypocrisy , of course , is not confined to the West . 
When leaders in , say , Singapore , Malaysia and mainland China talk about &quot; Asian values &quot; to romanticize their regimes , they , too , challenge the values of democracy . 
But Taiwan &apos;s former President Lee Teng-hui thinks these arguments thin alibis for anti-democratic policies . 
When it comes to human rights , says Mr. Lee , there are no special Asian values . 
Freedom is a universal value . 
Despite communism &apos;s collapse , assaults on liberalism remain . 
Amartya Sen , a Nobel Laureate in economics , demonstrated empirically that no famine - mass starvation leading to mass death - ever occurred in a democratically governed country . 
During the Bengal famine of 1943 , two to three million people died from hunger . 
That happened under British rule . 
Since India became independent in 1947 with a multiparty democratic system , the country has never suffered such a disaster . 
Undernourishment , malnutrition , crop failures , and food scarcities have occurred , but there have been no famines . 
Compare that with Mao &apos;s &quot; Great Leap Forward &quot; of 1958-1961 when 30 million Chinese died of hunger . 
That &apos;s ten times the number of Indians who died in the gigantic starvation of British India less than twenty years before . 
Sen also examined various African countries that experienced crop failures and food shortages . 
Governments under democratic pressures usually act forcefully and decently on such occasions ; people under dictatorial regimes are often hit by government-induced and manipulated famines . 
Where political opposition and a free press are active , governments cannot neglect thousands of people starving to death . 
When opposition is silenced and mass media voices only the dictator &apos;s propaganda , millions of people dying from famine can be kept secret and / or ignored . 
Elie Wiesel , survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald and a Nobel Peace Laureate , once said : &quot; Let us remember the heroes of Warsaw , the martyrs of Treblinka , the children of Auschwitz . 
They fought alone , they suffered alone , they lived alone , but they did not die alone , for something in all of us died with them . &quot; 
What died with them ? 
My answer is this : the idea that there are limits to human cruelty . 
Now we recognize that there are no limits . 
Knowing empirically the benefits in terms of peace and human welfare which democracy delivers , we must reaffirm our commitment to , and the necessity of , spreading Kant &apos;s vision .
