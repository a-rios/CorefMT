Russia &apos;s Crimean Shore ? 
MOSCOW - In his 1979 novel The Island of Crimea , Vasily Aksyonov imagined the region &apos;s flourishing independence from the Soviet Union . 
Aksyonov , a dissident writer who emigrated to America shortly after the book &apos;s samizdat ( underground ) publication , is now lauded as a prophet . 
But his prophecy has been turned on its head : Today &apos;s Crimea does not want independence from Ukraine ; it wants continued dependence on Russia . 
Traditionally the gem in the imperial crown , a lavish playground of czars and Soviet commissars - and , more important , the home of the Russian Navy &apos;s Black Sea Fleet - Crimea became part of Ukraine under Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 . 
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , Russian President Boris Yeltsin apparently forgot to claim it back , so Ukraine kept a territory in which nearly 60 % of the two million inhabitants identify as Russians . 
In defense of Khrushchev ( my great-grandfather ) , whether Crimea was part of Russia or Ukraine hardly mattered . 
After all , they were all part of the Soviet empire . 
But in the last 20 years , Russia has sought to retake the peninsula . 
The Kremlin has been rumored to expedite passport applications for Crimean residents , and its allies - for example , Aleksei Chalyi , Sevastopol &apos;s new mayor - populate its political offices . 
And now Ukraine &apos;s fugitive ex-president , Viktor Yanukovych , is reported to have taken refuge there as well . 
Busy with the Sochi Olympics and wary of an international debacle , Russian President Vladimir Putin maintained almost complete public silence as Ukraine &apos;s crisis reached its bloody crescendo . 
In fact , Putin &apos;s manipulation of Yanukovych - forcing him to renege in November on Ukraine &apos;s plan to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union , and to enact a harsh anti-protest law the following month - ended in disgrace for the Kremlin : Kyiv is now firmly in the hands of pro-Western forces . 
But the seemingly spontaneous resolve of some Crimean Russians to rejoin Mother Russia is allowing Putin to wipe some of the egg off his face . 
After all , pleas from Crimea for fraternal Russian support appear to justify Putin &apos;s backing for the dithering , venal , and now widely despised Yanukovych . 
So the big question now is whether Putin will seize on the restiveness of Russians in Crimea ( and eastern Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv ) to recover parts of former Soviet territory , as he did with Georgia &apos;s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions after the 2008 war . 
If so , the long-term strategic costs could be enormous . 
The Northern Caucasus and its vicinity already is a tinderbox ; acquiring more territory with disaffected Muslims would undoubtedly yield further security challenges . 
After all , the formerly Ottoman Crimea has long been home to the Tatars , who bear a massive historical grudge against the Kremlin , owing to their forced removal by Stalin to the Central Asian steppes . 
Today , they compose 12-20 % of the Crimean population ( depending on who is counting ) ; but , threatened by Putin &apos;s repressive policies toward other Muslims , they might well renew their call for all Tatars to return . 
If more Tatars do settle in Crimea , Russia &apos;s neo-imperial project , already facing an Islamist insurgency in Chechnya and Dagestan , would become all but untenable . 
That much should be clear to virtually everyone , if not to Putin , whose obsession with short-term tactical victories - which usually take the form of poking the United States in the eye - can also be seen in Syria . 
Putin &apos;s gains there - arranging for chemical disarmament by June of this year , or orchestrating the Geneva talks on ending the civil war - have no beneficial endgame for Russia . 
The Geneva conference ended earlier this month in a stalemate between President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s government and its opponents . 
The regime &apos;s request to delay the elimination of its chemical-weapons arsenal has created a new disagreement , with Russia , China , and Iran calling for a flexible timetable , while the US and the European Union continue to insist on the June deadline . 
In the meantime , Russia is increasingly loathed across the Middle East , including in strategically important Turkey , for backing the murderous Assad . 
Investing in incompetent or brutal partners is Putin &apos;s signature diplomatic trait . 
But perhaps even he has come to understand that backing such people is doomed to failure . 
A breakthrough of sorts may have come this past weekend when , after vetoing three previous resolutions , Russia finally agreed with Western and Arab-backed calls for Syria &apos;s government and opposition forces to provide immediate access to humanitarian aid . 
Or perhaps the possibility of regaining full sovereignty over Crimea has led Putin to reconsider the value of retaining Syria &apos;s Mediterranean port of Tartus for the Russian Navy . 
But Putin &apos;s greatest strategic derangement concerns China . 
Voting with Russia against the West to keep Assad in power does not make the world &apos;s most populous country a reliable partner . 
If China concludes that its geopolitical interests , particularly in dealing with the US , would be best served by detaching itself from Putin , it will not hesitate to do so . 
Moreover , China still regards large chunks of Russian Siberia as its own stolen territory . 
If there is one objective that unites the Chinese political establishment , it is recovery of lost territory , no matter how long it takes . 
President Xi Jinping may smile and tell Putin how similar they are , but he will happily move to subordinate Russia with every passing year . 
If anything , Russia needs Europe and America if it is to confront successfully its many challenges , particularly that posed by China . 
Instead , Putin takes perverse pride in his persistent efforts to alienate the West . 
His former Ukrainian proxy , Yanukovych , could attest to the catastrophic stupidity of this policy .
