A World of Regions 
NEW YORK - In almost every part of the world , long-festering problems can be solved through closer cooperation among neighboring countries . 
The European Union provides the best model for how neighbors that have long fought each other can come together for mutual benefit . 
Ironically , today &apos;s decline in American global power may lead to more effective regional cooperation . 
This may seem an odd time to praise the EU , given the economic crises in Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Ireland . 
Europe has not solved the problem of balancing the interests of strong economies in the North and those of weaker economies in the South . 
Still , the EU &apos;s accomplishments vastly outweigh its current difficulties . 
The EU has created a zone of peace where once there was relentless war . 
It has provided the institutional framework for reuniting Western and Eastern Europe . 
It has fostered regional-scale infrastructure . 
The single market has been crucial to making Europe one of the most prosperous places on the planet . 
For these reasons , the EU provides a unique model for other regions that remain stuck in a mire of conflict , poverty , lack of infrastructure , and environmental crisis . 
New regional organizations , such as the African Union , look to the EU as a role model for regional problem-solving and integration . 
Yet , to this day , most regional groupings remain too weak to solve their members &quot; pressing problems . 
In most other regions , ongoing political divisions have their roots in the Cold War or the colonial era . 
During the Cold War , neighbors often competed with each other by &quot; choosing sides &quot; - allying themselves with either the United States or the Soviet Union . Pakistan tilted towards the Americans ; 
India towards the Soviets . 
Countries had little incentive to make peace with their neighbors as long as they enjoyed the financial support of the US or the USSR . 
On the contrary , continued conflict often led directly to more financial aid . 
Indeed , the US and Europe often acted to undermine regional integration , which they believed would limit their roles as power brokers . 
Thus , when Gamal Abdel Nasser launched a call for Arab unity in the 1950 &quot; s , the US and Europe viewed him as a threat . The US undercut his call for strong Arab cooperation and nationalism , fearing a loss of American influence in the Middle East . 
As a result , Nasser increasingly aligned Egypt with the Soviet Union , and ultimately failed in the quest to unite Arab interests . 
Today &apos;s reality , however , is that great powers can no longer divide and conquer other regions , even if they try . 
The age of colonialism is finished , and we are now moving beyond the age of US global dominance . 
Recent events in the Middle East and Central Asia , for example , clearly reflect the decline of US influence . 
America &apos;s failure to win any lasting geopolitical advantage through the use of military force in Iraq and Afghanistan underscore the limits of its power , while its budget crisis ensures that it will cut its military resources sooner rather than later . 
Similarly , the US played no role in the political revolutions underway in the Arab world , and still has not demonstrated any clear policy response to them . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s recent speech on the Middle East is a further display of America &apos;s declining influence in the region . 
The speech drew the most attention for calling on Israel to return to its 1967 borders , but the effect was undercut when Israel flatly rejected the US position . 
The rest of the speech was even more revealing , though it drew little public notice . 
When Obama discussed the Arab political upheavals , he noted the importance of economic development . 
Yet when it came to US action , the most that the US could offer financially was slight debt relief for Egypt ( $ 1 billion ) , scant loan guarantees ( $ 1 billion ) , and some insurance coverage for private investments . 
The real message was that the US government would contribute very little financially to the region &apos;s economic recovery . 
The days when a country could depend on large-scale American financing are over . 
We are , in short , moving to a multi-polar world . 
The Cold War &apos;s end has not led to greater US dominance , but rather to the dissemination of global power to many regions . East Asia , South Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East have new geopolitical and economic influence . 
Each region , increasingly , must find its own path to economic development , energy and food security , and effective infrastructure , and must do so in a world threatened by climate change and resource scarcity . 
Each region , therefore , will have to secure its own future . 
Of course , this should occur in a context of cooperation across regions as well as within them . 
The Middle East is in a strong position to help itself . 
There is a high degree of economic complementarity between Egypt and the oil-rich Gulf States . 
Egypt can supply technology , manpower , and considerable expertise for the Arab region , while the Gulf provides energy and finance , as well as some specialists . 
The long-delayed vision of Arab economic unity should be returned to the table . 
Israel , too , should recognize that its long-term security and prosperity will be enhanced as part of an economically stronger region . 
For the sake of its own national interests , Israel must come to terms with its neighbors . 
Other regions also will find that the decline of US power increases the urgency of stronger cooperation between neighbors . 
Some of the greatest tensions in the world - say India and Pakistan , or North and South Korea - should be defused as part of region-wide strengthening . 
As the EU shows , ancient enmities and battle lines can be turned into mutually beneficial cooperation if a region looks forward , to resolving its long-term needs , rather than backward , to its long-standing rivalries and conflicts .
