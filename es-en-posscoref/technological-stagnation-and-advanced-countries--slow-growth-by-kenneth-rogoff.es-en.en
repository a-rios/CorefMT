Innovation Crisis or Financial Crisis ? 
CAMBRIDGE - As one year of sluggish growth spills into the next , there is growing debate about what to expect over the coming decades . 
Was the global financial crisis a harsh but transitory setback to advanced-country growth , or did it expose a deeper long-term malaise ? 
Recently , a few writers , including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and political activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov , have espoused a fairly radical interpretation of the slowdown . 
In a forthcoming book , they argue that the collapse of advanced-country growth is not merely a result of the financial crisis ; at its root , they argue , these countries &quot; weakness reflects secular stagnation in technology and innovation . 
As such , they are unlikely to see any sustained pickup in productivity growth without radical changes in innovation policy . 
Economist Robert Gordon takes this idea even further . 
He argues that the period of rapid technological progress that followed the Industrial Revolution may prove to be a 250-year exception to the rule of stagnation in human history . 
Indeed , he suggests that today &apos;s technological innovations pale in significance compared to earlier advances like electricity , running water , the internal combustion engine , and other breakthroughs that are now more than a century old . 
I recently debated the technological stagnation thesis with Thiel and Kasparov at Oxford University , joined by encryption pioneer Mark Shuttleworth . 
Kasparov pointedly asked what products such as the iPhone 5 really add to our capabilities , and argued that most of the science underlying modern computing was settled by the seventies . 
Thiel maintained that efforts to combat the recession through loose monetary policy and hyper-aggressive fiscal stimulus treat the wrong disease , and therefore are potentially very harmful . 
These are very interesting ideas , but the evidence still seems overwhelming that the drag on the global economy mainly reflects the aftermath of a deep systemic financial crisis , not a long-term secular innovation crisis . 
There are certainly those who believe that the wellsprings of science are running dry , and that , when one looks closely , the latest gadgets and ideas driving global commerce are essentially derivative . 
But the vast majority of my scientist colleagues at top universities seem awfully excited about their projects in nanotechnology , neuroscience , and energy , among other cutting-edge fields . 
They think they are changing the world at a pace as rapid as we have ever seen . 
Frankly , when I think of stagnating innovation as an economist , I worry about how overweening monopolies stifle ideas , and how recent changes extending the validity of patents have exacerbated this problem . 
No , the main cause of the recent recession is surely a global credit boom and its subsequent meltdown . 
The profound resemblance of the current malaise to the aftermath of past deep systemic financial crises around the world is not merely qualitative . 
The footprints of crisis are evident in indicators ranging from unemployment to housing prices to debt accumulation . 
It is no accident that the current era looks so much like what followed dozens of deep financial crises in the past . 
Granted , the credit boom itself may be rooted in excessive optimism surrounding the economic-growth potential implied by globalization and new technologies . 
As Carmen Reinhart and I emphasize in our book This Time is Different , such fugues of optimism often accompany credit run-ups , and this is hardly the first time that globalization and technological innovation have played a central role . 
Attributing the ongoing slowdown to the financial crisis does not imply the absence of long-term secular effects , some of which are rooted in the crisis itself . 
Credit contractions almost invariably hit small businesses and start-ups the hardest . 
Since many of the best ideas and innovations come from small companies rather than large , established firms , the ongoing credit contraction will inevitably have long-term growth costs . 
At the same time , unemployed and underemployed workers &quot; skill sets are deteriorating . 
Many recent college graduates are losing as well , because they are less easily able to find jobs that best enhance their skills and thereby add to their long-term productivity and earnings . 
With cash-strapped governments deferring urgently needed public infrastructure projects , medium-term growth also will suffer . 
And , regardless of technological trends , other secular trends , such as aging populations in most advanced countries , are taking a toll on growth prospects as well . 
Even absent the crisis , countries would have had to make politically painful adjustments to pension and health-care programs . 
Taken together , these factors make it easy to imagine trend GDP growth being one percentage point below normal for another decade , possibly even longer . 
If the Kasparov-Thiel-Gordon hypothesis is right , the outlook is even darker - and the need for reform is far more urgent . 
After all , most plans for emerging from the financial crisis assume that technological progress will provide a strong foundation of productivity growth that will eventually underpin sustained recovery . 
The options are far more painful if the pie has ceased growing quickly . 
So , is the main cause of the recent slowdown an innovation crisis or a financial crisis ? 
Perhaps some of both , but surely the economic trauma of the last few years reflects , first and foremost , a financial meltdown , even if the way forward must simultaneously treat other obstacles to long-term growth .
