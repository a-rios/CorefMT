The Flight to Quality 
BERKELEY - In late May , the yield to maturity of the 30-year United States Treasury bond was 4.07 % per year - down a full half a percentage point since the start of the month . 
That means that a 30-year Treasury bond had jumped in price by more than 15 % . 
So a marginal investor was willing to pay more than 15 % more cash and more than 30 % more equities for US Treasury bonds at the end of the month than at the beginning . 
This signals a remarkable shift in relative demand for high-quality and liquid financial assets - an extraordinary rise in market-wide excess demand for such assets . 
Why does this matter ? 
Because , as economist John Stuart Mill wrote in the first half of the nineteenth century , excess demand for cash ( or for some broader range of high-quality and liquid assets ) is excess supply of everything else . 
What economists three generations later were to call Walras &apos;s Law is the principle that any market in which people are planning to buy more than is for sale must be counterbalanced by a market or markets in which people are planning to buy less . 
We have seen this principle in action since the early fall of 2007 , as growing excess demand for safe , liquid , high-quality financial assets has carried with it growing excess supply for the goods and services that are the products of ongoing human labor . 
This is true to such an extent that there is now a 10 % gap between the global economy &apos;s current output and what it would be producing if it were in its normal relatively healthy state of near-balance . 
And global financial markets are now telling us that this excess demand for safe , liquid , high-quality financial assets has just gotten bigger . 
To some small degree , a change in investor sentiment has induced the rise in excess demand for such assets . 
After all , we can assume that the animal spirits of investors and financiers has been further depressed as a psychological reaction to the exuberant belief just a few years ago in the powers of financial engineering . 
But most of the recent shift has come not from an increase in demand for safe , liquid , high-quality financial assets , but from a decrease in supply : six months ago , bonds issued by the governments of southern Europe were regarded as among the high-quality assets in the world economy that one could safely and securely hold ; now they are not . 
The argument six months ago in favor of those bonds seemed nearly airtight . 
Yes , the liabilities of southern Europe &apos;s private sector were speculative and potentially insecure ; but the region was part of the eurozone , and thus its governments &quot; debts were backed by the European Central Bank , which in turn was backed by the governments of France and Germany , which in turn were backed by the willingness of French and German taxpayers to pay for the long-run project of closer European integration . 
Neither the French nor the Germans , obviously , want to contemplate any possibility of a return to the days when every generation they would kill each other over the question of which language should be spoken by the mayor of Strasbourg ( or is it Strassburg ? ) . 
Now things are not so certain . 
When there is excess demand for safe , liquid , high-quality financial assets , the rule for which economic policy to pursue - if , that is , you want to avoid a deeper depression - has been well-established since 1825 . 
If the market wants more safe , high-quality , liquid financial assets , give the market what it wants . 
After all , as a social-resource planning mechanism does , a market tells us which things are valuable and thus gives us the signal to make more of them . 
Markets are now signaling that US Treasury bonds are much more valuable assets than they were a month ago . 
So those governments whose credit is still unshaken and whose assets are still the benchmarks of quality for the world economy should be creating a lot more of them . 
Creditworthy governments around the world can create more safe , liquid , high-quality financial assets through a number of channels . 
They can spend more or tax less and borrow the difference . 
They can guarantee the debt of private-sector entities , thus transforming now-risky leaden assets back into golden ones . 
Their central banks can borrow and use the money to buy up some of the flood of risky assets in the market . 
Which of these steps should the world &apos;s creditworthy governments take in response to the asset-price movements of May ? 
All of them , because we really are not sure which would be the most effective and efficient at the task of draining excess demand for high-quality assets . 
How much should they do ? 
As long as there is a clear global excess supply of goods and services - as long as unemployment remains highly elevated and inflation rates are falling - they are not doing enough . 
And the gap between what they should be doing and what they are doing grew markedly in May . 
This isn &apos;t rocket science or capping deep-sea oil blowouts . 
These are problems that we have long known how to solve .
