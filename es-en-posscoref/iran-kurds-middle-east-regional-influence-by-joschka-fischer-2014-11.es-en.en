The Middle East &apos;s New Winners and Losers 
BERLIN - &quot; War , &quot; said the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus , is the &quot; father of all things . &quot; 
In view of the bloody - indeed barbaric - events in the Middle East ( and in Iraq and Syria in particular ) , one might be tempted to agree , even though such ideas no longer seem to have a place in the postmodern worldview of today &apos;s Europe . 
The Islamic State &apos;s military triumphs in Iraq and Syria are not only fueling a humanitarian catastrophe ; they are also throwing the region &apos;s existing alliances into disarray and even calling into question national borders . 
A new Middle East is emerging , one that already differs from the old order in two significant ways : an enhanced role for the Kurds and Iran , and diminished influence for the region &apos;s Sunni powers . 
The Middle East is not just facing the possible triumph of a force that seeks to achieve its strategic goals by mass murder and enslavement ( for example , of Yazidi women and girls ) . 
What is also becoming apparent is the collapse of the region &apos;s old order , which had existed more or less unchanged since the end of World War I , and with it , the decline of the region &apos;s traditional stabilizing powers . 
The political weakness of those powers - whether global actors like the United States or regional players like Turkey , Iran , and Saudi Arabia - has led to a remarkable role reversal in the region &apos;s power dynamic . 
Although the US and the European Union still classify the pro-independence Kurdistan Workers &quot; Party ( PKK ) as a terrorist organization ( whose founder , Abdullah Ã–calan , has been in prison in Turkey since 1999 ) , only the PKK &apos;s fighters , it seems , are willing and able to stop the Islamic State &apos;s further advance . 
As a result , the Kurds &quot; fate has become a burning question in Turkey . 
Turkey is a NATO member , and any violation of its territorial integrity could easily trigger the North Atlantic Treaty &apos;s mutual-defense clause . 
And the Kurdish question entails a potential for much wider conflict , because statehood would also threaten the territorial integrity of Syria , Iraq , and probably Iran . 
And yet , in fighting for their lives against the Islamic State , the Kurds have won new legitimacy ; once the fighting has ended , they will not simply forget their national ambitions - or the mortal threat they faced . 
And it is not just the Kurds &quot; unity and bravery that have raised their prestige ; they have increasingly become an anchor of stability and a reliable pro-Western partner in a region that is short on both . 
That presents the West with a dilemma : Given its reluctance to commit its own ground forces to a war it knows it must win , it will have to arm the Kurds - not just the Kurdish Peshmerga militia of northern Iraq , but also other Kurdish groups - with more advanced weaponry . 
But the biggest regional winner could prove to be Iran , whose influence in Iraq and Afghanistan gained a substantial boost from US policy under President George W. Bush . 
Iranian cooperation is essential to stable solutions in Iraq and Syria , and the country plays an important role in the Israel-Palestine conflict and in Lebanon . 
It is impossible to bypass Iran in the search for solutions to the region &apos;s myriad crises . 
In fact , in the fight against the Islamic State , even limited military cooperation between the US and Iran no longer seems to be off the table . 
The key strategic question , however , will not be resolved on the region &apos;s battlefields , but in the various negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
If compromise ( or even a short-term extension of the current interim agreement , with a realistic prospect for a final accord ) is achieved , Iran &apos;s broader regional role will become both stronger and more constructive . 
The nuclear issue implicates another important hidden question , namely Iran &apos;s relationship with Israel , at whose northern border in Lebanon stands Hezbollah , Iran &apos;s closest partner in the region . 
Hezbollah remains committed to Israel &apos;s destruction , and Iran supplies it with powerful weapons . 
This much is clear about the new Middle East : It will be both more Shia and Iranian and more Kurdish , which will also make it a good deal more complicated . 
Old alliances ( and conflicts ) will no longer be as self-evident as in the past - even if they continue . 
Beyond that , one can say only that the Middle East will remain the powder keg of world politics in the twenty-first century . 
Its stabilization , while of global interest , will be difficult to achieve - and only by a complicated mixture of military and diplomatic means . 
No single global power is likely to manage that alone .
