The Moral of Sandy 
COPENHAGEN - When &quot; superstorm &quot; Sandy hit the east coast of the United States on October 29 , it not only flooded the New York City Subway and became the most important factor for 15 % of US voters in the presidential election a week later . 
It also resurrected the unwarranted claim that global warming was to blame for such events , together with the morally irresponsible argument that we should help future hurricane victims by cutting CO2 emissions . 
From Bill Clinton to Robert Redford , countless pundits blamed Sandy on climate change . 
Now , global warming is real , and cutting CO2 is a good idea when the reduction cost is lower than that of the damage it prevents . 
There is also a grain of truth in the connection between hurricanes and global warming : the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) expects stronger but fewer hurricanes toward the end of this century . 
But the end of the century is 88 years from now , and blaming global warming now is simply unconvincing ( Bloomberg &apos;s first source for its claim was a 134-character tweet ) . 
In its 2012 report on extreme weather , the IPCC said that it puts little trust in any attribution of hurricanes to global warming . 
The authors of one of the central Science papers for the UN &apos;s hurricane estimates put it clearly : &quot; It is premature to conclude that human activities ... have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane activity . &quot; 
We will be unable to detect an impact &quot; until we near the end of the century . &quot; 
In fact , the US has not seen a hurricane of Category 3 or higher since Wilma in 2005 . 
Those seven years without strong hurricanes is the longest such span in more than a century . 
( Sandy , which was downgraded from a hurricane before it hit New York , was rebranded in the media as a &quot; superstorm . &quot; ) 
While Bloomberg claims that Sandy is the costliest storm in US history , and holds implications for &quot; the survival of the human race , &quot; this is simply wrong , as any recollection of the costs of Hurricane Katrina would show . 
Indeed , when adjusted for inflation and growth of coastal communities , Sandy ranks only 17th for US storms , and both the number and power of hurricanes that make landfall in the US have been declining slightly since 1900 , not increasing . 
Similarly , in global terms , the energy in hurricanes during the last four years ( including Sandy ) has been lower than at any point since the 1970 &quot; s . 
And , though hurricanes will be perhaps 2-11 % stronger by the end of the century , they will also be less frequent , while societies will be more robust , with total global damage costs set to decline from 0.04 % to 0.02 % of world GDP over this period . 
But the real damage from the claims about Sandy and climate change stems from what often follows : the insidious argument that if global warming caused this destruction , we should help future victims of hurricanes by cutting CO2 emissions now . 
As Redford put it , we need to &quot; reduce the carbon pollution that &apos;s fueling these storms . &quot; 
Like so many others , he deplores doubters : &quot; By ignoring the scientific facts , they dishonor the human suffering brought on by climate change . &quot; 
But , unfortunately , it is by focusing on cutting CO2 that we really dishonor human suffering , because any realistic carbon cuts will do virtually nothing for the next 50-100 years . 
Consider sea-level rise , which caused by far the most damage in New York . 
Models show that the world &apos;s most ambitious climate policy , the EU &apos;s &quot; 20-20-20 &quot; plan , will have a net cost of roughly $ 250 billion a year for the rest of the century , or about $ 20 trillion in total . 
Yet it will reduce sea-level rise by just nine millimeters by 2100 . 
If the US embarked on a similar plan , the cost and the benefit would probably be on a similar scale : a two-centimeter reduction in sea-level rise by the end of the century at a net cost of about $ 500 billion annually . 
Consider this extremely unrealistic scenario : even if we almost immediately could get the entire world - including China and India - on board for drastic carbon cuts , and even if we would suck CO2 out of the atmosphere toward the end of the century , we could reduce sea level rise by only 18-45 centimeters by the end of the century . 
Models show that the cost , by then , would be at least $ 40 trillion annually . 
Contrast this to what New York City is rightly concerned about : the 3.3 % chance each year ( entirely without global warming ) that a Category 3 hurricane will hit New York . 
This would cause sea surges of up to 7.5 meters ( about three meters higher than Sandy ) , putting Kennedy Airport under six meters of water . 
Much of the risk could be managed by erecting seawalls , building storm doors for the Subway , and simple fixes like porous pavements - all at a cost of around $ 100 million a year . 
Sandy underscored a fundamental question for all parts of the world that are affected by hurricanes . 
If we want to reduce hurricane damage , should we focus primarily on a very cheap solution that would enable us to handle storm surges much better within a few years , or on an incredibly expensive solution that would require almost a hundred years to avoid nine millimeters of 7.5-meter surges ? 
The morally defensible answer is clear , and it has nothing to do with immediate reductions in CO2 emissions .
