The Federal Reserve Diet 
LONDON - Markets around the world were relieved by the US Senate &apos;s confirmation of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s reappointment . 
It was the right decision from the perspective of financial stability ; change at the top would have thrown in doubt the Fed &apos;s determination to respond decisively to the crisis - and , indeed , its long-term commitment to low inflation . 
Bernanke &apos;s performance over the last two years has won high praise , and an extended political fight over control of US monetary policy was the last thing the world needed at what is still a very delicate moment for the global economy . 
Nevertheless , 30 senators voted against Bernanke . 
This may , in part , have just been partisan politics , but Bernanke was appointed by President George W. Bush , and there were other voices , both Democrat and independent , raised against his reappointment . 
The case against Bernanke rested partly on his performance before the crisis . 
Was he not a hard-core member of the &quot; Greenspan consensus , &quot; which held that it was not the Fed &apos;s responsibility to look out for bubbles , whether of asset prices or credit , and that it should limit itself to mopping up after the event ? 
Bernanke had also supported the low-interest-rate policy implemented after the dot-com collapse , which , in the view of many economists , was maintained for too long , fueling the boom and contributing to the bust . 
Indeed , just recently he defended that policy , whereas many other central bankers have tacitly or explicitly accepted that they need a new approach to credit and asset prices . 
That was , I think , part of the reason for many commentators &quot; doubts about Bernanke &apos;s continued suitability . 
But these arguments became tangled up in a broader critique of the Fed &apos;s actions . 
Should it have been allowed to rescue the insurance giant AIG so expensively , without approval by the US Congress ? 
How is it that the Fed &apos;s balance sheet can expand so dramatically , potentially committing large sums of taxpayer dollars , without Congress having a purchase on its decisions , except well after the event ? 
These questions have led to pressure for audits of the Fed &apos;s actions , and for greater political control over its decision-making . 
Congressman Ron Paul has been leading the pack hunting the Fed , but he is by no means as isolated a voice as he was two years ago . 
This is dangerous territory . 
Any suggestion that monetary-policy decisions would in future be subject to political override would , to use a non-technical term , spook the markets . 
Most developed countries have concluded that central-bank independence makes good sense . 
Politicians acknowledge , in their more rational moments ( yes , they have them ) , that they can &apos;t be trusted with the interest-rate weapon , especially as an election approaches . 
So they have handed it over to technocrats , in the hope that they make rational choices that benefit everyone . 
I share this consensus view . 
But there is a problem , and the crisis has highlighted it . 
The arguments that apply strongly in the case of interest rates are less clear when it comes to other functions that central banks may carry . 
If a central bank is committing public funds in support of individual firms , even with a systemic justification , do not different accountability considerations apply ? 
And if it is a direct institutional supervisor , as well as being the lender of last resort , there are different considerations again . 
Supervisors make decisions that , in effect , have an impact on private financial returns and property rights . 
They must operate within tight legal constraints , and with rigorous accountability frameworks , involving the government and the legislature . 
In its proposed reforms of the regulatory system , the Obama administration plans to give the Fed more of these powers . 
That has inevitably strengthened the hands of those who argue that more power requires more accountability . 
The problem is how to establish two different types of accountability for two different functions . 
Is it possible to maintain a rigorously independent chairman when it comes to interest rates , and a tightly accountable chairman when he is making supervisory decisions ? 
Only with great difficulty , is my answer . 
It is very hard to make legislators understand these delicate distinctions . 
There is bound to be some contagion from one function to another . 
So the proposals to strengthen the Fed &apos;s regulatory role carry great risks . 
It would be far better , in my view , to leave the Fed with an overall systemic role , which raises fewer new accountability issues . 
Below it , there is the opportunity to create a single banking supervisor , combining the functions of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Office of Thrift Supervision , and the regulatory functions of the regional Feds . 
In a perfect world , one would add in the state banking regulators , but I recognize that at this point I have begun to trample on cherished features of the US Constitution ! 
This regulatory architecture would leave the Fed free to speak openly about the development of the financial system as a whole , without worrying about the implications for individual institutions in its care . 
The crisis has demonstrated that we need this plain speaking . 
Moreover , such a solution would protect the Fed &apos;s crucial independence in its monetary-policy role . 
President Obama should not draw the conclusion that arguments about the Fed &apos;s accountability have gone away with Bernanke &apos;s confirmation . 
If he proceeds with plans to give it more functions , they will persist . 
To protect the Fed &apos;s independence , which is a global public good of the highest importance , he should cut back the Fed &apos;s authority to its core role .
