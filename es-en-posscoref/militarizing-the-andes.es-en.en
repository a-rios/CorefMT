Militarizing the Andes 
While the world &apos;s attention is riveted on Iraq , the Colombia Plan , developed by the United States to fight drugs and left-wing guerrillas in Colombia , may soon be applied as a general strategy across the nations of the Andes , if not all of Latin America . 
Colombia , it seems , is only mentioned nowadays in connection with President Alvaro Uribe &apos;s re-election bid later this month . 
When it was unveiled in 2000 , the Colombia Plan had a double rationale : to slash narcotics production and exports while strengthening Colombia &apos;s counterinsurgency campaign against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels . 
Back then , the US saw Colombia as hosting two increasingly interwoven threats , which , without a successful military response , heralded the grim prospect of Colombia becoming a failed state . 
Indeed , despite receiving almost $ 1.4 billion from the US between 1989 and 1999 to fight drug trafficking , Colombia had not reduced the problem . 
Worse still , the economic , territorial , and military insurgency of the FARC guerrillas was growing stronger . 
Indeed , between 1995 and 1998 , the Colombian army suffered its worst setbacks - including casualties , captures , and ambushes - in the four decades of the insurgency . 
With the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and the response of the Bush administration , the &quot; war against terrorism &quot; became relevant to Colombia . 
As a result , the failed three-year dialogue between the government of Andr√©s Pastrana , Uribe &apos;s predecessor , and FARC was buried in February 2002 , with the conflict definitively internationalized through massive and indirect US intervention . 
Between 2000 and 2005 , Washington paid out nearly $ 4 billion to Colombia , with approximately 75 % of the total going to the military and the police , and increased its presence in the country with 800 soldiers and 600 private security contractors . 
Indeed , Colombia is now the fifth largest recipient of US aid in the world . 
US policy was ( and remains ) aimed primarily at the &quot; war on drugs , &quot; to be fought mainly by Colombians themselves . 
But the &quot; war on terrorism &quot; in Latin America has also fallen to the Colombians , with a US rear guard backing up the Colombian state in order to avoid American casualties on a new front , and an overextension of US military commitments . 
When evaluated as an anti-narcotics strategy , the Colombia Plan &apos;s failure is self-evident . 
Even though the Colombian government chemically eradicated 523,000 hectares of coca between 2000 and 2004 , 114,000 hectares of coca remained under cultivation last year . 
Likewise , although Uribe &apos;s government approved the extradition of 304 Colombian nationals and 11 foreigners ( most to the US ) between 2002 and 2005 , drugs-linked organized crime continues to thrive and expand in Colombia . 
Of course , the large cartels no longer exist . 
The results of the Colombia Plan &apos;s counter-insurgency effort are equally mixed . 
The military strengthening of Colombia in the last five years has been massive , with the offensive capacity , geographic deployment , and public credibility of the armed forces much greater than before . 
Until 2002 , some 3,000 kidnappings were reported each year in Colombia ; by 2005 , the government had reduced that figure to less than 1,000 . 
Between 2000 and 2004 , the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) was seriously weakened , and the FARC retreated to a smaller area , notably reducing its combat potential . 
However , while ELN may be strategically beaten , the FARC is not . 
On the contrary , since 2005 , the FARC has been escalating its attacks . 
Moreover , Colombia has not effectively recovered territorial sovereignty in areas controlled by armed right-wing groups like the United Self Defenses of Colombia . 
The implicit immunity from prosecution these groups received in exchange for their demobilization has done little to help . 
So , after five years , the Colombia Plan , a part of two simultaneous global wars - against drugs and terrorism - has produced only uncertain and scanty results . 
Yet this has not led to any official questioning of tactics . 
On the contrary , both the US and the Uribe government regard what has happened in Colombia as &quot; model &quot; to be emulated across the Andes in order to prevent other countries in the region from becoming failed states . 
In fact , this &quot; model &quot; is already being applied in the region . 
In Ecuador , the US has deployed its military power through the renovation of the Manta military base . 
The US continues to pressure Peru &apos;s government to shoot down planes supposedly linked to drug trafficking , and is trying to convince Evo Morales &apos;s new government in Bolivia to continue a failed &quot; war on drugs . &quot; 
But , as in Colombia , the effort to militarize the &quot; war on drugs &quot; and the &quot; war on terrorism &quot; seems likely only to generate more disorder .
