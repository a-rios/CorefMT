Law and Order , Russian-Style 
Around the world , people worry that political freedom is disappearing in Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Indeed , about the only people who are unconcerned about creeping authoritarianism in Russia are the Russians themselves . 
Russians seem to care less about political freedom than they do about social welfare - pensions , domestic violence , children &apos;s rights , or police brutality . 
In fact , most Russians are indifferent to the government &apos;s efforts to curtail press freedom and limit the right to protest . 
Such apathy makes my task as Russia &apos;s ombudsman , an office charged by the State Duma ( parliament ) with protecting political rights in Russia , difficult , if not impossible . 
The ombudsman acts as a bridge between the authorities and the people , seeking to resolve conflicts that arise between state bodies and citizens . 
My office is open not only to Russian citizens , but to foreigners and stateless people who feel their political rights have been compromised . 
The standards we apply are not only those contained in Russia &apos;s constitution , but also international legal principles and human rights norms , even if they sometimes contradict our constitution . 
For example , as ombudsman , I was opposed to curtailing the right of Russians to jury trials . 
Those who wanted to limit the use of juries supposedly feared a risk to state security in some instances . 
My office worked closely with the state to assure that , in most cases , juries are used . 
Similarly , my office defended the liberal weekly newspaper Novoe Vremya ( New Times ) , which was being pressured by Moscow &apos;s city government on the pretext of a commercial dispute about a lease . 
That fight is not over , but after my intervention , Moscow &apos;s authorities must take into account the public &apos;s negative attitude to their effort to quash this publication . 
Of course , Russia provides far more headline-grabbling examples of political and human rights problems , such as the low-grade war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair . 
My office pays maximum attention to Chechnya , although this is not easy to do from Moscow . 
Indeed , I could spend all my time in Chechnya , but Russia has 89 regions with countless human rights issues to address . 
This is why I suggested to Putin that Chechnya have its own regional rights ombudsman who would spend all his time there . 
The new Chechen authorities seem to welcome this prospect . 
As to the Yukos affair , my office cannot intervene in any legal process until it is completed . 
Former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky &apos;s lawyers have sent a complaint to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg . 
If Khodorkovsky disagrees with the final decision of the Russian courts , he will undoubtedly appeal to that court . 
Only then will I be able to express an opinion . 
Many observers nonetheless insist that those under criminal investigation should be released on bail instead of being kept in prison . 
Others say that this is not an option in Khodorkovsky &apos;s case - being very rich , he could easily jump bail and flee abroad . 
In fact , this is precisely what happened with other figures accused in the Yukos case . 
All of these serious human rights questions expose the fact that Russia &apos;s legal institutions remains half-formed . 
For example , the Duma has taken far too long to enact a law on lobbying , which in most developed democracies clearly defines what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behavior . 
Khodorkovsky might not be in as much trouble if such precise laws existed . 
Unformed laws are directly related to unformed ideas . 
Human rights in Russia are often violated simply because people are not aware that they have some particular right . 
The most important strategic goal of my office is that people learn how to defend their rights better , and to make the authorities take the complaints of ordinary Russians into consideration . 
Sadly , most bureaucrats still look upon human rights values with disdain . 
But the real problem for my office is neither ignorance nor legal infirmity , it is that in an under-developed legal system such as Russia &apos;s , my authority is mostly personal , and requires help from the mass media . 
Because concepts of human rights remain rudimentary , the best that can be hoped for is that awareness will slowly begin to take hold . 
My tactical goal is thus to raise the public profile of the ombudsman &apos;s office , in order to win more respect and recognition by both citizens and the state . 
This will be all but impossible without cooperation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia . 
Indeed , I view one of my tasks as being to facilitate contacts between these groups and the authorities . 
The government &apos;s response to these efforts will be an important indicator of whether and to what extent Putin &apos;s administration intends to include human and political rights within its so-called &quot; dictatorship of law . &quot;
