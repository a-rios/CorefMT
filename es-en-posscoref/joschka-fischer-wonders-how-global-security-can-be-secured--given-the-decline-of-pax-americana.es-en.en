The Overstretched West 
BERLIN - The chaotic consequences of the gradual disintegration of Pax Americana are becoming increasingly clear . 
For seven decades , the United States safeguarded a global framework , which - however imperfect , and regardless of how many mistakes the superpower made - generally guaranteed a minimum level of stability . 
At the very least , Pax Americana was an essential component of Western security . 
But the US is no longer willing or able to be the world &apos;s policeman . 
The staggering accumulation of crises and conflicts facing the world today - in Ukraine , Iraq , Syria , Gaza , and Libya - are linked to America &apos;s new stance . 
Should matters come to a head in another seismic zone of world politics - namely , East Asia - the world would confront a global catastrophe stemming from the synchronicity of numerous regional crises . 
Obviously , it would be a crisis that no one could control or contain . 
The bipolar world of the Cold War is history ; 
George W. Bush squandered America &apos;s brief moment as the only true superpower . 
Economic globalization has so far not given rise to a framework for global governance . 
Perhaps we are in the middle of a chaotic process that will lead to a new international order - or , more likely , we are only at the beginning of that process . 
The debate about a future global order is taking place primarily in the West - specifically , North America and Europe . 
With the emerging powers largely trying to adapt their strategic positions to their national aspirations and interests , they are unwilling or unable to articulate the ideas and binding rules that should underpin a new international order . 
What , for example , does a Chinese or Indian formula for a new global order look like ? 
( In light of events in eastern Ukraine , it is perhaps advisable not to inquire too closely about Russia &apos;s views . ) 
The old transatlantic West seems to be alone in this respect , and therefore remains indispensable to preserving global stability . 
And yet the frequency of crises has also revived in Western countries an old , fundamental normative conflict between idealism and realism , or a value-based and an interest-based foreign policy . 
Though it has long been clear that Western polities rely on both , the contrast , however artificial , is now front and center once again . 
The crisis in Iraq , and the horrific violence of the Islamic State ( IS ) there and in Syria , is largely the result of the West &apos;s non-intervention in the Syrian civil war . 
The foreign-policy &quot; realists &quot; opposed a supposedly idealistic &quot; humanitarian &quot; intervention . 
The results are now clear : a humanitarian disaster and a grave challenge to the Arab Middle East as it has been constituted for the last century . 
The controversy in Europe about arming the Kurds seems bizarre in light of the situation in Iraq . 
Before our eyes , the IS is threatening to kill or enslave all members of religious and ethnic minorities who do not immediately convert to Islam or flee . 
With the world watching the IS threaten genocide , taking action is a moral duty . 
Questions regarding , for example , what happens after the fighting ends to the weapons given to the Kurds are of secondary importance . 
In terms of realpolitik , this argument is strengthened by the fact that Iraq &apos;s national army is all but incapable of defeating the IS , while the Kurdish militias could - but only if they are equipped with modern weapons . 
A victory for the IS in northern Iraq , or even just the capture of Erbil , the Kurdish Regional Government &apos;s capital , would cause not just an unparalleled humanitarian disaster ; it would also pose an enormous political threat to the greater Middle East and world peace . 
So the nexus between values and interests is self-evident and renders the conflict over fundamental foreign-policy principles irrelevant . 
This is particularly true for the European Union . 
A Middle East with a brutal , unfettered terrorist state at its center would be a direct threat to neighboring Europe &apos;s safety . 
So why not help those in Iraq who are willing and able to confront this peril ? 
But if only the West assumes responsibility for maintaining global order , won &apos;t it become overstretched , given the number and nature of the crises it faces ? 
Most of these struggles are not clashes between states ; they are asymmetrical conflicts , for which Western societies - including the US - are not equipped . 
These conflicts are further exacerbated by the ruthlessness that characterizes religious wars - just like those in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . 
So , yes , the West does indeed face a high risk of becoming overstretched . 
But what is the alternative , other than accelerating chaos , mushrooming security risks , and serial humanitarian disasters ? 
For the West - and for Europe first and foremost - this dilemma cannot be avoided . 
Today &apos;s accumulating crises , accompanied by America &apos;s strategic fatigue , are forcing Europe to define what role it will play in the future of Western - and global - stability . 
If the US can no longer bear the burden of Pax Americana , Europe must do more for collective security . 
But Europe cannot assume greater responsibility for global order and stability without unifying politically . 
Unfortunately , too many European leaders cannot - or will not - understand this .
