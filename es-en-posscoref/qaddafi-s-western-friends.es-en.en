Qaddafi &apos;s Western Friends 
VALLETTA , MALTA - With Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s regime in ruins and Qaddafi himself on the run , it is time to ponder just how he survived in power for so long . 
Greed for markets and money , it seems , often trumped the West &apos;s supposed concern for basic human rights . 
Major Western countries compromised themselves over Libya for decades . 
After all , Qaddafi survived President Ronald Reagan &apos;s punitive 1986 bombing raid on his compound only because former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and former Maltese Prime Minister Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici tipped him off . 
Craxi , of course , later found refuge in the embrace of another recently fallen Arab dictator , Tunisia &apos;s Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , when he fled Italy to escape imprisonment in 1992 . Bonnici , for his part , continued cementing his ties with the Libyan dictator until the very end , through his association with - wait for it - the Qaddafi Prize for Human Rights . 
Moral squalor also permeated Qaddafi &apos;s international &quot; rehabilitation &quot; in the years just before the Arab Spring . 
According to many observers , British Prime Minister Tony Blair &apos;s role in launching this process in 2004 was , almost from the start , motivated by a desire to do business with his regime . 
And more than oil was at stake . 
According to an Associated Press report , citing Foreign Office statistics , Libya purchased from the United Kingdom &quot; about £ 40 million ( $ 55 million ) worth of military and paramilitary equipment in the year ending September 30 , 2010 . &quot; 
Qaddafi &apos;s shopping list included &quot; sniper rifles , bulletproof vehicles , crowd-control ammunition , and tear gas . &quot; 
Certainly , that military hardware came in handy over the last six months . 
According to the same AP report : &quot; The Bush administration approved the sale of $ 3 million of materials to Libya in 2006 and $ 5.3 million in 2007 . 
In 2008 , Libya was allowed to import $ 46 million in armaments from the US . 
The approved goods included nearly 400 shipments of explosive and incendiary materials , 25,000 aircraft parts , 56,000 military electronics components and nearly 1,000 items of optical targeting and other guidance equipment . &quot; 
Nor was Germany immune to temptation . 
In 2004 , then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder inaugurated an oil well operated by the German company Wintershall in the Libyan Maghreb . Not to be outdone , French President Nicolas Sarkozy rushed off to Libya in 2008 to sell nuclear technology to Qaddafi . 
Italy imports 60 % of its oil and 40 % of its natural gas from Libya , and soon after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was re-elected in 2008 , he pledged to pay Qaddafi &apos;s regime € 250 million a year for 20 years in exchange for Libya &apos;s acceptance of all North African refugees seeking political asylum in Italy . 
Somehow , it seems , Berlusconi &apos;s name never fails to pop up when lucrative business transactions with Libya are discussed . 
Indeed , Berlusconi and Qaddafi have shared common personal business interests since 2009 , when Lafitrade , a Qaddafi family company , took a 10 % stake in Quinta Communications , a cinema production company which is 22 % owned by Berlusconi &apos;s company Fininvest . 
The case of little Malta , a couple of hundred kilometers from Libya &apos;s shores , could be just the tip of a much bigger iceberg of complicity . 
The Maltese government has just revealed that it froze Libyan government assets worth € 377 million , of which € 86 million belonged to the Qaddafi family or to entities in which they are majority stakeholders . 
Where has all this money been invested - only in Maltese banks , or are there any business concerns also involved ? 
And who are the Maltese partners ? 
Are politicians involved ? 
These questions matter because Libyan institutions in Malta used to offer &quot; aid &quot; to Maltese politicians in exchange for promoting Qaddafi &apos;s image . 
Last August 28 , the pro-Christian Democratic newspaper Il-Mument revealed CIA documentation of direct financing by the Qaddafi regime for activities organized by the Malta Labor Party during the 1989 Bush-Gorbachev summit held in Malta . 
The Labor Party &apos;s former treasurer , Joe Sammut , is most often mentioned for his connection with Qaddafi . 
According to The New York Post , Sammut handled hundreds of thousands of dollars on behalf of Mutassim Qaddafi , the Colonel &apos;s son and former security chief . 
Sammut , it is said , was involved in organizing parties featuring Snoop Dog , Nelly Furtado , and Enrique Iglesias , among others , for the entertainment of Qaddafi &apos;s sons . 
And it is not only Malta Labor Party politicians who allegedly have had connections with the Qaddafi clan . 
Malta &apos;s current European Union Commissioner , John Dalli , a former Christian Democrat MP and government minister , has openly admitted that he had &quot; established a strong network at the political and executive levels &quot; in Libya . 
Qaddafi and his family have been spreading money around Europe for years , buying influence and a blind eye from governments to the regime &apos;s human rights transgressions . The International Criminal Court in The Hague , one hopes , will one day bring Qaddafi , his family , and his minions to justice . 
But one should also hope that Libya &apos;s new government will expose the links between Western politicians and the Qaddafi regime . 
At that point , the court of public opinion , at the very least , can render its judgement on their actions .
