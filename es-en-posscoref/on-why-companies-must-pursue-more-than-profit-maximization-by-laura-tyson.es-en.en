The Business of Business is More Than Business 
BERKELEY - Earlier this year , Robert Simons of Harvard Business School fired off a blistering indictment of American businesses and business schools . 
American companies , he charged , have become softheaded , unfocused , and uncompetitive , in part because business schools are persuading them to embrace a long list of gauzy , feel-good values , such as social responsibility , environmental sustainability , and inclusiveness . 
Reviving a famous broadside by Milton Friedman back in 1970 , Simons argued that a company &apos;s only mission is to &quot; compete and win . &quot; 
Friedman , too , maintained that anything except making money is a distraction . 
It is difficult to deny the appealing simplicity of this argument . 
Who would deny that companies have a clear responsibility to earn profits for their shareholders , or that most shareholders invest primarily to make money , not to make the world a better place ? 
Why make things more complicated ? 
Because they are . 
First , most references to Friedman &apos;s argument overlook his recognition of constraints on business behavior . 
In his words , companies should &quot; make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society , both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom . &quot; 
In other words , compliance with the law is not enough . 
Some ethical constraints , such as basic human rights , reflect universal values ; others vary across time , location , and situations . 
Second , not all shareholders are alike . 
As Lynn Stout of Cornell Law School has put it , they are &quot; human beings with differing investment time frames , different interests ex ante and ex post , different degrees of diversification , and different attitudes toward sacrificing personal wealth to follow ethical rules and avoid harming others . &quot; 
They also differ in their attitudes toward risk . 
Maximizing shareholder value over a particular time period may satisfy the interests of some shareholders but violate the interests of others . 
The simple theory of profit maximization assumes away the conflicting interests of diverse shareholders . 
In reality , when businesses make decisions , they have to balance these interests . 
Third , businesses can also affect shareholders &quot; interests over time . 
Individuals gravitate to organizations that are compatible with their personal preferences . 
So companies can attract like-minded shareholders by espousing distinctive values , missions , and cultures . 
A recent study found that patient shareholders account for a larger portion of the shares of companies that espouse a long-term sustainability agenda relative to companies committed to share-price maximization . 
A growing number of investors are looking for responsible investment or &quot; impact investment &quot; opportunities that promise a mix of both financial and social returns . 
Fourth , every company both depends on and affects the societies in which it functions . 
The larger and more global the company , the larger and more global are its societal effects . 
Companies need customers who can afford their products , which means that businesses benefit from social stability and broad prosperity . 
Companies also need educated , hard-working , ethical employees and reliable , efficient suppliers . 
Businesses that ignore the broader social and environmental context in which they operate are likely to pay a price : reputational damage and loss of brand value , falling sales , difficulties in recruiting talent , lower worker productivity , corruption , tougher government regulation , or an increase in climate-change-related costs . 
There are now mobile phone apps that assess and grade large multinational companies &quot; supply chains for customers , investors , and public officials . 
Companies that score poorly risk losing sales and investors and triggering official regulatory or legal action . 
For example , Apple &apos;s brand was recently shaken by revelations about brutal workplace conditions at Foxconn factories in China , where most of its iPhones and iPads are assembled . 
In response to concerns among customers , employees , and shareholders , Apple has improved working conditions and agreed to regular reviews by an independent observer . 
Similarly , American and European clothing companies have been struggling to contain the reputational damage caused by lethal working conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories . 
The Friedman-Simons view that businesses &quot; sole social responsibility is to increase profits assumes that competent , non-corrupt governments both provide the public goods necessary for a prosperous economy and contain the negative externalities , like pollution and climate change , that result from private economic activities . 
In response to &quot; government failures , &quot; companies face pressure from a variety of stakeholders - including incompetent and corrupt governments themselves - to address broad social and environmental problems . 
But businesses cannot solve such problems by themselves . 
Solutions depend on innovative collaboration among private companies , non-profit organizations , and governments . 
This is already happening . 
For example , Walmart has teamed up with the Environmental Defense Fund to devise a strategy to eliminate 20 million tons of embedded carbon in the products on its shelves . 
Likewise , the European Union , the International Labor Organization , and the government of Bangladesh have cooperated with global companies on a pact to improve conditions for Bangladeshi garment workers . 
Companies have a responsibility to their shareholders , but they also have a responsibility to the societies that grant them the right to operate . 
And they can fulfill both responsibilities profitably . 
In fact , recent evidence suggests the opposite : social and environmental responsibility can be a source of long-term competitive advantage .
