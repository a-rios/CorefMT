What Hamas Wants 
As it struggles to form a government for the Palestinian territories , Hamas seems to be clutching to the Biblical verses in Ecclesiasties rather than the desires of the Quartet ( the United States , Russia , the European Union , and the United Nations ) charged with trying to bridge the Israeli-Palestinian divide . 
&quot; To everything there is a season , and a time to every purpose under heaven , &quot; fits Hamas &apos;s current agenda because its priorities and time frame are different from those of the international community , which is pressing it to make immediate political declarations , most importantly , to recognize Israel &apos;s right to exist . 
Hamas understands the political obligations that it must meet in order to be fully accepted in the world community , but its leaders prefer to wait until they are fully empowered before exploring these issues . 
Moreover , Hamas , like most Palestinians , is trying to evaluate the best way forward in the peace process . 
In their eyes , the current process produced years of inaction in negotiations , allowing for continued occupation and theft of Palestinian lands . 
As an example , Hamas leaders point out that in the past year , with the moderate Mahmoud Abbas in power , the Israelis have not even negotiated with him . 
So , from their point of view , Israel is not going to rush to negotiate with any Palestinian authority , whether it recognizes Israel &apos;s right to exist or not . 
Instead , the newly elected Hamas leaders are preoccupied with basic issues like preserving internal unity among Palestinians , ending lawlessness , ensuring greater respect for the rule of law , fighting corruption , and reforming Palestinian governance . 
Most Palestinians are in complete agreement with these priorities . 
Indeed , the latest public opinion poll among Palestinians shows that 73 % feel as secure as or even more secure than they did before the election . 
Of the 709 randomly selected Palestinians who were surveyed , 30 % said that they hope the new Hamas government tackles corruption . 
Twenty-two percent said that they hope Ismael Haniyeh , Hamas &apos;s designated prime minister , will end the chaos in Palestinian towns and provide internal security and the rule of law . 
Almost one in five hoped that unemployment would be addressed . 
Ironically , while the majority of Palestinians voted a religious movement into power , only 1 % of those polled said that Hamas &apos;s priority should be to implement Islamic law in Palestine . 
While the poll showed that an overwhelming 73 % of Palestinians still support a peace deal with Israel , they are not confident that any deal is around the corner . 
Eleven percent of the respondents said that the prisoner issue should be the most important priority for the new government - nearly twice the number who said that a peace settlement with Israel should be the top priority . 
More than 8,000 Palestinians are held in Israeli prisons , many without charge or trial . 
Nevertheless , 62 % of Palestinians said that they believe Hamas should change its position regarding recognition of Israel . 
It is difficult for an international superpower like the US or a regional one like Israel to realize that a group or a people dare to have priorities different from theirs . 
But Palestinians have shown over the years that they are a proud people who will not cave in just because the other side is militarily or politically more powerful . 
In any case , Hamas cannot be blamed for using America &apos;s push for democracy to attain popular goals . 
After all , anyone who wants to be re-elected must give priority to the needs of their own people and not necessarily to the demands of the international community . 
Only when elected representatives deal with the day-to-day issues that face their people can they begin to tackle external negotiations . 
What is clear is that Hamas and the Palestinians want an end to the 38-year Israeli occupation , and that selling Palestinians the same plans that were sold to the PLO will not work . 
If Israel and the international community are genuinely serious about ending the occupation , Hamas will cooperate . 
While Hamas must be flexible in dealing with legitimate requests by the international community , the international community is obliged to provide an effective road map to peace . 
Once Palestinians are convinced that there is an opportunity for genuine peace and independence , they will press Hamas to act on it - or elect a party that will . 
Clearly , the international community has lacked the political will to press Israel to change . 
For the time being , and until this will is found , the world should give Hamas time to deal with the daily needs of Palestinians . 
Once the possibility of serious negotiations appears , a Hamas that has improved the lives of ordinary Palestinians will be in a position to carry out the negotiations that will be needed for a historic compromise .
