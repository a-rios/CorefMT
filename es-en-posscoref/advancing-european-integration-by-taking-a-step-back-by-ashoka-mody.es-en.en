A Rest Stop for Europe 
PRINCETON - Last week , in a highly anticipated speech , German President Joachim Gauck cautioned against the blind pursuit of an &quot; ever-closer &quot; European Union , acknowledging that the growing inequality among member states is generating &quot; a sense of unease , even unmistakable anger , &quot; and increasing the risk of national humiliation . 
He pointed out that , in addition to the economic crisis , there is &quot; a crisis of confidence in Europe as a political project . &quot; 
While Gauck made clear that he remains decidedly pro-Europe , he highlighted the need for closer reflection about Europe &apos;s future - and especially that of the eurozone . 
Standing on the verge of greater integration , Europeans are hesitant , &quot; unsure whether we should really stride out on the onward journey . &quot; 
Addressing this hesitation , he declared , will require a thoughtful , nuanced understanding of what &quot; more Europe &quot; actually means . 
Gauck may not have gone far enough : At this point , an ever-closer union may be a political mirage . 
Any meaningful progress toward stabilizing the eurozone would require a significant - potentially open-ended - financial commitment , and the EU is not politically ready to cross that threshold . 
Repeatedly pretending to move forward , then pulling back at the critical point , exacerbates political uncertainty and economic vulnerability . 
Rather than indecisively pursuing more unity , this may be the moment to restore effective sovereignty to national authorities in eurozone countries . 
Such a move would alleviate anxiety in the short term , thereby giving Europeans the opportunity to regroup in preparation for future steps toward a more integrated Europe and a more resilient euro . 
To this end , eurozone leaders must take three key steps . 
The dysfunctional system of European fiscal governance should be dismantled ; fiscal responsibility should be returned to member states ; and , to minimize the risk of excessive future lending , private lenders should be required to bear the losses implied by unsustainable sovereign debt . 
The case against European fiscal governance is straightforward . 
Before the crisis , the single-minded emphasis on reducing national budget deficits to less than 3 % of GDP led to extensive abuse . 
Either the target was openly flouted , as it was in leading economies like Germany and France , or the data were manipulated to obscure problems ( a common practice throughout the eurozone , not just in Greece ) . 
And the belief in economic growth as a fiscal panacea led to unrealistically optimistic GDP forecasts . 
When the crisis struck , the 3 % deficit target became the focal point for unrelenting austerity - a form of what anthropologist Clifford Geertz described as &quot; involution , &quot; which occurs when a process intensifies rather than changes in response to external or internal pressure . 
In other words , EU leaders began to complicate fiscal governance , ultimately creating an inefficient , inescapable labyrinth of regulation and bureaucracy . 
As fiscal metrics become increasingly intricate , monitoring efforts will become ever easier to undermine . 
The case for returning fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also strong - and not only because centralized fiscal authority has proved to be so inefficient . 
With citizens of distressed countries bearing the fiscal burden of the crisis , the enduring presumption that they will not act responsibly is patronizing , at best . 
And the current strategy of exchanging goodies for good behavior encourages game-playing and dilutes responsibility . 
While the risk that governments will succumb to fiscal temptation remains , citizens &quot; current suffering is likely to deter future excesses . 
National fiscal sovereignty would facilitate the final crucial step : building a more mature relationship with private lenders . 
The eurozone was founded on the &quot; no bailout &quot; principle : if member states could not repay their debts , lenders would bear the losses . 
But lenders chose - correctly , as it turned out - to disregard that threat . 
Instead of enforcing the no-bailout principle and establishing a precedent , debtor countries used official loans to repay private creditors . 
As a result , these countries have condemned themselves to continued austerity , low growth , and high debt , while diminishing any future incentive for private lenders to impose fiscal discipline on sovereign borrowers . 
Only by shifting the burden of responsibility back onto private lenders can debtor countries escape this quagmire . 
In the United States , each state is responsible for its fiscal management , without being forced to comply with a single , overarching template . 
The states are not regulated by the federal government ; they are disciplined by the knowledge that no one will repay their debts for them . 
And the system seems to work : entering the crisis , US states had significantly lower deficit and debt ratios than the eurozone &apos;s vulnerable member states . 
So far , European integration has largely been a process of &quot; falling forward , &quot; with each stumble serving as a lesson from which a stronger union emerges . 
But , while this uncertain approach may suffice as a basis for declarations of good intentions , it does not inspire the confidence required for countries to make the profound financial commitment that is now needed . 
Europeans should have the chance to regain their footing . 
Transferring fiscal responsibility back to national authorities would not only mean the end of counterproductive efforts to manage fiscal affairs centrally ; it would also diminish the sense of frustration and lack of control that is fueling Euro-skepticism . 
In short , taking a step back would provide an opportunity to reset , to reflect , and to plot the best course toward a more stable , more integrated Europe . 
For a fiscal union to function - however unlikely that outcome may be - a solid foundation is crucial . 
As Gauck explained , Europeans &quot; are pausing to ... equip &#91; themselves &#93; both intellectually and emotionally for the next step , which will require &#91; them &#93; to enter uncharted territory . &quot; 
Giving Europeans the time and space to choose more Europe would reinforce the core values upon which integration has rested for more than six decades . 
Continuing to stumble forward , however , would inevitably lead to a debilitating , if not fatal , fall .
