Renminbi and Reality 
BEIJING - The exchange rate of the renminbi has once again become a target of the United States Congress . 
China-bashing , it seems , is back in fashion in America . 
But this round of China-bashing appears stranger than the last one . 
When Congress pressed China for a large currency revaluation in 2004-2005 , China &apos;s current-account surplus was rising at an accelerating pace . 
This time , China &apos;s current-account surplus has been shrinking significantly , owing to the global recession caused by the collapse of the US financial bubble . 
China &apos;s total annual surplus ( excluding Hong Kong ) now stands at $ 200 billion , down by roughly one-third from 2008 . 
In GDP terms , it fell even more , because GDP grew by 8.7 % in 2008 . 
Back then , pegging the renminbi to the dollar pushed down China &apos;s real effective exchange rate , because the dollar was losing value against other currencies , such as the euro , sterling , and yen . 
But this time , with the dollar appreciating against other major currencies in recent months , the relatively fixed rate between the dollar and the renminbi has caused China &apos;s currency to strengthen in terms of its real effective rate . 
Of course , there are other sources of friction now that did not seem as pressing five years ago . 
America &apos;s internal and external deficits remain large , and its unemployment rate is both high and rising . 
Someone needs to take responsibility , and , as US politicians don &apos;t want to blame themselves , the best available scapegoat is China &apos;s exchange rate , which has not appreciated against the US dollar in the past 18 months . 
But would a revaluation of the renminbi solve America &apos;s problems ? 
Recent evidence suggests that it would not . 
Between July 2005 and September 2008 ( before Lehmann Brothers &quot; bankruptcy ) , the renminbi appreciated 22 % against the dollar . 
Most economists agree that the renminbi is probably undervalued . 
But the extent of misalignment remains an open question . 
The economist Menzie Chinn , using purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rates , reckoned the renminbi &apos;s undervaluation to be 40 % . 
But , after the World Bank revised China &apos;s GDP in PPP terms downward by 40 % , that undervaluation disappeared . 
Nick Lardy and Morris Goldstein suggest that the renminbi was probably undervalued only by 12-16 % at the end of 2008 . 
And Yang Yao of Beijing University has put the misalignment at less than 10 % . 
But assume that China does revalue its currency sharply , by , say , 40 % . 
If the adjustment came abruptly , Chinese companies would suffer a sudden loss of competitiveness and no longer be able to export . 
The market vacuum caused by the exit of Chinese products would probably be filled quickly by other low-cost countries like Vietnam and India . 
American companies cannot compete with these countries either . 
So no new jobs would be added in the US , but the inflation rate would increase . 
Now assume that the renminbi appreciates only moderately , so that China continues to export to the US at higher prices but lower profits . 
This would push up inflation rates significantly , forcing the US Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy , thereby quite possibly undermining America &apos;s recovery , which remains unsteady . 
New difficulties in the US and China , the world &apos;s two largest economies , would have a negative impact on global investor confidence , hurting US employment even more . 
In both scenarios , US employment would not increase and the trade deficit would not diminish . 
So then what ? 
The historical evidence from the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , when the US consistently pressed Japan to revalue the yen , suggests that US politicians would most likely demand that the renminbi appreciate even more . 
The exchange rate measures the relationship between at least two currencies , whose values are based on the productivity and domestic balance of their respective national economies . 
Causes for misalignment may be found on both sides . 
If the US dollar needs to devalue because of fundamental disequilibrium in the US economy , the problems cannot be fixed by lowering the dollar &apos;s value alone . 
Of course , there are problems with China &apos;s external imbalance with the US , such as excessive national savings ( which account for 51 % of China &apos;s GDP ) and distortions in the prices of energy and other resources . 
All those problems contribute to the imbalance , and China should fix them . 
But we should realize that there are fundamental causes for the imbalance on the US side as well , such as over-consumption financed by excessive leverage and high budget deficits . 
Only when both sides make serious efforts to fix their domestic fundamentals will the imbalances be reduced in a serious and sustained way . 
Short-run exchange-rate adjustments simply cannot fix negative long-term trends . 
China may resume a &quot; managed float &quot; of its exchange rate , particularly if the uncertainty of the overall post-crisis economic situation diminishes . 
In choosing whether or not to do so , its policymakers may weigh factors ranging from China &apos;s international responsibilities to the potential damage of foreign protectionism or even a &quot; trade war . &quot; 
What is certain , however , is that China &apos;s politicians have a domestic agenda just like the Americans . 
The key element of that agenda is to maintain employment growth . 
One-third of China &apos;s labor force remains in agriculture , earning only about half what migrant workers in China &apos;s booming cities earn . 
( Per-capita earnings for China &apos;s farmers may rise to $ 770 if the renminbi appreciates by 10 % , but of course that is only a US dollar-term revision , with Chinese farmers feeling no increase at all ) . 
Getting more farmers into better-paid manufacturing and service-industry jobs will mean not only a reduction in poverty , but lower income disparity . 
By any moral standard , that goal is at least as important as anything on America &apos;s agenda .
