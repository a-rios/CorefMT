The Kingdom and the Afghan Chaos 
LONDON - In his quest to stabilize his country , Afghanistan &apos;s President Hamid Karzai , dressed in white robes , arrived last week in Mecca on what can only be called a diplomatic pilgrimage . 
Although Karzai undoubtedly spent time praying at Islam &apos;s holiest site , his mission was intended to prove more than his piety . 
So what diplomatic or financial gain was Karzai seeking ? 
Why travel to Saudi Arabia at the very moment that US President Barack Obama &apos;s military surge has become operational ? 
Can Saudi Arabia play a serious role in resolving his country &apos;s increasingly bloody conflict ? 
One card the Saudis can play is their severe Islamic ideology , which the Taliban shares . 
Indeed , the Saudis , backed by Pakistani military intelligence , nurtured the madrasas that educated the Taliban before their march to power in the 1990 &quot; s . 
In theory , the Saudis also have the economic clout both to entice and rein in the Taliban . 
Being present at the Taliban &apos;s creation , the Saudis know how to talk to its leaders . 
Moreover , Saudi Arabia has been increasingly willing to use Mecca as a forum to attempt to resolve regional political disputes . 
Only recently , it seems , has the Saudi regime discovered the great soft power that its custodianship of Mecca and Medina - Islam &apos;s holiest sites - provides . 
Mecca has , indeed , become a potent venue for political summitry and a tool for mediation if not media manipulation . 
In October 2006 , for example , Mecca was used to host talks among Iraq &apos;s warring sectarian factions . 
In February 2007 , the short-lived Palestinian government of national unity was created as the result of a summit there . 
In December 2007 , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad performed the Hajj at the personal invitation of King Abdullah , marking the first time a head of state of the Islamic Republic was able to do so . 
In October 2008 , the Kingdom held mediation talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government following Karzai &apos;s request to King Abdullah , whom Karzai describes as &quot; the leader of the Muslim world . &quot; 
The Taliban could not spurn an invitation to negotiate in Mecca . 
Today , the Saudi regime uses Mecca &apos;s status among Muslims in a calculated way designed to reassert the Kingdom &apos;s paramount status as the Islamic world &apos;s &quot; leading state . &quot; 
Through the strategic deployment of Mecca , it is hoped that the region &apos;s radicals - Iraqi Shi &apos;a , Hamas , Hezbollah , the Taliban , and the Iranians - will undergo a kind of &quot; healing &quot; as they gain access to Islam &apos;s holiest sites . 
At the same time , potential Sunni Arab rivals like Hashemite Jordan and Egypt are reminded that Saudi Arabia remains the ideological heartland of Islam . 
But Saudi soft power extends beyond custodianship of Mecca and Medina , for Saudi diplomacy is also backed by the largest oil reserves in the world . 
This could help the Taliban accept negotiations - and perhaps even renounce violence - if Saudi money is deployed to assist Taliban fighters create new lives for themselves . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s diplomatic mission in Afghanistan is an essential step in its efforts to &quot; whiten its face &quot; and restore its reputation in the West , particularly the United States , which has not forgotten that the majority of the September 11 , 2001 , hijackers were Saudi citizens , and that the government failed to manage the Taliban during the years leading up to those attacks . 
The subsequent fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan as a result of the US-led invasion embarrassed the Saudi regime , because it had recognized the Taliban government in 1997 and supported it ideologically and financially . 
Indeed , Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries , alongside Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates , to form diplomatic relations with the Taliban government . 
Although bilateral tensions began to build from 1998 onward , due to the Taliban &apos;s refusal to turn over Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia ( his homeland ) , the Kingdom still hoped that petro-dollar diplomacy might solve this problem . 
The Saudis even invited Taliban officials - including Mullah Omar - to perform the Hajj . 
Mohammed Rabbani , the Taliban prime minister , did so that year , yet his government still failed to hand over bin Laden . 
For the Saudis , a bid to rehabilitate the Taliban , despite the damage they have caused to the Kingdom &apos;s diplomatic standing in the West , serves a strategic purpose . 
The Kingdom has suffered from the rise of the Shi &apos;a in neighboring Iraq and is keen to maintain Sunni supremacy in the Islamic lands further to the east . 
Yet they see that , under Karzai , Saudi influence has declined in Afghanistan since 2001 , while that of the Iranians has strengthened . 
The Iranians vehemently oppose the return of Taliban control over Afghanistan &apos;s government . 
Culturally , ethnically , and linguistically , Afghans are more closely related to Iranians than they are to Arabs . 
Apart from sharing their ideology with the Taliban and their past recognition of the Taliban government , the Saudis lack any understanding of the diversity and fluidity of Afghan society . 
Saudi ambivalence about Karzai , despite his being a Sunni Muslim , was on open display during his visit to the Kingdom . 
Indeed , King Abdullah sent only a junior prince to accompany Karzai in Mecca , a studied diplomatic affront . 
So the question for the Saudis now is how to get the Taliban invited to the negotiating table . Their best hope is to be found in Pakistan , which views Afghanistan in much the same strategic way that Saudi Arabia does , but with India , instead of Iran , being the rival for influence . 
Given the Obama administration &apos;s belief that Pakistan is essential to any solution in Afghanistan , the Saudis have probably placed their bet correctly in choosing a diplomatic partner for determining the Afghan end game . 
With only 18 months left before Obama &apos;s promised draw-down of US forces , Western strategy is clearly aimed at splitting the &quot; good &quot; Taliban from &quot; bad &quot; Al Qaeda . 
But , given Saudi Arabia &apos;s past record of supporting radicalism in Afghanistan , it is highly unlikely that the Kingdom can help secure this aim .
