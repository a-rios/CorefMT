Nuclear Power in the Balance 
VIENNA - I am often asked if nuclear power is safe . 
My standard answer is : &quot; Yes - as safe as air travel . &quot; 
Plane crashes do occur , but highly effective safety systems ensure that they are extremely rare - so rare that most of us board airplanes without worrying that we might not reach our destination . 
The same is true of nuclear power , although there are always concerns that a severe accident could have major human and environmental consequences . 
The question is of more than merely academic interest . 
The future of nuclear power will be one of the key issues on the table at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December . 
Global nuclear power capacity could double in the next 20 years . 
Thirty countries already use nuclear power and many of them , including China , Russia , and India , plan major expansions in their existing programs . 
Around 60 other countries - most of them in the developing world - have informed the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that they are interested in introducing nuclear power . 
Nuclear power has obvious attractions for both rich and poor countries . 
The developing world desperately needs access to electricity to help lift people out of poverty and ensure sustainable development . 
In some African countries , electricity consumption per capita is around 50 kilowatt-hours per year , compared with an average of 8,600 kilowatt-hours in the OECD countries . 
All countries are concerned about security of energy supplies as reserves of fossil fuels dwindle , as well as about the sometimes wild fluctuations in the price of oil , coal , and gas . 
Climate change is also a growing concern . 
Nuclear power is not a panacea for all of the world &apos;s energy problems , but it will continue to be part of the global energy mix for the foreseeable future . 
As with other technologies , countries must weigh the costs and benefits of nuclear power . 
Every country has the right to introduce nuclear power , as well as a responsibility to do it correctly . 
The IAEA is not a lobbyist for nuclear power . 
Our role is to provide impartial information and advice . 
We impress upon potential newcomers the need to plan properly , to train the required number of highly skilled nuclear engineers and scientists , to build the complex technical infrastructure , to establish independent and effective regulatory bodies , and to adhere to international safety standards and security guidelines . 
This can take a decade or two . 
The risks to people and the environment that arise from nuclear power are well understood . 
They can be assessed and controlled . 
An extensive global safety regime is now in place that includes binding international legal instruments , internationally agreed safety standards , peer review and assessment , nationally integrated systems of governmental and regulatory control , and research and development . 
As a result , nuclear safety has improved significantly since the world &apos;s worst nuclear 
There is always room for improvement , and constant vigilance is needed . 
It is essential , therefore , to make sure that a true culture of safety takes root worldwide , not least in countries new to nuclear power . 
The reactor designs available today are nothing like the Chernobyl reactors . 
To ensure that nuclear facilities are operated to the highest standards of safety , measures are in place , for example , to control the release of radioactive material to the environment , to prevent the occurrence of events that might lead to a loss of control over a nuclear reactor core , and to mitigate the consequences of such events if they were to occur . 
What still needs to be done ? 
Nuclear safety is primarily a national responsibility , but , since risks transcend national borders , close international cooperation is needed . 
We must work to extend the coverage of international conventions and codes of conduct . 
In some countries , we still see a troubling combination of old reactors and weak regulators . 
Progress is needed in demonstrating the safety of long-term disposal of radioactive waste . 
Although IAEA safety standards are the recognized international benchmark and are now being incorporated into European Union law , they are voluntary , not binding . 
The same is true of the peer-review missions , made up of experts from around the world , which we put together to candidly assess the safety of a country &apos;s nuclear power program . 
All countries should accept the safety standards and regular peer-review missions , which , ideally , should be made binding . 
Energy is the engine of development , and development sustains life . 
We must do our utmost to ensure that peaceful nuclear energy , when a country chooses to pursue it , remains at the service of humanity .
