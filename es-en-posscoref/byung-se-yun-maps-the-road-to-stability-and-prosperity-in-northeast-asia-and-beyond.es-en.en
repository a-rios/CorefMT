Korean Unification and Global Peace 
SEOUL - While the United Nations celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2015 , Koreans will lament 70 years of national division . 
Considering all of the challenges and opportunities that the divided peninsula faces - and will continue to confront in the coming years - unification remains an important goal that we must continue to pursue . 
Founded formally in 1948 under UN auspices , the then-fledgling Republic of Korea immediately became engulfed in Cold War power politics , which hampered its efforts to join the UN - a goal not achieved until 1991 . 
Since then , however , the Republic has more than made up for its late arrival . 
It is playing an active role in the UN - the Security Council , the Economic and Social Council , and the Human Rights Council - and it is participating in numerous initiatives related to peacekeeping , development cooperation , climate change , non-proliferation , and human rights . 
During this time , the international community has also dramatically changed . 
Globalization and technological transformation have deepened interdependence , and yet insecurity , inequality , injustice , and intolerance remain undiminished worldwide . 
Two decades after the Rwandan genocide , we continue to bear witness to human cruelty and horror - in Syria , South Sudan , and the Central African Republic , for example . 
Meanwhile , a billion or so of the world &apos;s poorest people , including women and children , are barely surviving . 
Northeast Asia has its share of trouble . 
The latter &apos;s pursuit of nuclear arms is particularly worrying . 
On its part , the United States is now &quot; rebalancing &quot; toward Asia . 
Growing conflicts over history , territory , and maritime security , combined with an ugly resurgence of nationalism , risk triggering military confrontation , quite possibly through political miscalculation . 
Left unattended by policymakers and peacemakers , Northeast Asia &apos;s tensions could undermine the region &apos;s flourishing economy . 
It is in this challenging environment that the Republic of Korea &apos;s president , Park Geun-hye , took office in 2013 . 
Her foreign policy - called &quot; Trustpolitik &quot; - aims to transform this atmosphere of suspicion and conflict into one of confidence and cooperation , and to build &quot; a new Korean Peninsula , a new Northeast Asia , and a new world . &quot; 
The greatest obstacle to achieving this transformation is the North Korean nuclear question . 
Today &apos;s most urgent task therefore must be to prevent this from happening , and then to check further advances in the North &apos;s nuclear weapons and delivery capabilities . 
The semblance of peace on the Korean Peninsula remains fragile , and South Korea &apos;s government has engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts to rally friends and partners in the region and worldwide to deter the North . 
The UN Security Council has adopted a series of resolutions to impose extensive sanctions , following the North &apos;s three previous nuclear tests . 
Any further provocation will bring the full force of the organization &apos;s sanctions to bear . 
Under these circumstances - in addition to the dire human rights and humanitarian situation in North Korea - Park laid out her vision for a unified Korea . 
In a recent speech in Dresden , she proposed three concrete and action-oriented proposals to the North that would address its humanitarian problems , build infrastructure for the common welfare and prosperity of the two Koreas , and promote integration of the Korean people . 
The humanitarian component of this strategy could be implemented regardless of political and security considerations . 
For example , it would involve implementing the UN &apos;s 1,000-day project for maternal health and infant nutrition , aimed at ending the North &apos;s chronically high rate of infant malnutrition . 
We can only hope that North Korea will respond positively to our proposal . 
Korea &apos;s road to unification will undoubtedly be difficult , and will require the international community &apos;s support . 
In return , the new , unified country that we aspire to build will serve the interests of its neighbors and those of the wider international community in promoting global peace and prosperity . 
There is a recent precedent for this vision , and thus reason to be hopeful . 
Some 23 years ago , the geopolitical context that sustained the division of the two Germanys changed radically . 
Similarly , the day will come when Korea &apos;s two UN nameplates will be replaced with one .
