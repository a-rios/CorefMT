The Roots of China &apos;s Rapid Recovery 
BEIJING - China &apos;s GDP is estimated to have grown 8.7 % year on year in 2009 - once again the highest rate in the world - with the fourth-quarter increase reaching 10.7 % , compared to 6.3 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 . 
For much of the world , China &apos;s ability to shrug off the global financial crisis and maintain a strong growth trajectory in 2010 and 2011 seems too easy . 
But securing China &apos;s growth has been anything but easy . 
The strong , decisive , and deftly timed stimulus policies at the start of the financial crisis did , of course , play a major role in China &apos;s quick rebound . 
As early as October 2008 , when the crisis first hit , China &apos;s government adopted a comprehensive policy package designed to prevent the economy from sliding further . 
The fiscal deficit was equivalent to 3 % of GDP in 2009 , which generated 3 % GDP growth , while the deficit in 2008 was literally zero . 
The country &apos;s so-called &quot; moderate relax &quot; monetary policy also played its part by allowing bank lending to expand by almost 34 % in 2009 , with M2 money supply growing by 27 % . 
Monetary growth may increase inflationary pressures and the risk of an asset bubble down the road , but it helped ensure that China &apos;s economy did not fall into a vicious downturn when the financial crisis hit . 
Other policy moves aimed at boosting demand in the housing and auto market also proved effective . 
But China &apos;s crisis management is only part of the story . 
It does not explain why other countries that took even stronger measures failed to generate a similarly rapid recovery , or why China &apos;s government seems to have more room than others for policy maneuver . 
China &quot; s budget was actually in surplus and its government debt-to-GDP ratio was only 21 % before the crisis ( now it is about 24 % ) , much lower than any other major economy . 
Moreover , the level of non-performing loans in Chinese banks was quite low when Lehman Brothers collapsed , which allowed Chinese policymakers to let it increase in order to battle the crisis . 
Moreover , the Chinese economy was in good shape when the global crisis hit . 
Cautious macroeconomic management during China &apos;s boom , including early self-adjustment , put China in a favorable position . 
China &apos;s economy had been booming since 2004 , but officials did not step aside and &quot; let the market decide . &quot; 
Instead , they adopted counter-cyclical measures aimed at preventing the economy from overheating . 
The government increasingly tightened its policies as the economy continued to surge ahead due to asset bubbles , high local-government investment spending , and buoyant demand in global markets for Chinese goods . 
Overheating in the housing market was brought to an end in late September 2007 , nipping a nascent nationwide bubble , and a stock-market bubble was punctured the following month . 
Moreover , numerous local investment projects were stopped , while measures to slow the growth of net exports - including a 20 % revaluation of the renminbi and a significant cut in tariff rebates for exports - brought down annual export growth from around 30 % to a more reasonable 17 % in late 2007 . 
As a result , by the fourth quarter of 2007 - one year before the global financial crisis hit - China &apos;s economy started to cool . 
The quarterly growth rate decelerated from 13 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 9 % in the third quarter of 2009 . 
In short , it is because China began its adjustment one year before the global crisis that its economy emerged earlier than other countries . 
The lesson is that booms have to be managed adeptly , and that financiers have to be supervised in their pursuit of ever-higher returns . 
Of course , China &apos;s economy has structural and institutional problems - what developing country does not ? 
China &apos;s macroeconomic policies are probably still too &quot; administrative . &quot; 
When many of the most important actors in an economy are insensitive to market price signals , as they are in China , economic policy will need to be administrative in order to deal effectively with those players . 
To be sure , the authorities have sometimes been overly cautious . 
In fact , when a country &apos;s economic growth is continuously above 9 % , policymakers probably cannot be too cautious . 
No doubt , government macroeconomic management that is too strong may delay necessary market-oriented reforms . 
For a developing economy like China , it is better to have a government that plays an active role in avoiding the ups and downs that the Western economies experienced in their early days - and are still experiencing today .
