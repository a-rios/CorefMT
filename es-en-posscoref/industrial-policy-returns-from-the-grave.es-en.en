Industrial Policy Returns from the Grave 
PALO ALTO - One of the worst responses by officials to the financial crisis and deep recession has been to revive &quot; industrial policy . &quot; 
Once again , governments are using subsidies , mandates , regulation , and capital investment to pick industrial winners and losers , rather than using a broad , even-handed approach . 
The new round of industrial policy is occurring in advanced economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom , which long resisted its worst excesses , France , which long promoted national &quot; champions , &quot; and emerging economies such as Brazil and China . 
For example , French President Nicholas Sarkozy plans to borrow 52 billion euros to promote what his government guesses or hopes will be &quot; growth industries . &quot; 
Even central banks , especially the US Federal Reserve , have been supporting particular firms and types of assets because of the financial crisis . 
Industrial policy is appealing to politicians who can favor key constituencies while claiming to be helping the economy as a whole . 
But it usually does far more harm than good . 
Perhaps the most contentious area of industrial policy is governments &quot; role in research and development . 
While governments have an obvious interest in military-related R D , markets function well when the returns are received and the risks borne by private owners . 
For basic scientific research , the potential return will be broadly available to any and all , whether or not they paid for it and bore the risk of failure . 
Because private investors are unable to appropriate the returns , private markets invest too little in basic science . 
That is why economists of all political persuasions agree that governments should fund basic science and technology . 
When I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers for President George H.W. Bush , we doubled the budget of the National Science Foundation . Governments , however , risk crowding out private R D , the returns from which could be fully appropriated by firms , not only through their own use , but by patenting and licensing the technology to other firms . 
The appropriate place to draw the line conceptually is at pre-competitive , generic science and technology . 
Governments should fund R D until it reaches the stage where private firms could appropriate ( the bulk of ) the benefit . 
It should also remain generic research , thereby maintaining a level playing field for commercial applications . 
For example , the computer-linking technology that created the Internet was funded by an agency of the US Defense Department . 
But it would be foolish for the government to subsidize a particular search engine or social-networking platform . 
Governments should not be in the game of using subsidies , taxes , regulation , mandates , loans , and investments to pick particular winners . 
It simply doesn &apos;t work , and , worse still , it crowds out or stifles potentially valuable competing technologies . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , advocates of industrial policy praised its extensive use in Japan . 
But the attempt by Japan &apos;s powerful trade and industry , and finance ministries to micromanage the economy is one reason the Japanese wound up with a burst asset bubble , a lost decade , three recessions , and by far the highest public debt-to-GDP ratio of any advanced economy . 
Back then , America &apos;s advocates of industrial policy - often called &quot; Atari Democrats , &quot; after the long since eclipsed maker of early computer games - didn &apos;t even get their facts straight about Japan . While there was a &quot; fifth generation &quot; computer project and one on HDTV , the vast bulk of Japanese subsidies went not to new technologies , but to old-line , high-employment industries like agriculture , mining , and heavy manufacturing . 
Similar economic problems permeate the history of the last few decades , from South Korea to Western Europe to the US . 
In 1980 , President Jimmy Carter ran for reelection on a platform of &quot; national reconstruction banks , &quot; industrial policy , and a council headed by labor and business leaders that would decide where to invest tens of billions of dollars . 
He was trounced by the free-marketeer , Ronald Reagan . 
But even in the US , industrial policy is making a comeback . 
President George W. Bush spent years and billions of dollars pushing a hydrogen car . It got nowhere , and , while hydrogen may eventually become commercially viable for stationery sources , its use for transportation must still overcome some serious obstacles ( including flammability and combustibility that is an order of magnitude greater than that of gasoline ) . 
America &apos;s massive $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus , ostensibly designed to combat recession and create jobs ( but so far ineffective ) contained immense sums for subsidies to particular industries and technologies , almost $ 40 billion for clean-energy programs alone . 
While firms and investors take the funds , private financing for commercial alternative-energy projects is widely available ; an immense number of venture-capital funds worldwide are devoted to alternative and clean energy . 
Government should set general goals for energy and the environment and then let entrepreneurs , investors , and consumers decide how best to achieve them . 
It should fund basic scientific and technological research applicable to these issues . 
But no policy makes sense if it cannot be sustained without long-term government support . 
Whatever the dubious temporary merits of reviving industrial policy in a deep recession , governments need an exit strategy before the programs become permanently entrenched and develop powerful rent-seeking constituencies . 
Vast amounts of debt-financed spending will require higher future taxes , which will divert capital and labor from higher-value uses than can be sustained without permanent government lifelines . 
Industrial policy failed miserably in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
Allowing governments to pick industrial winners and losers is just as bad an idea today .
