Will Europe &apos;s Sinners Save Themselves ? 
When German officials pushed in the 1990 &quot; s for the Stability and Growth Pact as a prerequisite for giving up the Deutschmark , they did not anticipate that Germany would be the first country to violate the pact . 
While the pact says that a government cannot borrow more than 3 % of its GDP , Germany &apos;s public-finance deficit reached 3.7 % of GDP and more from 2002 to 2004 . 
There have been more sinners , though . 
France also violated the pact &apos;s fiscal criterion in these three years . 
Portugal did so in 2001 and the Netherlands in 2003 . 
Greece cheated by manipulating its statistics : while the reported deficits were below the limit , the country had to admit that the true deficit from 2000 to 2004 was 4.3 % on average and never below 3.7 % . 
Other countries have been more successful due to fortunate circumstances . 
Italy , for example , not only benefited from its government &apos;s creative accounting , but also from the fact the euro led to interest-rate convergence in Europe . 
Long-term interest rates for Italian government bonds declined from about 12 % to about 4 % in the ten years from 1994-95 to 2004-05 . 
With the Italian debt / GDP ratio currently at roughly 106 % , lower borrowing costs reduced the public debt ratio by more than eight percentage points . 
Indeed , other things being equal , had the interest rate not declined , Italy would have had a public-finance deficit of 11 % of GDP in 2004 rather than the reported 3 % , and its debt / GDP ratio would , of course , have been much higher . 
It was the euro , not the Italian government , that helped Italy satisfy the Stability and Growth Pact . 
But now Italy seems to have run into trouble again and also wants to weaken the pact . 
The reform proposals that are currently being debated are adventurous to say the least , because they all seem to center around the question of which government expenses should be exempt from the calculation of the deficit . 
The list of exemptions includes a country &apos;s net payments to the EU , education expenses , public investment in general , or exceptional expenses . 
The pact would become meaningless under such circumstances . 
The idea of the pact was , after all , to impose firm borrowing constraints on European governments to prevent them from saddling future generations with today &apos;s liabilities or from one day adopting the Italian strategy : borrow without limits and print more money to inflate away the debt . 
While constraints are a good idea , it is understandable that EU governments do not like them . 
Sinners do not like rules . 
In Germany , for example , the Council of Economic Advisors calculated the implicit pension debt to be more than 270 % of GDP . 
Add the open public debt of 67 % of GDP to this total , and the result is an overall German debt / GDP ratio of about 340 % . 
Other European countries are in a similar situation , which is exacerbated by the fact that Europeans are having fewer children . 
The future generations that are to foot the bill may simply not be there . 
Europe is , moreover , the continent with the slowest rate of economic growth in the world . 
Average EU growth in 2004 , when the world economy recorded the strongest growth in more than a quarter-century , was only 2.2 % while inflation was 1.9 % . 
This is about 4 % in nominal terms , and faster growth will hardly be possible in the longer run . 
With such low growth , the 3 % -of-GDP ceiling for annual fiscal deficits is no longer compatible with the 60 % limit on the debt-GDP ratio that the Maastricht Treaty stipulates for the euro countries . 
Countries that borrow 3 % and grow at a rate of 4 % will converge towards a debt / GDP ratio of 75 % . 
A country like Germany , which has a real growth trend of only 1 % per year and may continue to have only 1 % inflation in the medium term , is heading towards a debt / GDP ratio of 150 % . 
But the right response is to make the Stability and Growth Pact tougher , not weaker . 
The easiest way to keep the debt / GDP ratio under control would be to implement a staggered deficit criterion that reduces the permitted public-finance deficit to less than 3 % for countries whose debt / GDP ratio exceeds 60 % and raises the deficit ceiling above 3 % for countries whose debt / GDP ratio is below this level . 
This approach would automatically take account of different growth rates and give countries a powerful incentive to run surpluses in good times in order to increase the scope for maneuver in bad times . 
Unfortunately , however , it is the sinners themselves who will determine the conditions under which they are punished .
