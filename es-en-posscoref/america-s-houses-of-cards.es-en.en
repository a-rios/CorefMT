America &apos;s Houses of Cards 
There are times when being proven right brings no pleasure . 
For several years , I argued that America &apos;s economy was being supported by a housing bubble that had replaced the stock market bubble of the 1990 &quot; s . 
But no bubble can expand forever . 
With middle-class incomes in the United States stagnating , Americans could not afford ever more expensive homes . 
As one of my predecessors as Chairman of the US President &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers famously put it , &quot; that which is not sustainable will not be sustained . &quot; 
Economists , as opposed to those who make their living gambling on stocks , make no claim to being able to predict when the day of reckoning will come , much less identifying the event that will bring down the house of cards . 
But the patterns are systematic , with consequences that unfold gradually , and painfully , over time . 
There is a macro-story and a micro-story here . 
The macro-story is simple , but dramatic . 
Some , observing the crash of the sub-prime mortgage market , say , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , it is only a problem in the real estate sector . &quot; 
But this overlooks the key role that the housing sector has played in the US economy recently , with direct investment in real estate and money taken out of houses through refinancing mortgages accounting for two-thirds to three-quarters of growth over the last six years . 
Booming home prices gave Americans the confidence , and the financial wherewithal , to spend more than their income . 
America &apos;s household savings rate was at levels not seen since the Great Depression , either negative or zero . 
With higher interest rates depressing housing prices , the game is over . 
As America moves to , say , a 4 % savings rate ( still small by normal standards ) , aggregate demand will weaken , and with it , the economy . 
The micro-story is more dramatic . 
Record-low interest rates in 2001 , 2002 and 2003 did not lead Americans to invest more - there was already excess capacity . 
Instead , easy money stimulated the economy by inducing households to refinance their mortgages , and to spend some of their capital . 
It is one thing to borrow to make an investment , which strengthens balance sheets ; it is another thing to borrow to finance a vacation or a consumption binge . 
But this is what Alan Greenspan encouraged Americans to do . 
When normal mortgages did not prime the pump enough , he encouraged them to take out variable-rate mortgages - at a time when interest rates had nowhere to go but up . 
Predatory lenders went further , offering negative amortization loans , so the amount owed went up year after year . 
Sometime in the future , payments would rise , but borrowers were told , again , not to worry : house prices would rise faster , making it easy to refinance with another negative amortization loan . 
The only way ( in this view ) not to win was to sit on the sidelines . 
All of this amounted to a human and economic disaster in the making . 
Now reality has hit : newspapers report cases of borrowers whose mortgage payments exceed their entire income . 
Globalization implies that America &apos;s mortgage problem has worldwide repercussions . 
The first run on a bank occurred against the British mortgage lender Northern Rock . 
America managed to pass off bad mortgages worth hundreds of billions of dollars to investors ( including banks ) around the world . 
They buried the bad mortgages in complicated instruments , buried them so deep that no one knew exactly how badly they were impaired , and no one could calculate how to re-price them quickly . 
In the face of such uncertainty , markets froze . 
Those in financial markets who believe in free markets have temporarily abandoned their faith . 
For the greater good of all ( of course , it is never for their own selfish interests ) , they argued a bailout was necessary . 
While the US Treasury and the IMF warned East Asian countries facing financial crises ten years ago against the risks of bail-outs and told them not to raise their interest rates , the US ignored its own lectures about moral hazard effects , bought up billions in mortgages , and lowered interest rates . 
But lower short-term interest rates have led to higher medium-term interest rates , which are more relevant for the mortgage market , perhaps because of increasing worries about inflationary pressures . 
It may make sense for central banks ( or Fannie Mae , America &apos;s major government-sponsored mortgage company ) to buy mortgage-backed securities in order to help provide market liquidity . 
But those from whom they buy them should provide a guarantee , so the public does not have to pay the price for their bad investment decisions . 
Equity owners in banks should not get a free ride . 
Securitization , with all of its advantages in sharing risk , has three problems that were not adequately anticipated . 
While it meant that American banks were not hit as hard as they would otherwise , America &apos;s bad lending practices have had global effects . 
Moreover , securitization contributed to bad lending : in the old days , banks that originated bad loans bore the consequences ; in the new world of securitization , the originators could pass the loans onto others . 
( As economists would say , problems of asymmetric information have increased . ) 
In the old days , when borrowers found it impossible to make their payments , mortgages would be restructured ; foreclosures were bad for both the borrower and the lender . 
Securitization made debt restructuring difficult , if not impossible . 
It is the victims of predatory lenders who need government help . 
With mortgages amounting to 95 % or more of the value of the house , debt restructuring will not be easy . 
What is required is to give individuals with excessive indebtedness an expedited way to a fresh start - for example , a special bankruptcy provision allowing them to recover , say , 75 % of the equity they originally put into the house , with the lenders bearing the cost . 
There are many lessons for America , and the rest of the world ; but among them is the need for greater financial sector regulation , especially better protection against predatory lending , and more transparency .
