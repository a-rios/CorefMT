South Korea &apos;s Japanese Mirror 
SEOUL - Given the daunting challenges facing Japan , one can only admire Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s determination to end the country &apos;s two-decade-long period of economic stagnation . 
His strategy - the &quot; three arrows &quot; of massive monetary expansion , increased government spending , and structural reform - is theoretically sound . 
But only one and a half arrows have been launched so far . 
The stimulus package is being offset by consumption-tax hikes aimed at reducing Japan &apos;s massive debt burden - a process that will lead many Japanese consumers to adjust their spending downward . 
The promised structural reforms of the energy sector , labor market , and competition policy have yet to be introduced , and appear unlikely to take effect anytime soon . 
Even more worrisome are larger immutable realities - like a rapidly aging and shrinking population - that will limit Japan &apos;s economic growth in the coming decades . 
But Japan &apos;s problems are not unique . 
Indeed , its neighbor and historical rival , South Korea , is headed down a similar path . 
The difference is that South Korea may still have time to ameliorate these trends , and avoid a Japanese-style quagmire of permanent low growth and long-term decline . 
South Korea - the seventh-largest trading country in the world , and one of the most prominent economic success stories of the last 50 years - is at risk of such a bleak future as a result , first and foremost , of demographics . 
South Korea &apos;s working-age population is falling by 1.2 % annually - the fastest decline among OECD countries . 
While there are many reasons for South Korea &apos;s low fertility rate , two economic factors stand out . 
First , household-debt levels are enormous , capturing a quarter of income , with mortgage payments taking the lion &apos;s share . 
The ratio of housing prices to incomes is more than double that of the United States . 
Second , South Korean families feel compelled to spend a large share of their income ( 10 % , on average ) on education . 
With households already saving only around 4 % of their disposable income , compared to 20 % in 1988 , there is little room for additional expenditure . 
A concomitant feature of South Korea &apos;s labor market is that women &apos;s labor-force participation rate - a paltry 33 % for women aged 30-39 - is among the lowest in the OECD . 
This partly reflects the difficulty of balancing child rearing with work in South Korea , compared to , say , Europe or the US . 
South Korea &apos;s female labor-force participation rate is even lower than in Japan , where there are waiting lists for childcare . 
Moreover , South Korea has underinvested in day-care centers , with firms rarely offering childcare support . 
Given that South Korean women tend not to hold lucrative jobs , the cost of childcare is often prohibitive . 
The recent increase in South Korea &apos;s minimum normal retirement age has done little to improve the labor-market outlook . 
Wages in the small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) that employ 88 % of workers still lag behind those of major conglomerates , the chaebols ; and the middle class is shrinking in terms of its share of earnings . 
But South Korea does have some advantages over Japan . 
Although the government &apos;s stimulus policies have increased the national debt , the debt / GDP ratio remains relatively low , at roughly 37 % . 
Public debt in Japan , by contrast , exceeds 220 % of GDP . 
Moreover , despite South Korea &apos;s dependence on exports , domestic consumption is robust . 
And ample spending on research and development , together with an unrelenting drive to be at the forefront of technological innovation , implies a brisk pace of innovation . 
This creates room to address one of the economy &apos;s two main challenges : low productivity in services . 
As it stands , productivity in services is six times lower than in manufacturing . 
The operations of South Korea &apos;s chaebols - which dominate production , if not employment - should be adjusted to support productivity gains in the increasingly dominant services sector . 
The key here , as in Japan , is to foster greater competition in services . 
If the chaebols continue to do their own advertising , financing , and IT , they will starve SMEs . 
A review of industrial concentration is warranted , as is a major government effort to foster SME growth in new ventures by offering incentives , ensuring access to capital , and lowering barriers to market entry . 
More employment in higher-end service jobs , especially for women , would also improve South Korea &apos;s prospects considerably . 
In the longer term , however , South Korea &apos;s prospects hinge largely on the labor force . 
The rising dependency ratio - expected to exceed 50 % by 2030 , when 36 % of the population will be above the age of 65 - could spell disaster for the country . 
Health-care costs will rise , increasing the strain on budgets . 
While increased immigration could help to ease labor-force pressures , it would be met with public resistance . 
In this context , potential growth may well fall back to the predicted 2.5 % annual rate , even though the economy &apos;s capital stock is in good shape . 
South Korea has learned numerous positive lessons from Japan . 
It captured many of Japan &apos;s export markets ; it imported and adapted Japanese technologies ; it employed similar planning methods ; and the chaebols are an outgrowth of Japan &apos;s zaibatsu corporate model . 
Now , however , South Korea must learn from Japan &apos;s negative experiences . 
Structural reform cannot wait . 
Nationalism should be channeled toward securing public support for deep economic and social reforms . 
South Korea &apos;s leaders do not have to look far to find out what will happen if they fail to address looming challenges quickly and resolutely .
