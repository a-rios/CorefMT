Stabilizing the Horn 
STRASBOURG - After almost two decades as a failed state torn by civil war , perhaps the world should begin to admit that Somalia - as it is currently constructed - is beyond repair . 
Some of the country , however , can meet at least a basic standard of governance . 
The northernmost region , Somaliland , situated strategically at the opening to the Red Sea and home to roughly 3.5 million of Somalia &apos;s 10 million people , is more or less autonomous and stable . 
But this stability fuels fears that Somaliland &apos;s people will activate the declaration of independence they adopted in 1991 . 
At the end of September , Somaliland will hold its third presidential election , the previous two having been open and competitive . 
Unlike many developing countries , it will welcome foreign observers to oversee the elections , though , unfortunately , most Western countries and agencies will stay away , lest their presence be seen as legitimizing Somaliland &apos;s de facto government . 
But Somaliland &apos;s strategic position near the world &apos;s major oil-transport routes , now plagued by piracy , and chaos in the country &apos;s south , mean that independence should no longer be dismissed out of hand . 
Indeed , following a fact-finding mission in 2007 , a consensus is emerging within the EU that an African Union country should be the first to recognize Somaliland &apos;s independence . 
A 2005 report by Patrick Mazimhaka , a former AU deputy chairman , provides some leeway for this , as Mazimhaka pointed out that the union in 1960 between Somaliland and Somalia , following the withdrawal of the colonial powers ( Britain and Italy ) , was never formally ratified . 
Ethiopia is the obvious candidate to spearhead recognition , given its worries about jihadi unrest within Somalia . 
Moreover , landlocked Ethiopia uses Somaliland &apos;s port of Berbera extensively . 
Yet Ethiopia may hesitate , owing to its fears that formally recognizing Somaliland &apos;s independence could undermine Somalia &apos;s fragile Western-backed Transitional Federal Government . 
But , as Somalia &apos;s new president , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , is a former head of the Islamic Courts , Ethiopia may choose the current status quo in Somaliland over the dream of stabilizing Somalia . 
The key regional obstacle to recognition is Saudi Arabia , which not only objects to the secular , democratic model promoted by Somaliland , but is a strong ally of Somalia , which is a member of the Arab League ( despite not being Arab ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference . 
Saudi Arabia supports the TFG financially and politically . 
Saudi pressure on Somaliland has ranged from banning livestock imports between 1996-2006 , to threatening to reject the Somaliland passports of Hajj pilgrims . 
When Somaliland &apos;s people vote at the end of September , they will not be deciding explicitly on secession , but their steady effort at state building does amplify their claims to independence . 
So , two years after Kosovo &apos;s independence , and a year after Russian troops wrenched Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia , it is high time for diplomats and statesmen to provide some guidelines as to when and in what circumstances secession is likely to be acceptable . 
Does any self-selected group anywhere have the right to declare independence ? 
If so , the richest parts of any country could decide to go it alone , thus impoverishing their fellow citizens . 
Even if greed is ruled out as an acceptable motive , in favor of traditional ethno-cultural nationalism , a profusion of tiny tribal states might make the world far more unstable . 
Moreover , does anyone , for example , want to see China return to the years of bloody warlordism of the early twentieth century ? 
Not likely . Thus clear principles are needed , as neither self-determination nor the inviolability of national borders can be treated as sacrosanct in every case . 
So let me attempt to outline some basic principles : 
路 No outside forces should either encourage or discourage secession , and the barriers for recognizing secession should be set high . 
Secession is in itself neither good nor bad : like divorce , it may make people more or less content . 
路 A declaration of independence should be recognized only if a clear majority ( well over 50 % -plus-one of the voters ) have freely chosen it , ideally in an unbiased referendum . 
路 The new state must guarantee that any minorities it drags along - say , Russians in the Baltic states , or Serbs in Kosovo - will be decently treated . 
路 Secessionists should have a reasonable claim to being a national group that , preferably , enjoyed stable self-government in the past on the territory they claim . 
Nations need not be ethnically based ; few are entirely . 
But most nations are unified by language , a shared history of oppression , or some other force of history . 
On this , admittedly subjective , measure , Somaliland qualifies as a nation . 
It was briefly independent ( for five days ) in 1960 after the British withdrawal , before throwing in its lot with the formerly Italian south , a decision which its people have regretted ever since . 
In this brief period , 35 countries , including Egypt , Israel , and the five Permanent Members of the Security Council , recognized Somaliland diplomatically ( interestingly , Israel was the first to do so ) . 
If Somaliland &apos;s imminent multi-party elections are reasonably fair and open , the outside world , including the AU and the United Nations , will need to reconsider its status , which has been fudged since the collapse of Siad Barre &apos;s regime in 1991 . 
All three of Somaliland &apos;s parties contesting the forthcoming election are adamant about wanting recognition of the region &apos;s independence , which was confirmed overwhelmingly by a referendum in 2001 . 
So there is no question of one clan or faction imposing independence on the others . 
Given the interests of all the world &apos;s great powers in stabilizing the Horn of Africa , there does seem to be movement toward accepting Somaliland &apos;s claims . 
An independent Somaliland could be a force for stability and good governance in an otherwise hopeless region . 
So the world may soon need to test whether the controversial principles it brought to bear in Kosovo have the same meaning in Africa .
