Corporate Crimes and Punishments 
Capitalism will not take root around the world if corruption defiles it . 
Socialism collapsed a decade ago because it became discredited in the eyes of the peoples who lived under it . 
Now capitalism is receiving severe rebukes , with its critics given powerful evidence that they are right in seeing it as a system that works for insiders and their cronies . 
After all , isn &apos;t Enron &apos;s bankruptcy a crystal-clear example of inmates controlling their guards ? 
If America wants to lead capitalism &apos;s global march , it must exorcize a growing culture of corporate crony capitalism . 
The choice , of course , is no longer between socialism and capitalism . 
Socialism became a mess as great expectations of a workers &apos; paradise were bogged down in bureaucracy . 
Without incentives and radical decentralization , economic progress is simply a dream . 
So the past century demonstrated time and again , which is why China - nostalgic egalitarian rhetoric notwithstanding - opted for all-out capitalism under its post-Mao rulers . 
Did Deng Xiao Peng foresee the vast inequalities that would result ? 
Possibly . 
But Deng wanted higher standards of living for every Chinese , even if inequality resulted . 
To function and remain socially acceptable , however , capitalism must be as clean as possible . 
Everybody may not get a chance to become rich in a capitalist system , but the system should not be perceived as rigged in ways that allow only insiders to get rich while everyone else pays the bill . 
If inequality is one negative aspect of radical capitalism - to some extent mitigated by the public sector - the other one is the potential corruption of capitalist institutions : call it the Enron syndrome . 
When American Congressional committees weaken regulatory oversight of their business friends ; when accounting firms surrender their independence because of the lure of mega-contracts ; when corporate boards can &apos;t say no because the fees of board members are stunningly large relative to the effort ; and when managers live in a frenzy of self-dealing , the stage is set for capitalism to lose its reputation . 
That clearly is the case of late in America . 
Capitalism involves a delicate problem of agency and trust ; giving managers the green light for entrepreneurship is not enough to make certain that the interests of investors are safeguarded ; nor is it enough for stock markets to price securities realistically . 
While evidence about the Enron debacle is not fully in , it is fair to say that Enron is both a great moral scandal and a blot on capitalism . 
It throws a stark light on the flaws of capitalism &apos;s core institutions . 
The witch-hunt underway - with politicians , regulators , and even the White House seeking to save their political skins - is , indeed , essential . 
Inevitably , it contains populist , anti-business sentiments . 
At times , it almost looks as if anti-globalization protesters are taking over . 
But in the swing of the pendulum the excesses of yesterday will incite greater scrutiny and a tougher rulebook for business in the future . 
All for the good . 
Capitalism is a public trust ; it works if everybody has a fair chance and corporate theft receives highly visible punishments . 
The ritual witch-hunt now underway may be the only way for bosses to regain their bearings . 
For the only way capitalism can be made acceptable , and hence deliver growth and prosperity around the world , is to practice this rite of exorcism in public . 
Enron bosses will be humiliated ; other bosses will ( in private ) shake their heads at the scale of these purges . 
They will argue that all the Congressional and newspaper investigations are excessive ; that we should put Enron behind us and move on to the business of making money again . 
But to act in such a way will leave those doubtful of capitalism in even greater doubt . 
Such , indeed , would create the ultimate moral hazard - a world of corporate crime without punishment . 
Some will say that it will be impossible to build good boards of directors if members can be sued ; some will ponder what will happen to stocks if hard questions are asked about financial reporting by companies . 
A clean sweep , however , will ultimately be good for stocks and certainly much better than cover-up and lingering doubts about what the books really look like . 
Capitalism , indeed , has always needed its morality tales . 
But distinctions must be made . 
The failure of Long Term Capital Management a few years ago provided a lesson about risk management and the need to not be dreamy-eyed about a string of huge returns . 
Nothing remotely illegal happened then ; there was no government bailout nor facilitation of management &apos;s errors . 
Investors simply made a mistake out of greed and lost , big time . 
By contrast the Enron affair involved impropriety and perhaps criminal conduct of just about anyone coming close to management . 
Moreover , it is not yet clear whether or not top Enron managers won &apos;t walk away with a bundle of cash while the company &apos;s workers lose their retirement assets . 
Chinese capitalism , too , is rife with corruption and self-dealing . 
The Chinese government &apos;s reaction - every so often - is to behead a bunch of obvious and odious villains . 
That may seem an extreme solution for Western democracies . 
But to imprison corrupt managers , regulators and politicians is an essential element of a functioning and respected capitalism . 
Because capitalism redistributes aggressively , it is vital that there be trust , transparency and accountability . 
After Enron - standing not just for a single event but a slippage in corporate culture altogether - we will only regain our bearings through the imposition of severe punishment for corporate crimes .
