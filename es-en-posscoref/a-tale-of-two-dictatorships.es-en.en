A Tale of Two Dictatorships 
Myanmar and Pakistan are both Asian countries whose military rulers are in trouble . 
But they are heading in opposite directions , because , whereas Pakistan understands why Asia is rising , Myanmar does not . 
Asia is rising because Asian countries are increasingly opening their doors to modernity . 
Starting with Japan , this modernizing wave has swept through the four &quot; Asian Tigers &quot; ( South Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , and Singapore ) , some ASEAN countries ( Malaysia , Indonesia , Thailand , and Vietnam ) , and then to China and India . 
Now , it is moving into Pakistan and West Asia . 
I was in Pakistan during one of its more exciting weeks . 
Exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif sought to return , but was promptly sent back into exile . 
The world expected a political eruption . 
Instead , the country carried on calmly . 
Pakistan did not erupt because Pakistan &apos;s elite is focused on modernization . 
Led by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz , who was formerly with Citibank , the country has carried out dramatic structural reforms , matching best practices in leading emerging-market economies . 
This explains high economic growth rates . 
Pakistan has welcomed foreign trade and investment . 
And , just as the success of overseas Indians in America inspired Indians in India , Pakistan stands to similarly benefit from its own successful diaspora . 
But this opening to modernity extends beyond economics and finance . 
Yes , thousands of madrasas remain open and Islamic fundamentalism is strong . 
But this has not completely changed the fundamental texture of Pakistan &apos;s society . 
One sight at LUMS , a leading private university in Lahore , heartened me : how women were dressed . 
When I visited Malaysian campuses as a young man in the 1960 &quot; s , few Malay Muslim women wore the hijab . 
Today , on the same campuses , almost all do . 
By contrast , at LUMS ( which has the look and feel of Harvard Business School ) , only about 5 % of female students wore the hijab , a remarkable expression of social freedom . 
There has also been an explosion of free media in Pakistan . 
An astonishing number of Pakistani TV stations openly discuss the activities of Sharif and the other exiled former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto . 
Indeed , many elements of an open society are in place , including - as the world learned in March - an independent judiciary . 
Myanmar , by contrast , broadcasts no information on the dissident Aung San Suu Kyi , and would never allow the reinstatement of a Chief Justice fired by its generals , as Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf did in March , let alone demonstrations in the streets in the Chief Justice &apos;s favor . 
Of course , there is much silent resentment about the enormous political and economic space occupied by the Pakistan military , and a danger of a backlash if the military does not learn to share more space with civil society . 
I met many retired army generals occupying key posts . 
Fortunately , they seemed to have a temperament closer to Colin Powell &apos;s than to either Than Shwe or Maung Aye , the two closed military minds who have cut off Myanmar from the world . 
America &apos;s decision to engage , rather than isolate , Pakistan has also helped . 
I have no doubt that closer American re-engagement helped to nudge Pakistan in the right direction . 
Many members of Pakistan &apos;s elite have been educated in American universities - another leading indicator of a country &apos;s orientation . 
Just imagine how different international relations would be if American leaders could visit Myanmar ( or even Iran ) with equal ease and have friendly discussions about agreements and disagreements . 
Myanmar &apos;s generals deserve to be condemned for their brutal crackdown on civilian protestors and Buddhist monks . 
The Western world will rush to demand more sanctions and more isolation . 
But to what avail ? 
Myanmar has effectively isolated itself for more than 50 years . 
What can even more isolation achieve ? 
A courageous Western leader might confront Myanmar &apos;s leaders with a threat that would really frighten them : deeper engagement . 
Myanmar &apos;s generals genuinely believe that they are protecting Burmese &quot; purity &quot; by shutting out the world . 
Imagine the impact if as many Myanmar generals visited America as Pakistani generals do . 
A brave young Myanmar intellectual , Thant Myint-U ( the grandson of former United Nations Secretary General U Thant ) asks , &quot; What outside pressure can bring about democratic change ? 
And why , after nearly two decades of boycotts , aid cutoffs , trade bans , and diplomatic condemnation , are Myanmar &apos;s generals apparently more in charge than ever before ? &quot; 
I was in Pakistan as a state guest . 
But my real mission was to reconnect with my ethnic Sindhi roots , as I had never visited the country where my parents were born . 
Only those who understand the pain of the partition of British India in 1947 will appreciate the powerful symbolism of a child of Hindu parents being welcomed back warmly to Muslim Pakistan . 
Those cultural ties helped me understand the Urdu and Sindhi being spoken , and also to feel the deep urge to modernize in the Pakistani soul - an urge that exists alongside the urge to reconnect with Pakistan &apos;s rich cultural past . 
I left Pakistan feeling hopeful , because I saw the strong desire to join today &apos;s rising Asia . 
If a similar impulse could be implanted into Myanmar , both its people and the world would benefit .
