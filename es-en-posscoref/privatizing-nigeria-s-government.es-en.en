Privatizing Nigeria \ u0027s Government 
Nigeria can be bold at diplomacy , as its offer of asylum to President Charles Taylor of Liberia demonstrates . 
It will require similar audacity if it is to turn its moribund economy around . 
Nigeria is a paradigm of failed development . 
Average incomes are amongst the lowest in the world . 
Poverty is endemic , with more than three-quarters of Nigerians living on less than US $ 2 per day and distribution of income more skewed in favor of the rich than anywhere else in the world . 
The top 2 % of Nigerians earn the same as the bottom 55 % . 
With Nigeria on the verge of burying the ghosts of its past dictatorships the time is ripe for daring reforms . 
Its leaders should focus on one key issue : managing Nigeria &apos;s oil revenues . 
Paradoxically , the boldest course would be for the government to stop managing these revenues and turn over a large fraction of these funds directly to the people , as is done in the US state of Alaska and the Canadian province of Alberta . 
At the earliest opportunity , Nigeria &apos;s government should convene a conference of all national and regional leaders and secure agreement on a constitutional provision whereby each household would be guaranteed a share of oil revenues , with the amount determined by prevailing prices and quotas . 
What is the rationale of this proposal and how might it be implemented ? 
Recent research I conducted with the IMF &apos;s Arvind Subramanian demonstrates that Nigeria &apos;s poor economic performance is primarily a story of the mismanagement of oil revenues . 
Based on evidence from a cross-section of countries , natural resources such as oil and minerals do seem to be a &quot; curse &quot; rather than a blessing , as they impose a heavy drag on long-run economic growth . 
Rather , the main problem with oil booms is that they give rise to a series of pathologies - rent seeking , patronage , corruption , plunder - that corrode vital domestic public institutions and undermine governance . 
Indeed , asked at a conference in London what would be the worst news his staff could bring him , Senegal &apos;s President Wade quipped : &quot; that oil has been discovered just off our coast . &quot; 
The surest way to avoid these debilities is to remove the conditions in which they thrive . 
Oil revenues should be taken out of public hands to the greatest degree possible and handed over to the private sector . 
This solution is rendered more urgent in Nigeria by the prospect of exploiting the country &apos;s vast reserves of natural gas , which may aggravate and prolong the resource &quot; curse . &quot; 
Our proposal has a number of advantages , most importantly creating the right incentives for effective and responsive governance . 
Currently , oil accounts for a substantial share of Nigeria &apos;s total government revenues . 
With no need to tax the public , Nigeria &apos;s government has little incentive to provide services efficiently : oil revenues are manna from heaven and keep flowing regardless of what the public sector delivers . 
Moreover , while Nigeria is formally a democracy , the balance of power between citizens and public officials , including those at state and local government levels , is skewed in favor of the latter by virtue of their easy access to oil revenues . 
Empowering citizens by giving them money could rectify this imbalance and so improve accountability and the functioning of democracy . 
Finally , our proposal offers a way out of the ongoing and sterile debate between international donors and Nigeria on the issue of debt relief . 
Nigerian officials and the public wish to see the external debt burden lifted , especially because a big part of it is &quot; odious &quot;  -  contracted by dictators , with a large degree of creditor complicity . 
But donors are wary . 
They justifiably fear that any savings from relief may well be misused , just as other public resources have been . 
Under our proposal , the savings from debt relief would be distributed directly to the private sector , alleviating donors &apos; legitimate concerns while also responding to Nigerian grievances . 
The details for implementing our proposal need to be worked out by Nigerian politicians . 
For example , a decision needs to be made as to whether the transfers go to each citizen or each household ( a yearly check for each person in the family may have undesirable consequences on fertility as parents have children to collect checks ) . 
Also , Nigerians need to decide whether all beneficiaries receive equal shares , or whether those who face the environmental consequences of oil exploration and production  -  for example , in the Nigerian delta  -  should receive more . 
Another question is how much of the revenues should be transferred , and how transfers can be effected in a country as large , complex , and financially backward as Nigeria . 
But even with all the difficulties of corruption and inefficiency that will no doubt plague its actual implementation , our proposal is superior to the status quo . 
After all , today &apos;s terrible conditions are the result of staggering corruption and waste over the last 40 years . 
At best , our proposal could fundamentally improve the quality of public institutions and thus transform economics and politics in Nigeria for decades to come . 
The time to act is now .
