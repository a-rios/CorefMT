Piracy in China 
BEIJING : China now appears to be the country with the most notorious reputation for corporate piracy . 
Indeed , if multinationals and developed countries had an &quot; Interpol &quot; to track down and arrest countries charged with being havens for business piracy , China would likely top the &quot; Most Wanted &quot; list because of its lack of protection of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) . 
Sadly , much of the case against China is true ; no one here should ignore this , or pretend the facts are otherwise . 
Is this reputation for piracy somehow an intrinsic business &quot; characteristic of the Chinese &quot; or of &quot; Asians &quot; as a whole as some allege ? 
Maybe , maybe not . 
Taiwanese and Koreans were the culprits in the 1960s , and 1970s . 
Today , Thai businesses are accused of piracy as often as Chinese companies . 
But intellectual / corporate piracy is not confined to Asia . 
Piracy , however , should not be used to tar an entire country &apos;s economy or business structures as criminal . 
It should , instead , be regarded as a problem found almost universally in countries undergoing the earliest stages of development . 
A fully functioning legal system and - perhaps more importantly - the mentality associated with the rule of law are often absent , or primitive , in most developing countries . 
Signing IPR conventions , and incorporating them into domestic law , means little or nothing when a country &apos;s law enforcement is weak . 
Moreover , law enforcement and legal sanctions don &apos;t mean much if people do not own property themselves , that would be at risk through fines or other sanctions . 
No surprise , then , that a backward , developing country in the early stages of &quot; catching up &quot; through learning from the developed world , sees copying the intellectual advances of others as something like a human right . 
This may explain why the issues of intellectual property rights are , for most developing countries , usually treated as an &quot; international matter , &quot; not a problem for domestic politics . 
Given this situation , is it actually realistic to expect politicians and government officials to work hard to protect foreigners &quot; rights in face of the needs of their fellow citizens ? 
The answer is an emphatic NO . 
Politicians and bureaucrats , indeed , will only take action when &quot; domestic piracy &quot; starts to occur . 
When people in a country begin to illicitly copy the intellectual achievements of a fellow citizen , IPR becomes a real domestic political issue dividing special interest groups . 
Containing piracy then becomes a matter debated in political assemblies , in the media and - most importantly - in the courts . 
When this happens , real efforts to enforce laws that previously existed only on paper to please foreigners , starts to take place . 
This is now happening in China . 
In recent years , Chinese companies have been suffering piracy related problems just as their foreign counterparts have . 
Foreign companies will no doubt also benefit from this new commitment to stamp out piracy . 
China &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) may help some more , but it will not solve the problem overnight . 
In any case , no one should exaggerate the problem of piracy . 
Quite a few foreign companies shout &quot; piracy &quot; when what is really happening is competition - ie , a company in a developing country makes a similar product but at a lower price . 
Copying the idea and basic design of a product is not piracy . 
As developing countries seek to create their own &quot; knowledge economy , &quot; copyright and intellectual property rights will become more and more important . 
Here , indeed , China is particularly hopeful about its future . 
Although this may mean that China is crossing the &quot; divide &quot; between the haves and have-nots of the world &apos;s knowledge economy , it will not bridge that divide . 
Other peoples and countries find themselves on an unequal footing in this digital age , so the problem of piracy is not likely to disappear . 
The costs of acquiring and using new technologies protected by copyrights pose huge obstacles for developing countries . 
Reducing those costs should be a priority in international discussions about the &quot; digital divide &quot; and &quot; poverty relief . &quot; 
Poverty is no excuse for &quot; stealing &quot; or gaining a free lunch , of course , but using the protection of intellectual property to keep the poor poor is unjust , and may cause instability that harms rich countries , too . 
Reducing the costs for developing countries to use new technologies may , indeed , reduce the incentives for violating copyright and other intellectual property protections .
