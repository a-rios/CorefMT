Hugging a Burning Tree 
PRAGUE - We are all brought up to recycle paper to save trees . 
We get countless e-mail admonitions : &quot; Please consider the environment before printing . &quot; 
Indeed , environmentalism was born with a call to preserve the forests . 
But now , in the name of saving the planet from climate change , environmentalists are proposing an immense global campaign to cut down and burn trees and scrubs in order to reduce fossil-fuel use . 
The initiative could be dismissed as a weird irony , if it weren &apos;t for its phenomenal costs , which include likely destruction of biodiversity , increased water use , and reduced global food production . 
And it may end up increasing global CO2 emissions to boot . 
When most people think of renewable energy sources , they imagine solar panels and wind turbines . 
Globally , however , solar and wind are only a small part of total renewables - less than 7 % in 2010 . 
Hydropower is a much bigger player , at 17 % . 
But the most important by far is biomass - humanity &apos;s oldest fuel makes up 76 % of today &apos;s renewable energy and 10 % of all energy . 
About 60 % of this is wood , twigs , and dung , used by almost three billion people who lack access to modern fuels - and resulting in terrible air pollution and millions of deaths . 
But the West uses the other 40 % of biomass to produce heat , and it will increasingly use it to generate electricity . 
This makes sense , because solar and wind power are inherently unreliable - we still need electricity on cloudy days or when the wind dies down . 
Biomass ( along with hydropower ) can be used to smooth the fluctuations inherent to wind and solar . 
Biomass is experiencing a revival , because it is considered CO2-neutral . 
The conventional wisdom is that burning wood only releases the carbon sucked up while the tree was growing , and hence the net climate effect is zero . 
But a growing number of voices challenge this view . 
The European Environment Agency &apos;s Scientific Committee has called it a &quot; mistaken assumption &quot; based on &quot; a serious accounting error , &quot; because if a forest is cut down to burn wood , it will take a long time for new growth to absorb the CO2 emissions . 
The climate effect could be a net increase in emissions if forests are cleared to create energy-crop plantations . 
According to the Committee &apos;s members , &quot; the potential consequences of this bioenergy accounting error are immense . &quot; 
Environmentalists &quot; plan to obtain 20-50 % of all energy from biomass could mean a tripling of current biomass consumption , placing its production in direct competition with that of food for a growing global population , while depleting water supplies , cutting down forests , and reducing biodiversity . 
An academic paper published last year makes the point clear in its title : &quot; Large-scale bioenergy from additional harvest of forest biomass is neither sustainable nor greenhouse gas neutral . &quot; 
Its authors point out that while the Industrial Revolution caused climate change , reliance on coal was actually good for forests , because our forebears stopped raiding forests for wood . 
This is one of the major reasons that forests in Europe and the United States have recovered - and it is why many forests in developing countries are threatened . 
The developed world &apos;s re-enchantment with biomass could take it down a similar road . 
But the biggest problem is that biomass production simply pushes other agricultural production elsewhere . 
In Denmark , a group of researchers estimated by how much various energy crops would reduce CO2 emissions . 
For example , burning a hectare of harvested willow on a field previously used for barley ( the typical marginal crop in Denmark ) prevents 30 tons of CO2 annually when replacing coal . 
This is the amount that proud green-energy producers will showcase when switching to biomass . 
But burning the willow releases 22 tons of CO2 . 
Of course , all of that CO2 was soaked up from the atmosphere the year before ; but , had we just left the barley where it was , it , too , would have soaked up quite a bit , lowering the reduction relative to coal to 20 tons . 
And , in a market system , almost all of the barley production simply moves to a previously unfarmed area . 
Clearing the existing biomass there emits an extra 16 tons of CO2 per year on average ( and this is likely an underestimate ) . 
So , instead of saving 30 tons , we save four tons at most . 
And this is the best-case scenario . 
Of the 12 production modes analyzed , two would reduce annual CO2 emissions by only two tons , while the other ten actually increase total emissions - up to 14 tons per year . 
At the same time , we are paying a king &apos;s ransom for biomass . 
Germany alone spends more than $ 3 billion annually , or $ 167 per ton of avoided CO2 emissions , which is more than 37 times the cost of carbon reductions in the European Union Emissions Trading System . 
And the estimate of avoided emissions ignores indirect land-use changes , making the likely real cost at least eight times higher . 
Ten years ago , the EU and the US embraced biofuels as a way to combat global warming . 
Today , the US turns 40 % of its maize output into ethanol to be burned in cars . 
This has driven up food prices and caused tens of millions of people to starve , while costing more than $ 17 billion each year in subsidies and causing agricultural deforestation elsewhere in the world , with more total CO2 emissions than the entire savings from the ethanol . 
Biofuels have become an almost unstoppable and unmitigated disaster . 
We need to confront the next - and potentially much bigger - biomass boondoggle . 
Yes , we should turn waste into energy and be smart about agricultural leftovers . 
But we are about to diminish biodiversity , over-extract water , make food more expensive , and waste hundreds of billions of dollars - all while cutting down trees to burn them and potentially increasing CO2 emissions . 
We have been brought up to know and do better .
