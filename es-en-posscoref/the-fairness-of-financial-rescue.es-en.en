The Fairness of Financial Rescue 
BERKELEY - Perhaps the best way to view a financial crisis is to look at it as a collapse in the risk tolerance of investors in private financial markets . 
Maybe the collapse stems from lousy internal controls in financial firms that , swaddled by implicit government guarantees , lavish their employees with enormous rewards for risky behavior . 
Or perhaps a long run of good fortune has left the financial market dominated by cockeyed optimists , who have finally figured that out . 
Or perhaps it stems simply from unreasoning panic . 
Whatever the cause , when the risk tolerance of the market crashes , so do prices of risky financial assets . 
Everybody knows that there are immense unrealized losses in financial assets , but no one is sure that they know where those losses are . 
To buy - or even to hold - risky assets in such a situation is a recipe for financial disaster . 
So is buying or holding equity in firms that may be holding risky assets , regardless of how &quot; safe &quot; a firm &apos;s stock was previously thought to be . 
This crash in prices of risky financial assets would not overly concern the rest of us were it not for the havoc that it has wrought on the price system , which is sending a peculiar message to the real economy . 
The price system is saying : shut down risky production activities and don &apos;t undertake any new activities that might be risky . 
But there aren &apos;t enough safe , secure , and sound enterprises to absorb all the workers laid off from risky enterprises . 
And if the decline in nominal wages signals that there is an excess supply of labor , matters only get worse . 
General deflation eliminates the capital of yet more financial intermediaries , and makes risky an even larger share of assets that had previously been regarded as safe . 
Ever since 1825 , central banks &quot; standard response in such situations - except during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s - has been the same : raise and support the prices of risky financial assets , and prevent financial markets from sending a signal to the real economy to shut down risky enterprises and eschew risky investments . 
This response is understandably controversial , because it rewards those who bet on risky assets , many of whom accepted risk with open eyes and bear some responsibility for causing the crisis . 
But an effective rescue cannot be done any other way . 
A policy that leaves owners of risky financial assets impoverished is a policy that shuts down dynamism in the real economy . 
The political problem can be finessed : as Don Kohn , a vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve , recently observed , teaching a few thousand feckless financiers not to over-speculate is much less important than securing the jobs of millions of Americans and tens of millions around the globe . 
Financial rescue operations that benefit even the unworthy can be accepted if they are seen as benefiting all - even if the unworthy gain more than their share of the benefits . 
What cannot be accepted are financial rescue operations that benefit the unworthy and cause losses to other important groups - like taxpayers and wage earners . 
And that , unfortunately , is the perception held by many nowadays , particularly in the United States . 
It is easy to see why . 
When Vice Presidential candidate Jack Kemp attacked Vice President Al Gore in 1996 for the Clinton administration &apos;s decision to bail out Mexico &apos;s feckless government during the 1994-1995 financial crisis , Gore responded that America made $ 1.5 billion on the deal . 
Similarly , Clinton &apos;s treasury secretary , Robert Rubin , and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus were attacked for committing public money to bail out New York banks that had loaned to feckless East Asians in 1997-1998 . 
They responded that they had not rescued the truly bad speculative actor , Russia ; that they had &quot; bailed in , &quot; not bailed out , the New York banks , by requiring them to cough up additional money to support South Korea &apos;s economy ; and that everyone had benefited massively , because a global recession was avoided . 
Now , however , the US government can say none of these things . 
Officials cannot say that a global recession has been avoided ; that they &quot; bailed in &quot; the banks ; that - with the exception of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns - they forced the bad speculative actors into bankruptcy ; or that the government made money on the deal . 
It is still true that the banking-sector policies that were undertaken were good - or at least better than doing nothing . 
But the certainty that matters would have been much worse under a hands-off approach to the financial sector , Ã  la Republican Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in 1930-1931 , is not concrete enough to alter public perceptions . 
What is concrete enough are soaring bankers &quot; bonuses and a real economy that continues to shed jobs .
