Creativity , Corporatism , and Crowds 
NEW HAVEN - Economic growth , as we learned long ago from the works of economists like MIT &apos;s Robert M. Solow , is largely driven by learning and innovation , not just saving and the accumulation of capital . 
Ultimately , economic progress depends on creativity . 
That is why fear of &quot; secular stagnation &quot; in today &apos;s advanced economies has many wondering how creativity can be spurred . 
One prominent argument lately has been that what is needed most is Keynesian economic stimulus - for example , deficit spending . 
After all , people are most creative when they are active , not when they are unemployed . 
Others see no connection between stimulus and renewed economic dynamism . 
As German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently put it , Europe needs &quot; political courage and creativity rather than billions of euros . &quot; 
In fact , we need both . 
If we are to encourage dynamism , we need Keynesian stimulus and other policies that encourage creativity - particularly policies that promote solid financial institutions and social innovation . 
In his 2013 book Mass Flourishing , Edmund Phelps argues that we need to promote &quot; a culture protecting and inspiring individuality , imagination , understanding , and self-expression that drives a nation &apos;s indigenous innovation . &quot; 
He believes that creativity has been stifled by a public philosophy described as corporatism , and that only through thorough reform of our private institutions , financial and others , can individuality and dynamism be restored . 
Phelps stresses that corporatist thinking has had a long and enduring history , going back to Saint Paul , the author of as many as 14 books of the New Testament . 
Paul used the human body ( corpus in Latin ) as a metaphor for society , suggesting that in a healthy society , as in a healthy body , every organ must be preserved and none permitted to die . 
As a public-policy credo , corporatism has come to mean that the government must support all members of society , whether individuals or organizations , giving support to failing businesses and protecting existing jobs alike . 
According to Phelps , Pope Leo XIII advocated a corporatist view in his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum , and Pope Pius XI amplified these ideas in his 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo Anno . 
But , in reading these works , I do not find a clear or persuasive statement of any economic doctrine , except for basic notions of fairness and Christian charity . 
In fact , an Ngrams search of books shows that the term corporatism began to become popular only after the mid-1930s , and achieved broad currency by the 1970s and 1980s . 
The term seems to have been used most often by critics , often to denounce the defunct Fascist philosophy , or by those extolling elements of a &quot; new &quot; corporatism . 
Surely , elements of corporatist thinking persist today . 
Historically , an important spur toward corporatist thinking was Gustave Le Bon &apos;s 1895 book The Crowd , which coined the terms &quot; crowd psychology &quot; and &quot; collective mind . &quot; 
For Le Bon , &quot; An individual in a crowd &quot; - not only angry mobs on the street , but also other psychologically interconnected groups of people - &quot; is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand , which the wind stirs up at will . &quot; 
Le Bon believed that crowds need strong leaders , to distance them from their natural madness and transform them into civilizations of splendor , vigor , and brilliance . 
Mussolini and Hitler both took inspiration from his book , and incorporated his ideas into Fascist and Nazi ideology ; and those ideas did not die with those regimes . 
Still , the word &quot; crowd &quot; has taken on an entirely different meaning - and political valence - in our century . 
Crowdsourcing and crowd-funding have created new kinds of crowds , of the sort that Le Bon never could have imagined . 
As Le Bon emphasized , people cannot easily do great things as individuals . 
They need to operate together within organizations that redirect crowd psychology , facilitate creativity , and are led by people of integrity . 
Any such organizational technology , however , is subject to error and requires experimentation . 
When the crowd-sourced Wikipedia was started in 2001 , its success was not obvious . 
Even one of its founders , Jimmy Wales , found it a little hard to believe : &quot; It &apos;s kind of surprising that you could just open up a site and let people work . &quot; 
When the United States &quot; Jumpstart Our Business Startups ( JOBS ) Act , which facilitated true crowd-funding of enterprises , was signed by President Barack Obama in 2012 , it was an experiment , too . 
Many critics said that it would result in the exploitation of naive investors . 
We still do not know whether that is true , or how well the experiment will work . 
Ultimately , we need economic institutions that somehow promote the concerted creative actions of a wide swath of the world &apos;s people . 
They should not be corporatist institutions , dominated by central leaders , but should derive their power from the fluid actions of modern crowds . 
Some of those actions will have to be disruptive , because the momentum of organizations can carry them beyond their usefulness . 
Acknowledging the need to experiment and design new forms of economic organization must not mean abandoning fairness and compassion .
