What the Greek and Iranian Deals Are Not 
PARIS - This month &apos;s agreements on the Greek crisis and Iran &apos;s nuclear program are undoubtedly important achievements . 
The deal between Greece and its creditors , for example , has been compared to the Treaty of Versailles , with the Greeks forced to accept ruinous terms of &quot; surrender . &quot; 
But economic depression , however difficult , is not war , and the position of today &apos;s Greece cannot compare to that of the defeated Germans in 1918 . 
Meanwhile , opponents of the accord to limit Iran &apos;s nuclear activities for the next 15 years have likened it to the Munich Agreement ( shameful appeasement of an evil foe ) , while its supporters have compared it to the rapprochement between the United States and China in the 1970s . 
But the Iranians are nothing like the Nazis , and there is no country like the Soviet Union posing the kind of threat that inspired US President Richard Nixon to head to Beijing in 1972 . 
Equally problematic has been the tendency to compare the two sets of negotiations to each other . 
Beyond timing , they have little in common . 
What they do share is that their &quot; success &quot; was driven largely by the sense that powerful external threats made the alternative - no deal at all - much worse . 
In Greece &apos;s case , negotiations were propelled by the specter of an embittered Greece cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin , with his dangerous revisionist ambitions , or acting as a conduit for Europe-bound migrants . 
With Iran , the immediate threat of the Islamic State &apos;s advance proved more frightening than the medium-term prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran . 
The only other feature the two agreements share is their incompleteness . 
As a result , both deals seem more like wagers than agreements . 
The Greek bet - whether the country will be able to keep its financial head above water , as it attempts to implement the very difficult structural reforms it has promised - will be decided first . 
Indeed , the answer will become clear in a matter of months , or even weeks . 
The Iran bet - whether the country will resume its aggressive nuclear ambitions - will probably take much longer to be settled , perhaps eight or ten years . 
Of course , Iran may keep up its end of the bargain for the full 15-year timeline , but then what ? 
Any international negotiation - whether between partners or adversaries - follows a certain logic . 
There comes a moment when the negotiating process creates its own dynamic , escaping the control , at least in some ways , of its protagonists . 
The challenge is to find the proper point of balance - the &quot; fair compromise &quot; - between the parties . 
Here is where the Greek and Iranian negotiations diverge . 
Indeed , beyond the appearance of success in both cases , the results have been very different , if not diametrically opposed . 
Whereas Greece , the weaker party in its negotiations , was unnecessarily humiliated by its European partners , Iran , also the weaker party in its negotiations , was given new legitimacy by its adversaries in the West . 
Family members , it seems , are treated more severely than outsiders . 
One might argue that the deal with Iran represents a fundamental shift in the country &apos;s stance toward the West . 
The Iranian regime does not share Western values , nor will it anytime soon . 
And it is well known that in the Middle East , the enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend - not even if that enemy is the Islamic State ( or general chaos ) . 
If it is true that too much was extracted from Greece , and too little from Iran , it seems more likely that this reflects a fundamental difference between the Greek and Iranian negotiating positions than a discrepancy in the negotiators &quot; skill . 
Iran is becoming increasingly indispensable to any resolution of the Middle East &apos;s problems , which gives it a degree of clout that Greece , which many in Europe still view as entirely dispensable , does not have . 
This explains why US President Barack Obama and his chief negotiator , Secretary of State John Kerry , were dead-set on reaching an agreement with Iran . 
Greece &apos;s European partners , by contrast , were deeply divided on whether to give the country the relief it needed to keep it in the eurozone . 
To be sure , there were also divisions among Iran &apos;s interlocutors , the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , along with Germany . 
But , with China and Russia essentially on its side , at least partly , Iran could exploit those divisions to its advantage . 
Greece had no such option . 
While Germany and France disagreed on the concessions they were willing to offer , Greece could not pit one position against the other . 
Regardless of the merits of French President Fran√ßois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as negotiators , the fact is that , with the Greek economy totally dependent on official financing by Europe , Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was in no position to reject a last-chance agreement . 
Perhaps the most important difference between the two deals is that Greece &apos;s fate , though relevant to the world economy , mostly concerns Europe , whereas the accord with Iran has far-reaching consequences , from the balance of power in the Middle East to global nuclear non-proliferation . 
Both are incomplete and provisional , fueling skepticism among their critics . 
To the extent that time heals wounds , that is reason enough for hope .
