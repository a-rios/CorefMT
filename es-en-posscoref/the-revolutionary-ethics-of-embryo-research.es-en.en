The Revolutionary Ethics of Embryo Research 
What appeared to be the most momentous scientific advance of 2005 is currently under siege . 
In June , the prestigious journal Science published an article by the South Korean scientist Woo-Suk Hwang and an international team of co-authors describing how they had developed what were , in effect , &quot; made to order &quot; lines of human stem cells cloned from an adult . 
Although the scientific validity of their research is now the subject of several separate investigations , it is no less important to examine its ethical implications . 
Hwang and his colleagues claimed to have replaced the nucleus of an unfertilized human egg with the nucleus of an ordinary cell taken from another person , developing stem-cell lines from the resulting embryo that matched the DNA of the person who supplied the ordinary cell . 
That achievement appeared to take us significantly closer to a world in which patients could be given cell or tissue transplants that their bodies would not reject , because the biological materials , cloned from the patients themselves , would be a perfect match . 
At the beginning of December , Hwang disclosed that some of the eggs came from two women working in his lab , and that other &quot; donors &quot; had been paid for their eggs - a breach of ethical guidelines that had nothing to do with the accuracy of the science . 
At the time of this writing , he still defends the validity of his work , while admitting &quot; human errors &quot; in the preservation of the stem-cell lines , including contamination by a fungus . 
He has reportedly even suggested that some cells may have been tampered with . 
We will not know how close we are to the production of individually tailored stem-cell lines until the scientific investigations into Hwang &apos;s research are completed . 
Nevertheless , few researchers doubt that what Hwang and his colleagues claimed to do is , in principle , achievable . 
If Hwang was not the first to do it , someone else eventually will . 
Once it can be done reliably , it will pave the way for important medical breakthroughs . 
But the ethical significance of such research goes far beyond the undoubted importance of saving critically ill patients . 
Proving the possibility of cloning from the nucleus of an ordinary human cell would transform the debate about the value of potential human life , for we would find that &quot; potential human life &quot; was all around us , in every cell of our bodies . 
For example , when President George W. Bush announced in 2001 that the United States would not fund research into new stem-cell lines that are created from human embryos , he offered the following reason : &quot; Like a snowflake , each of these embryos is unique , with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being . &quot; 
But it is precisely this reasoning that is threatened by what Hwang and his team claimed to have achieved . 
If it is the uniqueness of human embryos that makes it wrong to destroy them , then there is no compelling reason not to take one cell from an embryo and destroy the remainder of it to obtain stem cells , for the embryo &apos;s &quot; unique genetic potential &quot; would be preserved . 
This possibility highlights the weakness of the argument that abortion , too , is wrong because it destroys a genetically unique human being . 
By this reasoning , a woman who finds herself pregnant at an inconvenient time could have an abortion , as long as she preserves a single cell from the fetus to ensure that its unique genetic potential is preserved . 
But it seems absurd that this should make any difference to the morality of aborting the fetus . 
If , at a later date , the woman wants to have a child , why should she use the DNA of her earlier , aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way ? 
Each fetus - the one she aborts and the one she later conceives through sexual intercourse - has its own &quot; unique &quot; DNA . 
In the absence of special reasons , like a change in sexual partners , there seems to be no reason to prefer the existence of one child to that of the other . 
Perhaps the assumption is that , as opponents of abortion sometimes say , the aborted fetus had the genetic potential to become a Beethoven or an Einstein . 
So why prefer one genetic potential over the other ? 
Once we abandon arguments based on potential , the claim that it is wrong to kill embryos and fetuses must be based on the nature of those entities themselves - that they are actual human beings who already possess the characteristics that make killing wrong . 
But , because fetuses , at least at the stage of development when most abortions are performed , have yet to develop any kind of consciousness , it seems reasonable to regard ending their lives as much less serious than killing a normal human being . 
If so , then this is all the more true of embryos .
