Europe &apos;s Surplus of Stagnation 
LONDON - While the rest of the world recovers from the Great Recession of 2008-2009 , Europe is stagnating . 
Eurozone growth is expected to be 1.7 % next year . 
What can be done about it ? 
One solution is a weaker euro . 
Earlier this month , the chief executive of Airbus called for drastic action to reduce the value of the euro against the dollar by about 10 % , from a &quot; crazy &quot; $ 1.35 to between $ 1.20 and $ 1.25 . 
The European Central Bank cut its deposit rates from 0 to -0.1 % , effectively charging banks to keep money at the Central Bank . 
But these measures had little effect on foreign-exchange markets . 
That is mainly because nothing is being done to boost aggregate demand . 
The United Kingdom , the United States , and Japan all increased their money supply to revive their economies , with currency devaluation becoming an essential part of the recovery mechanism . 
ECB President Mario Draghi often hints at quantitative easing - last month , he repeated that , &quot; if required , we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing &quot; - but his perpetual lack of commitment resembles that of Mark Carney , the governor of the Bank of England , whom one former UK government minister recently compared to an &quot; unreliable boyfriend . &quot; 
But the ECB &apos;s inaction is not wholly responsible for the appreciation of the euro &apos;s exchange rate . 
The pattern of current-account imbalances across the eurozone also plays a large role . 
Germany &apos;s current-account surplus - the largest in the eurozone - is not a new phenomenon . 
It has existed since the 1980s , falling only during reunification , when intensive construction investment in the former East Germany more than absorbed the country &apos;s savings . 
The external surplus has grown especially rapidly since the early 2000s . 
Today , it remains close to its pre-crisis 2007 level , at 7.4 % of GDP . 
Now , however , previously deficit-stricken countries are moving into surplus , which means that the eurozone &apos;s current account is increasingly positive ; indeed , the eurozone-wide surplus is now expected to be 2.25 % of GDP this year and next . 
The eurozone is saving more than it is investing , or , equivalently , exporting more than it is importing . 
This is strengthening its currency . 
Back in October 2013 , the US Treasury pointed the finger at Germany &apos;s structural surplus as the source of Europe &apos;s woes . 
Its argument was that if one country runs a surplus , another must run a deficit , because the excess savings / exports of the surplus country must be absorbed by another country as investment , consumption , or imports . 
If the surplus country takes no steps to reduce its surplus - for example , by increasing its domestic investment and consumption - the only way the deficit country can reduce its deficit is by cutting its own investment and consumption . 
But this would produce a &quot; bad &quot; equilibrium , achieved by stagnation . 
Something like this seems to have happened in the eurozone . 
Germany has retained its &quot; good &quot; surplus , whereas the Mediterranean countries slashed their deficits by cutting investment , consumption , and imports . 
Greece &apos;s unemployment rate soared to nearly 27 % ; 
In November 2013 , Paul Krugman wrote that , &quot; Germany &apos;s failure to adjust magnified the cost of austerity . &quot; 
Though it &quot; was inevitable that Spain would face lean years as it learned to live within its means , &quot; Krugman argued , &quot; Germany &apos;s immovability was an important contributor to Spain &apos;s pain . &quot; 
But Germany rejected this logic . 
Its current-account surplus was its just reward for hard work . 
Indeed , according to the German finance ministry , the surplus is &quot; no cause for concern , neither for Germany , nor for the eurozone , or the global economy . &quot; 
Because no &quot; correction &quot; was needed , it was up to the deficit countries to adjust by tightening their belts . 
John Maynard Keynes pointed out the deflationary consequence of this attitude in 1941 . 
Deficit countries with a fixed exchange rate ( as is the case in the eurozone ) are forced to cut their spending , while surplus countries are under no equivalent pressure to increase theirs . 
Keynes &apos;s proposed solution to this problem was an international payments system that would force symmetric adjustment on both surplus and deficit countries . 
Persistent surpluses and deficits would be taxed at an escalating rate . 
His plan was rejected . 
Of course , a creditor country can always help a debtor by investing its surplus there . 
Germany is willing to do this in principle , but insists that austerity must come first . 
The problem is that stagnation ruins investment prospects . 
China has shown that voluntary adjustment by a surplus country is possible . 
Until recently , the global imbalances problem was centered on China &apos;s bilateral surplus with the US . 
China used its excess savings to buy US Treasury bonds , which drove down world interest rates and enabled cheap borrowing , permitting America to run a vast current-account deficit . 
The main impact of low interest rates , however , was to fuel the housing bubble that burst in 2007 , leading directly to the 2008 financial crisis . 
Since then , China has made great efforts to reduce its external surplus . 
At its peak of 10.1 % of GDP in 2007 , the surplus was larger than Germany &apos;s ; by the end of 2013 , it had plummeted to 2 % of GDP . 
Why was China willing to adjust while Germany would not ? 
Perhaps a key difference lies in the fact that Germany has significant political clout over the deficit countries with which it trades . 
Germany was effectively able to force austerity upon its neighbors . 
That raises an important issue regarding the legitimacy of austerity . 
Its main proponents are creditors , who have much to gain from it ( relative to the alternative of raising domestic wages and forgiving debts ) . 
Creditor-debtor conflicts have always been the stuff of monetary politics , and the persistence of austerity has set the stage for a new debtors &quot; revolt . 
So we will have to rely on Draghi and quantitative easing to save the euro from Germany . 
Money will have to fall from the proverbial helicopter before Germany shows any willingness to reduce its surplus .
