Whose Georgia ? 
In recent weeks , leaders of various opposition organizations in Georgia , such as Antisoros and Fairness , have been jailed on unfair accusations of plotting a coup on behalf of Russia . 
But the wave of political repression merely reflects President Mikhail Saakashvili &apos;s desperate effort to cling to power . 
With popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening , the authorities have sought to controll non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and strengthen the security forces . 
But this will only make mass protests inevitable , ultimately jeopardizing the democratic transition in Georgia that Saakashvili claims to represent . 
Saakashvili sees a &quot; Moscow hand &quot; in every challenge to his authority , which could be explained by his government &apos;s close alliance with the United States . 
But the people rounded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally imprisoned by Eduard Shevarnadze &apos;s government , which Saakashvili helped depose in Georgia &apos;s supposedly democratic &quot; Rose revolution &quot; in 2003 . 
The latest events clearly indicate that a czarist mentality survived the revolution , reflected in a Byzantine model of political power - an emperor and his court - that has as its main vehicle largely unconstrained presidential authority . 
Before the security forces targeted the opposition bloc that I represent , supporters of educational reforms were prosecuted , while most of the press is under the influence of the government . 
Saakashvili claims that the opposition forces that I represent oppose Western values . 
But we advocate parliamentarism - genuine separation of executive and legislative power - in Georgia . 
And , in supporting the Western model of parliamentariansm , we are on the side of Georgia , not Russia . 
It is strange that Saakashvili , a graduate of Columbia Law School , fails to see the disparity between his own democratic rhetoric and autocratic actions . 
Thus , those of us who value Georgia &apos;s historical ties with Russia are called , at best , &quot; archaists , &quot; and at worst &quot; enemies of Georgian independence , &quot; as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power . 
But what separates us from Saakashvili is that we understand that history , geography , and economics dictate close ties to Russia . 
We simply see no contradiction between that stance and support for Western values . 
Indeed , even Russia , with all its imperfections , cannot be said to oppose Western values . 
The unfortunate paradox in Georgia - and elsewhere in the post-Soviet world - is that self-serving pro-Western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrificed in favor of a new dictatorship . 
When the West actively supports popular revolutions , as in Georgia and Ukraine , the newly established power relies on democratic slogans , not democratic behavior . 
Shevardnadze , too , was initially viewed as a symbol of post-Soviet Georgian democracy . 
As a government minister in 1993 , however , I was already hearing CIA officials express concern that a &quot; Mafia state &quot; was being created instead . 
First with Shevarnadze , and now with Saakashvili , popular disillusionment reflects not rejection of democracy , but frustration with its continuing absence . 
Saakashvili is evidently mesmerized by the US , and the West in general , but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in Georgia today ? 
And why , then , is sustaining close ties to the US so desirable , while refusing to dismiss Russia as a partner is regarded as being an agent of the Kremlin ? 
Is the US , in contrast to Russia , by definition honest , innocent , and high-minded ? 
There should be no place for such unfortunate double standards . 
Regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents , our political orientation is not pro-Russian , but pro-Georgian . 
We believe that Georgia should pursue its own interests , which it may share with Europe , Russia , or the US , but which are nonetheless our own . 
We have no interest in merely executing US policy , or in basing Georgia &apos;s foreign and domestic policy solely on distancing the country from Russia , as Saakashvili has done . 
Thus , pro-Georgian politics should not countenance nationalism . 
Nowadays , some of our politicians have embraced the slogan &quot; Georgia for Georgians . &quot; 
But nationalism suggests the lack of a coherent conception of Georgia &apos;s interests . 
Georgia &apos;s tradition as a multinational , tolerant state , which has been weakened in the last 15 years , must be reinvigorated , because we have no need for enemies against which to define ourselves . 
A strong relationship with Russia need not come at the expense of relations with America and the West , and vice versa . 
Georgia should be neither pro-Russian nor pro-American . 
It is a small , poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development . 
Its model should not be Palestine and permanent battle , but Switzerland and permanent prosperity .
