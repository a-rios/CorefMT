The End of the Emerging-Market Party 
CAMBRIDGE - Enthusiasm for emerging markets has been evaporating this year , and not just because of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s planned cuts in its large-scale asset purchases . 
Emerging-market stocks and bonds are down for the year and their economic growth is slowing . 
To see why , it is useful to understand how we got here . 
Between 2003 and 2011 , GDP in current prices grew by a cumulative 35 % in the United States , and by 32 % , 36 % , and 49 % in Great Britain , Japan , and Germany , respectively , all measured in US dollars . 
In the same period , nominal GDP soared by 348 % in Brazil , 346 % in China , 331 % in Russia , and 203 % in India , also in US dollars . 
And it was not just these so-called BRIC countries that boomed . 
This means that average sales , measured in US dollars , by supermarkets , beverage companies , department stores , telecoms , computer shops , and Chinese motorcycle vendors grew at comparable rates in these countries . 
It makes sense for companies to move to where dollar sales are booming , and for asset managers to put money where GDP growth measured in dollars is fastest . 
One might be inclined to interpret this amazing emerging-market performance as a consequence of the growth in the amount of real stuff that these economies produced . 
Consider Brazil . 
Only 11 % of its China-beating nominal GDP growth between 2003 and 2011 was due to growth in real ( inflation-adjusted ) output . 
The other 89 % resulted from 222 % growth in dollar prices in that period , as local-currency prices rose faster than prices in the US and the exchange rate appreciated . 
Some of the prices that increased were those of commodities that Brazil exports . 
Russia went through a somewhat similar experience . 
Real output growth explains only 12.5 % of the increase in the US dollar value of nominal GDP in 2003-2011 , with the rest attributable to the rise in oil prices , which improved Russia &apos;s terms of trade by 125 % , and to a 56 % real appreciation of the ruble against the dollar . 
By contrast , China &apos;s real growth was three times that of Brazil and Russia , but its terms of trade actually deteriorated by 26 % , because its manufactured exports became cheaper while its commodity imports became more expensive . 
The share of real growth in the main emerging countries &quot; nominal US dollar GDP growth was 20 % . 
The three phenomena that boost nominal GDP - increases in real output , a rise in the relative price of exports , and real exchange-rate appreciation - do not operate independently of one another . 
Countries that grow faster tend to experience real exchange-rate appreciation , a phenomenon known as the Balassa-Samuelson effect . 
Countries whose terms of trade improve also tend to grow faster and undergo real exchange-rate appreciation as domestic spending of their increased export earnings expands the economy and makes dollars relatively more abundant ( and thus cheaper ) . 
Real exchange rates may also appreciate because of increases in capital inflows , which reflect foreign investors &quot; enthusiasm for the prospects of the country in question . 
For example , from 2003 to 2011 , Turkey &apos;s inflows increased by almost 8 % of GDP , which partly explains the 70 % increase in prices measured in dollars . 
Real appreciation could also be caused by inconsistent macroeconomic policies that put the country in a perilous position , as in Argentina and Venezuela . 
Distinguishing between these disparate and inter-related phenomena is important , because some are clearly unsustainable . 
In general , terms-of-trade improvements and capital inflows do not continue permanently : they either stabilize or eventually reverse direction . 
Indeed , terms of trade do not have much of a long-term trend and show very pronounced reversion to the mean . 
While prices of oil , metals , and food rose very significantly after 2003 , reaching historic highs sometime between 2008 and 2011 , nobody expects similar price increases in the future . 
The debate is whether prices will remain more or less where they are or decline , as food , metals , and coal prices have already done . 
The same can be said of capital inflows and the upward pressure that they place on the real exchange rate . 
After all , foreign investors are putting their money in the country because they expect to be able to take even more money out in the future ; when this occurs , growth tends to slow , if not collapse , as happened in Spain , Portugal , Greece , and Ireland . 
In some countries , such as China , Thailand , South Korea , and Vietnam , nominal GDP growth was driven to a large extent by real growth . 
Moreover , according to the soon-to-be-published Atlas of Economic Complexity , these economies began producing more complex products , a harbinger of sustainable growth . 
Angola , Ethiopia , Ghana , and Nigeria also had very significant real growth , but nominal GDP was boosted by very large terms-of-trade effects and real appreciation . 
For most emerging-market countries , however , nominal GDP growth in the 2003-2011 period was caused by terms-of-trade improvements , capital inflows , and real appreciation . 
These mean-reverting processes are , well , reverting , implying that the buoyant performance of the recent past is unlikely to return any time soon . 
In most countries , the US dollar value of GDP growth handsomely exceeded what would be expected from real growth and a reasonable allowance for the accompanying Balassa-Samuelson effect . 
The same dynamics that inflated the dollar value of GDP growth in the good years for these countries will now work in the opposite direction : stable or lower export prices will reduce real growth and cause their currencies to stop appreciating or even weaken in real terms . 
No wonder the party is over .
