The EU &apos;s Turkish Opening 
MADRID â€’ June &apos;s Turkish general election sent a powerful message : Turkey &apos;s democracy remains intact . 
Indeed , while there were some grievances about transparency during the campaign process , democracy prevailed , with a stunning 86 % of eligible voters turning out - a rate rarely seen in Europe . 
The rest of the world - and especially the European Union - should take note . 
With their votes , Turkey &apos;s citizens denied the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) the absolute majority that it needed to amend the constitution . 
Moreover , by giving the Peoples &quot; Democratic Party ( HDP ) - which brings together the country &apos;s long-marginalized Kurdish minority and other groups - more than 10 % of the vote , they enabled the party to enter parliament for the first time , with representation throughout the country , not just in Kurd-majority areas . 
Reinforcing this triumph of pluralism , the Alevi and Christian minority groups won greater parliamentary representation , and the Yazidis and Roma will be represented for the first time . 
The new parliamentary configuration is likely to have a major impact on Turkey &apos;s foreign policy , which has faced serious challenges in the last few years . 
Indeed , as regional conflicts have intensified , the country &apos;s central foreign-policy objective of ensuring &quot; zero problems &quot; with its neighbors has become unattainable . 
And the policies that Turkey has pursued , most notably toward Syria and Egypt , have satisfied neither the region &apos;s Sunni-majority countries nor the West . 
Perhaps more important , the AKP government &apos;s foreign policy has faced considerable criticism from domestic forces , which now have more power to change it - an outcome that will occur regardless of whether the AKP ultimately forms a coalition or a minority government . 
The direction of change will have to account for the various parties &quot; preferred approaches . 
The secular , center-left Republican People &apos;s Party , for example , opposes interference in the internal affairs of any country , advocating instead that Turkey re-establish good relations with the countries of the region , including Syria . 
By contrast , the HDP protested against the previous AKP government &apos;s failure to intervene last year when the Islamic State besieged the Syrian city of Kobane . 
For its part , the rightist Nationalist Movement Party criticizes the AKP administration &apos;s decision to denounce the current Egyptian government , arguing that the move has all but eliminated Turkey &apos;s influence in the country . 
Now , the party asserts , Turkey should work to defend its regional neighbors &quot; territorial integrity . 
Amid all of this uncertainty , one thing is clear : Turkey cannot turn inward . 
Indeed , as a regional power , it has a responsibility to work to ease tensions and promote conflict resolution . 
It also has a long-term national interest in increased regional stability , not least because it would help to stem the tide of refugees - already numbering two million - flowing into the country , while opening up more commercial opportunities nearby . 
Turkey &apos;s democratic revival represents an ideal opportunity for the EU to rekindle its relations with the country . 
The EU is Turkey &apos;s leading trade partner and one of its largest investors , and has long considered Turkey to be a stable ally in a volatile region . 
The escalation of warfare and sectarian violence , which are becoming chronic , endanger both Turkey and Europe . 
In this context , renewed relations would serve both sides &quot; interests . 
The EU could , for example , provide diplomatic support in Turkey &apos;s dealings with its neighbors and humanitarian aid to help refugees . 
Given that a more stable Middle East would send fewer refugees and terrorists across its borders , Europe has a strong incentive to provide such support . 
The urgency of this situation demands that the bilateral relationship move beyond narrow discussions of Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU . 
After all , given broad resistance to any further EU enlargement at the moment , the accession process will undoubtedly move very slowly . 
The objective should thus be to find new , more efficient modes of cooperation that avoid the issues and conflicts that have impeded accession negotiations . 
This is not to say that the accession process should be abandoned . 
Rather , other more efficient channels of cooperation should be opened up in parallel to it . 
A good place to start would be a meeting of members of the European and Turkish parliaments . 
European leaders should also carefully monitor the possible revision of Turkish foreign policy , grasping opportunities to reignite bilateral dialogue on issues of common interest . 
This will require subsequent high-level meetings at regular intervals , in order to produce agreement regarding specific joint actions on urgent challenges . 
This is a moment of opportunity for EU-Turkey relations , and it must be seized . 
Achieving the goal of enhanced stability in the Middle East requires the two sides to work together . 
Europe should not let this train pass it by .
