Resilient China 
BEIJING - Today &apos;s financial crisis and looming global recession are challenging China &apos;s export-driven economic model as never before in the 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy . 
Indeed , in recent weeks , &quot; the factory of the world &quot; has become plagued by the closure of thousands of manufacturing plants and the threat of widespread labor unrest . 
I believe that China &apos;s innovative model for development is likely to help it weather both the gathering economic crisis and any resulting social and political unrest . 
Moreover , should China safely navigate this storm , its status as a rising economic and political power will be strengthened . 
The essence of the Chinese economic model is a careful sequencing of reforms , with priority given to economic reform over political reform , which means retaining the existing constitutional system and the ruling status of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . 
This model has involved substantial liberalization in terms of official ideology , the economy , and society , while maintaining public ownership of the major banks and largest state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) as &quot; anchors of economic stability . &quot; 
Similarly , whereas much autonomy has been extended to local governments in economic and social development , the central government has kept its grip on the direction of policy by maintaining the power to appoint local party and government officials . 
In short , the Chinese model reflects a combination of pragmatism , liberalism , and market competition , but with a strong dose of state intervention . 
What is astonishing about this &quot; model &quot; is that it has enabled China to maintain rapid growth within a relatively stable political environment for 30 years . 
Although China is not the only country to enjoy such long-term growth ( post-WWII Japan and South Korea are other cases ) , it is something of a miracle that a once-poor country with one-fifth of the world &apos;s population could achieve such sustained development . 
Of course , there are problems . 
Environmental deterioration is severe , the &quot; Gini index &quot; ( the gap between rich and poor ) is widening , and official corruption has not been curbed . 
Nor has domestic consumption been sufficiently expanded , leaving economic growth overly dependent on exports and foreign investment . 
Moreover , the global economic crisis has proven to be a far more serious threat than China &apos;s leaders initially recognized . 
The worst difficulties stem from China &apos;s dependence on international markets , especially the United States . 
A rapid decline in exports has caused the closure of thousands of factories in the Pearl River and Yangtze River deltas , and tens of millions of unemployed migrant workers are now returning to their hinterland provinces . 
These newly laid-off workers are joining more than six million new college graduates looking for work . 
If the economy cannot maintain high growth rates , mounting unemployment could combine with an accumulation of unresolved political and social issues to create a risk of major social unrest . 
But the &quot; China model &quot; has given the authorities the tools to avoid such an outcome . 
First , while the US had to wait for its new president to take office , China &apos;s government was able to intervene swiftly with a rescue package . 
Judging from events in the last two months , its $ 560 billion stabilization plan has served its purpose , despite some public criticism that it was too hastily formulated . 
Second , China &apos;s fiscal surplus , growing foreign-exchange reserves , and high savings rate have ensured the financial resources needed to maintain adequate investment and sufficiently rapid growth . 
Third , the new stimulus package is mainly aimed at infrastructure , equipment renovation , and industrial upgrading , which have suffered serious under-investment in the past , especially in China &apos;s central and western regions . 
Fourth , increased investment in the country &apos;s social safety net includes not only universal health and social insurance , but also expanded housing subsidies . 
Fifth , increased investment in rural areas , provided for in the government &apos;s rescue plan , will help narrow the gap between urban rich and rural poor . 
To promote the sale of household electrical appliances in rural areas , the government has begun providing a 13 % price subsidy , not only benefiting rural consumption , but also boosting the growth of major industrial enterprises . 
Finally , the authorities have subtly used the media to maintain consumer confidence by managing public criticism and thereby helping maintain popular trust in the government and the economy . 
Most forecasts suggest that , with a huge effort , China can maintain 8 % growth in 2009 . 
But the history of economic crises shows that non-economic factors play an equally important role in any solution . 
Currently , ordinary Chinese still believe that their country &apos;s economic growth remains high , and China &apos;s leaders continue to enjoy high approval ratings because of widespread belief in their abilities and dedication . 
Such psychological factors will need continual nurturing . 
The coincidence of economic crisis with the 30th anniversary of China &apos;s reforms has provided a timely reminder of the pain of the Cultural Revolution , memories of which make most Chinese opposed to returning in any way to the pre-reform years . 
Most Chinese now firmly believe that a more open and free China , one increasingly integrated into the world economy , is the only way forward .
