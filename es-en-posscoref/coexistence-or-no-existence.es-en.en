Coexistence or No Existence 
Now that the conflict over the cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad is dying down , or so I hope , it is clear that the only winners are the extremists  -  in the Islamic World and in Europe . 
I regret the fact that the controversy started in my own country when a newspaper chose to publish the cartoons in a na√Øve effort to demonstrate freedom of expression . 
It happened last autumn , and at that time I argued publicly against what I regarded as an insensitive act , because it hurt other peoples &quot; religious feelings . 
It was also an unnecessary provocation , and constituted in itself a caricature of our cherished freedom of expression , that is guaranteed in our constitution . 
As my father ( an old journalist himself ) used to say : Freedom of expression provides a right to say what you think , but it is not an obligation to do so ! 
When the controversy blew up a few weeks ago , a lot of fuel was added to the fire . 
Many incorrect stories were circulated . 
This added to the anger , and it led to burning embassies and threats of violence . 
The conflict has been called &quot; A Clash of Civilizations . &quot; 
It could well deteriorate into that ; the potential is there . 
There were so many mistakes on both sides : On one side there was a lack of understanding of the deep religious feelings that were hurt by a show of disrespect . 
The potential for a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; lies in the deep differences between European and Islamic cultures and traditions . 
We should all be aware of those who seek to deepen these differences and turn them into insurmountable gulfs instead of inspirations to a richer life . 
It is only too easy for them to point to the case of the cartoons and say : Now you see how western-style democracy and freedom of expression mean that you will face ridicule and mockery of your religious faith ! 
It is easy because freedom of expression was used , when publishing the cartoons , merely to demonstrate itself and therefore became a caricature of itself . 
Our globalized world brings us not only economic opportunities but also cultural and spiritual challenges . 
Internet and SMS have developed over less than a decade and we still have not made the mental adjustments to the implications of such instantaneous communication . 
The Danish cartoonists and newspaper editors that published the cartoons obviously failed to understand that they were not just addressing themselves to a local audience but to other inhabitants of the global village . 
If they had realized that , they would not have published the cartoons - as they stated clearly when they made their apology . 
The lessons of this unfortunate incident seem to me to be clear : We should all acknowledge that in the modern world it is increasingly necessary for all sensible people to work for mutual respect , tolerance and better understanding . 
We must avoid situations where different values are confronted with each other in ways that trigger violence . 
Instead we must try to build bridges between religions , ethics and norms . 
Call it self-censorship if you wish . 
If you wish to stay in the same room as other people you try not to offend them through unnecessary provocations . 
The room we are talking about is no longer the local pond but the global village . 
Co-existence is the key . 
Some people are unwilling to accept this . 
They are not open to values other than their own . 
They want confrontations . 
You find such people in Europe as well as in the Islamic world . 
Unfortunately they are the beneficiaries of the conflict that was triggered by the cartoons in a Danish newspaper . 
But if we do not stand up to them we all run a grave risk of repeating some of history &apos;s great mistakes . 
The risk was explained in a very small poem by the late Danish poet and philosopher Piet Hein in one of his famous &quot; Grooks &quot; called &quot; That is the question &quot; : 
Coexistence 
or no existence
