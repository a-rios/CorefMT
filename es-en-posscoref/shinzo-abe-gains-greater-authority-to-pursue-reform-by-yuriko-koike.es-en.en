Japan in Action 
TOKYO - Japan &apos;s prolonged political anni horribiles - spanning more than half a decade - has ended . 
The Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) won a decisive victory in elections to the upper house of parliament held on July 21 , bringing to an end the indecisive politics caused by the lack of an effective majority . 
During the previous six years , there were six prime ministers , ten defense ministers , and 14 justice ministers ( ten of whom came and went during the 39 months of rule by the Democratic Party of Japan ) . 
These figures indicate just how unstable the country &apos;s political situation had become . 
But anxiety about the immature DPJ government , prolonged deflation , and unprecedented challenges posed by neighboring countries created a widespread sense of crisis among Japanese voters . 
It was this that motivated them to return the LDP to power , though many voters seemed fed up with the party just a few short years ago . 
In the recent election campaign , the LDP continued to criticize the previous DPJ government &apos;s immaturity , but avoided attacks on other parties . 
Instead , the LDP highlighted the beneficial effects of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s reforms ( colloquially known as &quot; Abenomics &quot; ) , such as increased share prices , faster GDP growth , and higher employment , all of which have created hope for a turnaround in Japan &apos;s prospects . 
Since Abe returned last December for a second stint as Prime Minister , Japanese voters have entrusted him with maintaining political stability and ensuring economic revitalization . 
The Abe government must implement deregulation and other structural reforms while convincing powerful interest groups to adjust to a new national and global environment in which Japan &apos;s old economic model no longer works . 
Fortunately , Abe will not need to worry about elections for the next three years . 
With strong majorities in both houses , he should be able to secure whatever reform legislation he needs - that is , provided that he can maintain the LDP &apos;s internal discipline ( his enormous popularity will help him ) . 
Abe &apos;s agenda includes reform of social security in response to demographic trends , as well as gaining the agriculture sector &apos;s acceptance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , the bold regional trade agreement that will unite the United States , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , and much of the rest of Asia , with the exception of China . 
The rigors of the TPP are bound to force significant agricultural reforms , and pushing it through will , indeed , test party discipline . 
But Abe is also pressing for change in medical research and the technology sector by embracing long-shunned innovations such as iPS cells ( artificial stem cells ) . 
He is also emphasizing the development of renewable energy and power-saving innovations , which became an urgent policy objective following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant two years ago . 
Abe is resolved to make steady progress on each of these key issues . 
But Abenomics has a strategic corollary as well . 
Japanese diplomacy lost its footing in the unstable - and often naive - politics of the DPJ years . 
Thus , Abe has been traveling abroad every month since last December in an effort to demonstrate that Japan has returned as a global player , and is particularly keen to play a prominent role in recasting Asia &apos;s security structures in the wake of China &apos;s rise . 
Indeed , Abe has visited 13 countries in the last six months alone ( a schedule that has helped him to cast aside any lingering memories of his previous tenure as Prime Minister , when ill health forced him from office after barely a year ) . 
Abe has placed particular emphasis on strengthening Japan &apos;s alliance with the Unites States , which had atrophied as a result of the DPJ government &apos;s feckless behavior ( relations with China deteriorated as well ) . 
More broadly , Abe envisages Japan &apos;s future as that of a trading country that has assumed its rightful role in ensuring a free and open maritime order . 
Abe &apos;s diplomatic whirlwind is aimed at strengthening ties with countries that share this commitment , as well as Japan &apos;s other values , including human rights and democracy . 
Of course , given Asia &apos;s size and dynamism , there are many other issues that will need to be addressed in the years ahead , including improvement of the security environment in a currently unstable East Asia and amending the country &apos;s constitution , which the LDP has considered doing for many years . 
That task has already begun , and the LDP &apos;s recent election victory will strengthen Abe &apos;s ability to complete it .
