Rethinking the Fight against HIV 
COPENHAGEN - Thirty years ago , the world got its first inkling of impending catastrophe when five young gay men in Los Angeles were struck down by the illness that became known as HIV / AIDS . 
Today , the disease has a truly global impact , claiming 1.8 million lives annually - the equivalent of wiping out the population of Washington , DC , three times every year . 
Of course , there have been remarkable scientific breakthroughs since 1981 . 
Scientists established that a previously unknown retrovirus was the cause of AIDS , and determined that the virus was primarily transmitted through sexual contact . 
They created tests that can establish a person &apos;s HIV status or gauge the disease &apos;s progression . 
They designed antiretroviral drugs that have made it possible for HIV infection to be a survivable chronic condition . 
Alongside these advances , policymakers , human-rights advocates , and people living with HIV / AIDS have fought hard to reduce stigma and discrimination . 
And an unprecedented amount of funds has been invested in HIV treatment and prevention . 
By 2008 , total resources for HIV programs in low- and middle-income countries were an incredible 50 times higher than they were just 12 years earlier . 
But , despite this significant progress , the toll of HIV / AIDS remains excruciating . 
There are 2.4 million new infections annually and 34 million people living with HIV / AIDS who require treatment to stay alive . 
There is a widespread misperception in the developed world that we have already won the battle against HIV / AIDS . 
In reality , the crisis has merely become less visible . 
Sub-Saharan Africa has 10 % of the world &apos;s population , but is home to 70 % of those living with HIV / AIDS . 
Across Africa , the disease is estimated to have reduced average national growth rates by 2-4 percentage points a year . 
Researchers led by Bernhard Schwartl√§nder , the director of evidence , strategy , and results at UNAIDS , calculated that annual spending of at least $ 22 billion will be needed by 2015 to achieve universal access to HIV prevention , treatment , care , and support . 
UNAIDS and the Kaiser Family Foundation estimate that in 2010 donors gave $ 6.9 billion for HIV prevention , care , treatment , and support - down 10 % from 2009 . 
The lamentable reality is that securing $ 22 billion in annual funding by 2015 will be practically impossible . 
So , it is worth asking another question : what could we achieve with just a small increase in the current funding ? 
That is what the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the Rush Foundation are doing in a new project , RethinkHIV . 
There are as many opinions about what should be the top priority for funders as there are options . 
We spoke with people living with HIV across Africa who have starkly different perspectives . 
In Kawangware , Kenya , 38-year-old Esther argued passionately for more social-policy reform . 
She told us , &quot; I believe HIV isn &apos;t the only killer . 
It &apos;s also the stigma and the stress that kills faster . &quot; 
In Mungushi , Tanzania , on the other hand , 28-year-old Rehema told us that economic assistance would make the biggest difference . 
&quot; It is very hard to take the antiretroviral drugs without having any food in the stomach and when I am worrying about where I am going to live , &quot; she said . 
In RethinkHIV , we engage some of the world &apos;s top HIV economists , epidemiologists , and demographers in this vital discussion about priorities . 
Their new research will be essential input . 
Teams of researchers have written 18 papers identifying the most effective ways to tackle the epidemic , looking at what has been proven to work , and at what could be scaled up or replicated elsewhere in Africa . 
All of them calculate the costs and benefits of their proposed solutions , and will compete to convince a panel of five world-class economists , including three Nobel laureates , that they have the very best solutions . 
The Nobel Laureates &quot; findings will point to the most effective avenues for additional funding . 
This approach , the &quot; Copenhagen Consensus &quot; process , is the same one that has been applied every four years to global challenges , and will next take place in 2012 . 
The premise is simple : no dollar can be spent twice . 
A billion dollars spent on one set of approaches can &apos;t be spent elsewhere . 
So where is it best to spend more first ? 
Often , this simple question is not asked , because doing so means choosing between many popular strategies , each with its own base of enthusiastic supporters . 
By highlighting the effectiveness of some options - or pointing to policy choices that require further research - the new research and Nobel laureate findings can assist donors and catalyze optimal choices about where funding should go . 
Thirty years after the discovery of HIV / AIDS , we have seen impressive scientific and policy advances . 
But HIV / AIDS remains a daily threat to millions , stunts development , and destroys far too many lives . 
With attention and money flagging , it is vital that we step up our fight against this disease by adding lessons from cost-benefit analysis to our arsenal .
