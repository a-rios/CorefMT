The Death of Pakistan ? 
NEW DELHI - This is a tipping point for Pakistan . 
Will it survive the current maelstrom of challenges - exemplified by the recent assassination of Governor Salmaan Taseer of Punjab by one of his bodyguards , an Islamic zealot - or will it capsize ? 
For the world , Pakistan &apos;s fate is an urgent , perhaps even an existential , question . 
After all , Pakistan is a nuclear-armed , terrorist-spawning regional power . 
The roots of Pakistan &apos;s instability run deep . 
Following World Wars I and II , the European powers and the United States sat around distant tables and fabricated frontiers , giving birth to Iraq , Israel , Kuwait , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia - and thus to most of the of the Middle East &apos;s current ills . 
The region &apos;s new map was based on the assumption that the fundamentals of &quot; Muslim Asia &quot; could be transformed by introducing the Western nation-state system . 
Instead , what formed was a region of entities that have largely failed to cohere as nations . 
In 1947 , the Indian sub-continent , too , was vivisected in much the same way , with a religion-based entity carved out of it : Pakistan . 
Of course , it is pointless at this stage to re-examine that tragic folly . 
The consequences of partition , however , remain : Pakistan has not yet been able to evolve an administratively credible government . 
Indeed , if Muhammad Ali Jinnah , Pakistan &apos;s founding father , had been right that Muslims are a separate nation , Bangladesh would not have broken away from it , and the country &apos;s relations with its neighbor Afghanistan would be free of intrigue and violence . 
This brings us to the heart of the matter : the question of Islam and statehood . 
In his book Islam and the Destiny of Man , Gai Eaton put the matter with elegant precision : &quot; Islamic society is theocentric ... not theocratic . &quot; 
This is an important distinction , for it calls into question the &quot; validity of ( the ) concept of ( an ) Islamic state as distinct from a Muslim state . &quot; 
The first , Eaton writes , is an &quot; ideological proposition &quot; that has &quot; never materialized in Muslim history because no Muslim state has even been theocratic . &quot; 
Whereas the centrality of the state in human affairs is a modern , European development , traditional societies like India or Pakistan have always regarded the state as no more than a necessary evil , since large societies cannot be managed on the old tribal basis . 
For Muslims , all sovereignty vests in God ; indeed , nothing whatever exists or can exist outside of Him . 
As Eaton puts it , the Koran &apos;s insistence that &quot; there is no god but God &quot; can also be interpreted to mean that &quot; there is no legislator but the Legislator . &quot; 
That is why in Islamic jurisprudence , laws must be derived from the Koran and the Sunnah of the Prophet , not handed down from British or classical philosophy . 
So the central issue in Islam has not been whether the state can be separated from religion , but whether society can be so separated . 
It cannot , which is why no Muslim state can be fully secular . 
Indeed , the issue that now lies at Pakistan &apos;s core is whether it can become a theocratic state . 
Which brings us back to the horror of Taseer &apos;s assassination and the strange and divided reaction to it in Pakistani civil society . 
Taseer &apos;s assassination , unlike that of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards in 1984 , was not a retaliatory revenge attack . 
Worse , many citizens , if not most , have reacted by supporting the assassin ( some showering him with flower petals ) , while hundreds of Ulemas ( religious leaders ) welcomed his killing and called participation in his funeral &quot; un-Islamic . &quot; 
According to the chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami movement , &quot; the killed is himself responsible for his killing . &quot; 
This aggressive , fundamentalist path is inexorably leading Pakistan back centuries in time . 
Of course , Pakistan alone is responsible for the path it chooses , but it would not have so readily adopted its current course but for the tacit ( and explicit ) support that the US has given it , beginning in the 1980 &quot; s to counter the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan . 
Once again , we see how misplaced Western national priorities can bring ruin on a non-Western nation . 
In any contest of ideas , the extreme will usually triumph over the moderate . 
In Pakistan , the extremist now wears Islamic garb , and stands for the Creator , for faith , and for a theocratic order . 
What , by contrast , might a Pakistani liberal stand for ? Indeed , who in Pakistan is calling for a liberal , democratic country ? 
In the dark , congested alleys of Lahore , Karachi , Peshawar , or Quetta , the yearning is not for democratic liberalism , but for the believers to unite behind the one true faith . 
Here , in this desire , is where Pakistan &apos;s ultimate reckoning is to be found , not in the corridors of Washington , and certainly not on the broad avenues of Islamabad .
