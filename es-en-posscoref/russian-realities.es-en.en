Russian Realities 
At first glance , Russia bears many of the hallmarks of a great power . 
It possesses a large arsenal of nuclear weapons , a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council , enormous reserves of oil and other minerals , a recent record of robust economic growth , and more territory than any other country despite being only three-fourths the size of the former Soviet Union . 
Closer inspection , however , reveals a different Russia . 
Much of its wealth reflects the increased value of energy , not productive economic activity . 
Russia &apos;s armed forces are able to project little in the way of usable military might . 
The country &apos;s population now numbers less than Pakistan &apos;s and is declining by 500,000 people per year , leaving large portions of its vast landmass mostly uninhabited . 
Male life expectancy is now less than 60 years , owing to alcoholism , crime , drugs , disease , and a dreadful public health system . 
All this adds up to a Russia that , if not quite a Potemkin state , is anything but great . 
There are limits to what Russia can accomplish in the world in any positive sense , although its capacity to be a spoiler or create problems is considerable . 
Decisions made in Moscow can affect world energy prices , the future of the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs , and the success of terrorists . 
For better and for worse , Russia still matters . 
But how much will it matter ? 
One question concerns political stability . 
In order to remain intact and functional , the country needs a political system and a society that persuade talented young people to stay in Russia - and that provides them with the education to develop their talent . 
There also must be limits on the power of the central government and the presidency , a degree of regions autonomy , and rule of law - in short , the rudiments of a modern state and democracy . 
Alas , Russia is moving more in the opposite direction ; political power is becoming more , not less , concentrated . 
The economic picture is similarly uncertain . 
High energy prices are a boon to Russia &apos;s economy , but , as is often the case in the Middle East and other oil- and gas-rich regions , they can be a burden as well , feeding corruption and discouraging real economic activity . 
The challenge for Russia &apos;s leaders is to use its oil wealth to educate Russia &apos;s people and rebuild Russia &apos;s infrastructure , thereby ensuring global competitiveness and employment growth . 
Russia also needs a national security strategy to complement its political and economic renewal . 
All stick and little carrot has failed to quell Chechen nationalism , and President Vladimir Putin &apos;s similarly heavy-handed attempts to control Russia &apos;s so-called &quot; near abroad &quot; - as in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution - have proven no more successful . 
Nor will any posture succeed that seeks to put Russia forward as a geopolitical counterweight to the United States . 
Such a strategy might be politically satisfying to some , but Russia lacks the resources to compete with the US and needs good bilateral relations in order to proceed with its own internal transformation . 
At the same time , the best way to help bring about a more liberal Russia - one that promises to be more stable at home and more responsible abroad - is by working with it . 
The outside world can and should support the strengthening of civil society , independent media , and a true transfer of political power in 2008 . 
Isolating Russia makes no sense . 
Russian membership in the World Trade Organization has the potential to strengthen the rule of law , combat corruption , and give Russia a stake in better relations with the outside world . 
Closer ties between Russia and the European Union make sense for similar reasons . 
There should also be some understanding for what Russia and the Russian people have gone through over the past two decades . 
Losing a country and a special place in the world is the sort of trauma that could lead to the emergence of extreme and potentially violent nationalism . 
Russia should be treated as a major power , which means consultations on important global issues . 
Its voice should be heard on matters ranging from terrorism and weapons proliferation to global climate change and energy policy . 
Next year &apos;s G-8 meeting in Russia provides an opportunity to do all of this and more . 
Amid all the attention being devoted to China and the potential for competition or even conflict with the US , it should not be forgotten that Russia &apos;s future hangs in the balance , for history suggests that declining powers can pose as great a challenge to world order as rising ones . 
One need only consider Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey at the start of the twentieth century or the former Yugoslavia at its end . 
So far , the decline of what was the Soviet Union has proceeded relatively well ; 
Russia , the principal successor state , has avoided all-out civil war and war with its neighbors . 
But the challenge of integrating Russia remains . 
At best , Russia is a potential partner in the effort to manage globalization &apos;s challenges ; at worst , it is a potential problem . 
What is certain is that how Russia develops will be a key factor determining the character of this century , no less than the last .
