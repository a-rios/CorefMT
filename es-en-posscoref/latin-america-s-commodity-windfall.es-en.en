Latin America &apos;s Commodity Windfall 
BUENOS AIRES - Latin America is experiencing an exceptional boom , owing to soaring income from exports of natural resources . 
Have these funds been used as effectively as possible ? 
With the exception of Central America , rising commodity prices have improved the external accounts and fiscal positions of Latin American countries . 
Revenue from natural-resource exports represented 25 % of total income in the public sector in 2008 . 
In Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador , and Mexico , it exceeded 40 % . 
This comes to around 7 % of GDP in these countries ( more than 11 % in Venezuela and Bolivia , and 8 % in Ecuador and Mexico ) . 
To determine what should be done with this windfall , it is important to know whether the increase in commodity prices is likely to be permanent or transitory . 
If the latter , the best course of action would be to save the additional income or use it , as a second-best option , to reduce the national debt . 
If the increase were considered permanent , however , it would make sense to increase spending or reduce tax pressure . 
The choice will depend on the characteristics of the country . 
There would be more reason to reduce taxes in Norway , for example , than in Latin America , where the general course would be to increase spending . 
It is reasonable to presume that the commodity boom &apos;s positive effect on Latin America &apos;s terms of trade will last for an extended period - perhaps 10-15 years - but that it will not be permanent . 
Moreover , it could be argued that if more knowledge is not added to exports , it will be hard to achieve sustainable economic development based on natural resources . 
Given this , it would be wise to spend at least part of the windfall on improving the capacity to innovate , which is essential for a long-term growth beyond the fluctuation of international commodity prices . 
That means investing in education and building incentives to increase productivity through changes in products , processes , or organization . 
So what happened to the additional revenues derived from the commodity boom of recent years ? 
Some of these funds were aimed to improve countries &quot; fiscal balance . 
While the primary deficit ( before interest payments ) in 2002 was similar among countries with and without important natural resources , in 2007 , the former showed a surplus equivalent to 3.8 % of GDP - compared to 1.6 % of GDP for non-commodity-exporting countries . 
As a result , public debt fell to 28 % of GDP region-wide in 2008 , from 51 % in 2003 . 
Fiscal consolidation was not , however , the result of formal fiscal rules . 
While several countries established legal limits to control spending , deficits , and debt , in some cases -for example , Argentina , Ecuador , and Venezuela - such laws were not enforced . 
In addition to reducing debt , Chile used its additional revenues to increase the resources of two fiscal funds : when the recession began , there were more than $ 22 billion in assets in both funds . 
Despite imprudent fiscal management , Venezuela , too , maintained considerable resources in specific funds ( $ 11 billion at the end of 2008 ) . 
Ecuador and Colombia , by contrast , eliminated their stabilization funds in 2005 and 2008 , respectively . 
Beyond improving public accounts , a large part of the revenues from high commodity prices were used to increase public spending , although this proportion varied from country to country . 
At one extreme stands Argentina , with the largest increase in public spending relative to GDP in Latin America ( almost ten points ) . 
At the other extreme are Chile , Costa Rica , and Uruguay . 
Since there is no attribution in countries &quot; fiscal accounts of income from products linked to natural resources , we can only hazard a reasonably informed guess about how that spending was allocated . 
Between 2001-2002 and 2007-2008 , social-welfare spending in countries with abundant natural resources increased by around 55 % in real terms , with spending relative to GDP rising by nearly 3.5 percentage points . 
Therefore , on a regional level , a large part of the additional resources were used to increase public spending , especially for social security , health , and education , in that order . 
In some countries there were also increased subsidies . 
Argentina , for example , increased subsidies for energy and transport to the equivalent of 3 % of GDP . 
Something very similar occurred in Ecuador and Venezuela throughout the decade . 
In contrast , spending for other objectives - for example , research and development on new products and processes - increased very little . 
In short , Latin American countries have used their additional export revenues to pay down debt and increase social spending . 
Both were necessary , but , with few exceptions , the region is not using the commodity windfall to do what it must : improve technological capacities sufficiently to ensure that future economic growth does not depend entirely on the fickle furtunes of finite natural resources .
