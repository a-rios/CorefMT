Expansion and Democracy in Europe 
Europe is poised on the rim of two nearly revolutionary undertakings : eastward expansion and the possibility of a draft constitution for the European Union . 
Both should be treated as inextricably linked . 
I support EU-enlargement . 
It is an historical necessity . 
However , expansion must go hand-in-hand with institutional reforms that improve both the EU &apos;s capacity to act and its democratic legitimacy . 
Since communism &apos;s fall , the nations of Central and Eastern Europe have undergone exhilarating yet wrenching transitions . 
The biggest danger posed by that rather abrupt and harsh process of transformation is that , in trying to become open , a society risks disintegrating in the effort . 
This may happen when old structures are swept away , and are not replaced with new ones in a prudent way . 
Open societies demand reliable institutions , and these cannot be created overnight . 
Making that difficult passage from closed to open society was a necessary step for the states of Central and Eastern Europe to become candidate members and - perhaps soon - full members of the EU . 
Enormous effort was expended by them - something not fully understood by current EU members - to accomplish their domestic transformations and so adapt themselves to the incredibly extensive acquis of the Union . 
But the EU still must prove to the countries seeking to join it that the Union is a truly open , democratic society of the type they have struggled to make of themselves . 
That question has practical implications , for if the EU is to manifest itself as a free and open society it must assure its ability to function both effectively and efficiently when expansion takes place . 
Here is where the constitutional assembly underway in Brussels can and must link enlargement with reform of the Union , for enlargement must also be used to strengthen the transparency and democratic legitimacy of the EU . 
The Council of Nice in 2000 sought to restructure the Union for the time when enlargement will double its membership to 27 . 
But the Nice meeting failed miserably . 
An important step not taken was to end the principle of unanimity that rules decisionmaking in the EU Council of Ministers , and replacing it with a system of qualified-majority voting . 
So long as unanimity remains , the more countries that take part in decisionmaking , the bigger the danger of a single veto blocking action . 
Reform of the structures and working procedures of the EU Commission is also an urgent need . 
Because of the system of collegiality , the sheer number of commissioners even now strains the Commission &apos;s decisionmaking capacity . 
If , in future , every country continues to send at least one commissioner to Brussels , the process will grind to a crawl , if not a halt . 
Better to radically reduce the size of the Commission , and to either tie countries into regional packages for Commission representation or rotate membership every few years among countries . 
But the most important question of EU democracy is this : a nation can vote its government out of office when it is not satisfied , but this is not possible in the EU . 
The Commission cannot be voted out of office because it was never actually voted into office . 
The European parliament is also not yet a real parliament , with control of the purse and oversight of the executive . 
Both must change . 
The European parliament must exercise effective democratic control on the European level . 
It must receive full sovereignty over EU budget-making and the right to sign-off on all decisions taken by a qualified majority in the Council . 
As to the EU &apos;s executive , the Commission , or at least its president , must be elected - in the long-term it may be elected directly by European citizens , and in the interim , at least by members of the European parliament . 
The Nice conference failed because the EU &apos;s national leaders could not , or would not , reach beyond their immediate national interests to take a pan-European perspective . 
But the Union &apos;s capacity to act as a union is now a pre-condition to securing each European country &apos;s national interests . 
If the events of September 11 th have taught us anything , they have shown that purely national answers to vital questions are either unavailable or unviable . 
As the Union reforms itself internally to strengthen its democratic character and become a truly open society , it must not close itself off from those outside it . 
At the very moment when today &apos;s candidate countries strive for EU membership , EU enlargement is feared by those states that are unlikely to join the Union for the foreseeable future . 
After the current round of enlargement is completed , the EU &apos;s eastern border will likely run to the east of the Baltic states , Poland , Slovakia , Hungary and Romania , with Russia , Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova on the other side . 
The Union must see to it that this border is not a new wall dividing Europe , and that the zone of stability and prosperity it has created for its members spreads to the EU &apos;s eastern neighbors as well . 
Membership in the EU should not be the determining factor in European statecraft . 
Our shared European values should matter most . 
The EU &apos;s ability to create peace and stability - not to mention economic prosperity - is unique in modern history . 
Indeed , the current state of the world shows how necessary a common European foreign and security policy is . 
Today there is not too much America - as some maintain - but too little Europe . 
The challenge facing the delegates at the Brussels convention is nothing less than creating an open , democratic , and yes , greater , Europe .
