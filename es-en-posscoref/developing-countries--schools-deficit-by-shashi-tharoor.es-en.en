The Emerging World &apos;s Education Imperative 
NEW DELHI - Official delegations from the world &apos;s nine most populous developing countries just met in New Delhi to discuss a subject vital for their countries &quot; futures : education . 
The meeting of ministers and others from Bangladesh , Brazil , China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Mexico , Nigeria and Pakistan , known as the E-9 , is the latest in a series of encounters held every two years to fulfill the pledge of &quot; education for all &quot; by 2015 . 
The E-9 account for 54 % of the world &apos;s population , 42.3 % of children not in school , 58 % of young illiterates ( aged 15-24 ) , and 67 % of adult illiterates ( two-thirds of whom are women ) . 
So the challenges are enormous : children , from families too poor to think about education , beyond the reach of schooling and too malnourished to study ; and too few schools , classrooms , teaching resources , and adequately trained teachers . 
Rampant illiteracy underpins other problems , including exploding populations , gender imbalances , and widespread poverty . 
India provides a good example of how these problems should be addressed . 
A decade ago , 30 million Indian children were not in school ; today , the figure is three million . 
A far-reaching Right to Education Act , obliging the state and central governments to provide ( as a constitutional right ) eight years of free and compulsory education to all children between six and 14 , has had a large impact . 
And free mid-day meals at school are a powerful incentive to children from poor families to attend school and stay there . 
This does not mean that all enrolled students will emerge prepared for the information age ; but getting children into school is a start . 
India also needs a relevant curriculum and skilled teachers who can motivate students to learn it - in short , an overdue emphasis on quality , in addition to officals &quot; understandable focus on access and inclusion . 
There are 540 million Indians under the age of 25 . 
The labor force is expected to increase by 32 % over the next 20 years , whereas it will decline by 4 % in industrialized countries and by nearly 5 % in China . 
India &apos;s favorable demographic profile can add significantly to its economic-growth potential for the next three decades , provided that its young people are educated and trained properly . 
Otherwise , the same young people will swell the ranks of the frustrated and unemployed , with unimaginable consequences in terms of social unrest and the risk of organized violence . 
Maoist groups already target such people for recruitment . 
If India is to avoid an apocalyptic fate , it must give them a better chance of gainful employment through more and improved educational opportunities . 
India has one of the largest higher-education systems in the world , and ranks second in terms of student enrollment . 
But , while the country now has 621 universities and 33,500 colleges , only a few are world-class institutions , including the Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT ) whose graduates have flourished in America &apos;s Silicon Valley . 
But such institutions are still islands in a sea of mediocrity . 
India is entering the global employment marketplace with a self-imposed handicap of which we are just beginning to become aware . 
For far too long , we were complacent , having produced , since the 1960 &quot; s , the world &apos;s second largest pool of trained scientists and engineers . 
They were more than our then-protected economy could absorb , so many tens of thousands of them left to make their fortunes elsewhere , founding companies in Silicon Valley , inventing the Pentium chip , and even winning a couple of Nobel Prizes . 
Their success meant that IIT was soon mentioned alongside MIT . 
But it also masked another reality - that there just are not as many of them as there should be . 
Senior Indian executives whose businesses require them to recruit competent scientists or engineers complain that demand for such talent vastly exceeds the supply . 
Once the elite institutions are accounted for , what remains is decidedly uneven in quality . 
A World Bank Survey in 2009 highlighted that 64 % of employers are &quot; only somewhat satisfied , &quot; or worse , with the new engineering graduates they hire . 
I have spoken to many CEOs who tell me that many , if not most , of their new employees require remedial training before they can begin work , in order to compensate for the shortcomings of their university education . 
Indeed , companies like Tata and Infosys are hiring people whom they do not consider to be up to par - and spending 6-9 months , sometimes longer , to educate them properly for their jobs . 
The need for education reform has never been clearer , and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh &apos;s government has recognized it . 
Still , India &apos;s spends only 1.2 % of its GDP on higher education , compared to 3.1 % in the US or , closer to home , 2.4 % in South Korea . 
The figure should be higher . 
So , too , is India &apos;s 3.3 % share of global output of academic research far too low for a country with 17 % of the world &apos;s brains . 
Education is now recognized as a national priority . 
More resources are being committed , the corporate sector is being encouraged to get involved , and there is a welcome emphasis on innovation . 
International cooperation , exemplified by the mutual learning implicit in the E-9 exercise , is also being tapped . 
The next ten years could witness a dramatic transformation of education in India . 
But it will not happen without a huge national effort . 
The rest of the E-9 , engaged in similar endeavors , will be watching .
