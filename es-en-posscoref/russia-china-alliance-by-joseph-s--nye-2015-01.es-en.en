A New Sino-Russian Alliance ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Some analysts believe that 2014 ushered in a new era of Cold War-style geopolitics . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea was met with heavy economic sanctions from Europe and the United States , weakening Russia &apos;s ties with the West and leaving the Kremlin eager to strengthen ties with China . 
The question is whether Russia will manage to build a real alliance with the People &apos;s Republic . 
At first glance , it seems plausible . 
Indeed , traditional balance-of-power theory suggests that US primacy in power resources should be offset by a Sino-Russian partnership . 
Perhaps more convincing , there seems to be historical precedent for such a partnership . 
In the 1950s , China and the Soviet Union were allied against the US . 
After US President Richard Nixon &apos;s opening to China in l972 , the balance shifted , with the US and China cooperating to limit what they viewed as a dangerous rise in the Soviet Union &apos;s power . 
With the collapse of the Soviet Union , that de facto US-China alliance ended , and a China-Russia rapprochement began . 
In 1992 , the two countries declared that they were pursuing a &quot; constructive partnership &quot; ; in 1996 , they progressed toward a &quot; strategic partnership &quot; ; and in 2001 , they signed a treaty of &quot; friendship and cooperation . &quot; 
In recent years , China and Russia have cooperated closely in the UN Security Council and taken similar positions on Internet regulation . 
They have used diplomatic frameworks - such as the BRICS group of major emerging countries ( along with Brazil , India , and South Africa ) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( along with Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan ) - to coordinate positions . 
And Putin has struck up a good working relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping , based on their shared domestic illiberalism and desire to counter American ideology and influence . 
Their economic relationship , too , seems to be progressing . 
Last May , shortly after the annexation of Crimea , Russia announced a $ 400 billion deal to supply 38 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) of gas to China annually for 30 years , beginning in 2019 . 
The contract , between Russia &apos;s state-owned energy giant Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation , entails the construction of a 2,500-mile gas pipeline to China &apos;s Heilongjiang province ( where , incidentally , the two countries nearly went to war a few decades ago ) . 
Though the exact price remains secret , it appears that Russia offered major concessions , after nearly a decade of negotiations , to ensure the deal &apos;s success . 
Moreover , in November , Gazprom announced a framework agreement to deliver an additional 30 bcm of gas to China &apos;s Xingjiang Province from western Siberia for 30 years via another new pipeline . 
If the &quot; eastern &quot; and &quot; western &quot; pipelines are completed as planned , the 68 bcm they deliver to China annually would dwarf the 40 bcm that Russia exports to its current largest customer , Germany . 
This may seem to portend an ever-deepening bilateral relationship . 
But there is a hitch : the gas deals amplify a significant bilateral trade imbalance , with Russia supplying raw materials to China and importing Chinese manufactures . 
And the gas deals do not make up for Russia &apos;s lost access to the Western technology that it needs to develop frontier Arctic fields and become an energy superpower , not just China &apos;s gas station . 
In fact , the problems with a Sino-Russian alliance run even deeper . 
With its economic , military , and demographic heft - China generates considerable unease in Russia . 
Consider the demographic situation in eastern Siberia , where six million Russians live across the border from up to 120 million Chinese . 
Furthermore , Russia &apos;s economic and military power has been in decline , whereas China &apos;s has exploded . 
Anxiety over China &apos;s conventional military superiority probably motivated , at least partly , Russia &apos;s 2009 announcement of a new military doctrine explicitly reserving the right to first use of nuclear weapons - a stance that resembles America &apos;s Cold War force posture , aimed at deterring superior conventional Soviet forces in Europe . 
These imbalances suggest that Russia would resist a tight military alliance with China , even as the two countries pursue mutually beneficial tactical diplomatic coordination . 
China &apos;s willingness to cooperate with Russia also has its limits . 
After all , China &apos;s development strategy depends on its continued integration into the world economy - and , specifically , reliable access to American markets and technology . 
The Chinese Communist Party &apos;s legitimacy depends on strong economic growth , and it will not risk this strategy for some &quot; authoritarian alliance &quot; with Russia . 
Even within multilateral forums , the relationship between Russia and China is far from balanced . 
Given that China &apos;s economy is larger than the other four BRICS economies combined , the group &apos;s initiatives - including its new development bank - are likely to reflect a disproportionate Chinese influence . 
And though the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has facilitated some diplomatic coordination , China and Russia remain locked in a struggle for influence in Central Asia . 
The Sino-Russian alliance in the twentieth century was a product of China &apos;s weakness following World War II and at the beginning of the Cold War - and , even then , it lasted little more than a decade . 
Today &apos;s China is strong , and unlikely to get too close to a Russia whose decline has been accelerated by its leader &apos;s poor judgment . 
In short , when it comes to a Sino-Russian alliance challenging the West , history is not likely to repeat itself . 
Contrary to Putin &apos;s hopes , 2014 will not be remembered as a year of successful Russian foreign policy .
