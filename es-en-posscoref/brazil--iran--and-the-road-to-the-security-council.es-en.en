Brazil , Iran , and the Road to the Security Council 
SAO PAULO - The attempt by Brazil &apos;s government to participate in the international negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program could well be called &quot; A Manual for Candidates to a Permanent Membership of the United Nations Security Council . &quot; 
Brazil &quot; s diplomatic efforts with Iran - a country suspected of developing nuclear energy for military purposes - began at a meeting last year between President Barack Obama and Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva during the G8 + 5 summit in L &apos;Aquila , Italy . 
According to Robert Gibbs , Obama &apos;s press spokesman , and Brazilian authorities , Obama said he had no objections whatsoever to Lula talking to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
But Obama suggested using the weight of commercial relations between the two countries to tell the Iranian leader that he should follow Brazil &apos;s example ( in Brazil , the ban on nuclear energy for military purposes is enshrined in the Constitution ) . 
Lula and Ahmadinejad met in June 2009 , when Obama was still holding out a hand to the ayatollahs . 
Lula acted according to Obama &apos;s suggestion when he received Ahmadinejad in Brasilia . 
He acknowledged - as everyone does - &quot; Iran &apos;s right to pursue a nuclear program with peaceful intentions , &quot; but immediately asked for &quot; respect for the international agreements &quot; and underlined the fact that &quot; this is the road Brazil is following . &quot; 
Furthermore , he urged Ahmadinejad &quot; to continue to engage countries interested in finding a fair and balanced solution to Iran &apos;s nuclear question . &quot; 
&quot; Engagement &quot; is the key word in this affair . 
It was used to describe Obama &apos;s new American diplomacy , particularly with regard to Iran , at least until the disputed elections in Iran last summer and the worsening domestic crisis that has ensued . 
In Lula &apos;s meeting with Ahmadinejad , the delicate subject of Ahmadinejad &apos;s repeated denials of the Holocaust came up . 
Lula told his Iranian counterpart that to deny the Holocaust was bad , even for Iran itself . 
Ahmadinejad replied that he did not deny it , but only criticized what he considered Israel &apos;s &quot; political use &quot; of it . 
Even so , Lula insisted that he should change his attitude . 
&quot; Who else is in a position to say such things to Iran &apos;s president ? &quot; asked a top Brazilian diplomat by way of justifying a dialogue that has been sharply criticized by Brazil &apos;s Jewish community , which is emphatically opposed to Lula &apos;s proposed trip to Teheran , scheduled for May . 
Relations between Iran and the countries that are negotiating the nuclear question have deteriorated since Ahmadinejad &apos;s visit to Brazil last year , which came soon after his disputed re-election . 
One result is the open difference of opinion on Iran between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Lula , or between Lula and German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
During his meeting in Berlin with Merkel last December , Lula insisted on the Brazilian government &apos;s traditional position : sanctions , such as those that the United States strongly advocates , lead to nothing ; the best way forward is dialogue . 
The Brazilian president asked for &quot; more patience &quot; in the talks with Iran . 
The German chancellor replied that she was &quot; losing &quot; her patience &quot; with Iranian leaders after &quot; four years of negotiations in which no progress was made . &quot; 
But Brazil insisted on the path of dialogue and began talking with other stakeholders in the Iranian question , such as Turkey , whose foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , recently staked out a similar position . 
&quot; We want the Middle East to be prosperous and stable , governed by political dialogue and diplomacy , &quot; Davutoglu said after a visit to Teheran . 
&quot; Iran &apos;s contribution will be very important in bringing this about . &quot; 
But Brazil &apos;s government has also begun to criticize , albeit weakly , Iran &apos;s performance on human rights . 
At first , Lula minimized the seriousness of the incidents that occurred after Ahmadinejad &apos;s re-election and went so far as to compare them to a dispute between football fanatics . 
This led to a clash with Sarkozy when Lula visited Paris soon after Iran &apos;s post-election crisis began . 
While Lula didn &apos;t repeat his comparison with a football game , neither did he criticize the repression , unlike Sarkozy , who did so strongly .
