Finance Agonistes 
LONDON - For at least a quarter-century , the financial sector has grown far more rapidly than the economy as a whole , both in developed and in most developing countries . 
The ratio of total financial assets ( stocks , bonds , and bank deposits ) to GDP in the United Kingdom was about 100 % in 1980 , while by 2006 it had risen to around 440 % . 
In China , financial assets went from being virtually non-existent to well over 300 % of GDP during this period . 
As the size of the financial industry grew , so , too , did its profitability . 
The share of total profits of companies in the United States represented by financial firms rocketed from 10 % in 1980 to 40 % in 2006 . 
Against that background , it is not surprising that pay in the financial sector soared . 
The City of London , lower Manhattan , and a few other centers became money machines that made investment bankers , hedge-fund managers , and private equity folk immoderately wealthy . 
University leaders like me spent much of our time persuading them to recycle a portion of their gains to their old schools . 
For the last two years , things have been different . 
Many financial firms have shrunk their balance sheets dramatically , and of course some have gone out of business altogether . 
Leverage is down sharply . 
Investment banks with leverage of more than 30 times their capital in early 2007 are now down to little more than ten times . 
Trading volumes are down , as is bank lending , and there have been major layoffs in financial centers around the globe . 
Is this a short-term phenomenon , and will we see an early return to rapid financial-sector growth as soon as the world economy recovers ? 
Already the market is full of rumors that guaranteed bonuses are returning , that hedge funds are making double-digit returns , and that activity is reviving in the private equity market . 
Are these harbingers of a robust recovery for the financial sector , or just urban myths ? 
There is no certain answer to that question , but perhaps economic history can offer some clues . 
A recent analysis by Andy Haldane of the Bank of England of long-term returns on UK financial sector equities suggests that the last 25 years have been very unusual . 
Suppose you had placed a long-term bet on financial equities in 1900 , along with a short bet on general equities - in effect a gamble on whether the UK financial sector would outperform the market . 
For the first 85 years , this would have been a very uninteresting gamble , generating an average return of only around 2 % a year . 
But the period from 1986 to 2006 was radically different . 
During those two decades , your annual average return would have been more than 16 % . 
As Haldane puts it , &quot; banking became the goose laying the golden eggs . &quot; 
Indeed , there is no period in recent UK financial history that bears any comparison to those jamboree decades . 
If you had unwound your bet three years ago , you would now be sitting pretty - as long as you had gone into cash , of course - because the period since 2006 has undone most of these gains . 
So if you had held your bank stocks up to the end of last year , over 110 years your investment would have yielded an annual average return of less than 3 % , still broadly a break-even strategy . 
Why was this 20-year experience so unusual , with returns so much higher than at any time in the last century ? 
The most straightforward answer seems to be leverage . 
Banks geared up dramatically , in a competitive race to generate higher returns . 
Haldane describes this as resorting to the roulette wheel . 
Perhaps that analogy is rather insulting to those who play roulette . 
Indeed , the phrase &quot; casino banking &quot; tends to ignore the fact that casinos have a rather good handle on their returns . 
They are typically very astute at risk management , unlike many of the banks that dramatically increased their leverage - and thus their risks - during the last 20 years . 
The conclusions that we might draw for the future depend heavily on how central banks and regulators react to the crisis . 
At present , financial firms are learning the lessons for themselves , reducing leverage and hoarding capital and cash , whereas the authorities are trying to persuade banks to expand lending - precisely the strategy that led to the current crisis . 
Of course , we know that a different approach will be needed in the longer run . 
In effect , the authorities are following the approach first outlined by St. Augustine . 
They would like banks to be &quot; chaste , &quot; but not yet . 
But when growth does return , leverage will be far more tightly constrained than it was before . 
Regulators are already talking about imposing leverage ratios , as well as limits on risk-weighted assets . 
If they follow through , as I expect , there will be no return to the strategies of the last two decades . 
In that case , finance will no longer be an industry that systematically outpaces the rest of the economy . 
There will be winners and losers , of course , but systematic sectoral out-performance looks unlikely . 
What that will mean for financial-sector pay is a slightly more complex question , to which I will return .
