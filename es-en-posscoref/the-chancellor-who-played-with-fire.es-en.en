The Chancellor Who Played with Fire 
BERLIN - German Chancellor Angela Merkel should be happy nowadays : her party &apos;s approval ratings aren &apos;t bad , and her own are very good . 
She no longer has serious rivals within the center-right Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , while the left opposition is fragmented into four parties . 
Her response to the European crisis has prevailed - or at least that is the impression that she conveys , and that most Germans believe . 
So everything is fine and dandy , right ? 
Not so fast . 
Two issues could complicate Merkel &apos;s re-election bid in the autumn of 2013 . 
Domestically , her coalition partner , the liberal Free Democrats ( FDP ) , is disintegrating . 
Even if the FDP survives the next election ( which is by no means certain ) , the current coalition is unlikely to retain its parliamentary majority , leaving Merkel increasingly dependent on the Social Democrats ( SPD ) . 
While this need not matter to her too much as long as she retains the chancellorship , in Sigmar Gabriel , the SPD &apos;s leader , she faces - for the first time - an opponent whom she would underestimate at her peril . 
But the real danger to Merkel is external : the European crisis . 
If she is unlucky , the crisis will come to a head at the start of the German election year , and all previous calculations could be moot , because , despite Germans &quot; frustration with Europe , the electorate would punish severely those who allowed Europe to fail . 
The European Union &apos;s economy is sliding into a severe and , in all likelihood , long-lasting recession , largely self-inflicted . 
While Germany is still trying to banish the specter of hyperinflation with strict eurozone austerity measures , the EU crisis countries are facing a real threat of deflation , with potentially disastrous consequences . 
It is only a question of time - no longer very much time - before economic destabilization gives rise to political instability . 
Hungary , where democratic backsliding appears to be taking hold , provides a foretaste of a Europe in which the eurozone crisis and deflation persist . 
The mood in the Mediterranean EU members , as well as in Ireland , is heating up , owing not only to the tightening squeeze of austerity , but also - and perhaps more importantly - to the absence of policies that offer people hope for a better future . 
The explosive nature of current trends , which point to eventual re-nationalization of sovereignty from the bottom up , is greatly underestimated in Berlin . 
The crisis has now reached Italy and is threatening to spread to France . 
With Mario Monti &apos;s premiership , Italy has mobilized its best people , and neither Italy nor Europe will get a better government for the foreseeable future . 
If Monti &apos;s administration is toppled - either in parliament or in the streets - the EU &apos;s fourth-largest economy could come crashing down . 
Monti is urgently calling for help . 
Where is it ? 
Developments in France ( the second-largest eurozone economy ) should also not be underestimated in this presidential election year . 
If a majority of the French come to believe that a course of action is being imposed on them from outside - and by Germany , no less ! - they will respond with traditional Gallic stubbornness . 
What is at stake is less the election &apos;s outcome than the margin between President Nicolas Sarkozy and the far-right National Front leader , Marine Le Pen - and whether she overtakes him to qualify for the second-round run-off against the Socialist candidate . 
While she would be unlikely to win the presidency , she could reshape and realign the French right . 
For that reason , a Sarkozy debacle would drastically reduce his Socialist successor &apos;s room for maneuver on European policy , fundamentally altering France &apos;s position in Europe . 
But , while the French election &apos;s outcome will hinge to a crucial extent on European crisis politics , Germany &apos;s government acts as if this were none of its concern . 
And the central question is not , &quot; What needs to be done now in the interest of Europe ? &quot; 
No one will act in a way that jeopardizes their electoral prospects , at least while there are still alternatives . 
So it is conceivable that Germany is not at all interested in a serious effort to resolve Europe &apos;s crisis , because that would mean taking big risks and investing a lot of money . 
The CDU-FDP coalition prefers to sugarcoat the situation by convincing themselves of an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy , abetted by those in the European crisis countries unwilling to perform and reform and whose only purpose is to make the Germans pay . 
So far , Merkel &apos;s coalition is like someone driving against traffic , dead certain that everyone else is going the wrong way . 
Europe &apos;s disintegration has already advanced much further than it might appear . 
Distrust and national egoism are spreading rapidly , devouring European solidarity and common purpose . 
Institutionally , Europe has been on the right track since the last summit , but it threatens to disintegrate from the bottom up . 
To save the euro - which is essential , because the European project &apos;s fate depends on the success of monetary union - Europe needs action now : in addition to indispensable austerity measures and structural reforms , there is no way to succeed without a viable economic program that will assure growth . 
That won &apos;t come cheap . 
If Merkel &apos;s government believes that paying lip service to growth is enough , it is playing with fire : a euro collapse in which not only Germans would be badly burned .
