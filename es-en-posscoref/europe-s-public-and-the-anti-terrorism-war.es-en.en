Europe \ u0027s Public and the Anti-Terrorism War 
BERLIN : Chancellor Schröder &apos;s government coalition barely scraped through Germany &apos;s Bundestag to secure the support it needed to dispatch German soldiers to help in the campaign against international terrorism . 
No doubt special circumstances accompanied that vote , but the effort which the country &apos;s most respected and powerful politician expended in order to gain the backing of Germany &apos;s parliament ( as well as his coalition partners , the Greens ) should be a warning to other Western governments not to leave their publics behind as they engage in the tough , multi-year campaign against the planners and executors of international terrorism . 
In the first weeks after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon governments all over Europe were certain of public support . 
That changed when the US bombing against the Taliban began ; doubts over the wisdom of the US campaign combined with resentment at seeing a super-modern superpower pound away at a medieval country devastated by decades of war . 
These doubts were moderated somewhat as America &apos;s strategy began to produce results . 
But they are certain to resurface and grow as memories of September 11 th attacks fade and the effort to stamp out terrorism encounters new difficulties , setbacks and dilemmas and possibly requires risky military operations elsewhere . 
Maintaining public support within the US is no problem for America &apos;s leadership . 
Americans are both shocked and angered by the attack on their cherished invulnerability and are determined to pursue the perpetrators with every means at their disposal . 
President Bush has made this his top priority ; for as long as he is in the White House , he will not waver in this pursuit and neither will his people . 
But to retain popular backing will be a problem in Western Europe , America &apos;s closest allies . 
Should they cease to support the US , the unique transatlantic partnership could disintegrate . 
A wounded America appreciated the spontaneous demonstrations of sympathy and solidarity that poured across the Atlantic after September 11 th . 
But this will turn into furious rejection if Europe were to sow doubt over what Americans now regard as the most dangerous - if not the only challenge - to the common security of the Atlantic community . 
European governments know this . 
After all , not only moral outrage but calculated self-interest led them on September 12 th to invoke , for the first time , Article V of the NATO Treaty . 
If they reiterate their expressions of &quot; unconditional solidarity &quot; and make their own armed forces available they do so not only to gain some degree of influence on American strategy beyond Afghanistan , but also to signal their determination to stand by the US in the most unequivocal manner possible . 
Yet this policy demands a commitment for the long haul . 
Unless it is explained and seen as an expression of national interest , it will strain domestic political support , even to the degree of endangering government coalitions like that of Mr. Schröder . 
Of all Europe &apos;s governments , only that of Prime Minister Tony Blair in Britain has developed a strategy that successfully combines solidarity for the US with retaining public support at home . 
Admittedly , going to war is much less an anathema for Britons than for continental Europeans . 
Yet Blair did not rely on this alone . 
From the start , he declared that the attacks on New York were directly aimed at his country . 
When he called on British forces it was thus for the common defense , not just to serve the US . 
He insisted on being consulted by the Bush administration on US plans , and when some in Washington thought aloud about taking on Iraq after Afghanistan , the Prime Minister registered a clear veto . 
All this signaled to allies abroad and citizens at home that Britain &apos;s cooperation should not be taken for granted , that it requires domestic approval . 
By contrast , continental leaders have done little to dispel the impression that they are acting in response to a US request and for a US cause . 
But their people rightly demand that government should not just serve the interests of others . 
If they wish to stay the course in the struggle against international terrorism , European leaders must take a leaf or two from Blair &apos;s book . 
For one , they have to emphasize that this is their own struggle , not just America &apos;s . 
For another , they will have to make their own , distinct contribution . 
They cannot simply wait for America to move , nor can they always seek to placate Washington &apos;s preferences . 
In short , they will have to make their own efforts to sustain the common effort . 
What this distinct contribution could be is not difficult to define . 
After all , only the ingrained habit of playing second fiddle to the US prevents EU members from clearly and loudly distancing themselves from Israel &apos;s repressive interferences on the West Bank and Gaza , even though such a stance would help strengthen the commitment of Arab states to the coalition against terrorism as well as provide a useful shove to American diplomacy . 
The same applies to a European effort to rebuild relations with Iran , or a joint initiative to invest in helping Russia to destroy its huge arsenal of antiquated nuclear and chemical munitions so as to avoid having these fall into the wrong hands . 
There is little except national inertia , complacency and opportunism that stands in the way of beginning to formulate and implement a distinct EU policy to bolster the coalition against terrorism . 
The present crisis exposes this pattern of European behavior as what it has always been - the luxury of looking backwards . 
Calls for pooling European efforts have been many , based on the conviction that only in this way can European governments play a more effective international role . 
All too often , however , these have been ignored or dismissed as impractical by those in power . 
They deserve a better hearing now that retaining the solidarity of their citizens has become an essential condition for European governments to maintain solidarity with America for the long struggle against international terrorism that lies ahead .
