The Consequences of Angela Merkel 
LONDON - Germany has been leading the opposition in the European Union to any write-down of troubled eurozone members &quot; sovereign debt . 
Instead , it has agreed to establish bailout mechanisms such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism , which can lend up to € 500 billion ( $ 680 billion ) combined , with the International Monetary Fund providing an additional € 250 billion . 
These are essentially refinancing mechanisms . 
Heavily indebted eurozone members can apply to borrow from them at less than the commercial rate , conditional on their committing to ever more drastic fiscal austerity . 
Principal and interest on outstanding debt have been left intact . 
Thus , creditors - mainly German and French banks - are not expected to suffer losses on their existing loans , while borrowers gain more time to &quot; put their houses in order . &quot; 
That , at least , is the theory . 
So far , three countries - Greece , Ireland , and Portugal - have availed themselves of this facility . 
In mid-July 2011 , Greece &apos;s sovereign debt stood at € 350 billion ( 160 % of GDP ) . 
The Greek government currently must pay 25 % for its ten-year bonds , which are trading at a 50 % discount in the secondary market . 
In other words , investors are expecting to receive only about half of what they are owed . 
The hope is that the reduction in borrowing costs on new loans , plus the austerity programs promised by governments , will enable bond prices to recover to par without the need for the creditor banks to take a hit . 
This is pie in the sky . 
Unless a large part of its debt is forgiven , Greece will not regain creditworthiness . 
( Indeed , by most accounts , it is about to default . ) 
And the same is true , albeit to a lesser degree , for other heavily indebted sovereigns . 
Any credible bailout plan must require creditor banks to accept that they will lose at least half of their money . 
In the United States &quot; successful Brady Bond plan in 1989 , the debtors - Mexico , Argentina , and Brazil - agreed to pay what they could . 
The banks that had loaned them the money replaced the old debt with new bonds at par value , which averaged 50 % of the old bonds , and the US government provided some sweeteners . 
It was write-offs and devaluations , not austerity programs , that allowed bond prices to recover . 
In the Greek case , creditors have yet to accept the need for write-offs , and European governments have provided them with no incentives to do so . 
Germany &apos;s opposition to debt forgiveness is thus bad economics , bad politics ( except at home ) , and bad history . 
The Germans should remember the reparations fiasco of the 1920 &quot; s . 
In the Treaty of Versailles , the victorious Allies insisted that Germany should pay for &quot; the cost of the war . &quot; 
They added up the figures , and in 1921 they presented the bill : Germany &quot; owed &quot; the victors £ 6.6 billion ( 85 % of its GDP ) , payable in 30 annual installments . 
This amounted to transferring annually 8-10 % of Germany &apos;s national income , or 65-76 % of its exports . 
Within a year , Germany had asked for , and obtained , a moratorium . 
New bond issues , following a big debt write-down in 1924 ( the Dawes Plan ) , enabled Germany to borrow the money to resume payments . 
There then followed a crazy system : Germany borrowed money from the US in order to repay Britain , France , and Belgium , while France and Belgium used a bit of it to pay back Britain , and Britain used more of it to pay back the US . 
This whole tangle of debts was finally de facto written off in 1932 in the middle of the global slump . 
But , until 1980 , Germany continued repaying the loans that it had incurred to pay the reparations . 
From the start , the economist John Maynard Keynes had been a fierce critic of the reparations policy imposed on Germany . 
He made three main points : Germany didn &apos;t have the capacity to pay were it to regain anything like a normal standard of living ; any attempt to force it to reduce its standard of living would produce revolution ; and to the extent that Germany was able to increase its exports to pay reparations , this would be at the expense of the recipients &quot; exports . 
What was needed was cancelation of reparations and inter-Allied war debts as a whole , together with a big reconstruction loan to put the shattered European economies back on their feet . 
In 1919 , Keynes produced a grand plan for comprehensive debt cancellation , plus a new bond issue , guaranteed by the Allied powers , whose proceeds would go to victors and vanquished alike . 
The Americans , who would have had to provide most of the money , vetoed the plan . 
The point to which Keynes kept returning was that the attempt to extract debt payments over many years would have disastrous social consequences . 
&quot; The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation , of degrading the lives of millions of human beings , and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable , &quot; he wrote , &quot; even if it does not sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe . &quot; 
History never repeats itself exactly , but there are lessons to be learned from that episode . 
Germans today would say that , unlike reparations , the Greek and Mediterranean debts were voluntarily incurred , not coerced . 
This raises the question of justice , but not the economic consequences of insisting on payment . 
Moreover , there is a fallacy of composition : if there are too many debt collectors , they will impoverish the very people on whom their own prosperity depends . 
In the 1920 &quot; s , Germany ended up having to pay only a small fraction of its reparation bill , but the long time it took to get to that point prevented the full recovery of Europe , made Germany itself the most conspicuous victim of the Great Depression , and bred widespread resentment , with dire political consequences . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel would do well to ponder that history .
