Is There A Right To Secede ? 
BARCELONA - The European Union has brought 28 countries into a closer political and economic union . 
Paradoxically , it has also made it more feasible to contemplate the breakup of some of those countries . 
Independence for a small state outside of a political and economic group like the EU would be risky nowadays . 
Within the EU , however , the barriers between states - and thus the economic and political risks of independence - are lower . 
Consider Scotland , where a popular referendum on independence will be held on September 18 . 
The referendum is the result of the landslide victory by the Scottish National Party in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron has argued against Scotland leaving the United Kingdom , but he has not opposed holding the referendum . 
Opinion polls taken since the wording of the referendum ( &quot; Should Scotland be an independent country ? &quot; ) was announced indicate that the &quot; yes &quot; side is unlikely to gain a clear majority . 
In Spain , there is a national debate about independence for Catalonia , where national identity is strengthened by the fact that the majority of the region &apos;s residents speak Catalan as well as Spanish . 
By contrast , only about 1 % of Scots can speak Scottish Gaelic . 
Perhaps as a result , support for independence in Catalonia appears to be far broader , with about half of the region &apos;s residents saying that they support secession . 
But the Spanish parliament voted overwhelmingly against allowing the Catalan government to hold a referendum on independence , and the central government has said that such a vote would be unconstitutional . 
Artur Mas , President of Catalonia &apos;s regional government , has vowed to go ahead with a non-binding referendum anyway . 
If a majority of the voters in a distinct region of a country favor independence , does that mean that they have a right to secede ? 
There are surely more questions that need to be addressed than that single one . 
What if a region &apos;s secession leaves behind a rump state that is no longer viable ? 
Within the EU , this is less of an issue , given that small states - in theory - still benefit from free trade within the Union ; but , outside of the EU , the situation of the remaining state can be dire . 
In September 1938 , Hitler threatened to attack Czechoslovakia in order to bring the ethnic Germans living near the German border under his rule . 
The Munich Agreement gave this region , referred to by the Nazis as the Sudetenland , to Germany , leaving Czechoslovakia without defensible borders and paving the way for the Nazi invasion and partition of the country the following March . 
Had a free and fair referendum been offered to the Sudeten Germans , a majority might have backed union with Germany . 
The UK and Spain do not need to fear that independence for Scotland and Catalonia would expose them to such threats . 
Nonetheless , the secession of Scotland would deprive the UK of significant North Sea oil revenues , on which the economics of Scottish independence largely relies , and Spain could also suffer from the loss of Catalonia &apos;s disproportionately large contribution to the Spanish economy . 
Widespread human rights violations , either caused or tolerated by a national government , can give rise to what is sometimes called a remedial right to secession for a region &apos;s inhabitants . 
If other remedies fail in such a situation , secession might be justified as a last resort , even if it imposes heavy costs on the rump state . 
That was the case when Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan , and it was also allegedly the case when NATO supported Kosovo &apos;s independence from Serbia . 
If Scotland and Catalonia ever become independent countries , it will only be because the UK and Spain permit it . 
All states have an interest in stability , so it is hard to imagine that , in the absence of widespread , grave , and undeniable human rights violations , other states would recognize a region that , after being part of a state for many centuries , declared itself independent without the acquiescence of the country from which it secedes . 
The EU is also unlikely to accept Scotland or Catalonia as a member if the UK or Spain rejects their claims to independence . 
Indeed , European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso has said that the EU may reject Scotland and Catalonia &apos;s applications , or at least delay them considerably , even if the UK and Spain do accept their independence . 
And , without EU membership , it is hard to imagine that a majority of people in Scotland or Catalonia would take the plunge into economic uncertainty that independence would bring . 
The role of a referendum in a region seeking to secede can therefore only be a form of persuasion aimed at the government of the existing state . 
A large turnout showing a clear majority for independence would be a way to say : See how strongly we feel about this issue . 
We are so dissatisfied with the status quo that most of us now favor secession . 
If you want us to stay , you need to address the grievances that have caused a majority of us to want to leave .
