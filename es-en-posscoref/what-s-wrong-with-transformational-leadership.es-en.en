What &apos;s Wrong with Transformational Leadership ? 
CAMBRIDGE - This year &apos;s presidential campaign in the United States has been marked by calls from Barack Obama &apos;s would-be Republican challengers for a radical transformation of American foreign policy . 
Campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality , but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change . 
Things do not always work out as intended . 
Foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 US presidential election . 
In 2001 , George W. Bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy , but adopted transformational objectives after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . 
Like Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry Truman before him , Bush turned to the rhetoric of democracy to rally his followers in a time of crisis . 
Bill Clinton had also talked about enlarging the role of human rights and democracy in US foreign policy , but most Americans in the 1990 &quot; s sought normality and a post-Cold War peace dividend rather than change . 
By contrast , Bush &apos;s 2002 National Security Strategy , which came to be called the Bush Doctrine , proclaimed that the US would &quot; identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are , together with the regimes that sustain them . &quot; 
The solution to the terrorist problem was to spread democracy everywhere . 
Bush invaded Iraq ostensibly to remove Saddam Hussein &apos;s capacity to use weapons of mass destruction and , in the process , to change the regime . 
Bush cannot be blamed for the intelligence failures that attributed such weapons to Saddam , given that many other countries shared such estimates . 
But inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context , together with poor planning and management , undercut Bush &apos;s transformational objectives . 
Although some of Bush &apos;s defenders try to credit him with the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; revolutions , the primary Arab participants reject such arguments . 
Bush was described by The Economist as &quot; obsessed by the idea of being a transformational president ; not just a status-quo operator like Bill Clinton . &quot; 
Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the virtues of &quot; transformational diplomacy . &quot; 
But , while leadership theorists and editorial writers tend to think that transformational foreign-policy officials are better in either ethics or effectiveness , the evidence does not support this view . 
Other leadership skills are more important than the usual distinction between transformational and &quot; transactional &quot; leaders . 
Consider President George H.W. Bush , who did not do &quot; the vision thing , &quot; but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign-policy agendas of the past half-century . 
Perhaps genetic engineers will one day be able to produce leaders equally endowed with both vision and management skills ; comparing the two Bushes ( who shared half their genes ) , it is clear that nature has not yet solved the problem . 
This is not an argument against transformational leaders . 
Mohandas Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , and Martin Luther King , Jr . , played crucial roles in transforming people &apos;s identity and aspirations . 
Nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in US foreign policy . 
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman made crucial contributions . 
But , in judging leaders , we need to pay attention to acts of both omission and commission , to what happened and to what was avoided , to the dogs that barked and to those that did not . 
A big problem in foreign policy is the complexity of the context . 
We live in a world of diverse cultures , and we know very little about social engineering and how to &quot; build nations . &quot; 
When we cannot be sure how to improve the world , prudence becomes an important virtue , and grandiose visions can pose grave dangers . 
In foreign policy , as in medicine , it is important to remember the Hippocratic Oath : first , do no harm . 
For these reasons , the virtues of transactional leaders with good contextual intelligence are very important . 
Someone like George H. W. Bush , unable to articulate a vision but able to steer successfully through crises , turns out to be a better leader than someone like his son , possessed of a powerful vision but with little contextual intelligence or management skill . 
Former Secretary of State George Shultz , who served under Ronald Reagan , once compared his role to gardening - &quot; the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors , interests , and goals . &quot; 
But Shultz &apos;s Stanford colleague , Condoleezza Rice , wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was , but tried to change it . 
As one observer put it , &quot; Rice &apos;s ambition is not just to be a gardener - she wants to be a landscape architect . &quot; 
There is a role for both , depending on the context , but we should avoid the common mistake of automatically thinking that the transformational landscape architect is a better leader than the careful gardener . 
We should keep this in mind as we assess the current US presidential debates , with their constant reference to American decline . 
Decline is a misleading metaphor . 
America is not in absolute decline , and , in relative terms , there is a reasonable probability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades . 
We do not live in a &quot; post-American world , &quot; but we also do not live in the American era of the late twentieth century . 
The US will be faced with a rise in the power resources of many others - both states and non-state actors . 
It will also confront a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to obtain the country &apos;s preferred outcomes . 
America &apos;s capacity to maintain alliances and create cooperative networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power . 
The problem of America &apos;s role in the twenty-first century is not one of ( poorly specified ) &quot; decline , &quot; but rather of developing the contextual intelligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without others &quot; help . 
Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age , and what is required to operate successfully in it , will be the real transformational leadership task . 
Thus far , we are not hearing much about it from the Republican candidates .
