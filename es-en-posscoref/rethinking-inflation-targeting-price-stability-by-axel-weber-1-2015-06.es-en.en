Rethinking Inflation Targeting 
ZURICH - Over the last two decades , inflation targeting has become the predominant monetary-policy framework . 
It has been essentially ( though not explicitly ) adopted by major central banks , including the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Swiss National Bank . 
But the 2008 global economic crisis , from which the world has yet to recover fully , has cast serious doubt on this approach . 
The Bank for International Settlements has long argued that pure inflation targeting is not compatible with financial stability . 
It does not take into account the financial cycle , and thus produces excessively expansionary and asymmetric monetary policy . 
Moreover , a major argument in favor of inflation targeting - that it has contributed to a decline in inflation since the early 1990s - is questionable , at best . 
Disinflation actually began in the early 1980s - well before inflation targeting was invented - thanks to the concerted efforts of then-US Federal Reserve Board Chair Paul Volcker . 
And , from the 1990s on , globalization - in particular , China &apos;s integration into the world economy - has probably been the main reason for the decline in global inflationary pressure . 
A more recent indication that inflation targeting has not caused the disinflation seen since the 1990s is the unsuccessful effort by a growing number of central banks to reflate their economies . 
If central banks are unable to increase inflation , it stands to reason that they may not have been instrumental in reducing it . 
The fact is that the original objective of central banks was not consumer-price stability ; consumer-price indices did not even exist when most of them were founded . 
Later , their mission was expanded to include the role of lender of last resort . 
It was not until the excessive inflation of the 1970s that central banks discovered - or , in a sense , rediscovered - the desirability of keeping the value of money stable . 
But how to measure the value of money ? 
One approach centers on prices , with the consumer price index appearing to be the most obvious indicator . 
The problem is that the relationship between the money supply ( which ultimately determines the value of money ) and prices is an unstable one . 
For starters , the lag time between changes in the money supply and price movements is long , variable , and unpredictable . 
Given this , targeting consumer prices in the next 2-3 years will not guarantee that the value of money remains stable in the long term . 
Moreover , different methods of collecting consumer prices yield different results , depending on how housing costs are treated and the hedonic adjustment applied . 
In short , monetary policy has been shaped by an imprecise , small , and shrinking subset of prices that exhibits long and variable lags vis-Ã -vis changes in the money supply . 
Unfortunately , monetary policymakers &quot; effort to operationalize the objective of ensuring that the value of money remains stable has taken on a life of its own . 
Furthermore , economists now understand inflation as a rise in consumer prices , not as a decline in the value of money resulting from an excessive increase in the money supply . 
Making matters worse , central banks routinely deny responsibility for any prices other than consumer prices , ignoring that the value of money is reflected in all prices , including commodities , real estate , stocks , bonds , and , perhaps most important , exchange rates . 
In short , while price stabilization through inflation targeting is a commendable objective , central banks &quot; narrow focus on consumer prices - within a relatively short time frame , no less - is inadequate to achieve it . 
This was highlighted by the surge in many countries &quot; housing prices in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis , the steep decline in asset and commodity prices immediately after Lehman Brothers collapsed , the return to asset-price inflation since then , and recent large currency fluctuations . 
All are inconsistent with a stable value of money . 
Central banks &quot; exclusive focus on consumer prices may even be counterproductive . 
By undermining the efficient allocation of capital and fostering mal-investment , CPI-focused monetary policy is distorting economic structures , blocking growth-enhancing creative destruction , creating moral hazard , and sowing the seeds for future instability in the value of money . 
Within a complex and constantly evolving economy , a simplistic inflation-targeting framework will not stabilize the value of money . 
Only an equally complex and highly adaptable monetary-policy approach - one that emphasizes risk management and reliance on policymakers &quot; judgment , rather than a clear-cut formula - can do that . 
Such an approach would be less predictable and eliminate forward guidance , thereby discouraging excessive risk-taking and reducing moral hazard . 
History hints at what a stability-oriented framework could look like . 
In the last quarter of the twentieth century , many central banks used intermediate targets , including monetary aggregates . 
Such targets could potentially be applied to credit , interest rates , exchange rates , asset and commodity prices , risk premiums , and / or intermediate-goods prices . 
Short-term consumer-price stability does not guarantee economic , financial , or monetary stability . 
It is time for central banks to accept this fact and adopt a comprehensive , long-term monetary-policy approach - even if it means that , in the short term , consumer-price inflation deviates from what is currently understood as &quot; price stability . &quot; 
Temporary fluctuations in a narrow and imprecisely measured CPI are a small price to pay to secure the long-term stability of money .
