Motor City Meltdown 
WASHINGTON , DC - The financial crisis that began in 2007 has been persistently marked by muddled thinking and haphazard policymaking . 
Now , the United States Treasury is headed for a mistake of historic and catastrophic proportions by refusing to bail out America &apos;s Big Three automakers . 
Make no mistake . 
If Detroit &apos;s Big Three go bankrupt , the perfect storm really will have arrived with a collapse in both the real economy and the financial sector . 
This threat means that the financial bailout funds authorized by Congress can legitimately be used to support the automakers . 
Treasury &apos;s refusal to do so is a monumental blunder that risks a general meltdown , the consequences of which will extend far beyond America &apos;s shores . 
Proponents of a bailout for the Big Three have emphasized the enormous job losses associated with a bankruptcy scenario , including not only jobs directly provided by the automakers , but also jobs with parts suppliers , auto dealers , and in the transport and advertising industries . 
These job losses will then be multiplied locally and nationally . 
Lost wages will reduce consumption , causing additional job cuts , while factory closures will reduce investment , hitting employment in capital goods industries . 
Lost incomes will also drive down tax revenues , resulting in public-sector employment cutbacks . 
Moreover , the automakers are essential for closing the trade deficit , and their demise could bring another surge in imports . 
The automakers are also the backbone of American manufacturing , driving advances in manufacturing technology that will be needed if America is to be a world leader in the coming &quot; green &quot; transportation revolution . 
Additionally , the Big Three are vital to national security , supplying important military transportation assets . 
Lastly , bankruptcy will impose massive costs on the government &apos;s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ) , further worsening the fiscal outlook . 
All of this is true . 
In one fell swoop , the hard-won gains in stabilizing the financial system would be blown away . 
The Big Three and their auto finance associates ( such as GMAC ) are huge debtors whose liabilities are held throughout the financial system . 
If they go bankrupt , the insurance industry , which is likely a large holder of these debts , would quickly enter a spiral of collapse . 
Pension funds would also be hit , imposing further costs on the PBGC . 
But the greatest damage may come from the credit default swaps ( CDS ) market that brought down AIG . 
Huge bets have undoubtedly been placed on the bonds of GM , Ford , Chrysler , and GMAC , and bankruptcy will be a CDS triggering event requiring repayment of these bonds . 
Moreover , a Big Three bankruptcy will bankrupt other companies , risking a cascade of financial damage as their bonds and equities fall in value and further CDS events are triggered . 
This is the nightmare outcome that risks replicating the Crash of 1929 . 
Opposition to the bailout is bringing back to the surface the worst of the conservative economic thought that got America and the world into this mess in the first place . 
The opposition of the Federal Reserve and Treasury to hands-on intervention meant that they were slow to understand that merely ring-fencing the commercial banks could not save the financial system . 
Now , they are failing to understand the financial significance of the Big Three . 
Conservative animus toward trade unions is also once again on display . 
But it is union weakness that has caused wages to stagnate and forced America to rely on debt and asset price inflation as the engines of growth . 
Another conservative accusation is that a bailout would infringe free-trade rules . 
But it is these rules that have fostered the trade deficits that have destabilized and undermined the American economy . 
The reality is that world trade would suffer far greater damage from the global economic fallout of a Big Three bankruptcy . 
Lastly , conservatives have trotted out the old moral hazard story in order to argue that a bailout would turn American manufacturing into a permanent beggar of government funds . 
In fact , business has always lobbied Congress for favors and tax breaks , and the Lehman Brothers experience proved the foolishness of confusing parables about moral hazard with crisis management . 
There are undoubtedly colossal problems in Detroit , and the bosses of the Big Three automakers could never be convicted of an excess of imagination . 
Economic policy has also contributed to their current condition as trade agreements and an over-valued dollar promoted auto imports , and incoherent energy and environmental policy stifled innovation . 
All of this must be fixed . 
But sacrificing the Big Three automakers will accomplish nothing while risking a tragic economic depression .
