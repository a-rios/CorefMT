Darkness on the Edge of Europe 
KYIV - In 2014 , Vladimir Putin discovered his inner Trotsky . 
For what Russia &apos;s president is now offering Ukraine is a perverse twist on the formula Trotsky proclaimed during the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk in 1918 : &quot; No war , no peace . &quot; 
In doing so , Putin has not only moved to trap my country in a frozen conflict that will prevent both democracy and the economy from flourishing ; he has shredded the rules and norms that have kept the peace in Europe for three generations . 
No one should believe that the Minsk Protocol - agreed in September by representatives of Ukraine , Russia , and the Kremlin-backed armed militants in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk - marked the beginning of a return to normalcy in either Ukraine or Europe . 
Under that agreement , Ukraine &apos;s government ceded de facto control of the Donbas region , supposedly for only three years , to Russia &apos;s hired secessionists . 
But this imported hybrid war - and Russia &apos;s bid to carve up Ukraine - is far from over . 
On the contrary , the Minsk Protocol marked only the end of the beginning of Putin &apos;s program to turn Ukraine into a vassal state , and to restore a Russian veto over its neighbors &quot; international relations . 
His efforts to thwart Ukraine &apos;s European future will continue , as will his efforts to hollow out our democracy and replace it with a Kremlin echo chamber , unless the world imposes such a high price for his imperial ambitions that the Russian people refuse to bear it . 
So , in 2015 , the resolve that Europe and the United States have shown in opposing Putin &apos;s designs must not only be maintained ; it must be hardened . 
Yet , sadly , there have been signs of slackening Western commitment . 
The European Commission &apos;s agreement in September to postpone full implementation of Ukraine &apos;s association agreement with the European Union - the agreement that Ukrainians fought and died for in Kyiv last winter - signaled to Putin that cunning , force , and intimidation can win Western acquiescence in his subjugation of Ukraine and theft of Crimea . 
The delay , intended to show the EU &apos;s determination to make the association agreement work , has instead only whetted Putin &apos;s appetite . 
His hope is that some EU members &quot; interest in securing Russian gas supplies during the winter will cause them to forget their allies &quot; security interests - a classic divide-and-rule strategy , served chilled . 
Europe cannot afford to be taken in by it . 
Ukraine may now only be passing through the eye of the storm . 
Putin , knowing that the Russian Army &apos;s current logistical systems for supplying Crimea are insufficient , appears to be readying plans to secure a land corridor from the Russian border through southeastern Ukraine . 
That is why some of the most sinister figures behind Russia &apos;s other frozen conflicts , such as Lieutenant-General Vladimir Antyufeyev , the long-serving &quot; state security minister &quot; in Moldova &apos;s breakaway Transnistria region , are now calling the shots among eastern Ukraine &apos;s armed militants . 
Antyufeyev is using the tenuous ceasefire agreed under the Minsk Protocol to create a cloned KGB service , called the MGB , to intimidate Ukrainian citizens trapped in Donbas into submitting to proxy Kremlin rule . 
And , with the Donbas economy &apos;s crown jewels having been &quot; nationalized &quot; ( and the rest eviscerated ) , the region &apos;s emerging industries are crime and kidnapping , of the sort seen in Transnistria , Georgia &apos;s breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , and other Kremlin-backed statelets . 
The desire to secure access to Crimea is also why the Russian Army is now focused on the strategic port of Mariupol , a gateway on the Sea of Azov , for a land bridge . 
Europeans should understand the inherent dangers in creating a land corridor through another country , given the Nazis &quot; use of the Danzig Corridor as a pretext to invade Poland in 1939 . 
Surely , a day of reckoning will come for Putin , whose aggression is slowly wrecking the Russian economy . 
But when that day arrives remains too uncertain for Europe and the world to let down their guard and ease their pressure on the Kremlin . 
Indeed , if peace is to come to Ukraine - and if Putin is to be prevented from using the same strategy elsewhere - the world must let him know that some lines may never be crossed . 
After all , Ukraine is not the only country under the gun , as Putin &apos;s recent threats to &quot; protect &quot; Russian citizens in Kazakhstan , not to mention his intimidation of the Baltic states , attest . 
This is not an issue that concerns only the West . 
China may soon need to decide whether it can sit back and let the Kremlin whittle away the geo-strategic gains and enhanced security that came with the Soviet empire &apos;s demise . 
After all , it is no coincidence that China &apos;s quarter-century of extraordinary economic growth came after the Soviet threat on its border was eliminated . 
Indeed , contrary to what Putin claims to the Russian public , the Chinese are not fully committed to backing him in his confrontation with the West . 
One sign of this is the hard bargain that President Xi Jinping struck in negotiating China &apos;s recent huge gas contracts with Russia ; another is that Chinese lending to Russia since the invasion of Crimea has actually declined . 
As Ukraine prepares for another year of confrontation , the world should understand that one fact is non-negotiable : our country will be an independent , fully sovereign state . 
No foreign government will gain a veto over any aspect of our internal decision-making . 
Our future is for Ukraine &apos;s citizens to decide , period . 
This rules out our recognition - at any time and in any form - of Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea and occupation of Donbas . 
Ukrainians &quot; unity , spirit , and devotion to their freedom remain undented . 
War has forged a new patriotism that peace will not extinguish . 
We will continue to defy Putin and his efforts to reduce Ukraine to a semi-sovereign buffer state . 
But Ukraine &apos;s ability to resist , and the international community &apos;s ability to prevent brute force from having free rein , depends on whether world leaders understand that appeasement begets only further aggression . 
If they do not , 2015 could mark the return of a European and world order that was supposedly overcome seven decades ago .
