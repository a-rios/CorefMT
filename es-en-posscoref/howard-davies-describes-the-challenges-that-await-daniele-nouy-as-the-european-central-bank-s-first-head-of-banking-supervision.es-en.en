The Fox and the ECB 
PARIS - A French business magazine recently ranked IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde the most internationally influential French person alive - well ahead of President François Hollande . 
While politics may have influenced that particular decision , there is no doubt that Lagarde is at least the most prominent French woman alive . 
Lagarde &apos;s competition in this category is not particularly stiff . 
Valérie Trierweiler , Hollande &apos;s partner , came to prominence with an ill-judged political tweet about her predecessor , but has since retreated behind the Élysée Palace &apos;s firewalls . 
And Brigitte Bardot is not quite the force of nature she once was . 
But this may be about to change . 
The announcement comes less than a month before the ECB takes over direct supervision of some 130 banks , representing more than 80 % of eurozone bank assets , leaving only smaller national banks under the jurisdiction of local supervisory agencies . 
Nouy ( with whom I have worked ) is a knowledgeable and capable supervisor , equipped with a formidable combination of determination and charm . 
She will need all of these attributes and more to make Europe &apos;s new banking system function efficiently . 
The ECB was chosen as the Single Supervisory Mechanism , despite the wafer-thin legal basis ( an ambiguous clause in the Lisbon Treaty ) for its new responsibilities . 
When the Lisbon Treaty was signed , Germany was wholly hostile to giving the ECB such a role . 
That process would have included popular referenda - and thus the risk that the vote might not go the Eurocrats &quot; way . 
Despite enduring legal doubts about the ECB &apos;s powers , the need for a central supervisor is widely agreed . 
The credibility of Europe &apos;s national supervisory agencies has been irreparably damaged in recent years , owing to financial stress tests that gave clean bills of health to institutions - Laiki Bank of Cyprus and Bankia of Spain , among others - whose balance sheets were later found to have enormous holes . 
If the ECB is the eurozone &apos;s lender of last resort , Europe &apos;s leaders agreed , it must have direct knowledge of its potential clients &quot; balance sheets . 
It might also be expected to take a more objective view of the institutions that it supervises - one that is insulated from the influence of national politics . 
So far , so good . 
At the recent European Banking Conference in Frankfurt , there was near-unanimous agreement that a functioning banking union requires a central resolution authority ( to deal with failing financial institutions ) and a mutually guaranteed deposit-protection fund ( to boost confidence in weaker banks in the eurozone &apos;s troubled economies ) . 
But there was also near-unanimous agreement that Europe &apos;s banking union would not meet either of these needs - at least not at the outset . 
The logical French are pushing the parsimonious Germans hard , and a compromise may be reached , but it remains an uphill battle . 
Making matters worse , the ECB &apos;s decision-making mechanisms are poorly suited to the role of banking supervisor . 
It has been agreed that each bank will have an ECB-led supervisory team - responsible for making recommendations on issues like capital requirements , risk weighting of particular assets , and the fitness and propriety of directors and senior managers . 
A new supervisory board , including ECB officials and each eurozone member country &apos;s head of banking supervision , will be established to receive these recommendations . 
But everything will have to be put to the ECB Governing Council for non-objection or approval . 
Its main responsibility , after all , is to set monetary policy , which involves a small number of very important decisions , usually made on a pre-set timetable . 
Indeed , given that monetary policy works by influencing market expectations , maximizing such decisions predictability - at least in terms of timing and guiding principles - enhances their effectiveness . 
Supervision is a far messier business , demanding decisions at unexpected times . 
Moreover , decisions interact with each other , and often require amendment and clarification . 
Waiting for a stately decision-making process to unfold each month could cost money and harm depositors &quot; interests . 
To borrow the philosopher Isaiah Berlin &apos;s famous taxonomy , a supervisor is like a fox ; it knows many small things , is flexible , and constantly adapts its survival strategy . 
A successful central bank is more like a hedgehog ; it knows one big thing - that it must remain focused on low inflation . 
Slow and predictable decision-making is a virtue for such a creature , but it is maladapted for the fast-moving and complex world of twenty-first-century banks . 
So the real challenge facing Nouy in her new role at the ECB is to teach the hedgehog new , fox-like tricks . 
Ideally , she would be aided by a revised decision-making structure , with a new seat of authority able to support the supervisory teams with fast rulings . 
One hopes that the new supervisory board can grow into its role - and that the ECB Governing Council will give it the space to do so . 
The future of Europe &apos;s banking system depends on it .
