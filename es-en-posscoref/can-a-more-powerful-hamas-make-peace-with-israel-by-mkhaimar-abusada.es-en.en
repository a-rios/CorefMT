Hamas Rising 
GAZA CITY - Hamas , the militant political movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , has emerged from the latest round of fighting with Israel with its regional status significantly enhanced . 
At the same time , the movement faces new questions about its ability to take advantage of the diplomatic opportunities that it has gained . 
Hamas &apos;s forceful response to Israel &apos;s military operation in Gaza in November , which included landing rockets near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem , demonstrated its commitment to its core value of steadfastness . 
Moreover , in the wake of the eight-day clash , Hamas &apos;s long-exiled leader , Khaled Meshal , who had never before dared to show himself openly to Israel , entered Gaza from Egypt . 
Parading triumphantly through the streets , he reinforced the idea - at home and abroad - that Hamas had been victorious . 
Beyond Gaza , the rise of political Islam in the Arab Spring countries , particularly Egypt and Tunisia , has created a more Hamas-friendly neighborhood . 
Crucially , the negotiations in Cairo that produced a cease-fire with Israel involved direct , high-level diplomatic contact between Egypt and Hamas - a fundamental shift from former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s avowedly anti-Hamas stance . 
Visits to Gaza by the Emir of Qatar and Turkey &apos;s foreign minister , as well as by other regional leaders , have further buttressed Hamas &apos;s new stature . 
Demonstrating support for Hamas now means building credibility at home , which creates an opportunity to elicit large donations from Arab and Muslim countries to finance Gaza &apos;s reconstruction . 
By contrast , Mahmoud Abbas , the president of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , who embraces peace negotiations with Israel and disavows armed struggle , is more isolated than ever , despite his success in upgrading Palestine &apos;s status at the United Nations to that of &quot; non-member observer state &quot; days after the fighting in Gaza ended . 
Hamas initially reacted skeptically to the statehood bid , but supported it after the cease-fire , owing to its expectation that it will be able to exploit Palestine &apos;s upgraded status . 
Nonetheless , recent events , together with the PA &apos;s dwindling resources , have diminished Abbas &apos;s credibility among Palestinians , who increasingly view him as desperate . 
Israel &apos;s announcement after the UN vote of new settlements around Jerusalem weakened his standing further . 
Indeed , Abbas &apos;s time is running out . 
Meanwhile , Hamas is seeking to capitalize on its growing popularity by winning elections . 
In last October &apos;s municipal elections in the West Bank - the first in six years - the largely secular Fatah party technically retained its authority ; but voter turnout of only 55 % , following Hamas &apos;s call for a boycott , reflected waning support for the party . 
Hamas is now widely seen as the true representative of Palestinian national ambitions , and is set to unite the Palestinians under its flag . 
But can Hamas find a basis for negotiations with Israel ? 
To be sure , Hamas has not abandoned its resistance mantra ; even so , it has moderated its stance on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict over time . 
Indeed , Hamas &apos;s leaders have expressed support for the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders , with East Jerusalem as its capital . 
This gradual shift , combined with Hamas &apos;s endorsement of Abbas &apos;s diplomatic approach in the UN , suggests that Hamas now believes that a military victory over Israel is not possible . 
Signs of Hamas &apos;s shifting perspective are becoming increasingly apparent . 
While Meshal maintained a hardline stance in his speech in Gaza ( see below ) , in private discussions he expressed a readiness to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders . 
Meshal even stated that , if Israel reconsidered its attitude toward the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 - which calls upon the Arab world to recognize Israel &apos;s right to exist in exchange for Israel &apos;s return to its 1967 borders - Hamas would do the same . 
But , although Meshal welcomed the idea of future negotiations with Israel , he maintained that the time is not yet right . 
Hamas is convinced that Israel understands only the language of force and power , and it will not negotiate until Israel accepts the permanence of Palestinian demands . 
Israel may be starting to get the message . 
In fact , the recent fighting drove some Israeli politicians , such as Giora Eiland , former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s national security adviser , to acknowledge that Hamas is a political reality that can no longer be ignored . 
Eiland even advised Israel &apos;s government to recognize Hamas &apos;s rule in Gaza , lift the siege , and negotiate a prolonged cease-fire directly with the movement . 
But the success of such an approach depends on Israel &apos;s readiness to engage Hamas , which it continues to regard as a terrorist group , and on the viability of Egyptian mediation . 
Here , Israel may come under growing pressure from its principal ally . 
Indeed , America &apos;s acceptance of Islamist parties in the region , from Ennahda in Tunisia to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , suggests that skepticism of Islamist groups may be losing ground . 
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi &apos;s success in mediating between Israel and Hamas demonstrated that Islamists can be flexible - even when it comes to Israel . 
There is room for moderation in both sides &quot; positions , but their leaders must be given the right platform on which to make the needed adjustments .
