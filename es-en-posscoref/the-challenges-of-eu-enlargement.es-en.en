The Challenges Of EU Enlargement 
For more than 50 years , Europeans have shared aspirations for closer economic cooperation and political ties . 
The accession of ten new countries to the European Union earlier this year opened the latest and perhaps most dramatic chapter in this process . 
Expansion of the world &apos;s second-largest market offers historic opportunities for economic renewal . 
But with enlargement come challenges . 
At a time of slow growth , lingering high unemployment , and difficult fiscal situations in some countries , it is understandable that longer-standing members of the EU sometimes focus more on the potentially disruptive difficulties than the opportunities . 
Those problems are real , but their solutions lie in the new vistas of the enlarged EU : more trade in goods and services , integration of markets and better allocation of capital , and the potentially disciplining effect of economic unification on economic policies . 
The advantages for trade and investment - more than 450 million people in 25 countries - are self-evident . 
The addition of the faster-growing , middle-income economies of Central and Eastern Europe offers a larger , more diverse internal market with rising purchasing power and a well-educated workforce . 
Adoption of the Euro should foster even greater trade integration by eliminating exchange-rate risk , lowering transaction costs , and promoting greater price transparency and competition . 
The experience of current euro-area members thus far suggests trade gains of roughly 10 % just from the single currency . 
Regrettably , one channel of greater integration has been muted : the free movement of labor . 
Most established member states - fearing potential dislocations - have chosen to protect , albeit temporarily , their labor markets . 
It is essential that all members keep these artificial barriers to a minimum . 
Europe also has much to gain from ongoing financial integration with the eventual goal of a truly pan-European financial market . 
Greater market access , market reform , and efforts at regulatory harmonization - including those under the EU &apos;s Financial Services Action Plan - should help advance this trend . 
Foreign direct investment is the most direct channel for integration . 
By some accounts , FDI between the old and new members might be as much as 70 % lower than justified by economic fundamentals . 
Similarly , with bank credit to the private sector in the new members well below averages in the West , the scope for increasing lending activity is also substantial . 
Financial integration could catapult financial development for new member countries , including through the advent of new financial instruments and services . 
Enlargement of the euro area promises to spur further financial integration . 
Enhanced competition and economies of scale in larger , more closely integrated financial markets should narrow lending margins , lower intermediation costs , and allocate funds more efficiently . 
Greater diversification of portfolios and deeper cross-border linkages should help risk sharing , making the region more resilient to shocks . 
Ultimately , progress in both trade and financial integration rests on improved economic policies . 
New member states should continue pursuing macroeconomic stability and financial discipline , particularly with respect to public finances . 
Along with strong prudential supervision , this should help manage the vulnerabilities of capital-account volatility and credit booms , and lay the groundwork for the eventual adoption of the euro . 
Indeed , before joining the monetary union , the new member countries will need to make more progress toward the convergence criteria for interest rates , inflation , and public finances . 
Fiscal deficits in several new member countries will need to be reduced significantly . 
Trimming excessive social transfers and entitlements , together with proper use of EU structural funds , would help achieve this objective while also satisfying the need for public investment and infrastructure upgrades . 
Strong financial-market supervision will also be needed to contain risks stemming from credit booms , asset bubbles , and financial-market volatility . 
On the structural front , measures to enhance wage and price flexibility would improve resiliency to asymmetric shocks and would help the new countries &apos; cyclical fluctuations become more attuned to the rest of the EU . 
For longstanding members , enlargement presents an opportunity to prepare public finances for coming demographic challenges . 
Restoring the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact should be a top priority , but the larger challenge requires greater stability for long-term public financing . 
A growth-friendly approach to the burdens of aging populations is required , including steps to raise the retirement age and encourage life-long training . 
Enlargement should also give fresh impetus to policies to tackle deep-seated structural impediments and reverse sagging income prospects . 
The Lisbon Strategy adopted in March 2000 set an ambitious course for the EU , calling for greater focus on research and development , completion of the internal market , bold education and employment objectives , and promotion of active aging , all supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies . 
But as we approach the midpoint of this ten-year strategy , Europe stands well short of its many goals . 
As the recent Kok report reviewing the Strategy makes clear , &quot; The disappointing delivery is due to an overloaded agenda , poor coordination , and conflicting priorities . &quot; 
The Lisbon Strategy needs to be refocused . 
The issue is not the productivity of European workers when they are on the job , but rather the need to increase labor-force participation through policies that raise employment rates and reverse the decline in weekly work hours . 
More flexible labor markets and reform of entitlement programs would further allow Europe to confront the demands of greater competition without recourse to insular protections , such as those placed on labor migration . 
Evolving market access , competition , and integration may present Europe with challenges and some costs . 
But enlargement also creates new opportunities . 
Improved policies will amplify these opportunities , ensuring that economic gains will benefit hundreds of millions of people throughout Europe .
