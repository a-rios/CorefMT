Obama and Asia &apos;s Two Futures 
TOKYO - Despite the relentless shift of global economic might to Asia , and China &apos;s rise as a great power - the central historical events of our time , which will drive world affairs for the foreseeable future - America &apos;s focus has been elsewhere . 
The terrorist attacks of 2001 , followed by the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , the Great Contraction of 2008 , the Arab Spring , and Europe &apos;s sovereign debt crisis , all diverted the United States from helping to create a lasting structure of peace to accommodate today &apos;s resurgent Asia . 
In November , US President Barack Obama can begin to redress this imbalance when he hosts the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in his native state of Hawaii . 
The meeting &apos;s timing is fortunate , because a number of critical Asian issues are coming to a boil . 
The South China Sea , for example , is now churning with competing claims to its islands , atolls , and sea bed , including China &apos;s bold assertion that all of it is Chinese sovereign territory . 
At this year &apos;s ASEAN summit in Bali , it was agreed that these territorial disputes be settled through bilateral negotiations . 
But the scope of Chinese claims doomed that agreement from the start ; indeed , China now insists that the sea constitutes a core national interest , on a level with Taiwan and Tibet , for which it is prepared to fight . 
China &apos;s willingness to throw its weight around amplifies the grave imbalance in size , and leverage , between it and the other countries bordering the South China Sea . 
This has made bilateral negotiations to settle these disputes unviable . 
Vietnam and the Philippines have been bullied in this way recently , with both pushing back rather than submit to Chinese imposed terms . 
The presidential elections scheduled for next year in two of Asia &apos;s strongest democracies - South Korea and Taiwan - are also likely to cause diplomatic temperatures to rise in the months ahead . 
The risk stems not from the conduct of the South Koreans or the Taiwanese , but from the democratic choices that they make , which may offend two of Asia &apos;s last dictatorships . 
In South Korea , the remarkable Park Guen-hye &apos;s bid to become her country &apos;s first woman president may provide an excuse - as if any were needed - for North Korean mischief-making . 
The regime in Pyongyang is seeking to ensure that power passes to a third generation of Kims , represented by the pudgy and well-fed &quot; Dear Young General , &quot; Kim Jong-un , and appears to believe that provocations such as its bombardment of a South Korean island earlier this year are the way to secure the succession . 
Taiwan , too , may elect a woman president , Tsai Ing-wen , the leader of the opposition Democratic Peoples &quot; Party , next year . 
That outcome would stoke Chinese ire , not because of Tsai &apos;s gender , but owing to her politics . 
The DPP has long been the Taiwanese party keenest on securing independence for the country . 
A third Asian issue with combustible potential is Burma , where another unique woman , the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , is at the heart of events . 
The elections earlier this year , which many at first assumed were a sham , now appear to have produced changes to which Asia &apos;s countries will need to collectively and individually respond . 
The government not only freed Suu Kyi after two decades of house arrest , but has even begun a dialogue with her - talks for which the meticulous opposition leader has expressed real hope . 
Indeed , President Thein Sein &apos;s government has begun to release thousands of political prisoners , including the monk who led the massive street protests of 2007 . 
Sein &apos;s government has also listened to Burmese public disquiet at China &apos;s massive influence in the country , and has canceled a huge $ 3.6 billion dam that Chinese firms were building . 
China , it is plain to see , is at the root of most of the disputes troubling Asia . 
Two main issues must be managed - one philosophical , the other structural - in seeking to ameliorate the problems caused by China &apos;s unconstrained rise . 
Only by resolving the structural issue will Asia succeed in overcoming the philosophical problem . 
The philosophical problem concerns China &apos;s renewed conception of itself as the &quot; Middle Kingdom , &quot; a state with no sovereign equal . 
Throughout its history , China has sought to treat its neighbors as vassals - a mindset currently reflected in the way that it has approached negotiations with Vietnam and the Philippines over the South China Sea . 
China &apos;s free-floating rise , unanchored in any regional structure or settlement , makes this mindset particularly worrying . 
At the Hawaii summit , Obama must orchestrate the first steps toward constructing an effective multilateral framework within which the complications posed by China &apos;s rise can be addressed . 
The absence of such a structure of peace has been obscured , to some extent , by America &apos;s dominant role in Asia since the Pacific War . 
But China &apos;s rise and America &apos;s other global and domestic concerns have left many Asians wondering just how enduring those commitments will be in the future . 
Nevertheless , China &apos;s recent strategic assertiveness has led many Asian democracies to seek to deepen their ties with the US , as South Korea has done with a bilateral free-trade agreement . 
The US is reciprocating by pledging not to cut Asia-related defense spending , despite the big reduction in overall US defense spending that lies ahead . 
What Asia most needs today is a well-conceived regional system , embedded in binding multilateral institutions . 
A &quot; Trans-Pacific Partnership &quot; between Australia , Brunei , Chile , Malaysia , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore , the US , and Vietnam to govern supply-chain management , intellectual-property protection , investment , rules on state-owned firms , and other trade issues - likely to be announced in Hawaii - is a good start in the economic sphere . 
But much more is needed . 
Ultimately , the best way for peace to prevail in the region is for the US and China to share responsibility for a regional order with Asia &apos;s other powers , particularly India , Indonesia , Japan , and South Korea . 
Asia &apos;s choice is clear : either the region embraces a multilateral structure of peace , or it will find itself constrained by a system of strategic military alliances . 
In Hawaii , Obama and the other assembled Asian leaders - particularly the Chinese - must begin to choose between these two Asian futures .
