Germany &apos;s Labor Pains 
Germany is a country with very few strikes . 
Whereas the average number of working days lost due to strikes from 2000 to 2004 amounted to 234 per 1,000 employees in Spain , 171 in Canada , and 101 in France , only 3.5 days were lost in Germany . 
In the OECD &apos;s strike statistics , Germany ranks third from the bottom , ahead of only Poland , with 1.6 lost days , and Japan , with 0.4 . 
So Germans are all the more disturbed that the train drivers &quot; union , the GDL , has voted for a nation-wide strike that will paralyze the country . 
The recently signed wage agreement for all railway employees , negotiated by the rival unions Transnet and GDBA , did not go far enough for the GDL , which is now holding out for a 31 % wage hikes . 
The strike has been temporarily stopped by a court order , leaving time for negotiations , but the danger remains great because talks have reached an impasse . 
If the GDL gets a higher wage settlement than achieved in the general wage agreement for all railway workers , the general agreement will become invalid - an outcome that the railway management cannot accept under any conditions . 
More importantly , a strike could introduce a paradigm shift in the German labor market for two reasons . 
First , other privatized state-owned operations , especially postal and telecommunication services , could follow suit . 
Formerly , these operations could rely on the fact that employees were permanent civil servants ( Beamte ) , a German anomaly . 
While German permanent civil servants cannot be fired , nor are they allowed to strike . 
The status of permanent civil servant , marked by a special reciprocal obligation of loyalty , was created by the Prussian state in order to fill strategically important positions with people who could be fully trusted . 
Train drivers were the paramount examples of this credo . 
With the privatization of Germany &apos;s railway , which will shortly be concluded with its listing on the stock market , these civil servants will disappear . 
Today , 40 % of German train drivers are still permanent civil servants who have been leased from the state by the privatized railway . 
But the remaining train drivers &quot; right to strike is sufficient to threaten Germany with chaos in the transport system . 
The threatened strike is also significant because it marks a departure from the German system of industry-wide unions , which negotiate for all employees within an industry regardless of their occupation . 
The alternative is unions for individual trades within an industry , which usually are aggressive negotiators and tend to demand far more than is economically feasible . 
Such unions are common in Anglo-Saxon countries . 
They were responsible to a great extent for Britain &apos;s economic decline in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s . 
Not until Margaret Thatcher broke their power was the country able to breathe freely and renew itself . 
There is an economic explanation for why unions based on individual trades are detrimental . 
Such unions act as monopolies that offer complementary goods . 
Because the customer is only interested in the total price that he must pay for all goods in a bundle , and since the amount of the purchased units of this bundle is dependent only on the total price , individual sellers are encouraged to ask for particularly high prices . 
If they raise their prices , they receive the full financial gain , while any loss implied by a decline in demand is distributed among all sellers . 
For this reason , the total price that emerges is higher than would have been chosen by a monopoly seller who represents all producers together and who takes into consideration all the mutual disadvantages from any decline in demand . 
A monopoly is poison for a market economy , because it increases prices and decreases volume . 
Even more poisonous is a chain of monopolies offering complementary goods . 
It increases prices and decreases volumes even more than one comprehensive monopoly incorporating all suppliers in that chain would have done . 
This insight can be applied directly to the problem of unions . 
As a comprehensive monopoly , an industry-wide union achieves higher wages than would be possible under conditions of competition , i. e. without any unions , and consequently increases unemployment . 
But unions based on trades , which operate largely independently of one another , achieve even higher wages and create even more unemployment - so much so that employees as a whole are much worse off than they would be if an industry-wide union represented them . 
The German train drivers &quot; wage demands demonstrate that the privatization of former state-owned operations carries considerable risks for Germany &apos;s labor market , because how those demands are resolved will determine whether Germany will move in the direction of unions based on trades . 
If it does , Germany &apos;s ranking in international strike statistics will rise considerably .
