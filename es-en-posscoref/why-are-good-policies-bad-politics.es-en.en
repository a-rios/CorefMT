Why Are Good Policies Bad Politics ? 
BERKELEY - From the day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year , the policies followed by the United States Treasury , the US Federal Reserve , and the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been sound and helpful . 
The alternative - standing back and letting the markets handle things - would have brought America and the world higher unemployment than now exists . 
Credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse . 
The fact that investment bankers did not go bankrupt last December and are profiting immensely this year is a side issue . 
Every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $ 400 billion . 
A recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the US roughly $ 2 trillion - and cost the world as a whole four times as much . 
In comparison , the bonuses at Goldman Sachs are a rounding error . 
And any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk . 
As Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said , ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans - and tens of millions outside the US - at risk . 
The Obama administration &apos;s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy . 
Though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus , aid to states has been a job-saving success , and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boosts production and employment . 
And the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low : $ 12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal-stimulus program at current interest rates . 
For that price , American taxpayers will get an extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services , and employment will be higher by about ten million job-years . 
The valid complaints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewarded the princes of Wall Street , but rather that it has been too limited - that we ought to have done more . 
Yet these policies are political losers now : nobody is proposing more stimulus . 
This is strange , because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again . 
Good policies that are boosting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular , right ? 
With respect to Obama &apos;s stimulus package , it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dishonesty on the American right , which the press refuses to see . 
For two and a half centuries , economists have believed that the flow of spending in an economy goes up whenever groups of people decide to spend more . 
Sometimes spending rises because there is more disposable cash in the economy , and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs - the cost of forgoing some other action , such as saving - make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly . 
Sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices , and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment . 
But , whatever the cause or effect , spending always goes up whenever groups decide to spend more - and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else &apos;s . 
They are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid-2000 &quot; s , or of the princes of Silicon Valley to spend more building new companies during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Obama &apos;s Republican opponents , who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work , rely on arguments that are incoherent at best , and usually simply wrong , if not mendacious . 
Remember that back in 1993 , when the Clinton administration &apos;s analyses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit , the Republicans said that that would destroy the economy , too . 
Such claims were as wrong then as they are now . 
But how many media reports make even a cursory effort to evaluate them ? 
A stronger argument , though not by much , is that the fiscal stimulus is boosting employment and production , but at too great a long-run cost because it has produced too large a boost in America &apos;s national debt . 
If interest rates on US Treasury securities were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew , I would agree with this argument . 
But interest rates on US Treasury securities are very low and are not rising . 
Those who claim that America has a debt problem , and that a debt problem cannot be cured with more debt , ignore ( sometimes deliberately ) that private debt and US Treasury debt have been very different animals - moving in different directions and behaving in different ways - since the start of the financial crisis . 
What the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt , but that it has too much private debt , which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive . 
The market is also saying - clearly and repeatedly - that the economy has too little public US government debt , which is why everyone wants to hold it .
