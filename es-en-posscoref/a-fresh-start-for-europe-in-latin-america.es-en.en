A Fresh Start for Europe in Latin America ? 
MILAN - By 2050 , Brazil and Mexico will be among the world &apos;s six leading economies , according to analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs . 
Does the European Union care ? 
Is Latin America to be Europe &apos;s next missed business opportunity ? 
Latin America has a population of 550 million , with average yearly per capita income of $ 4,000 , immense natural resources , and substantial human capital . 
It accounts for 8 % of world production and grew by more than 5 % in each of the past three years . 
Although the United States remains the main destination of Latin American and Caribbean exports , Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for goods based on natural resources . 
During the past four years , Latin America attracted an annual average of $ 61 billion in foreign direct investment , 60 % of which went to Brazil and Mexico . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , foreign investors were chiefly attracted by privatization programs in the region , but more recently mergers and acquisitions and greenfield projects have been the most common type of investment . 
Predictably , Spain is the most important European investor in the region , though several important Spanish operations have recently passed to Italian companies , among them the utility Endesa , acquired by Enel , which is now the biggest private energy distributor in Latin America . 
Meanwhile , Latin American businesses have been increasing their own foreign investments . 
In 2006 , Brazil invested $ 28.2 billion abroad , compared to inflows of $ 18.8 billion . 
Indeed , emerging giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of worldwide investment in the coming decades . 
In 2006 , Italy &apos;s Fiat Group and India &apos;s Tata Motors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in India . 
The following year , they extended their partnership to Latin America , investing $ 80 million in production of a Tata pick-up truck at Fiat &apos;s factory in Cordoba , Argentina . 
It is to be hoped that many more major European corporations will follow suit . 
But small and medium sized enterprises ( SMEs ) - the majority of firms in both Latin America and Europe - find it difficult to trade and invest at international level , in part because of high transaction and information costs . 
In Europe , clusters of SMEs appear able to achieve economies of scale and scope , and thus to succeed collectively in global markets . 
This European experience is now being widely studied in Latin America . 
In Brazil , four local production systems have combined to form Project Promos / Sebrae / BID , based on the example of Italy &apos;s industrial districts . 
Between 2002 and 2006 , Brazil &apos;s SME support services and the Milan Chamber of Commerce created partnerships involving furniture , shoes , designer lingerie , and handicrafts from different regions of the country . 
This approach may well be the shape of things to come . 
But , while the EU &apos;s association agreement with Mexico is 10 years old , it does not yet have a strategic partnership with Brazil . 
This is partly because of the never-ending negotiation process with Mercosur , the troubled - and still incomplete - Latin American customs union . 
The EU is currently negotiating trade liberalization deals with all of Latin America &apos;s regional blocs : Mercosur , the Caribbean Community , the Central America Common Market , and the Andean Community . 
The EU must urge its Latin American partners towards further integration . 
Adopting a common &quot; rule of origin &quot; for their products would be an incentive to liberalize their international trade further , thus increasing it . 
Full trade liberalization in Latin America , although difficult to achieve , must be made central to EU strategy , and would boost economic growth . 
But even if tariffs and quotas are progressively reduced , trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high . 
The crucial issue is market access . 
Most Latin American countries still get poor results from their efforts to export to Europe , the exceptions being raw materials and energy resources . 
After the establishment of the EU-Chile free-trade area , Chilean exports to the EU increased substantially . 
But in the case of EU-Mexico trade liberalization , the growth of imports from the EU has exceeded the growth of exports to Europe , resulting in a widening Mexican trade deficit with the EU . 
This is at odds with the EU &apos;s proclamations since the 1999 Rio summit that Latin America is a vital political and economic partner . 
A change in Europe &apos;s approach is needed if a strategic partnership is to be created . 
The European Commission understands this . 
Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil , it intends to push ahead with one as fast as possible . 
In mid-2007 , the Commission confirmed that it will revisit the EU &apos;s dialogue with Mercosur , with the aim of giving new impetus to negotiations . 
But there is also keen awareness that the EU &apos;s hope for a special relationship with Brazil must not be allowed to hinder regional integration or worsen asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc . 
If Latin America is to become a strategic partner for the EU and a more attractive market for European companies , European institutions must become more open to the region &apos;s needs . 
A fresh start by the EU with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising , because of the &quot; pull &quot; it might have on other countries . 
Otherwise , Latin America may well prove to be Europe &apos;s next missed business opportunity .
