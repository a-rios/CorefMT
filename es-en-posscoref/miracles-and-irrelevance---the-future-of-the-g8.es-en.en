Miracles and Irrelevance - the Future of the G8 
Two weeks after the G8 leaders met in Germany an impression remains that they wrought a political miracle in Heiligendamm . 
Three things were supposedly saved at the G8 summit : world climate , Africa , and relations between Russia and the United States . 
It seemed that a world government had met on the shores of the Baltic Sea . 
In the face of European unity , George W. Bush was transformed from a notorious sinner against the world &apos;s climate to a born again climate protector . 
Some bold observers , indeed , regard this change of heart by Bush as a clear indication that Europe had assumed a new role in world politics . 
But no real miracles occurred ; instead , the G8 will need a miracle not to lose its relevance . 
In faraway America , however , where people are normally more religious than in old Europe , belief in the Heiligendamm miracle is less widespread . 
Indeed , Americans were rather indifferent to the summit . 
The reason for this is not only the public arrest of the tabloid newspapers &quot; current favorite , the heiress Paris Hilton , but also the fact that the only expectations Americans now have of President Bush is for him to finish his term . 
Because of Bush &apos;s perceived impotence , Americans believed that no real decisions could be taken at this summit . 
What , then , was decided at the summit ? 
To begin with , the G8 countries decided to &quot; seriously examine &quot; cutting in half worldwide emissions by 2050 ! 
This is a very long time in politics . 
This compromise was supposedly hammered out in tough negotiations . 
But translated into everyday speech , &quot; examine &quot; and even &quot; seriously examine &quot; mean nothing other than &quot; to postpone . &quot; 
For what happened is that America &apos;s president , both before the summit and quite publicly at it , successfully spurned quantifiable goals and refused to make any concrete commitments . 
So in the end all that was left was a choice between doing nothing and deciding to postpone a decision in a &quot; serious &quot; way . 
This is how international conferences sometimes work . 
Thus , sadly , Europe &apos;s contribution to the conversion of America &apos;s president on climate change was very limited . 
After all , whatever awakening Bush has had has more to do with changes in the US political climate , where climate change is now a real issue . 
Indeed , the positions of Al Gore and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger have contributed more to Bush &apos;s awakening than all the efforts of the European leaders combined . 
In the cold light of day , the US government &apos;s agreement to negotiate a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol within a UN framework is not a sign of real progress either . 
This is so because members of both parties in the US Congress still repeat the mantra : Nothing without China ! 
This position will not change after the next presidential election . 
The problem becomes clear when you compare per capita emissions in the US and China rather than absolute numbers . 
China may be the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases in absolute terms ( behind the US ) , but its per capita emissions are those of an emerging economy that is still far behind . 
The fact that the US , the world &apos;s largest economy and emitter of greenhouse gases - in absolute numbers and in per capita terms - is taking cover behind the largest emerging country with regard to climate policy does not bode well for the future . 
Climate change is not the only place where the G8 summit now seems less than miraculous . 
In the run-up to the summit , Germany announced that it would increase its foreign aid for Africa by 700 million Euros . 
This was the only concrete step , one deserving of praise . 
But otherwise the G8 only reaffirmed the decision they had taken two years ago in Gleneagles , Scotland . 
So in real terms Africa has received only more grandiose rhetoric . 
Unfortunately , there is nothing to indicate that restating empty promises will lead to any change . 
The German presidency of this year &apos;s G8 cannot be held responsible for this state of affairs . 
Under the prevailing circumstances , it is hard to see how more could have been achieved , given the political conditions back home of the summit &apos;s participants . 
So the summit &apos;s outcome was far from a miracle . 
What really mattered in Heiligendamm were not the decisions taken by any putative world government but the fact that the days of the G8 now seem to be numbered . 
Politically and economically , China and India are more important today than some European G8 members . 
Indeed , Europeans should understand that this viewpoint is spreading around the world , particularly on the other side of the Atlantic . 
President Putin &apos;s behavior at the summit clearly demonstrated what he thinks about the Europeans ; not too much . 
While the Europeans dreamed of assuming a mediator &apos;s role between the US and Russia , the Russian president was determined to resolve the questions of the US anti-ballistic missile shield and Kosovo bilaterally with the US . 
As in the old Cold War days , Russia would love to sit once again at the negotiating table alone with America . 
The Europeans , with their disunity and weakness , are perceived as unnecessary , even bothersome . 
If the Europeans continue to cultivate their weakness and disunity , it may well happen that Europe will become irrelevant across the international agenda . 
This year &apos;s G8 is over . 
Next December things will start getting serious . 
Environment ministers from around the world will meet at the next UN climate conference in Bali . 
Only then we will know with certainty if a miracle did occur at Heiligendamm or if the summit was , indeed , yet another &quot; political miracle play . &quot;
