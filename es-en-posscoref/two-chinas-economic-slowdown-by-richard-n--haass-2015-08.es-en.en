The New &quot; Two Chinas &quot; Question 
NEW YORK - To anyone over the age of 60 who follows world affairs , the term &quot; two Chinas &quot; recalls the post-1949 competition for diplomatic recognition waged by mainland ( &quot; Red &quot; ) China and Taiwan , or , more formally , the People &apos;s Republic of China and the Republic of China . 
By the early 1970s , just about every country fell in line with the People &apos;s Republic &apos;s demand that it alone be recognized as the legitimate sovereign government of China . 
The mainland was simply too large and too important economically and strategically to alienate . 
Today , a new , but very different , &quot; two Chinas &quot; question is emerging . 
In short , two very different Chinas can now be glimpsed . 
But which one will prevail ? 
Until recently , there was little reason to ask such a question . China &apos;s economy was growing at an astounding average annual rate of 10 % or higher for more than three decades . 
China had overtaken Japan as the world &apos;s second largest economy . 
Hundreds of millions of Chinese had entered the middle class . 
China &apos;s model of authoritarian efficiency seemed attractive to many other developing countries , particularly in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis , which began in the United States and thus seemed to discredit American-style liberal capitalism . 
But the question of China &apos;s future has become unavoidable . 
Officially , economic growth has slowed to near 7 % ; but many believe the real number is below 5 % . 
The slowdown should come as no surprise ; all developing economies experience something similar as they grow and mature . 
Nonetheless , the speed and degree of change have caught the authorities off guard , and have stoked official fears that growth will fall short of the rate needed for the country to modernize as planned . 
The government &apos;s alarm at the sharper-than-expected economic slowdown was reflected in its heavy-handed intervention in July to freeze stock markets in the midst of a dramatic price correction . 
That move was followed this month by a surprise devaluation of the renminbi , which suggests that the shift away from export-led growth is not working as hoped . 
Meanwhile , President Xi Jinping &apos;s anti-corruption campaign increasingly looks like a strategy to consolidate power , rather than an effort to reform China &apos;s state for the benefit of its economy and society . 
Corruption is pervasive , and Xi &apos;s campaign remains broadly popular . 
But the wave of prosecutions that Xi has unleashed is discouraging Chinese officials from making decisions , owing to their fear that they could face criminal charges in the future . 
As a result of these developments , one hears much less of late about the Chinese model and more about the Chinese reality . 
Aside from slowing growth , that reality includes severe environmental damage , one result of decades of rapid , coal-fueled industrialization . 
According to one estimate , air pollution is killing 1.6 million Chinese per year . 
China &apos;s aging population , an unintended consequence of its draconian one-child policy , poses another threat to long-term prosperity . 
With the dependency ratio - the proportion of children and pensioners relative to working-age men and women - set to rise rapidly in the coming years , economic growth will remain subdued , while health-care and pension costs will increasingly strain government budgets . 
What is increasingly apparent is that China &apos;s leaders want the economic growth that capitalism produces , but without the downturns that come with it . 
They want the innovation that an open society generates , but without the intellectual freedom that defines it . 
Something has to give . 
Some observers , fearing a rising China , will breathe a sigh of relief at its current difficulties . 
A slow-growth China would undermine the global economic recovery . 
It would be a less-willing partner in tackling global challenges such as climate change . 
Most dangerous of all , a struggling China could be tempted to turn to foreign adventurism to placate a public frustrated by slower economic growth and an absence of political freedom . 
Indeed , there are some signs that the authorities are doing just this in the South China Sea . 
Nationalism could become the primary source of legitimacy for a ruling party that can no longer point to a rapidly rising standard of living . 
The US and others will need to push back to ensure that China does not act on such a temptation . 
But these countries would be equally wise to signal to China that it is welcome to take its place among the world &apos;s leading countries if it acts responsibly and according to the rules set for all . 
But the bigger policy choices will be China &apos;s to make . 
The choices China faces are as difficult as they are unavoidable . 
Major social unrest cannot be ruled out . 
The one certainty is that the next three decades will not mirror the last three .
