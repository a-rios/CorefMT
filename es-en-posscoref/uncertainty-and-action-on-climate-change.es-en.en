Uncertainty and Action on Climate Change 
The uncertainties about climate change are many and great . 
How much CO2 may join the atmosphere if nothing is done about it ? 
How much global warming will it cause , and how will local climates , ecosystems , and vulnerable species be affected ? 
What impact will such changes have on productivity , comfort , and health ? 
And , of course , what are the likely costs of shifting to renewable energy sources and energy conservation ? 
As more becomes known about climate change - for example , the role of clouds and oceans - more uncertainties emerge . 
Nevertheless , the greenhouse &quot; theory , &quot; as it is sometimes disparagingly called , has been established beyond responsible doubt . 
There is uncertainty about the quantitative parameters , and there can be doubt about whether the warming of recent decades is entirely due to the &quot; greenhouse effect . &quot; 
But the basics of global warming are not in scientific dispute . 
If we know that the earth is warming , but are uncertain about how fast and with what effects on climates worldwide , what are the most urgent steps that we should take to address it ? 
One , of course , is to keep studying climate phenomena and their ecological impact . 
Another is to promote research and development aimed at remediation . 
We urgently need to understand what alternatives to fossil fuels there will be , how much energy can be conserved , how to extract CO2 from the atmosphere , and , if necessary , how to increase the earth &apos;s albedo , its reflectance of incoming sunlight . 
One way to ensure the necessary R D is to rely on the market to finance and direct the work by using taxes , subsidies , rationing , and - most important - by convincing firms and consumers that fossil fuels will become progressively more costly . 
But private interests will not undertake some essential R D under any circumstances ; the &quot; market &quot; will not induce the necessary outlays , because investors cannot capture all the benefits of moderating global warming for the human race . 
So the other option is for governments , cooperatively with business , to finance and direct R D. For example , it has long been understood that CO2 produced in large stationary plants like electric power stations can be &quot; captured &quot; and piped to where it can be injected into underground caverns ( or possibly ocean beds ) . 
Twenty-five years ago , it was estimated that this process would double the cost of electricity ; it now appears that costs may be more modest . 
But investment in the required R D - in the technology of capture , transport , injection , and sealing , and in geologic exploration for sites suitable for permanent storage - will be beyond the purview of any private interest . 
So-called &quot; geo-engineering &quot; is another area of research that deserves attention , but will not receive it from the private sector . 
Some sunlight reaching the earth is absorbed , and some is reflected away . 
Likewise , some volcanic eruptions , namely those that produce lots of sulfur , can cool the earth significantly . 
Indeed , it is estimated that the sulfur currently in the atmosphere , mainly from combustion of coal and oil , may be masking a significant part of the expected greenhouse effect . 
So it would make sense to conduct small , reversible experiments to determine what substances might be put at what altitude to reflect incoming energy , and to include the results in global climate models to ascertain where they would be most effective and benign . 
Needless to say , this is not a task for the private sector , and some international sponsorship might be appropriate . 
For some , particularly the Bush administration , uncertainty regarding global warming appears to be a legitimate basis for postponing action , which is usually identified as &quot; costly . &quot; 
But this idea is almost unique to climate change . 
In other areas of public policy , such as terrorism , nuclear proliferation , inflation , or vaccination , an &quot; insurance &quot; principle seems to prevail : if there is a sufficient likelihood of significant damage , we take some measured anticipatory action . 
At the opposite extreme is what is often called the &quot; precautionary &quot; principle , now popular in the European Union : until something - for example , genetically modified foods - is guaranteed safe , it must be postponed indefinitely , despite substantial expected benefits . 
Neither of these two principles makes sense , economically or otherwise . 
We should weigh the costs , benefits , and probabilities as best as possible , and not be obsessed with extreme cases . 
Of course , the uncertainties about climate change make a few actions infeasible for now , and probably for a long time . 
The acknowledged uncertainty about the &quot; climate sensitivity &quot; parameter implies that it makes no sense to decide now , through some multinational diplomatic process , what the ultimate ceiling on greenhouse gas concentrations must be , and then using this ceiling as a basis for allotting quotas to participating nations . 
But most issues concerning climate change are not so clear . 
The most terrifying possible consequence of global warming that has been identified is the &quot; collapse &quot; of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , which rests on the sea bottom and protrudes a kilometer or two above sea level . 
Unlike floating ice , which does nothing to the sea level when it melts , there is enough of this ice sheet above the surface that it could raise the sea level by something like 20 feet if it glaciated into the ocean , inundating coastal cities everywhere . 
Estimates of the likelihood of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet &apos;s collapse , or the likely time of collapse , have varied for three decades . 
Recent studies of the effect of ocean temperature on the movement of ground-based ice sheets are not reassuring . 
In my reading of the latest research , the likelihood of collapse in this century is small - but uncertain . 
In responding to such uncertainty , we should neither wait until the uncertainty has been 
These two extremes are not the only alternatives .
