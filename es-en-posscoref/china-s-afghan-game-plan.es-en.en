China &apos;s Afghan Game Plan 
MADRID - In his latest book , On China , Henry Kissinger uses the traditional intellectual games favored by China and the West - weiqi and chess - as a way to reveal their differing attitudes toward international power politics . 
Chess is about total victory , a Clausewitzian battle for the &quot; center of gravity &quot; and the eventual elimination of the enemy , whereas weiqi is a quest for relative advantage through a strategy of encirclement that avoids direct conflict . 
This cultural contrast is a useful guide to the way that China manages its current competition with the West . 
China &apos;s Afghan policy is a case in point , but it also is a formidable challenge to the weiqi way . 
As the United States prepares to withdraw its troops from the country , China must deal with an uncertain post-war scenario . 
Afghanistan is of vital strategic interest to China , yet it never crossed its leaders &quot; minds to defend those interests through war . 
A vital security zone to China &apos;s west , Afghanistan is also an important corridor through which it can secure its interests in Pakistan ( a traditional ally in China &apos;s competition with India ) , and ensure its access to vital natural resources in the region . 
Moreover , China &apos;s already restless Muslim-majority province of Xinjiang , which borders on Afghanistan , might be dangerously affected by a Taliban takeover there , or by the country &apos;s dismemberment . 
The US fought its longest-ever war in Afghanistan , at a cost ( so far ) of more than $ 555 billion , not to mention tens of thousands of Afghan civilian casualties and close to 3,100 US troops killed . 
But China &apos;s strategy in the country was mostly focused on business development , and on satiating its vast appetite for energy and minerals . 
The US Defense Department has valued Afghanistan &apos;s untapped mineral deposits at $ 1 trillion . 
But it is China that is now poised to exploit much of these resources . 
Indeed , China &apos;s development of the Aynak Copper Mine was the largest single foreign direct investment in Afghanistan &apos;s history . 
China was also engaged in constructing a $ 500 million electric plant and railway link between Tajikistan and Pakistan . 
Last December , China &apos;s state-owned National Petroleum Corporation signed a deal with the Afghan authorities that would make it the first foreign company to exploit Afghanistan &apos;s oil and natural-gas reserves . 
Once China &apos;s enormous economic and security interests in Afghanistan are left without America &apos;s military shield , the Chinese are bound to play an even larger role there , one that Afghans hope will reach &quot; strategic levels . &quot; 
China would prefer to accomplish this the Chinese way - that is , essentially through a display of soft power - or , as the Chinese government put it on the occasion of Afghan President Hamid Karzai &apos;s official visit to Beijing in early June , through &quot; non-traditional security areas . &quot; 
Judging by China &apos;s behavior in other parts of the world , any military cooperation is likely to be extremely modest and cautious . 
China has already made it clear it will not contribute to the $ 4.1 billion multilateral fund to sustain Afghan national security forces . 
Rather , the two countries &quot; recently signed bilateral cooperation agreement is about &quot; safeguarding Afghanistan &apos;s national stability &quot; through social and economic development . 
China is especially keen on combating drug trafficking , as Badakhshan , the Afghan province bordering on Xinjiang , has become the main transit route for Afghan opium . 
But preventing the spillover into Xinjiang of Taliban-inspired religious extremism remains a high priority as well . 
China went to great lengths to present the recent summit in Beijing of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , which includes China , Russia , and major Central Asian countries , as an attempt to create a fair balance of interests among regional stakeholders . Moreover , the SCO sought a consensus on how , in Chinese President Hu Jintao &apos;s words , to guard the region &quot; against shocks from turbulence outside the region . &quot; 
Yet , however focused it is on soft-power projection in Afghanistan , China will likely find it difficult not to be drawn into the role of policeman in an extremely complex and historically conflict-ridden region . 
China &apos;s regional outreach , moreover , clashes with that of other regional powers , such as Russia and India . 
Nor is its own ally , Pakistan , particularly eager to confront terrorist groups that threaten the security of its neighbors , China among them . 
Pakistan might find it extremely difficult to reconcile the security of its Chinese ally with its de facto proxy war with India . 
China might then be forced to bolster its military presence in Pakistan and in tribal areas along the Afghan border in order to counter terrorist groups such as the Pakistan-based East Turkestan Islamic Movement , which the Chinese believe is responsible for attacks in Xinjiang . 
The preferred Chinese way would be that of cooptation and dialogue . 
Indeed , Chinese diplomacy has been busy lately in trilateral talks with Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at achieving reconciliation with the Taliban . 
Nor is China interested in stirring up the conflict between its Pakistani allies and its Indian rivals . 
On the contrary , China has argued for years that the main problem affecting Afghanistan &apos;s stability is the India-Pakistan proxy fighting , and that peace in Kashmir is therefore the key to peace in Afghanistan . 
The task of defending its interests in Afghanistan after US withdrawal is a truly formidable challenge for Chinese diplomacy . 
It is inconceivable , though , that the Chinese would enter into the kind of massive US-style military intervention to which the world has grown accustomed in recent years . 
For China , the Afghan contest will most likely turn out to be a very measured combination of chess and weiqi .
