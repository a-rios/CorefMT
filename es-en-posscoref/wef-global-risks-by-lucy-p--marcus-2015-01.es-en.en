Preparing for the Unknown Unknowns 
LONDON - We live in perilous times . 
Just as we seem to get our bearings , something happens to make us feel as if our legs have been knocked out from under us . 
Actions and events often are intertwined , and what happens on one level - affecting individuals , states , economic sectors , and companies of all sizes - may have repercussions on others . 
The recent terrorist attacks in Paris are a case in point , affecting not only the families and friends of the victims , or even only the people of France . 
The reverberations are being felt around the world , and they will continue to have an impact - far beyond Europe - on public policy , electoral politics , media freedom , and more . 
The attacks came at a time when the world traditionally tries to make sense of the year ahead - to forecast the risks that lie in wait , the opportunities that will arise , and the challenges that will have to be overcome . 
But what about longer-term risks ? 
Do events like the Paris attacks show that forecasting them is impossible ? 
Or did the attacks expose precisely the type of risk that long-term projections should identify ? 
The World Economic Forum has just released its &quot; Global Risks 2015 &quot; report which attempts to predict and rank the biggest risks that the world faces over the next ten years . 
For example , &quot; the biggest threat to the stability of the world in the next ten years comes from the risk of international conflict . &quot; 
And the menace of war is followed by a raft of social , environmental , geopolitical , technological , and economic risks and trends . 
But all of these risks will be felt on an organizational , and ultimately , individual level as well . 
And yet we also know that the pace of change is faster than ever before , and that governments , businesses , and households are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up . 
Beneath all of our identifying , quantifying , and mitigating of risk lies the undeniable and timeless truth that the only constant is change . 
For Heraclitus , change was the fundamental principle of life . 
Machiavelli referred to it as fortuna : the events that shape us and determine our wellbeing are often beyond our reason and control . 
Though we can attempt to plan for change , we cannot always predict the precise nature and time at which it will occur . 
Moreover , for all the risks that we can and do plan for , it is those for which we cannot prepare that can do the most damage . 
That is why , alongside all of the identifying , quantifying , and mitigating , we must also embrace the idea that not all change can be clearly foreseen and planned for . 
The implication is that we must instill in our families , organizations , and states the resilience and tools needed to act effectively in times of crisis - and thus to minimize the potentially damaging impact of unexpected change . 
This ethos will also help us maximize the potential benefits of such flux . 
After all , without unforeseen change , much of human endeavor would be fruitless , and innovation would be unnecessary . 
Shocking things like the massacre at Charlie Hebdo in Paris happen , and they seem to be happening more frequently than ever . 
It is at such moments that we demonstrate our ability - or lack of it - to confront the unexplained , the unplanned , and the unfathomable . 
At the same time , such moments remind us that future generations ultimately will judge us not on the basis of what we accumulated - whether personally , as organizations , or as states - but by the impact we had on those around us , and by how well we responded to their needs . 
In perilous times , when the emergence , timing , and diffusion of risks can have a paralyzing effect , what matters is not simply what we accomplish , but how we accomplish it . 
In such times , the value we create cannot be measured only in terms of money . 
More important is how much stronger , more capable , and more resilient we help our colleagues , partners , children , and fellow citizens become . 
Perhaps the main risk this year - and in the decade ahead - is that we lose sight of this fundamental truth .
