The Virtual Enemy 
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September , 2001 , yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells operate , and what their weaknesses are . 
The Bush administration still uses the phrase &quot; war on terror &quot; and behaves as though it really is a war , the ordinary kind where one government fights another . 
Yet after five years of military exertions , strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse . 
It is time to understand the new , emerging model of conflict . 
In order to make the &quot; war &quot; paradigm fit , the Bush administration alludes to al-Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy . 
In fact , there is now no master planner or funder of terrorist activities . 
The Madrid , London , and Bali attacks , as well as several thwarted operations in the United States and Britain , were all characterized by their dispersed organization . 
Independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources , often within the target country . 
Those small operations also lacked a common internal design . 
Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell , even from person to person . 
Individuals can be involved for profit and power , or for political and religious reasons , while others participate for hate or thrills . 
Moreover , there are vast differences in terms of risks , rewards , and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain , or jumps from cell to cell . 
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that , in this case , has no head . 
The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context . 
Terrorism is a violent version of an &quot; agile virtual enterprise . &quot; 
A virtual enterprise is any small group that self-assembles into an organization that is just large enough to accomplish the collective intention . 
Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative , and , in the business sector , they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well . 
A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry . 
In fact , they are probably the commercial model of the future . 
The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability . 
At present , most of the price of any product supports the huge , inefficient organization that assembled it . 
Nearly all the creativity and problem solving occurs in small companies and is later &quot; integrated &quot; by mega-corporations , which have an expensive and vulnerable infrastructure , and keep most of the profit . 
This model is the current basis of the business world , just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy . 
When you buy a car from General Motors , 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM , which mostly only manages itself . 
The small suppliers actually provide you with 80 % of the value and innovation but only receive 20 % of the reward . 
Ironically , extensive research into alternative models was funded through the US Department of Defense , which , as the world &apos;s largest buyer of complex machinery , wanted better , cheaper and more tailored goods . 
The research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies . 
Unfortunately , the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world , almost certainly because it threatened large companies . 
It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller , more agile force , using some of these same insights . 
But the planning for the Iraq invasion , in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised , suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems . 
While the forces were deployed for a flexible entry and withdrawal , the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation . 
Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation . 
Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies . 
The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public . 
These books ( and the trends they indicate ) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques . 
Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management : how to nurture and support self-organizing cells . 
Perhaps the first lesson for Western policymakers is that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust . 
Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of &quot; not us &quot; rather than on real values and direct experience . 
That is why the Bush administration &apos;s actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic . 
Bush &apos;s &quot; us and them &quot; rhetoric clearly defines an &quot; other &quot; and positions it as a cohesive enemy . 
His &quot; war &quot; approach is making it easier for Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force . 
In the future , the virtual enterprise model will shape how business is conducted , wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered . 
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production , implying faster innovation and economic growth . 
However , if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate , they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise .
