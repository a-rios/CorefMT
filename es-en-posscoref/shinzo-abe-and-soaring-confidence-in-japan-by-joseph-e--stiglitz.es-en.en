The Promise of Abenomics 
TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s program for his country &apos;s economic recovery has led to a surge in domestic confidence . 
But to what extent can &quot; Abenomics &quot; claim credit ? 
Interestingly , a closer look at Japan &apos;s performance over the past decade suggests little reason for persistent bearish sentiment . 
Indeed , in terms of growth of output per employed worker , Japan has done quite well since the turn of the century . 
With a shrinking labor force , the standard estimate for Japan in 2012 - that is , before Abenomics - had output per employed worker growing by 3.08 % year on year . 
That is considerably more robust than in the United States , where output per worker grew by just 0.37 % last year , and much stronger than in Germany , where it shrank by 0.25 % . 
Nonetheless , as many Japanese rightly sense , Abenomics can only help the country &apos;s recovery . 
Abe is doing what many economists ( including me ) have been calling for in the US and Europe : a comprehensive program entailing monetary , fiscal , and structural policies . 
Abe likens this approach to holding three arrows - taken alone , each can be bent ; taken together , none can . 
The new governor of the Bank of Japan , Haruhiko Kuroda , comes with a wealth of experience gained in the finance ministry , and then as President of the Asian Development Bank . 
During the East Asia crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s , he saw firsthand the failure of the conventional wisdom pushed by the US Treasury and the International Monetary Fund . 
Not wedded to central bankers &quot; obsolete doctrines , he has made a commitment to reverse Japan &apos;s chronic deflation , setting an inflation target of 2 % . 
Deflation increases the real ( inflation-adjusted ) debt burden , as well as the real interest rate . 
Though there is little evidence of the importance of small changes in real interest rates , the effect of even mild deflation on real debt , year after year , can be significant . 
Kuroda &apos;s stance has already weakened the yen &apos;s exchange rate , making Japanese goods more competitive . 
This simply reflects the reality of monetary-policy interdependence : if the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of so-called quantitative easing weakens the dollar , others have to respond to prevent undue appreciation of their currencies . 
Someday , we might achieve closer global monetary-policy coordination ; for now , however , it made sense for Japan to respond , albeit belatedly , to developments elsewhere . 
Monetary policy would have been more effective in the US had more attention been devoted to credit blockages - for example , many homeowners &quot; refinancing problems , even at lower interest rates , or small and medium-size enterprises &quot; lack of access to financing . 
Japan &apos;s monetary policy , one hopes , will focus on such critical issues . 
But Abe has two more arrows in his policy quiver . 
Critics who argue that fiscal stimulus in Japan failed in the past - leading only to squandered investment in useless infrastructure - make two mistakes . 
First , there is the counterfactual case : How would Japan &apos;s economy have performed in the absence of fiscal stimulus ? 
Given the magnitude of the contraction in credit supply following the financial crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s , it is no surprise that government spending failed to restore growth . 
Matters would have been much worse without the spending ; as it was , unemployment never surpassed 5.8 % , and , in throes of the global financial crisis , it peaked at 5.5 % . 
Second , anyone visiting Japan recognizes the benefits of its infrastructure investments ( America could learn a valuable lesson here ) . 
The real challenge will be in designing the third arrow , what Abe refers to as &quot; growth . &quot; 
This includes policies aimed at restructuring the economy , improving productivity , and increasing labor-force participation , especially by women . 
Some talk about &quot; deregulation &quot; - a word that has rightly fallen into disrepute following the global financial crisis . 
In fact , it would be a mistake for Japan to roll back its environmental regulations , or its health and safety regulations . 
What is needed is the right regulation . 
In some areas , more active government involvement will be needed to ensure more effective competition . 
But many areas in which reform is needed , such as hiring practices , require change in private-sector conventions , not government regulations . 
Abe can only set the tone , not dictate outcomes . 
For example , he has asked firms to increase their workers &quot; wages , and many firms are planning to provide a larger bonus than usual at the end of the fiscal year in March . 
Government efforts to increase productivity in the service sector probably will be particularly important . 
For example , Japan is in a good position to exploit synergies between an improved health-care sector and its world-class manufacturing capabilities , in the development of medical instrumentation . 
Family policies , together with changes in corporate labor practices , can reinforce changing mores , leading to greater ( and more effective ) female labor-force participation . 
While Japanese students rank high in international comparisons , a widespread lack of command of English , the lingua franca of international commerce and science , puts Japan at a disadvantage in the global marketplace . 
Further investments in research and education are likely to pay high dividends . 
There is every reason to believe that Japan &apos;s strategy for rejuvenating its economy will succeed : the country benefits from strong institutions , has a well-educated labor force with superb technical skills and design sensibilities , and is located in the world &apos;s most ( only ? ) dynamic region . 
It suffers from less inequality than many advanced industrial countries ( though more than Canada and the northern European countries ) , and it has had a longer-standing commitment to environment preservation . 
If the comprehensive agenda that Abe has laid out is executed well , today &apos;s growing confidence will be vindicated . 
Indeed , Japan could become one of the few rays of light in an otherwise gloomy advanced-country landscape .
