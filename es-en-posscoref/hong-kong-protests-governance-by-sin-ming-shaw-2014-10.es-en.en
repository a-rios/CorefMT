China &apos;s Hong Kong Follies 
HONG KONG - The massive public demonstrations by students and young members of the middle-class that have roiled Hong Kong in recent weeks are ostensibly demands for democracy . 
But they actually reflect frustration among a population that has been poorly governed by a succession of leaders picked by China &apos;s central government more for their loyalty than their competence . 
In fact , the current near-uprising is the culmination of a long series of demonstrations since Hong Kong &apos;s handover from the United Kingdom to China in 1997 , after Chris Patten , the last British governor failed to persuade China to allow Hong Kong to establish a genuine democratic government . 
In China &apos;s view , Patten &apos;s position was hypocritical , even offensive , given that the British had ruled Hong Kong autocratically . 
China believed that it could easily manage the same kind of &quot; executive-led &quot; government that had served Hong Kong well for 150 years under the British . 
In order to placate Hong Kong &apos;s restive population - which included many refugees from China - a &quot; one country , two systems &quot; policy was embedded in the region &apos;s constitution , promising Hong Kong &quot; a high degree of autonomy , &quot; except in foreign and defense affairs for 50 years . 
Indeed , Hong Kong enjoys many freedoms that the rest of China lacks , including a judiciary system that is guided by British common law and independent from the executive branch . 
China has yet to follow through on its second promise : that Hong Kong would elect its chief executive by &quot; universal suffrage &quot; by 2017 . 
Instead , a committee - initially comprising 800 members , but since expanded to 1,200 - selects the chief executive in accordance with the Chinese government &apos;s wishes . 
Hong Kong &apos;s first chief executive , Tung Chee-hwa , was widely viewed as a wise choice . 
The Western-educated heir to a shipping fortune , and unusually well connected with the global elite , Tung was thought to be a conservative , thoughtful , cosmopolitan man imbued with liberal values and free of ties to the powerful families that dominated the real-estate industry in the territory . 
This perception could not have been more wrong . 
Tung turned out to be shallow , radical in his views , more chauvinist than China &apos;s top leaders , and prone to rash decision-making on important policies with wide-ranging social and economic consequences . 
He forced out his competent chief secretary , Anson Chan , a veteran Hong Kong civil servant , for her colonial background , thereby signaling his mistrust of the entire civil service that the British had created . 
It did not take long for Hong Kongers to realize that their new leader harbored a deep - and deeply flawed - &quot; patriotic &quot; worldview that regarded Western &quot; values &quot; as unsuitable for Hong Kong , the first globalized Chinese city in modern history . 
But it was not until Tung tried to ram through draconian internal-security legislation that many of Hong Kong &apos;s citizens began to feel that they were being overtaken by the repressive governance from which they were supposed to be exempt . 
Under Tung &apos;s leadership , mass protests became a frequent sight in Hong Kong . 
The Chinese government also belatedly recognized that Tung was a liability . 
In 2004 , then-Chinese President Hu Jintao unceremoniously dressed down Tung on live television . 
Three months later , Tung resigned for &quot; health reasons &quot; and was elected Vice Chairman of the largely symbolic Chinese People &apos;s Political Consultative Conference . 
Tung &apos;s successor , Donald Tsang , was chosen reluctantly . 
But he was a senior civil servant , and seemed to be the only technocrat who could credibly hold together Hong Kong &apos;s disaffected civil service , which China knew was indispensable to governing the territory , regardless of its British heritage . 
But Tsang brought his own weaknesses to Hong Kong &apos;s government - most notably , greed . 
Tsang , who enjoyed spending time with the wealthy on their yachts and in their private suites , pursued a restrictive land policy that boosted real-estate values - and thus the wealth of the land-owning tycoons . 
Prices rose so high , however , that real estate became accessible only to the very well-off , such as the families of high officials from the mainland . 
This kind of corrupt behavior earned Tsang a disgraceful exit from government . 
Next came Leung Chun-ying , the current governor . 
Leung - who was not China &apos;s first choice for the position - inherited a mess . 
But he did not do himself any favors with his cabinet choices , many of whom had mediocre records that indicated corruptibility . 
One of them , Paul Chan Mo-po , was tasked with managing Hong Kong &apos;s land-supply policy , despite a history of corruption in his personal property transactions . 
Worse , Leung pushed forward an unpopular plan to introduce &quot; patriotic education &quot; to Hong Kong , stoking fear among students of a China-dictated brainwashing . 
After the failure of three consecutive Chinese-selected leaders to address Hong Kong &apos;s concerns , it is no wonder that Hong Kong &apos;s citizens are increasingly seeking to loosen China &apos;s grip on their government . 
But , for the Chinese authorities , this movement reflects an unacceptable challenge to China &apos;s sovereignty . 
In this sense , Hong Kong is locked in a vicious circle - and it is up to China &apos;s government to break it . 
The fact is that Hong Kong &apos;s citizens understand that they need China , and they have no interest in subverting the central government - nor do they have the power to do so . 
Their demands for democracy are simply calls for good governance . 
They believe that free and fair elections represent their best chance of having a competent leader - someone like Patten , China &apos;s former nemesis , who is remembered fondly in Hong Kong . 
China &apos;s government is doing itself a disservice by demanding that Hong Kong &apos;s citizens bow before their sovereign , while blaming &quot; outside hostile forces &quot; for spurring some kind of unconstitutional rebellion . 
Instead , it should focus on the problems created by the chief executives that it chose for the wrong reasons , and it should resolve the underlying governance problems that the demonstrations reflect .
