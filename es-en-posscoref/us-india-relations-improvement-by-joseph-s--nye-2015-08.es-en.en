The Great Democracies &quot; New Harmony 
CAMBRIDGE - When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited US President Barack Obama to attend his country &apos;s Republic Day ceremonies earlier this year , it signaled an important change in relations between the world &apos;s two biggest democracies . 
Ever since the 1990s , three American administrations have tried to improve bilateral relations , with mixed results . 
While annual trade between the countries has soared during this period , from $ 20 billion to more than $ 100 billion , annual US-China trade is worth six times more , and the political relationship has had ups and downs . 
The two countries have a long history of confusing each other . 
By definition , any alliance with a superpower is unequal ; so efforts to establish close ties with the United States have long run up against India &apos;s tradition of strategic autonomy . 
On the contrary , India &apos;s success is an important US interest , and several factors promise a brighter future for the bilateral relationship . 
The most important factor is the acceleration in India &apos;s economic growth , which the International Monetary Fund projects will exceed 7.5 % through 2020 . 
For decades , India suffered from what some called the &quot; Hindu rate of economic growth &quot; : a little more than 1 % per year . 
It might more properly have been called a 1930s British socialist rate of growth . 
After independence in 1947 , India adopted an inward-looking planning system that focused on heavy industry . 
Market-oriented reforms in the early 1990s changed that pattern , and annual growth accelerated to 7 % under the Congress party , before slumping to 5 % . 
Since the 2014 general election brought Modi &apos;s Bharatiya Janata Party to power , the government has reversed the slowdown . 
And prospects for continued growth are strong . 
India has an emerging middle class of several hundred million , and English is an official language spoken by some 50 to 100 million . 
Building on that base , Indian information industries are able to play a major global role . 
Moreover , with a population of 1.2 billion people , India is four times larger than the US , and likely to surpass China by 2025 . 
Its sheer scale will be increasingly important not only to the global economy , but also to balancing China &apos;s influence in Asia and managing global issues such as climate change , public health , and cyber security . 
India also has significant military power , with an estimated 90-100 nuclear weapons , intermediate-range missiles , 1.3 million military personnel , and annual military expenditure of nearly $ 50 billion ( 3 % of the world total ) . 
Bollywood produces more films every year than any other country , out-competing Hollywood in parts of Asia and the Middle East . 
But one should not underestimate India &apos;s problems . 
Population alone is not a source of power unless those human resources are developed , and India has lagged well behind China in terms of literacy and economic growth . 
Despite its progress , around a third of India &apos;s population lives in conditions of acute poverty , making the country home to a third of the world &apos;s poor . 
India &apos;s $ 2 trillion GDP is only a fifth of China &apos;s $ 10 trillion , and a ninth of America &apos;s $ 17.5 trillion ( measured at market exchange rates ) . 
Likewise , India &apos;s annual per capita income of $ 1,760 is just one-fifth that of China . 
Even more striking , while 95 % of the Chinese population is literate , the proportion for India is only 74 % - and only 65 % for women . 
A symptom of this problem is India &apos;s poor performance in international comparisons of universities , with none ranked among the world &apos;s top 100 . 
India &apos;s high-tech exports are only 5 % of its total exports compared to 30 % for China . 
India is unlikely to develop the power to become a global challenger to the US in the first half of this century . 
Indeed , even in terms of soft power , a recent study by the Portland Consultancy in London placed India outside the top 30 countries . 
China ranked 30th , and the US came in third , behind the United Kingdom and Germany . 
Nonetheless , India has considerable assets that already affect the balance of power in Asia . 
While India and China signed agreements in 1993 and 1996 that promised a peaceful settlement of the border dispute that led them to war in l962 , the issue has heated up again , following Chinese actions in recent years . 
India and China are fellow members of the BRICS ( along with Brazil , Russia , and South Africa ) . 
While Indian officials are often discreet in public about relations with China , and wisely want bilateral trade and investment to grow , their security concerns remain acute . 
As part of the group of Asian countries that will tend to balance China , India has already begun to strengthen its diplomatic relations with Japan . 
It would be a mistake to cast the prospects for an improved US-India relationship solely in terms of China &apos;s rising power . 
Indian economic success is an American interest on its own . 
But one can predict a relationship in the coming years that will be both sui generis and stronger .
