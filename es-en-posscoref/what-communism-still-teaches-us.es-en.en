What Communism Still Teaches Us 
PRAGUE - The fifteenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution on November 17 , 1989 , which brought an end to 41 years of communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia , is an opportunity to ponder the meaning of moral behavior and free action . 
Today we live in a democratic society , but many people - not only in the Czech Republic - still believe that they are not true masters of their destiny . 
They have lost faith that they can really influence political developments , much less influence the direction in which our civilization is evolving . 
During the communist era , most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense . 
Communist leaders insisted that the system was the result of history &apos;s objective laws , which could not be challenged , and those who refused this logic were punished - just in case . 
Unfortunately , the way of thinking that supported Communist dictatorships has not disappeared entirely . 
Some politicians and pundits maintain that Communism merely collapsed under its own weight - again , owing to &quot; objective laws &quot; of history . 
Again , individual responsibility and individual actions are belittled . 
Communism , we are told , was only one of the dead ends of Western rationalism ; therefore , it was sufficient to wait passively for it to fail . 
The very same people often believe in other manifestations of inevitability , such as various supposed laws of the market and other &quot; invisible hands &quot; that direct our lives . 
As there is not much space in such thinking for individual moral action , social critics are often ridiculed as naive moralists or elitists . 
Perhaps this is one of the reasons why 15 years after the fall of Communism , we again witness political apathy . 
Democracy is increasingly seen as a mere ritual . 
In general , Western societies , it seems , are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic ethos and active citizenship . 
It is possible that what we are witnessing is a mere change of paradigm , caused by new technologies , and we have nothing to worry about . 
But perhaps the problem is deeper : global corporations , media cartels , and powerful bureaucracies are transforming political parties into organizations whose main task is no longer public service , but the protection of specific clienteles and interests . 
Politics is becoming a battleground for lobbyists ; media trivialize serious problems ; democracy often looks like a virtual game for consumers , rather than a serious business for serious citizens . 
When dreaming about a democratic future , we who were dissidents certainly had some utopian illusions , as we are well aware today . 
However , we were not mistaken when we argued that Communism was not a mere dead end of Western rationalism . 
Bureaucratization , anonymous manipulation , and emphasis on mass conformism were brought to &quot; perfection &quot; in the Communist system ; however , some of the very same threats are with us today . 
We were already certain then that if democracy is emptied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have &quot; guaranteed &quot; solutions to everything , it can be quite undemocratic . 
This is why we put so much emphasis on the moral dimension of politics and a vibrant civil society as counterweights to political parties and state institutions . 
We also dreamed about a more just international order . 
The end of the bipolar world represented a great opportunity to make the international order more humane . 
Instead , we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and , as such , is causing economic havoc as well as ecological devastation in many parts of the world . 
The fall of Communism was an opportunity to create more effective global political institutions based on democratic principles - institutions that could stop what appears to be , in its current form , the self-destructive tendency of our industrial world . 
If we do not want to be overrun by anonymous forces , the principles of freedom , equality and solidarity - the foundation of stability and prosperity in Western democracies - must start working globally . 
But , above all , it is necessary - just as it was during the Communist era - that we not lose faith in the meaning of alternative centers of thought and civic action . 
Let &apos;s not allow ourselves to be manipulated into believing that attempts to change the &quot; established &quot; order and &quot; objective &quot; laws do not make sense . 
Let &apos;s try to build a global civil society , and let &apos;s insist that politics is not just a technology of power , but needs to have a moral dimension . 
At the same time , politicians in democratic countries need to think seriously about reforms of international institutions , because we desperately need institutions capable of real global governance . 
We could start , for example , with the United Nations , which , in its current form , is a relic of the situation shortly after the end of World War II . 
It does not reflect the influence of some new regional powers , while immorally equating countries whose representatives are democratically elected and those whose representatives speak only for themselves or their juntas , at best . 
We , the Europeans , have one specific task . 
Industrial civilization , which now spans the whole world , originated in Europe . 
All of its miracles , as well as its terrifying contradictions , can be explained as consequences of an ethos that is initially European . 
Therefore , unifying Europe should set an example for the rest of the world regarding how to face the various dangers and horrors that are engulfing us today . 
Indeed , such a task - which is closely tied to the success of European integration - would be an authentic fulfillment of the European sense of global responsibility . 
And it would be a much better strategy than cheaply blaming America for the contemporary world &apos;s various problems .
