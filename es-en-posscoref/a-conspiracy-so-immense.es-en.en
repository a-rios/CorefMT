A Conspiracy So Immense 
NEW YORK - Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory ? 
Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation , documentation , and inference that takes shape - usually on the Internet - and spreads virally around the globe . 
In the process , conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse , where they were generally consigned in the past , and sometimes into the very heart of politics . 
I learned this by accident . 
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years , I found myself , in researching new developments , stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation . 
There are some major themes . 
A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting - via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations , among others - to establish a &quot; One World Government &quot; dominated by themselves rather than national governments . 
Sometimes , more folkloric details come into play , broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati , the Freemasons , Rhodes Scholars , or , as always , the Jews . 
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis . 
In literary terms , this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims . 
Historically , there tends to be the same set of themes : fearsome , uncontrolled transformative change led by educated , urbanized cosmopolitans . 
Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks - rapid urbanization , disruption of traditional family and social ties , loosening of sexual restrictions , and economic collapse - primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering . 
Similarly , the &quot; 9 / 11 Truth Movement &quot; asserts that al-Qaeda &apos;s attack on the Twin Towers was an &quot; inside job . &quot; 
In the Muslim world , there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks , and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day . 
Usually , conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking . 
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays ? 
Today &apos;s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past : rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty . 
A clearly designated &quot; enemy &quot; with an unmistakable &quot; plan &quot; is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings - or failures - of unfettered capitalism . 
And , while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational , the questions they address are often healthy , even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong . 
In seeking answers , these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities . 
Many citizens believe , rightly , that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses . 
Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding , and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut . 
Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust , setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum . 
Likewise , in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping - if not drafting - public policies , many people believe , again rightly , that their elected officials no longer represent them . 
Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces . 
Finally , even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because , in the last eight years , we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies . 
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war , using fabricated evidence to do so . 
Is it any wonder , then , that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque ? 
When even the 9 / 11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions ( because they were based on evidence derived from torture ) , is it surprising that many want a second investigation ? 
Frequently enough , it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse - pursuing such theories - who report on news that the mainstream media ignores . 
For example , it took a &quot; conspiracy theorist , &quot; Alex Jones , to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens . 
The New Yorker confirmed the story much later - without crediting the original source . 
The mainstream media &apos;s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias . 
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow . 
So even good , critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists . 
The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview , and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions . 
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia . 
In a fevered environment , without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing , citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues , as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin &apos;s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists . 
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age . 
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information , pitch stories , and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters . 
They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting , unmediated by corporate pressures . 
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism : finding good data , confirming stories with two independent sources , using quotes responsibly , and eschewing anonymity - that is , standing by their own bylines , as conventional reporters do . 
This is how citizens can be taken - and take themselves - seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation . 
In a time of official lies , healthy investigative energy should shed light , not just generate heat .
