Another Argentine History 
On top of Argentina &apos;s bestseller list is The Myths of Argentine History , Volume Two . 
In second place is The Myths of Argentine History , Volume One . 
Both , of course , are by the same author : Felipe Pigna , a 45-year-old historian . 
It is a rare event when two volumes of the same book top the Argentine bestseller list . 
Nevertheless , the same thing occurred with the first and second volumes of The Argentines , another look at our history by Jorge Lanata , one of Argentina &apos;s best known journalists . 
Argentina has been on the front pages of the world &apos;s newspapers , with stories describing an economic and social crisis born of debt default and devaluation , unemployment and widespread poverty . 
The subplot is inevitably how a Latin American country that once seemed more like Europe developed all the maladies of its Southern neighbors : a state unable to guarantee public health and education ; a growing gap between rich and poor ; the disappearance of the middle class ; and the decline of industrial capacity in favor of producing raw materials . 
All of this is undeniable , and yet the most important change in Argentina - one that occurred a few years earlier - went unnoticed . 
Argentina had been , since the end of the nineteenth century , the country of the future . 
Millions of immigrants arrived with great expectations of making a country - and making it 
In the collective imagination , this idea was expressed in the phrase , &quot; The country that we all deserve . &quot; 
The immigrants would raise a new generation of doctors , lawyers , and engineers . 
For the individual , Argentina embodied the dream that one &apos;s children would live better - and their children even better . 
This idea of promise and progress was central to Argentines . 
It was the basis for Argentina , the paradigm for our lives and our way of living . 
It lasted for nearly a century , until the early 1980 &quot; s . 
Since then , not even campaigning politicians have dared to promise a prosperous future . 
Slowly , many parents began to accept the fact that their children would be worse off . 
The notion of Argentina as a country with infinite promise became a 
We lost our organizing principle and no other idea has replaced it . 
We no longer have a guide , an idea of how to think about our country , how to understand it and how to imagine who we are and who we can become . 
Argentina has become a country without direction . 
It hasn &apos;t been easy living without knowing who we are , and it became even more difficult to live this way as we watched our world crumble . 
This absence of animating purpose , of faith in the future , has made us hungry for our past . 
Faced with the loss of the nation &apos;s central idea and desperately in search of a new one , millions of Argentines have become interested in their history . 
These books tell our history in an odd way . 
To begin with , they reject all academic conventions , such as footnotes , graphics , or judicious explanations in favor of agreeable journalistic narratives pitched to a mass audience . 
They appeal , above all , to the logic of popular suspicion that perhaps becomes inevitable when a proud nation is suddenly laid low : Pigna , like Lanata , presents a history full of conspiracy , lies , treason , and corruption . 
Both books apply to the past the lens that Argentines are accustomed to using when they look at the present : the lens of the press . 
If these books can be read as developing a new idea of Argentina , it is the idea that there is little to trust , that everything is fraudulent , and that leeriness must be our worldview . 
This is an interesting view - and perhaps a necessary one - but it is also dangerous . 
The process of developing and coming to terms with a new national idea cannot begin and end with a rejection of the very concept . 
Argentina &apos;s ongoing search is an untold , fascinating story of how we Argentines imagine and define who we want to be in the next decades . 
In an uncertain age , whoever defines us first , whether a politician , an artist , or an intellectual , will merit a prominent place in our history .
