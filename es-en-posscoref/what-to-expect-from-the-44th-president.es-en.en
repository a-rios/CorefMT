What to Expect From the 44th President 
NEW YORK - Campaigns , be they political or military , are waged to be won , and the current American presidential campaign is no exception . 
The Democratic and Republican candidates are doing all they can to distinguish themselves from an unpopular incumbent president and from one another in the remaining weeks before Americans vote . 
For good reason , much attention is focused on foreign policy differences between the two nominees , which in many areas are both obvious and considerable . 
Still , it is possible to discern some similarities between them , in part because some of their disagreements are not as pronounced as they seem , and in part because the constraints that the next president of the United States will face are certain to limit what either man could do in office . 
Consider Iraq , the most divisive issue in American politics for the past five years . 
Barack Obama regularly points out that the decision to go to war was deeply flawed ; 
John McCain emphasizes how much things have turned around since early 2007 , when US troop numbers were increased and US strategy revised . 
Observers could be forgiven for thinking that they are speaking about two entirely different conflicts . 
But what about the future ? 
No matter who wins this November , it is clear that Iraq will not dominate US foreign policy in the years ahead to anything near the degree that it has in recent years . 
We are entering the post-Iraq era of American foreign policy . 
Consistent with this , the US military presence is decreasing . 
Where the two candidates differ is on the timing and pace of this drawdown , not on its general direction . 
By contrast , the US commitment to Afghanistan will increase , and troop levels will climb . 
Behind this prediction is a widely shared assessment that the trends in Afghanistan ( unlike in Iraq ) are negative , and that the US must strengthen its military presence there and revise its strategy if the Taliban are not to gain the upper hand . 
It is also widely understood that Pakistan has become part of the problem . 
Pakistan &apos;s western reaches are now a sanctuary for militias and terrorists that are moving in and out of Afghanistan . 
Here , Barack Obama appears more willing to have the US launch unilateral military raids against terrorists should the opportunity arise . 
But whoever is elected will confront difficult choices if a nuclear-armed Pakistan remains unable or unwilling to act as an American partner and meet its responsibilities in the effort against terrorism . 
A third area of some consensus ( and some distance from George W. Bush ) is climate change . 
Under the next president , the US will no longer be a drag on international efforts to create a global regime that sets a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions . 
One result of this likely evolution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries , particularly China and India , to accept some limits on their own economic behavior . 
A President McCain or Obama will take steps to improve America &apos;s image in the world . 
One of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture . 
Also to be expected early on is a decision to close the facility at Guant√°namo Bay , where terrorism suspects have been held for years without trial . 
Iran is another area where the differences - at least initially - may not be as sharp as the campaign suggests . 
Both candidates have stressed that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be unacceptable . 
The victor will almost surely endorse a new diplomatic initiative aimed at ending Iran &apos;s independent ability to enrich uranium . 
Less clear are the details of such an initiative , or what the US would do if it were to fail . 
The candidates &quot; statements on Iran do suggest two different philosophies of diplomacy . 
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy , to be employed as one of many tools . 
McCain appears to embrace the view that such meetings are something of a reward , to be offered when preconditions are met ( Iran comes to mind ) and withdrawn when certain lines are crossed , as Russia was judged to have done this August in Georgia . 
Despite such differences , either would carry out policies closer to those of Bush &apos;s second term than his first . 
With a strained military and a struggling economy , the next president will often have little choice other than to talk . 
On other issues , such as trade , there are distinctions between the candidates . 
McCain is a stronger advocate of free trade than Obama is . 
But this difference may have less impact than meets the eye . 
Congress plays a large role in trade policy , and the near certainty that the Democratic Party &apos;s majority in Congress will grow after the election means that protectionism will grow as well . 
Difficult economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade pacts , despite the current importance of export-oriented firms for the American economy . 
There are real and important differences between the two candidates when it comes to how they would approach the world . 
But there are also more similarities than might be evident from the debates and the campaign . 
Aspects of the next president &apos;s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is .
