New Directions for the UN 
NEW YORK - The United Nations today leads what seems at times like a double life . 
On the one hand , pundits criticize it for not solving all the world &apos;s ills . 
On the other hand , UN member states and people around the world are asking it to do more , in more places , than ever before - a trend that will continue in 2011 . 
It is not hard to see why . 
We have only to read the newspaper , turn on the television , or go online to appreciate the sheer scale of the need . 
Conflicts rage in too many places . 
Natural disasters strike with greater fury , and in greater numbers , than ever before . 
On top of all this , we face a new generation of threats , unlike any in history , which spill across borders and have global reach . 
No single country or group , however powerful , can deal with them alone . 
All must work together - in common cause for common solutions - to address challenges like climate change , poverty , and nuclear disarmament . 
But there is profound skepticism that we can do so . 
The world looks to the UN as never before , yet the conventional wisdom is that we are not up to the job . 
The problems are too complicated . 
Resources are too few . 
The UN itself appears too divided to make the vital difference . 
The conventional wisdom is , however , wrong ; worse , it is dangerous , for we have all seen how quickly it can take hold , distort reality , and then harden like cement . 
For example , four years ago , when I came to office , only a handful of global leaders knew enough even to talk about climate change - the defining challenge of our times , whose effects we see every day , all around us . 
Today , we have moved climate change to the top of the global agenda . 
But make no mistake : it has been a difficult road . 
In December 2009 in Copenhagen , world leaders talked far into the night , and emerged , according to the conventional wisdom , with virtually nothing . 
In fact , though we did not get a comprehensive , legally binding treaty that would usher in an era of sustainable , low-carbon prosperity , as we had hoped , there were significant achievements in Copenhagen . 
For the first time ever , developed and developing countries acknowledged their responsibility to curb emissions of greenhouse gasses and agreed on the goal of limiting global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius . 
And , for the first time ever , countries made large pledges to finance mitigation and adaptation efforts : $ 30 billion over the next three years for fast-start financing , and $ 100 billion per year by 2020 . 
The lesson is that we should not dream of overnight breakthroughs , or allow ourselves to fall into despair in the absence of immediate progress . 
Let us work , instead , to build on many smaller advances , wherever we can make them - by mobilizing support , creating broad alliances , building coalitions , and taking into account a web of moving parts and complex issues - because that will set the stage for the eventual breakthroughs of tomorrow . 
Collective action has never been easy , but it has never been more necessary than in achieving the UN &apos;s Millennium Development Goals - the world &apos;s blueprint for ending extreme poverty . 
The conventional wisdom will tell you that the MDGs targets - reducing poverty and hunger , improving the health of mothers and children , combating HIV / AIDS , increasing access to education , protecting the environment , and forging a global partnership for development - are simply unattainable . 
In fact , we are controlling disease - polio , malaria , and AIDS - better than ever before , and making big new investments in women &apos;s and children &apos;s health - the key to progress in many other areas . 
Nevertheless , on climate change , poverty , and other issues , the conventional wisdom is that the UN should cede responsibility to the G-20 . 
Despite strenuous debate about currency issues and trade imbalances at its summit in Seoul in November , the sole area of agreement concerned an issue on the G-20 &quot; s agenda for the first time - economic development . 
Recognizing that global recovery depends on the emerging economies - that is , the developing world - G-20 leaders embraced investments aimed at lifting the world &apos;s most vulnerable people out of poverty . 
That is why G-20 leaders accept the need to work closely with the UN - after all , no organization does development better . 
The G-20 and the UN are finding new ways to work constructively together - not as rivals , but as increasingly close partners . 
And that is the way it should be . 
Forty years ago , a great American statesman , Dean Acheson , looked back at the excitement he felt in helping to build the post-World War II order . 
&quot; Present at the Creation , &quot; he called his memoir . 
Today , we find ourselves at an equally exciting moment , no less critical to the future of humankind . 
We , too , are present at a new creation . 
We must evolve and keep pace with a rapidly changing world . 
We must be faster and more flexible , efficient , transparent , and accountable . 
In an age of austerity , resources are precious ; we must make every dollar count . 
These are testing times for everyone . 
People everywhere live in growing anxiety and fear . 
There is near-universal loss of trust in institutions and leaders . 
Amid such uncertainty , our future depends on a UN that brings together the countries of the world not only to talk and debate , but also to agree and to act ; that mobilizes civil society , business , philanthropists , and ordinary citizens to help the world &apos;s governments solve current problems ; and that delivers peace , development , human rights , and global public goods - in a word , hope - to people around the world every day .
