Europe &apos;s Year of Indecision 
NEW YORK - The dire economic situation in which most of the rich world found itself in 2011 was not merely the result of impersonal economic forces , but was largely created by the policies pursued , or not pursued , by world leaders . 
Indeed , the remarkable unanimity that prevailed in the first phase of the financial crisis that began in 2008 , and which culminated in the $ 1 trillion rescue package put together for the London G-20 meeting in April 2009 , dissipated long ago . 
Now , bureaucratic infighting and misconceptions are rampant . 
Worse still , policy disagreements are playing out more or less along national lines . 
The center of fiscal conservatism is Germany , while Anglo-Saxon countries are still drawn to John Maynard Keynes . 
This division is complicating matters enormously , because close international cooperation is needed to correct the global imbalances that remain at the root of the crisis . 
Doubts about sovereign debt in Europe have revolved around the euro to such an extent that some now question whether the single currency can survive . 
But the euro was an incomplete currency from the outset . 
The Maastricht Treaty established a monetary union without a political union - a common central bank , but no common treasury . 
Its architects were aware of this deficiency , but other flaws in their design became apparent only after the crash of 2008 . 
The euro was built on the assumption that markets correct their own excesses , and that imbalances arise only in the public sector . 
As it happened , some of the largest imbalances that fueled the current crisis arose in the private sector - and the euro &apos;s introduction was indirectly responsible . 
In particular , sovereign debt in the eurozone was deemed riskless : banks had only to hold minimal reserves against member countries &quot; bonds , which the European Central Bank accepted on equal terms at its discount window . 
Member countries could borrow at practically the same interest rate as Germany , and banks were happy to earn a few extra pennies by loading up their balance sheets with the government debt of the eurozone &apos;s weaker economies . 
For example , European banks hold more than a â‚¬ 1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) of Spanish debt , with German and French banks holding more than half of that sum . 
Instead of the convergence prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty , the radical narrowing of interest-rate differentials generated divergences in economic performance . 
Countries like Spain , Greece , and Ireland developed real-estate bubbles , grew faster , and developed trade deficits with the rest of the eurozone , while Germany - weighed down by the costs of reunification - reined in its labor costs , became more competitive and developed a chronic trade surplus . 
The convergence of interest rates was broken when a newly elected government in Greece revealed that the deficit incurred by the previous government was much larger than had been reported . 
European authorities were slow to react , because member countries held radically different views . 
Germany , traumatized by runaway inflation in the 1920 &quot; s , and its dreadful political consequences , adamantly opposed any bailout . 
Moreover , it was heading into an election cycle , which increased the rigidity of its position . 
With German leaders insisting on charging penalty rates for providing assistance , the crisis festered - and the rescue costs continued to grow . 
Indeed , as eurozone members &quot; inability to print their own money effectively relegated them to the status of less-developed countries that must borrow in a foreign currency , risk premiums widened accordingly . 
The authorities , seeing no solution , kicked the can down the road - an approach that usually works , because problems become easier to solve when markets calm down . 
But , in this case , the crisis kept growing bigger , and the authorities ran out of road when Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court ruled out additional guarantees beyond the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) without the consent of the Bundestag . 
At the European Union &apos;s December 9 summit in Brussels , the eurozone countries agreed to establish a closer fiscal union . 
But , by the time this decision was taken , it was no longer sufficient to bring the financial crisis under control . 
The measures introduced by the ECB went a long way toward relieving banks &quot; liquidity problems , but nothing was done to reduce the large risk premiums on government bonds . 
Because the premiums are intimately interconnected with the banks &quot; capital deficiencies , half a solution is not good enough . 
Unless the sovereign debt of the rest of the eurozone is successively ring-fenced , a Greek default could cause a meltdown of the global financial system . 
Even barring such a nightmare scenario in 2012 , the summit sowed the seeds of future conflicts - over the emergence of a &quot; two-speed &quot; Europe and the false economic doctrine guiding the eurozone &apos;s proposed fiscal pact . 
That doctrine , by imposing austerity in a period of rising unemployment , threatens to push the eurozone into a vicious deflationary debt spiral from which it will be difficult to escape .
