The Spying Game 
MELBOURNE - Thanks to Edward Snowden , I now know that the US National Security Agency is spying on me . 
It uses Google , Facebook , Verizon , and other Internet and communications companies to collect vast amounts of digital information , no doubt including data about my emails , cellphone calls , and credit card usage . 
I am not a United States citizen , so it &apos;s all perfectly legal . 
And , even if I were a US citizen , it is possible that a lot of information about me would have been swept up anyway , though it may not have been the direct target of the surveillance operation . 
Should I be outraged at this intrusion on my privacy ? 
Has the world of George Orwell &apos;s 1984 finally arrived , three decades late ? 
Is Big Brother watching me ? 
I don &apos;t feel outraged . 
Based on what I know so far , I don &apos;t really care . 
No one is likely to be reading my emails or listening in on my Skype calls . 
The volume of digital information that the NSA gathers would make that an impossible task . 
Instead , computer programs mine the data for patterns of suspicious activity that intelligence analysts hope will lead them to terrorists . 
The process is not all that different from the data collection and analysis that many corporations use to target their ads at us more effectively , or that give us the online search results that we are most likely to want . 
The question is not what information a government , or business , gathers , but what they do with it . 
I would be outraged if there were evidence that - for example - the US government was using the private information that it scoops up to blackmail foreign politicians into serving US interests , or if such information were leaked to newspapers in an effort to smear critics of US policies . 
That would be a real scandal . 
If , however , nothing of that sort has happened , and if there are effective safeguards in place to ensure that it does not happen , then the remaining question is whether this huge data-gathering effort really does protect us against terrorism , and whether we are getting value for money from it . 
The NSA claims that communications surveillance has prevented more than 50 terrorist attacks since 2001 . 
I don &apos;t know how to evaluate that claim , or whether we could have prevented those attacks in other ways . 
The value-for-money question is even more difficult to assess . 
In 2010 , the Washington Post produced a major report on &quot; Top Secret America . &quot; 
After a two-year investigation involving more than a dozen journalists , the Post concluded that no one knows how much US intelligence operations cost - or even how many people American intelligence agencies employ . 
At the time , the Post reported that 854,000 people held &quot; top secret &quot; security clearances . 
Now that figure is reported to be 1.4 million . 
( The sheer number of people does make one wonder whether misuse of personal data for blackmail or other private purposes is inevitable . ) 
Whatever we think of the NSA surveillance program itself , the US government has clearly overreacted to the release of information about it . 
Most extraordinary of all , it seems that the US was behind the apparent refusal of France , Spain , Italy , and Portugal to permit Bolivian President Evo Morales &apos;s airplane to enter their airspace en route home from Moscow , on the grounds that Snowden might have been aboard . 
Morales had to land in Vienna , and Latin American leaders were furious at what they took to be an insult to their dignity . 
Supporters of democracy ought to think long and hard before prosecuting people like Julian Assange , Bradley Manning , and Snowden . 
If we think that democracy is a good thing , then we must believe that the public should know as much as possible about what the government it elects is doing . 
Snowden has said that he made the disclosures because &quot; the public needs to decide whether these programs and policies are right or wrong . &quot; 
He &apos;s right about that . 
How can a democracy determine whether there should be government surveillance of the kind that the NSA is conducting if it has no idea that such programs exist ? 
Indeed , Snowden &apos;s leaks also revealed that National Intelligence Director James Clapper misled the US Congress about the NSA &apos;s surveillance practices in his testimony at a hearing held in March by the Senate Intelligence Committee . 
When the Washington Post published ( along with The Guardian ) the information that Snowden provided , it asked Americans whether they support or oppose the NSA &apos;s intelligence-gathering program . 
Some 58 % of those surveyed supported it . 
The poll also indicated 65 % support for public hearings by the US Congress on the NSA surveillance program . 
If that happens , we will all be much better informed because of Snowden &apos;s disclosures .
