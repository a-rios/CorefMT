Fatal Thaws 
MOSCOW - During the Cold War , the Soviet Union and , in a milder way , the United States imposed external limits on the activities of states and societies , causing longstanding conflicts among smaller countries to be &quot; frozen . &quot; 
Following the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in the 1990 &quot; s , those conflicts began to &quot; unfreeze . &quot; 
With interethnic tensions already on the rise , Yugoslavia was the first country to dissolve into conflict . 
Soon after , war broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan , followed by fighting in Transdniestria and Chechnya . 
While some conflicts were addressed - the West finally intervened militarily in the former Yugoslavia ; and Russia fought in Chechnya for almost a decade , and imposed peace in Transdniestria - others , such as that between Armenia and Azerbaijan , were simply frozen again . 
Fortunately , not all potential conflicts erupted . 
The Soviet Union did not dissolve into violence , as most other empires have - an outcome for which no explanation short of divine intervention or sheer luck seems to suffice . 
Despite rising nationalist sentiments and mutual suspicions , Central and Eastern European countries also managed to avoid conflict , thanks to their rapid acceptance into NATO and the European Union . 
At that point , the world breathed a collective sigh of relief . 
But , in the early 2000 &quot; s , globalization triggered the &quot; second unfreezing &quot; by facilitating rapid economic growth in Asian countries that , for two centuries , had been constrained by Western dominance , Cold War rules and institutions , and rampant poverty . 
With thriving economies came increased strategic clout , leading to the rise of regional geopolitics shaped by national interests and fears , rather than by external forces . 
The West &apos;s failures in Iraq and Afghanistan , followed by the global economic crisis ( which exposed severe structural weaknesses in the US and the EU that their democratic governments have been unable to resolve ) , accelerated this process . 
As a result , Europe has practically abandoned its global geopolitical role , with virtually no evidence of its presence , aside from trade , remaining in East Asia . 
Although the US has retained considerable influence , the combination of structural economic problems , a divided elite , and two de facto military defeats has impeded its ability to exercise that power . 
Old alliances - such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization , the Central Eastern Treaty Organization , and the Australia , New Zealand , United States Security Treaty - have died or are dying . And forming new alliances has proved difficult , with India rejecting what the US , with uncharacteristic humility , has proposed . 
East and South Asia are embroiled in an arms race , mainly at sea . 
Everyone is afraid of China , which remains relatively peaceable , but no longer bothers to conceal its growing military capacity . 
With no pan-Asian security architecture expected to emerge in the near future , the West &apos;s departure from the region is generating a security vacuum . 
Furthermore , in the Greater Middle East , the fall of one secular dictatorship after another , coupled with the loosening of external control , has incited new - and rekindled old - suspicions , religious disagreements , and mistrust of outsiders in general and the West in particular . 
As a result , the region has entered a period of conflict , social degradation , rising nationalism , and growing religious fanaticism . 
Most threatening , however , is the possibility that the EU could collapse , triggering a third unfreezing . 
The EU , established to break the destructive cycle of European nationalism that had facilitated the rise of two totalitarian systems and caused two world wars , amounted to the creation of a prototype of a humane world order . 
After being its own - and thus the world &apos;s - worst enemy for centuries , Europe became a beacon of peace . 
But , resting on the laurels of the EU &apos;s founders , successive European leaders largely failed to perceive the competitive challenges posed by globalization . 
They seemed to forget that the European project &apos;s underlying motivation was political , not economic , which led them to rush into enlargement and set unrealistic goals . 
Now , they must pay for their mistakes by overhauling the entire institutional framework of the EU and the eurozone . 
At the same time , Europeans must prepare for an even more profound transformation . 
In order to regain economic competitiveness , European countries will have to abandon many of their social-welfare policies and reform their political institutions . 
Most Europeans prefer to ignore the looming challenge of radical policy reform , owing to the decline in living standards that it implies . 
Global leaders must encourage Europe to tackle its problems decisively by offering advice , financial support , and constructive criticism . 
Russia must continue to press for an Alliance of Europe - a new framework for economic and diplomatic relations among the EU , Russia , and the rest of Greater Europe - which could offer a way out of Europe &apos;s systemic crisis . 
The first unfreezing had serious consequences . 
Now , global leaders must work to minimize the fallout of the second , and use all available means to prevent a third .
