Britain &apos;s New Internationalism 
TOLEDO , SPAIN  -  
The settlement reached with North Korea , whereby it will dismantle its nuclear program , and the Annapolis conference for an Israeli-Palestinian peace - with the participation of Syria , a pivotal member of the region &apos;s &quot; axis of evil &quot; - are two key examples of this trend . 
The United States &quot; staunchest ally since 2001 , Great Britain , has already gone down this path , divorcing itself from its servile alliance with a Bush administration that focused on war and confrontation . 
Though only a miniature version of America &apos;s imperial predicament , Britain &apos;s current policy , as its new prime minister , Gordon Brown , is defining it , may anticipate the direction taken by the next American president . 
Tony Blair &apos;s endorsement of Bush &apos;s Middle East designs showed that an imbalance of power in an alliance always causes the weaker partner to become subservient . 
Britain joined America &apos;s Iraq adventure with the same inflated perceptions of its military capacity and diplomatic clout that trapped Bush . 
But Britain &apos;s military contribution to the war effort was not indispensable , so Bush did not have to heed Blair &apos;s advice . 
As a result , Britain could not serve as a bridge between a doubtful Europe and a belligerent US , as Blair believed , and Britain &apos;s capacity to be a force for good on the world stage was severely damaged . 
Like America , Britain has learned the hard way the limits of what sheer military power can achieve , and also the devastating implications of its misuse for its reputation in the Muslim world and beyond . 
The scope and virulence of anti-British sentiment in the Muslim world are now second only to that facing the US . 
Restoring Britain &apos;s reputation in the region will take years of hard work . 
Blair &apos;s legacy has thrown Brown into a confusing oscillation between Britain &apos;s transatlantic tradition and its European connections . 
No longer an independent global power , yet unhappy with the London-Washington axis that Blair forged , Brown &apos;s government continues to waffle in its commitment to a united Europe . 
Indeed , Brown , for whom America remains &quot; Britain &apos;s most important bilateral relationship , &quot; recently blocked his foreign secretary , David Miliband , from delivering a speech that he considered excessively pro-Europe . 
But such uncertainty , common in times of transition , should not overshadow what the end of the Blair-Bush era in Britain holds in store . 
Unilateralism and pre-emptive wars are to be replaced by what Brown defines as &quot; an agenda for a hard-headed internationalism , &quot; based on cooperation with multilateral agencies and alliances - the United Nations , NATO , the European Union , and the British Commonwealth . 
The new policy seems to shift emphasis to &quot; soft power &quot; strategy aimed at projecting Britain as a global economic and cultural hub . 
The City of London , the British Council , Oxfam , and the BBC are now expected to restore the prominence of Britain &apos;s enduring values . 
Conspicuously , it is no longer the British , but France &apos;s government under President Nicolas Sarkozy , that is carrying the torch of a possible attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
But , for Brown &apos;s policy to succeed , it must promote social change and political reform in the Arab world . 
That means abandoning Blair &apos;s strategy of confronting the &quot; arc of extremism &quot; with putative &quot; moderates &quot; who , besides offering lucrative markets for arms sales , are in fact autocrats whose conduct has helped fuel the growth of radical Islam . 
The &quot; extremists &quot; versus &quot; moderates &quot; language has served only to revive colonial memories in the region and divide it even more deeply . 
Post-Blair Britain is becoming a country for which wars that lack international legitimacy can only presage defeat and moral decay . 
Of course , international legitimacy can be a vacuous concept when not backed by the capacity to use effective force . 
Now incapable of intimidating anyone , Britain has opted for developing its potential to inspire . 
Unfortunately , inspiration , too , requires the threat of effective military power to be an effective force for change . 
Notwithstanding its many setbacks in recent years , the US remains the only power capable of leading a global strategy that consists in balancing soft and hard power . 
May the next American president pursue this course .
