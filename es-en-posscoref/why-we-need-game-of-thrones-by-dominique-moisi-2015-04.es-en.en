Why We Need &quot; Game of Thrones &quot; 
PARIS - Today &apos;s popular television programs have become the equivalent of the feuilletons that began appearing in newspapers in the nineteenth century . 
Series like &quot; Game of Thrones &quot; and &quot; Downton Abbey , &quot; like Balzac and Dickens before them , serve as a source of entertainment and fodder for debate . 
In this sense , our television screenplays have emerged as key tools of social and political analysis . 
Such tools can be used to comprehend , for example , the difference between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama . 
Netanyahu is still stuck in the third season of &quot; Homeland &quot; - that is , obsessed with Iran - whereas Obama , having begun to include the renewed Russian threat in his strategic calculus , has already moved into the third season of &quot; House of Cards . &quot; 
Of course , the availability of such comparisons is rooted in what often drives a TV series &quot; popularity : its ability to hold up a mirror to a society - to reflect its anxieties and longings - and create a window through which outsiders can peer in . 
Consider &quot; Downton Abbey , &quot; a British period drama that follows the lives of the Crawley family and its servants in the family &apos;s classic country house , from 1912 to the mid-1920s . 
Why are millions of people worldwide - from Europe to the United States to Asia - so attracted to these characters ? 
Are they nostalgic for a time long past , which the show reconstitutes with exacting verisimilitude ? 
Or are they fascinated by the social dynamics that the show explores ? 
For Julian Fellowes , who created the series , the explanation lies elsewhere - in our search for order in a chaotic world . 
People feel so disoriented nowadays , he believes , that they are drawn to &quot; Downton Abbey &apos;s &quot; tidy realm , in which the setting , clearly delineated in space and time , is governed by strict rules . 
Just as the Crawley house serves as a kind of refuge for its characters , it may give its viewers a safe , predictable outlet by which to escape the tumultuous present - and avoid the unknown future . 
Similarly , the American political drama &quot; House of Cards &quot; reflects a kind of disillusionment - this time , with US politics . 
Whereas &quot; The West Wing , &quot; a popular political drama that ran from 1999 to 2006 , portrays the US presidency - held by a sophisticated , cultivated , and humanistic leader - with a kind of longing , &quot; House of Cards &quot; immerses the viewer in a murky milieu of humanity &apos;s worst impulses . 
In &quot; House of Cards , &quot; the world is not as viewers believe it should be , but as they fear it is . 
This is the opposite of the approach taken by the Danish political drama &quot; Borgen , &quot; which presents an idealized prime minister , Birgitte Nyborg . 
But the effect is similar . 
One often hears people saying that the true problem facing Denmark - and , in particular , its political class - is that Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lacks Nyborg &apos;s strengths . 
By exposing the fundamental challenges and anxieties facing a society , a TV series can , at times , almost prefigure the future . 
In France , &quot; Engrenages &quot; - sold in English under the title &quot; Spiral &quot; - explores the deep malaise of French society . 
In retrospect , the series seems to have foreshadowed the tragedies that beset the country in January . 
In particular , the fifth season , which aired in France in late 2014 , offered a clinical description of how young people in the Paris suburbs went astray , while portraying the relationship between the police and their political superiors as cynical and even combative . 
The show &apos;s dialogue could have come straight out of a real-life Parisian &quot; power lunch . &quot; 
The TV show that has emerged as the most hotly debated of our time is , without a doubt , &quot; Game of Thrones , &quot; a medieval fantasy epic based ( increasingly loosely ) on George R.R. Martin &apos;s best-selling book series A Song of Ice and Fire . 
The series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling , but also for its sustained choreography of brutal violence . 
Students of international politics , especially in Canada and the US , wonder whether the show , by stressing the role of sheer brutality , encourages a &quot; realist &quot; vision of the world . 
Could the savagery featured on &quot; Games of Thrones &quot; - including abundant beheadings , rape , and sexual torture - have helped to encourage the tactics of , say , Boko Haram and the Islamic State ? 
Or could the series - in which violence often begets more violence , but does not necessarily get the characters what they want - actually be highlighting the limits of force ? 
On a more philosophical level , the show &apos;s universe - a combination of ancient mythology and the Middle Ages - seems to capture the mixture of fascination and fear that many people nowadays feel . 
It is a fantastic , unpredictable , and devastatingly painful world - one that is so complex that even the show &apos;s most loyal viewers often are confused . 
In this sense , it is much like the world in which we live . 
Though the West has no monopoly on the production of TV series , it undoubtedly dominates the field - and thus the worldview that such shows reflect . 
Given this , one might wonder whether Chinese or Russian leaders are making time in their busy schedules to watch series such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; or &quot; Games of Thrones , &quot; in order to understand their rivals &quot; mentality . 
Leading government advisers , at least , seem to recognize the value of tuning in . 
A Chinese friend recently told me that &quot; House of Cards &quot; was very popular among China &apos;s political elite . 
They relish the reminder that politics is just as ruthless in the US as it is at home .
