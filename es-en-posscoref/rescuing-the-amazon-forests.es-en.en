Rescuing the Amazon Forests 
Developing countries are blessed with some of the world &apos;s most precious natural resources . 
But that blessing can also be a curse - and not just for oil-rich countries , with their distorted economies and politics . 
Latin American countries in the Amazon region , for example , are home to what can rightly be considered the world &apos;s storehouse of biodiversity . 
Yet , when it comes to protecting this global treasure , these countries are expected to shoulder the burden by themselves . 
Even with good intentions , these countries on their own are unlikely to ensure that the benefits of conserving the Amazon are realized , because private interests in deforestation - both legal and illegal - remain very strong . 
The prospect of quick gains from occupying publicly owned forestland induces private individuals to grab and clear as much of these areas as quickly as possible , without regard for the environmental and social impact of their behavior . 
The need to supply fuel and open land during rapid economic development had a devastating effect on European and American forests . 
Brazil , too , has in recent decades depleted much of its forestland , only at faster rates . 
Five hundred years ago , the Atlantic rainforest stretched nearly the entirety of Brazil &apos;s 8,500-kilometer coastline ; today , less than 7 % remains . 
More than 15 % of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested , most of it in the last 50 years . 
In 2003 , the Brazilian Amazon lost 23,750 square kilometers of forest - an area nearly the size of Belgium . 
The tragedy is that much of this deforestation has been entirely unnecessary from the standpoint of economic development . 
For example , since 1990 Brazil has increased grain production by 125 % , with an increase of only 24 % in cultivated area . 
But , at the same time , more than 16 million hectares of pastures and degraded land - an area half the size of Germany - have been abandoned in the Amazon alone , owing to poor agricultural practices and land use . 
With their rehabilitation , Brazil could expand agricultural production without further harm to the rainforest . 
In this and other ways , the rainforest could be harnessed to finance development and generate growth in a socially inclusive and sustainable way . 
But to achieve this , the countries and the international community need to act . 
Developing countries need to ensure reliable property rights and policy enforcement in order to generate the incentives needed to protect nature in the future . 
To its credit , the Brazilian government has revoked policies that had previously encouraged land clearing in the Amazon , and has mandated that 80 % of privately owned forestland be used only for sustainable management of forest resources . 
Brazil has also developed a sophisticated system to track and record deforestation - though monitoring an area the size of Europe with scarce resources is by itself unlikely to lead to much compliance . 
As a result , there needs to be far greater support from the international community for promising initiatives . 
Consider these examples : 
路 The partnership between the Brazilian Government , the World Wide Fund for Nature , the World Bank , and the international community has been the basis for the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program , which seeks to set aside 12 % of the Amazon for conservation . 
路 The Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforests , funded by the Brazilian government and the G7 countries , has provided $ 420 million in the past decade for alternatives to deforestation . 
Where these programs have been implemented , little deforestation has occurred . 
路 The World Bank , through a recently approved $ 505 million loan , is supporting the inclusion of environmental issues and concerns across Brazil &apos;s government ministries . 
路 The Kyoto Protocol &apos;s Clean Development Mechanism allows for the trade of carbon credits for reforestation . 
This mechanism could help establish a system to pay for the maintenance of standing forests and support policies that comprehend the Amazon &apos;s global value .
