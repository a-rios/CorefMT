An Agenda for Growth in Europe 
A recent OECD study reminds us , once again , that per capita income levels are roughly 30 % lower in the euro area , as well as in the three largest Continental countries - France , Germany , and Italy - that dominate its performance , than in the United States . 
That gap is likely to widen as Europe &apos;s demographic profile darkens , and if productivity continues to grow more slowly than elsewhere in the industrial economies . 
Why have the large European economies failed to catch up with US income levels ? 
The bulk of the shortfall is due to less intensive use of labor : employment rates for women and for the oldest and youngest age groups are lower in the euro area than in the US , working hours are far fewer , and , least significantly , unemployment rates are higher . 
Some take consolation from this , viewing it as positive that Europeans prefer leisure to work . 
These measures will need to be revisited both to increase the supply of labor and to make public finances more sustainable . 
This process is already underway , particularly in Italy and France , through cuts in social security contributions for lower-paid workers , tighter conditions for drawing unemployment benefits , and tax credits for &quot; the working poor . &quot; 
Since the mid-1990 &quot; s , the relative decline in employment in these countries has , indeed , been slightly reversed . 
But factors beyond taxes and benefits also contribute to low employment rates in all the three major euro-zone economies : high minimum wages and some features of employment protection legislation slow down the flow of workers through the job market . 
Although a long agenda of reforms is beginning to be tackled , first in Germany and , more recently and cautiously , in France , the results are slow in coming and public understanding of the need for change remains limited . 
Much can be learned from each country &apos;s experience and from that of smaller EU member states , but labor market reforms inevitably have a strong national flavor . 
Employment objectives have been formulated for all EU member states since 1997 in the so-called European Employment Strategy ( EES ) , now part of the &quot; Lisbon Agenda , &quot; the set of goals established to boost EU productivity . 
Nor is the employment gap with the US the only problem for Europe . 
Beginning in the mid-1990 &quot; s , the rate of growth in output per hour worked - a key factor behind the rise in per capita income - slowed in most European countries while it rose in the US , reversing a decades-long pattern . 
Between 2000 and 2004 , hourly labor productivity rose more than twice as fast in the US than in the large euro zone economies - 2.8 % per year versus little more than 1 % . 
So why have the Europeans been unable to sustain improvements in both foundations of growth - employment and productivity - at the same time ? 
This proved possible not only in the US , but also in other advanced economies outside Europe - Australia , Canada , and New Zealand - and , unsurprisingly , in the new EU member states . 
The explanation is not capital spending , which is normally linked to productivity growth . 
This leaves the &quot; explanation &quot; to what economists call Total Factor Productivity ( TFP ) , a mix of several important elements , including innovation activity , a well-functioning financial system ready and willing to take risks , and organizational flexibility that facilitates rapid diffusion of new technologies . 
The main lapse in TFP growth in Europe over the past decade has been in services ( excluding information and communications technologies ) . 
While product markets have held center stage in the creation of the single European market , services continue to be fragmented by national regulatory , anti-competitive practices . 
Much of the explanation lies in the very heterogeneity of services and the greater difficulties that mutual recognition , or the &quot; country-of-origin principle &quot; - essential in the integration of product markets - implies for services . 
Unfortunately , reform was derailed in 2005 . 
During the referendum campaign in France preceding the vote on the draft EU Constitutional Treaty , the proposed directive was vilified as undermining the rights of labor , symbolized by that dreaded bogeyman , the &quot; Polish plumber . &quot; 
These attacks overlooked the fact that the directive makes employment conditions of workers from other EU-member states subject in most respects to host-country rules . 
A revised version of the directive that reduces its sectoral scope and makes a number of compromises with the country-of-origin principle is now before the European Parliament . 
Even this limited version would constitute progress ; most of the gains arise from removing the red tape that complicates cross-border establishment of small and medium-size service enterprises and limits competition in broad sectors of the economy . 
It is a sad reflection on the state of the EU that it seems unable to agree on the one clear productivity-advancing piece of legislation when improving productivity is held out as a shared goal . 
The failure to mobilize consumer interests in favor of European integration is particularly disappointing for the new member states , which had expected to reap some of the benefits .
