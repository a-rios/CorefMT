China &apos;s Multilateral Financial Mobilization 
LONDON - The board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently approved China &apos;s application to join - an application a decade in the making - and sent it on to member governments for final approval . 
But EBRD membership is only one expression of China &apos;s rapidly growing role in the world &apos;s international financial institutions . 
The question now is whether China will spur change within them , or vice versa . 
The global financial crisis shook up the international financial architecture , catching many institutions off guard . 
The International Monetary Fund , for example , had actually pursued sharp downsizing in the preceding years . 
But it also allowed them to prove their mettle . 
Many of them - not least the IMF , but also the EBRD and the European Investment Bank - eventually showed that they could respond flexibly and , as a result , have gained expanded mandates and more capital . 
The crisis also undermined the legitimacy of the G-7 - the countries at the root of the problem - while invigorating the G-20 . 
Amid these transformations , China gained an opening to boost its global influence - one that it is determined to exploit , despite resistance from some corners . 
It plans to use its presidency of the G-20 in 2016 , for example , to advance an ambitious agenda . 
In fact , Chinese international engagement is now occurring on a scale and at a rate never seen before . 
China is a member of many multilateral institutions - including several regional players like the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) and the Inter-American Development Bank ( IDB ) - with which it is deepening its relationships , especially through co-investment in projects around the world . 
For example , China significantly ratcheted up its commitment to the AfDB last year through the $ 2 billion Africa Growing Together Fund . 
Similarly , China &apos;s sovereign wealth funds have served as important anchor investors in the vehicles designed by the World Bank &apos;s International Finance Corporation and the EBRD to bring long-term institutional capital into their projects . 
One of those funds , SAFE , is currently the only investor in the EBRD vehicle - and China has not even formally joined the organization yet . 
China is also forging new institutions . 
The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) captured global headlines earlier this year , not just because of strong US resistance , but also because countries like Britain and Germany joined anyway . 
China also played a leading role in the formation , with its BRICS counterparts ( Brazil , Russia , India , and South Africa ) , of the New Development Bank ( NDB ) , now headquartered in Shanghai . 
Then there is China &apos;s $ 40 billion Silk Road Fund , intended to support the infrastructure projects needed to underpin President Xi Jinping &apos;s &quot; one belt , one road &quot; strategy , which aims to improve trade and communication linkages across Eurasia . 
China &apos;s most ambitious effort to date , the Silk Road Fund dwarfs the activities of the more traditional international financial institutions , in terms of both scale and range of activities . 
The Fund &apos;s first initiative , the $ 1.65 billion Karot hydropower dam in Pakistan , will entail both direct lending to the project and equity investment in the company responsible for building the dam and managing it for 30 years . 
As it stands , the Silk Road Fund is unilateral , placing it in the same category as the China Development Bank and the state-owned investment conglomerate CITIC . 
But the Chinese authorities have said that it is open for others to join , though that seems unlikely , given the scale of the Chinese commitment . 
Despite the remarkable size of China &apos;s investment projects , the country &apos;s leaders have so far remained relatively conservative in terms of institutional innovation . 
Over the last year , however , Chinese Communist Party officials have mooted a proposal for a more experimental new multilateral financial institution geared toward &quot; restoring the environment &quot; - that is , supporting large projects aimed at land reclamation , water purification , and improvements in air quality . 
Getting such an institution off the ground will not be easy , given the need for global coordination to bring potential shareholders together and for large subsidies to make investments viable . 
But that kind of bold institutional innovation could fill an important gap in the global financial architecture , and cement China &apos;s leadership in financing environmental remediation . 
In the meantime , Chinese institutions are innovating on a smaller scale , as they spearhead a leaner and faster approach to financing . 
For example , the AIIB &apos;s inaugural president , Jin Liqun , has announced plans to eliminate some of the most inefficient features of existing institutions , like the resident board and nationality restrictions on hiring . 
Nonetheless , China &apos;s growing global financial role is not likely to change profoundly how existing institutions operate . 
Of course , as efforts like Jin &apos;s highlight the flaws in existing structures , they may help to inspire reform . 
And the EBRD can undoubtedly benefit from China &apos;s experience with experimentation and scaling up . 
But the main aim of the AIIB and the NDB seems not to be to transform the multilateral financial landscape , but to add capacity , while showing that China can build state-of-the-art institutions . 
And when it comes to the EBRD , China &apos;s stake will be tiny , at least at first ; the Chinese say they are there to learn . 
Indeed , co-investment with the EBRD can provide Chinese companies with local knowledge - and potentially even protection - as they navigate new markets . 
For now , increased engagement in multilateral institutions seems likely to change China more than it changes the institutions , even as China &apos;s voting power increases to reflect better its growing contributions . 
A closer look at the experiences of long-standing institutions - including working with civil-society groups and promoting local ownership of policies - will help China hone its strategy for engagement in Africa and elsewhere . 
It may even enable China to improve its own development model . 
In the longer term , however , the development challenges that China faces at home - particularly rapid environmental deterioration - could drive it to take a more transformative role , pushing for institutional innovation globally .
