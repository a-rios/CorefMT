China &apos;s Investment Addiction 
BEIJING - China &apos;s economy slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of this year . 
Just as unexpectedly , most data released since July suggest that China &apos;s growth has stabilized . 
Markets , not surprisingly , have breathed a collective sigh of relief . 
But should investors still be nervous ? 
Currently , the most severe problem confronting Chinese authorities is overcapacity . 
For example , China &apos;s annual production capacity for crude steel is one billion tons , but its total output in 2012 was 720 million tons - a capacity utilization rate of 72 % . 
More strikingly , the steel industry &apos;s profitability was just 0.04 % in 2012 . 
Indeed , the profit on two tons of steel was just about enough to buy a lollipop . 
So far this year , the average profitability of China &apos;s top 500 companies is 4.34 % , down 33 basis points from 2012 . 
Some say that today &apos;s overcapacity is a result of China &apos;s past overinvestment . 
Others attribute it to a lack of effective demand . 
The government seems to come down in the middle . 
On one hand , the authorities have ordered thousands of companies to reduce capacity . 
On the other hand , the government has introduced some &quot; mini-stimulus &quot; measures , ranging from exemptions for &quot; micro firms &quot; from business and sales taxes to pressure on banks to increase loans to exporters . 
The authorities &quot; official line is that China &apos;s growth model requires less investment and more consumption . 
But not all Chinese economists agree . 
They argue that capital stock is the key factor for growth , and that China &apos;s per capita capital stock is still low relative to developed countries , which implies considerable scope for further investment . 
To be sure , capital accumulation is a driving force of economic growth , and catching up with developed-country income levels implies that China must increase its capital stock in the long run . 
But what is at issue is not the size of the capital stock , or even the level of investment ; the problem is the growth rate of investment , which has been significantly higher than that of GDP for decades . 
According to official statistics , China &apos;s investment rate is approaching 50 % of GDP . 
Given absorption constraints , capital efficiency has been falling steadily amid increasing deadweight . 
If environmental damage caused by breakneck investment growth were taken into account , China &apos;s capital efficiency would be even lower . 
Human capital and technological progress are as important to economic growth as physical capital and labor , if not more so . 
If resource allocation is skewed toward physical capital at the expense of accumulating human capital - for which adequate consumption is indispensable - economic growth would be more likely to slow than rise . 
So China should reduce the growth rate of investment and increase that of consumption , allowing the investment rate to settle at a more sustainable level . 
Of course , it is not entirely untrue that China &apos;s overcapacity reflects a shortfall of effective demand . 
But where can effective demand come from ? 
Again , China &apos;s steel industry provides a telling example . 
Despite China &apos;s lack of a comparative advantage for steel production , it has built approximately one thousand mills , with output accounting for roughly half of the global total . 
As early as 2004 , China &apos;s government tried to clamp down on overinvestment ; and yet output increased dramatically , from 300 million tons that year to a billion tons in 2012 , owing to strong demand generated by investment in infrastructure and real-estate development . 
China &apos;s investment consists of mainly three broad categories : manufacturing industry , infrastructure , and real estate . 
In late 2008 and 2009 , at the height of the global financial crisis , stimulus-fueled infrastructure investment sustained output growth . 
In 2010 , investment in real-estate development replaced infrastructure investment as the main driver of growth . 
Today , both infrastructure and real estate are important drivers of China &apos;s growth . 
China does need more infrastructure investment - particularly in power and water utilities , transport , and communications . 
But the pace of investment must take financial constraints fully into consideration . 
More important , China can and should invest more in social infrastructure such as schools , hospitals , retirement homes , and so on . 
However , real-estate investment is another story . 
It is difficult to judge how serious China &apos;s property bubble is and when it might burst . 
But one thing is certain : China has invested too much in real-estate development . 
With per capita income at less than $ 6,000 , homeownership in China is roughly 90 % , compared to less than 70 % in the United States . 
Average floor space per capita is 32.9 square meters , while median floor space per family in Hong Kong is just 48 square meters . 
China has 696 five-star hotels , with another 500 on the way . 
Five of the ten tallest skyscrapers under construction worldwide are in China . 
In my view , this is madness . 
China &apos;s economy is being held hostage by real-estate investment . 
On one hand , China should not try to eliminate overcapacity by maintaining the high growth rate of real-estate investment . 
While investment in social housing should be welcomed , real-estate investment , currently running at 10-13 % of GDP , is already far too high . 
On the other hand , if real-estate investment growth falls , overcapacity will be difficult to eliminate . 
This dilemma highlights the structural-adjustment challenge that China faces - and should give investors reason to hold their breath . 
That said , there are two caveats . 
First , unlike other categories of investment , real estate investment does not increase productive capital stock . 
There is no fundamental difference between a house and an expensive durable consumer good . 
Second , in China &apos;s statistics , the growth rate of gross fixed-asset investment is much higher than that of gross capital formation . 
This indicates that data on the growth rate of fixed-asset investment may have exaggerated the pace of capital-stock accumulation . 
Hence , while the Chinese government should be firm on reducing the dependence of growth on investment , it must exercise utmost care when doing so .
