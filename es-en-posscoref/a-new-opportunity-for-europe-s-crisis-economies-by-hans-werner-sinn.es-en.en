A Second Chance for European Reform 
MUNICH - The European Central Bank has managed to calm the markets with its promise of unlimited purchases of eurozone government bonds , because it effectively assured bondholders that the taxpayers and pensioners of the eurozone &apos;s still-sound economies would , if necessary , shoulder the repayment burden . 
Although the ECB left open how this would be carried out , its commitment whetted investors &quot; appetite , reduced interest-rate spreads in the eurozone , and made it possible to reduce the funding of crisis-stricken economies through the printing press ( Target credit ) . 
This respite offers an ideal opportunity to push forward with reforms . 
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras must convince his countrymen that he is serious about implementing them . 
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar deserve more support for their plans . 
And one can only hope that Italy &apos;s caretaker prime minister , Mario Monti , contests the next general election . 
All of these leaders understand what must be done . 
France , by contrast , does not appear to have noticed the writing on the wall . 
President François Hollande wants to solve his country &apos;s problems with growth programs . 
But when politicians say &quot; growth , &quot; they mean &quot; borrowing . &quot; 
That is the last thing that France needs . 
France &apos;s debt / GDP ratio is already around 90 % ; even if its 2013 budget deficit does not exceed 3.5 % of GDP , its debt / GDP ratio will have climbed to 93 % by the end of the year . 
The government &apos;s GDP share , at 56 % , is the highest in the eurozone and second highest among all developed countries . 
It is not only film actors like Gérard Depardieu who are leaving the country to escape its high taxes ; industry is fleeing as well . 
France &apos;s once-proud carmakers are fighting for survival . 
Indeed , France &apos;s manufacturing industry has shrunk to barely 9 % of GDP , less than Britain &apos;s manufacturing share ( 10 % ) and less than half of Germany &apos;s ( 20 % ) . 
Its current account is sliding into an ever-deeper deficit hole . 
Unemployment is rising to record levels . 
France &apos;s basic problem , like that of the countries most affected by the crisis , is that the wave of cheap credit that the euro &apos;s introduction made possible fueled an inflationary bubble that robbed it of its competitiveness . 
Goldman Sachs has calculated that France must become 20 % cheaper to service its debt on a sustainable basis . 
The same is true of Spain , while Italy would have to become 10-15 % cheaper and Greece and Portugal would need domestic prices to fall 30 % and 35 % , respectively . 
The OECD purchasing-power statistics paint a similar picture , with Greece needing to depreciate by 39 % and Portugal by 32 % just to reach the price level prevailing in Turkey . 
But , so far , virtually nothing has been done in this respect . 
Worse , some of the troubled countries &quot; inflation rates are still running higher than those of their trading partners . 
Eurozone politicians tend to believe that it is possible to regain competitiveness by carrying out reforms , undertaking infrastructure projects , and improving productivity , but without reducing domestic prices . 
That is a fallacy , because such steps improve competitiveness only in the same measure as they reduce domestic prices vis-à-vis eurozone competitors . 
There is no way around a reduction in relative domestic prices as long as these countries remain in the currency union : either they deflate , or their trading partners inflate faster . 
There is no easy or socially comfortable way to accomplish this . 
In some cases , such a course can be so perilous that it should not be wished upon any society . 
The gap is simply too large between what is needed to restore competitiveness and what citizens can stomach if they remain part of the monetary union . 
In order to become cheaper , a country &apos;s inflation rate must stay below that of its competitors , but that can be accomplished only through an economic slump . 
The more trade unions defend existing wage structures , and the lower productivity growth is , the longer the slump will be . 
Spain and France would need a ten-year slump , with annual inflation 2 % lower than that of their competitors , to regain their competitiveness . 
For Italy , the path toward competitiveness is shorter , but for Portugal and Greece it is substantially longer - perhaps too long . 
Italy , France , and Spain should be able to regain competitiveness in the eurozone within a foreseeable period of time . 
After all , Germany cut its prices relative to its eurozone trading partners by 22 % from 1995 , when the euro was definitively announced , to 2008 , when the global financial crisis erupted . 
Ten years ago , Germany was like France is today - the sick man of Europe . 
It suffered from increasing unemployment and a lack of investment . 
Most of its savings were being invested abroad , and its domestic net investment share was among the lowest of all OECD countries . 
Under growing pressure to act , Gerhard Schröder &apos;s Social Democratic government decided in 2003 to deprive millions of Germans of their second-tier unemployment insurance , thus paving the way for the creation of a low-wage sector , in turn reducing the rate of inflation . 
Unfortunately , thus far , there is no sign that the crisis countries , above all France , are ready to bite the bullet . 
The longer they cling to a belief in magic formulas , the longer the euro crisis will be with us .
