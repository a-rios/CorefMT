Japan &apos;s Constitutional Albatross 
TOKYO - The approach of the 70th anniversary of Japan &apos;s defeat in World War II has sparked much discussion - and lamentation - of East Asia &apos;s resurgent historical feuds . 
But recent tensions in the region may partly reflect a lack of progress in another , overlooked area : Japanese constitutional reform . 
Indeed , despite the powerlessness so vividly highlighted by the Islamic State &apos;s beheading of two Japanese hostages , Japan has not adopted even one amendment to the &quot; peace constitution &quot; that the occupying American forces imposed on it in 1947 . 
At first glance , this may not be altogether surprising . 
After all , the constitution served an important purpose : by guaranteeing that Japan would not pose a military threat in the future , it enabled the country finally to escape foreign occupation and pursue rebuilding and democratization . 
But consider this : Germany adopted an Allied-approved constitution under similar circumstances in 1949 , to which it has since made dozens of amendments . 
Moreover , whereas Germany &apos;s constitution , or Basic Law , authorized the use of military force in self-defense or as part of a collective security agreement , Japan &apos;s constitution stipulated full and permanent relinquishment of &quot; the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes . &quot; 
Japan is the only country in the world bound by such restrictions - imposed not just to prevent a militarist revival , but also to punish Japan for its wartime government &apos;s policies - and continued adherence to them is unrealistic . 
That is why Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made constitutional reform a high priority . 
Having cemented his authority in December &apos;s snap general election , in which his Liberal Democratic Party won a decisive victory , Abe is determined to pursue his goal of building a stronger , more competitive Japan - one that can hold its own against an increasingly muscular China . 
Abe &apos;s effort to &quot; normalize &quot; Japan &apos;s strategic posture began with a reinterpretation of Article 9 of the constitution , according to which the country would henceforth be allowed to engage in &quot; collective self-defense . &quot; 
Japan &apos;s government approved the change last summer , and the United States backed the move as well . 
With the Islamic State &apos;s attempts to leverage the lives of two Japanese hostages , legislation to implement the reinterpretation is set to be submitted to the Diet . 
Yet the reinterpretation has faced some resistance at home and abroad . 
Chinese critics , in particular , have expressed concern that Japanese militarism could reemerge , though they neglect to mention that it is China &apos;s military buildup that prompted Japan &apos;s government to reassess its national defense policy . 
In fact , the reinterpretation amounts to little more than a tweak : Japanese forces can now shield an American warship defending Japan , but they remain prohibited from initiating offensive attacks or participating in multilateral military operations . 
Given that the United Nations charter recognizes individual and collective self-defense as an &quot; inherent right &quot; of sovereign countries , the change should be uncontroversial . 
But significant obstacles continue to block wider constitutional reform . 
Amendments require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Diet , and a majority in a popular referendum , making Japan &apos;s constitution one of the world &apos;s most difficult to revise . 
To facilitate his ambitions , Abe hopes to scale down the requirement to simple majorities in both chambers or eliminate the need for a public referendum . 
Given popular resistance to change , Abe &apos;s task will not be easy . 
Whereas citizens of most democracies regard their constitutions as works in progress - India , for example , has amended its constitution 99 times since 1950 - the Japanese largely treat their constitution as sacrosanct . 
As a result , rather than ensuring that their constitution reflects social , technological , economic , and even ideological developments , they zealously uphold its precise provisions , like religious fundamentalists defending the literal truth of scripture . 
Moreover , pacifism is deeply ingrained in the Japanese psyche , even among young people , largely owing to the painful legacy of Japan &apos;s prewar militarism . 
Indeed , a poll conducted by the World Values Survey last year revealed that only 15.3 % of Japanese - compared with 74.2 % of Chinese and 57.7 % of Americans - would be prepared to defend their country , the lowest rate in the world . 
Just 9.5 % of Japanese under the age of 30 said that they would be willing to fight . 
Given such opposition , an actual revision of Article 9 , rather than just a reinterpretation , does not seem feasible , especially while the avowedly pacifist Komeito party remains part of the ruling coalition . 
Even if Abe manages to relax the amendment requirements - no easy feat , given the likelihood that a popular referendum would reveal weak public support - he will probably have to leave the change to his successor . 
But one factor could bolster Abe &apos;s cause considerably . 
Explicit US support for Japanese constitutional reform might not only blunt Chinese criticism , but could also reassure many Japanese that updating Article 9 would not amount to rejecting the postwar order that the Americans helped to establish in Japan . 
Such a move would also serve US security interests . 
A more confident and secure Japan would be better able to block China from gaining ascendancy in the western Pacific , thereby advancing the central US policy objective of ensuring a stable balance of power in Asia . 
No other country in the region could act as a credible counterweight to China . 
Today &apos;s Japan - a liberal democracy that has not fired a single shot against an outside party in nearly seven decades , and that has made major contributions to global development during this period - is very different from the Japan of 1947 .
