A Bad Deal for America &apos;s Future 
WASHINGTON , DC - The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America &apos;s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending , thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States . 
But the agreement has three major flaws . 
Two of them offset each other , but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years : economic growth . 
The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed : coming as they do when the US economy is weak , they risk triggering another recession . 
The measure &apos;s second shortcoming , however , is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest . 
While the legislation does too little to address America &apos;s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits , the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited . 
The third and most damaging flaw , however , is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places . 
Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving , intact , America &apos;s principal welfare programs for senior citizens , Social Security and Medicare , the legislation does not touch either of them . 
These programs &quot; costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation - those born between 1946 and 1964 - retires and collects benefits , accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead . 
And , because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes , any time , under any circumstances , the bill does not rely at all on tax increases - not even for the wealthiest Americans - for the deficit reduction that it provides . 
All of the spending cuts come from the &quot; discretionary &quot; part of the federal budget , which excludes Social Security , Medicare , the Medicaid program for the poor , and interest on the national debt . 
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut , and much of that goes to the defense budget , which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future . 
So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the &quot; discretionary non-defense &quot; part of the federal budget , which is only about 10 % of it . 
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead . 
Worse yet , discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth - and economic growth is indispensable for America &apos;s future prosperity and global standing . 
Growth is , in the first place , the best way to reduce the country &apos;s budget deficits . 
The higher the growth rate , the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates ; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits . 
Moreover , economic growth is necessary to keep the promise - enormously important to individual Americans - that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one , the popular term for which is &quot; the American dream . &quot; 
Just as important for non-Americans , only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world , which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe , East Asia , and the Middle East . 
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us : How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back , a crucial factor in America &apos;s economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership , which dates back to the founding of the country , that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation . 
That partnership has five components : wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills ; investment in infrastructure - roads , power plants , and ports - that supports commerce ; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products ; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America &apos;s borders ; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth . 
The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money , and that money is included in the &quot; discretionary non-defense &quot; part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation . 
Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term , with negative consequences both at home and abroad . 
Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education , infrastructure , and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers . 
Most of the weight will remain , and one &apos;s life prospects will have worsened significantly . 
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do , but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way . 
Unless more deficit reduction , which is inevitable , comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues , and less from programs vital for economic growth , the result will be a poorer , weaker US - and a more uncertain , if not unstable , world .
