The Impotence of the Federal Reserve 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States Federal Reserve &apos;s recent announcement that it will extend its &quot; Operation Twist &quot; by buying an additional $ 267 billion of long-term Treasury bonds over the next six months - to reach a total of $ 667 billion this year - had virtually no impact on either interest rates or equity prices . 
The market &apos;s lack of response was an important indicator that monetary easing is no longer a useful tool for increasing economic activity . 
The Fed has repeatedly said that it will do whatever it can to stimulate growth . 
This led to a plan to keep short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014 , as well as to massive quantitative easing , followed by Operation Twist , in which the Fed substitutes short-term Treasuries for long-term bonds . 
These policies did succeed in lowering long-term interest rates . 
The yield on ten-year Treasuries is now 1.6 % , down from 3.4 % at the start of 2011 . 
Although it is difficult to know how much of this decline reflected higher demand for Treasury bonds from risk-averse global investors , the Fed &apos;s policies undoubtedly deserve some of the credit . 
The lower long-term interest rates contributed to the small 4 % rise in the S P 500 share-price index over the same period . 
The Fed is unlikely to be able to reduce long-term rates any further . 
Their level is now so low that many investors rightly fear that we are looking at a bubble in bond and stock prices . 
The result could be a substantial market-driven rise in long-term rates that the Fed would be unable to prevent . 
A shift in foreign investors &quot; portfolio preferences away from long-term bonds could easily trigger such a run-up in rates . 
Moreover , while the Fed &apos;s actions have helped the owners of bonds and stocks , it is not clear that they have stimulated real economic activity . 
The US economy is still limping along with very slow growth and a high rate of unemployment . 
Although the economy has been expanding for three years , the level of GDP is still only 1 % higher than it was nearly five years ago , when the recession began . 
The GDP growth rate was only 1.7 % in 2011 , and it is not significantly higher now . 
Indeed , recent data show falling real personal incomes , declining employment gains , and lower retail sales . 
The primary impact of monetary easing is usually to stimulate demand for housing and thus the volume of construction . 
But this time , despite historically low mortgage interest rates , house prices have continued to fall and are now more than 10 % lower in real terms than they were two years ago . 
The level of real residential investment is still less than half its level before the recession began . 
The Fed has noted that structural problems in the housing market have impaired its ability to stimulate the economy through this channel . 
Business investment is also weak , even though large corporations have very high cash balances . 
With so much internal liquidity , these businesses are not sensitive to reductions in market interest rates . 
At the same time , many very small businesses cannot get credit , because the local banks on which they depend have inadequate capital , owing to accrued losses on commercial real-estate loans . 
These small businesses , too , are not helped by lower interest rates . 
The Fed &apos;s monetary easing did temporarily contribute to a weaker dollar , which boosted net exports . 
But the dollar &apos;s decline has more recently been reversed by the global flight to safety by investors abandoning the euro . 
Even if the US economy continues to stumble in the months ahead , the Fed is unlikely to do anything more before the end of the year . 
The next policy moves to help the economy must come from the US Congress and the administration after the November election . 
Nonetheless , what needs to be done is already clear . 
The cloud of a sharp rise in personal and corporate income-tax rates , now scheduled to occur automatically at the start of 2013 , must be removed . 
The projected increase in the long-term fiscal deficit must be reversed by stemming the growth in transfers to middle-class retirees . 
Fundamental tax reform must strengthen incentives , reduce distorting &quot; tax expenditures , &quot; and raise revenue . 
Finally , the relationship between government and business , now quite combative , must be improved . 
If these things happen in 2013 , the US economy can return to a more normal path of economic expansion and rising employment . 
At that point , the Fed can focus on its fundamental mandate of preventing a rise in the rate of inflation . 
Until then , it is powerless .
