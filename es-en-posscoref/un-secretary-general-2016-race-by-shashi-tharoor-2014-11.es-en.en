The Politics of UN Leadership 
NEW DELHI - Election cycles are growing longer worldwide . 
In the United States , for example , ambitious politicians are already campaigning hard in bellwether states for the 2016 presidential election . 
Yet some races - such as that for the next United Nations secretary-general , which will also be held in 2016 - still occur largely under the radar . 
This should change . 
A race for UN Secretary-General , which is usually fought so discreetly that it seems almost clandestine , bears little resemblance to the razzmatazz of an American presidential campaign . 
This can be explained largely by the fact that the decision comes down to the 15 members of the Security Council , who select the candidate to be rubber-stamped by the UN General Assembly ( as has occurred in every case so far ) . 
Crucially , the Security Council &apos;s five permanent members - China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the US - have veto power , so a majority means nothing if a single member of the P-5 dissents . 
The selection process is constrained further by an informal - but , after 43 years , essentially requisite - agreement to rotate through regions every two terms . 
( The only exception was the extremely popular and well-regarded Kofi Annan , who , despite having succeeded another African after one term , was selected for two consecutive terms . ) 
With the position having cycled , since 1971 , through Western Europe , Latin America , Africa , and Asia - Ban Ki-moon , the current second-term secretary-general , hails from South Korea - only one UN region has yet to be represented : Eastern Europe . 
In fact , a number of potential East European candidates have already emerged , with some said to have begun actively soliciting support . 
Former Slovenian President Danilo Türk , who served as Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs under Annan , is an early front-runner . 
There is also talk of current UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova , who is Bulgarian , and of two Slovaks , Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajčák and his predecessor , Jan Kubiš , entering the race . 
Finally , there is Romania &apos;s former foreign minister , Mircea Geoana , who is highly respected among P-5 governments . 
The fact that all five of these candidates are well known in diplomatic circles , and four have direct UN experience , refutes the old canard that Eastern Europe does not have a credible candidate to offer . 
( Full disclosure : all five are friends of mine , and I consider them highly capable and well suited for the role . ) 
But there is a hitch : Eastern Europe must avoid attracting a Russian veto . 
Indeed , that may be the main factor derailing the prospects of former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski . 
If , as some fear , the Kremlin vetoes all East European candidates , a representative from the Western Europe and Others Group , such as former New Zealand Prime Minister and current UN Under-Secretary-General Helen Clark , could stand a chance , especially given the appeal of finally selecting a woman for the role . 
Will the global public get to see much of the race ? 
The 2006 election , in which I finished a close second out of seven candidates , featured an unprecedented level of public exposure , with candidates meeting with UN regional groups , addressing the annual African Union summit , and even participating in a debate on the BBC . 
Web sites emerged for the sole purpose of analyzing the race . 
All of this represented an important step forward . 
Given the importance of the UN secretary-general &apos;s vision , candidates should have the opportunity to share their ideas and goals publicly , as I was committed to doing . 
Ultimately , however , the public campaign had little impact on the outcome , exemplified in the fact that Ban did not participate in the BBC debate . 
Though efforts to share one &apos;s vision can win a candidate wide expressions of support , they can do the same for his or her opponents - and , in the election of a UN secretary-general , Security Council members can vote for as many candidates as they like . 
This is not to say that the race does not shape the outcome . 
In 2006 , South Korea launched a yearlong , amply-financed outreach campaign that targeted all 15 Security Council members with official visits in their capitals , and that often dangled significant bilateral carrots - gestures that other candidates had neither the time nor the resources to offer . 
Indeed , South Korea was the only Security Council member country to conduct such a campaign . 
The obvious conclusion is that the contest for UN Secretary-General is about neither vision nor the best resume , language skills , administrative ability , or even personal charisma . 
It is a political decision , made principally by the P-5 . 
( It is , after all , unlikely that a candidate would win over the P-5 but fail to win a majority in the Security Council , given the option of casting unlimited votes . ) 
The result is that the &quot; least unacceptable &quot; candidate gets the job . 
And , as it stands , there is no reason to believe that the advent of social media , satellite television coverage , or a more intrusive press will change that fundamental reality . 
In 2016 , the smart money will be on an East European candidate acceptable to the P-5 , particularly Russia . 
How agreement on the candidate will be achieved is anyone &apos;s guess . 
What is clear is that any candidate who does not fit that description will enter the race with a crippling , though not necessarily insuperable , handicap .
