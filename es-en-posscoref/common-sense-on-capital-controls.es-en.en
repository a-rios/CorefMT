Common Sense on Capital Controls 
SANTIAGO - Few policy debates are stranger than the one concerning capital controls . 
Mention the issue to a banker or a mainstream economist and you are likely to get a vehement reply : capital controls do not work , because speculators can evade them at little or no cost , but countries should never adopt such controls , because doing so is very costly . 
Am I the only one who finds this logic a bit crooked ? 
The next stage of the conversation is usually just as strange . 
When dealing with surges of potentially destabilizing capital inflows , capital controls are a no-no , but something called prudential regulation is quite okay . 
Capital controls , you are likely to be told , discriminate between transactions depending on the country of residence of the parties involved , and that is bad . 
Prudential regulation discriminates on the basis of the transaction &apos;s currency of denomination or maturity , and that is good . 
If this conversation is taking place at a cocktail party , at this point you would be well advised to ask for another drink . 
That has been the state of the debate - until recently . 
The big intellectual change has come from the International Monetary Fund , once an outright enemy of capital controls . 
In a series of studies , IMF economists have stopped treating the issue as one of good versus evil , and have started treating it as a run-of-the-mill economic choice : capital controls have costs and benefits that can be measured and compared . 
The Fund now argues that they should be one more tool for prudent policymakers to use as circumstances require . 
Another big change has come from fast-growing emerging-market countries , many of which , facing a wall of money coming their way from slow-growth advanced countries ( and mindful of the costs that large and volatile capital flows can bring ) , have chosen to apply capital controls . 
Brazil , Indonesia , South Korea , Thailand , and Taiwan have all recently introduced disincentives to capital inflows . 
Other emerging countries , like Peru , have tightened domestic prudential regulations with the same aim in mind . 
Those who claim that capital controls are ineffective seldom specifyat what they are presumed to be ineffective . 
A recent paper by Marcos Chamon , Atish Ghosh , Jonathan Ostry , and Mahvash Qureshi , economists at the IMF &apos;s Research Department , suggests that capital controls can be effective indeed . 
The authors conclude that , by reducing the share of short-term foreign-currency debt in a country &apos;s total liabilities , capital controls can reduce vulnerability to financial crises . 
The IMF economists ask how 50 countries fared during the recent world financial meltdown , with performance measured by economic growth in 2008-09 relative to 2003-2007 . 
Their main finding is that countries with capital controls in place beforehand fared better - their growth rates fell less during the crisis . 
This was because they had less leverage to be unwound and less footloose capital that could leave in the event of a global financial squeeze . 
This does not mean that capital controls can solve all problems : the same paper shows that they are relatively ineffective at preventing lending booms - another key cause of economic vulnerability . 
This should not be surprising , since many factors besides international debt flows can cause domestic banks to throw caution to the wind and start lending recklessly . 
But the paper also shows that domestic prudential policies - such as capping home-mortgage loans at a certain percentage of the property &apos;s value , or increasing banks &quot; capital requirements during economic upswings - can be effective at restraining lending booms . 
This suggests that capital controls and prudential policies can complement each other , contrary to what conventional wisdom often assumes . 
Nor do these findings suggest that capital controls have no costs . 
For example , as the MIT economist Kristin Forbes has documented , they increase the cost of financing for small and medium-size companies . 
All aspiring economists are taught the discipline &apos;s cardinal rule : governments ( and people , for that matter ) should undertake an action to the point where , at the margin , its benefits equal its costs . 
Recent research , by carefully quantifying the potential costs and benefits , allows this standard logic to be applied to the question of whether and when to apply capital controls . 
For an economist , this is cause for celebration - no cocktail required .
