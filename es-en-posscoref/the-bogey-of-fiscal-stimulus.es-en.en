The Bogey of Fiscal Stimulus 
NEW YORK - After the economic disaster of 2008-2009 , people are understandably wary of the devastation that yet another financial crisis can wreak . 
But the likelihood of another crisis is quite small , and its adverse impact would be far less devastating this time around , as there are no more massive credit or asset bubbles to burst . 
That has not stopped pundits and the media from exaggerating such fears , distracting from greater efforts to overcome protracted stagnation for much of the developed world , which will inevitably drag down economic recovery elsewhere , especially in developing countries . 
The current favorite bogeyman is public debt . 
Much is being made of high levels of sovereign debt on both sides of the Atlantic , and in Japan . 
Likewise , while Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among rich countries , this is not a serious problem because the debt is domestically held . 
And Europe &apos;s debt problems are now widely acknowledged to be due to ill-conceived aspects of European integration . 
The international community has , so far , failed to develop effective and equitable arrangements for restructuring sovereign debt , despite the clearly dysfunctional and problematic consequences of past international public-debt crises . 
This prevents timely debt workouts when needed , effectively impeding recovery . 
High public debt is also being invoked in support of fiscal austerity in many developed countries . 
But , rather than helping , the rush to budget cutting is reversing earlier recovery efforts . 
With private-sector demand still weak , austerity is slowing , not accelerating , recovery . 
It has already reduced growth and employment . 
Opponents of fiscal stimulus cynically claim that all such efforts are bound to fail , citing as evidence US President George W. Bush &apos;s tax cuts ! 
Others point out that the US Fed &apos;s &quot; quantitative easing &quot; efforts have been modestly successful , at best . 
While undoubtedly mitigating the impact of the crisis , Europe &apos;s &quot; automatic stabilizers &quot; are now said to be enough to ensure recovery , despite strong evidence to the contrary . 
Slower growth means less revenue , and a faster downward spiral . 
Most major countries &quot; fiscal deficits nowadays reflect the recent collapse of tax revenues that followed the growth downturn , as well as very costly financial-sector bailouts . 
And yet many policymakers are insisting on immediate action to rectify not only fiscal deficits , but also trade imbalances and banks &quot; balance-sheet weaknesses . 
While these undoubtedly need to be addressed in the longer term , prioritizing them now effectively stymies stronger , sustained recovery efforts . 
The wrong public policies can induce recessions . 
This happened in 1980-1981 , when the US Federal Reserve raised real interest rates , ostensibly to kill inflation , inducing a global economic downturn as well . 
This contributed not only to sovereign-debt and fiscal crises , but also to protracted stagnation outside East Asia , including Latin America &apos;s &quot; lost decade &quot; and Africa &apos;s &quot; quarter-century retreat . &quot; 
Another distraction is exaggerating the threat of inflation . 
Recent inflation in many countries has been the result of higher commodity prices , especially fuel and food prices . 
In these circumstances , domestic deflationary policies will only further slow growth - and are helpless to stem imported inflation . 
Unfortunately , today &apos;s top policy priority is to address remote possibilities , whereas the urgent task at hand - coordinating and implementing efforts to raise and sustain growth and job creation - is being ignored . 
Meanwhile , cuts in social and welfare spending are only making things worse , as employment and consumer demand fall further . 
The pressure on employment and household budgets is likely to persist . 
Strident calls for structural reforms mainly target labor markets , rather than product markets . 
Growing worker insecurity is seen as the basis for a healthy economy . 
Labor-market liberalization in such circumstances not only undermines remaining social protection , but is also likely to diminish real incomes , aggregate demand , and , hence , recovery prospects . 
Moreover , in recent decades , profits have risen not only at the expense of wages , but also with much more accruing to finance , insurance , and real estate compared to other sectors . 
The outrageous increases in financial executives &quot; remuneration in recent years , which cannot be attributed to increased productivity , have exacerbated the financial sector &apos;s focus on the short term , while worsening its risk exposure in the longer term , thereby exacerbating systemic vulnerability . 
Growing income inequality in most countries before the Great Recession only made matters worse , by reducing household savings and increasing credit for consumption and asset purchases , rather than augmenting investment in new economic capacity . 
What the world needs now are leaders who look to the long-term future . 
The international financial institutions created after World War II were set up to ensure not only international monetary and financial stability , but also the conditions for sustained growth , employment generation , post-war reconstruction , and post-colonial development . 
Unfortunately , current policy is justified in terms of &quot; pro-market &quot; - effectively pro-cyclical - choices . 
But it is counter-cyclical efforts , institutions , and instruments that are sorely needed instead . 
Global leadership today seems to be held hostage by financial interests and associated media , ideologists , and oligarchs whose political influence enables them to secure more rents and pay lower taxes in what must truly be the most vicious of circles . 
Indeed , the menace that now confronts us is not public debt or inflation , but a downward economic spiral that will be increasingly difficult to reverse .
