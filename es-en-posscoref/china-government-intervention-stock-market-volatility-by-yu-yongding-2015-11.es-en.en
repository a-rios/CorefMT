China &apos;s Intervention Lessons 
BEIJING - China &apos;s stock market has been a hot topic since the summer , when a rapid rise gave way to a major plunge , triggering a global equities sell-off . 
The question now is what can be done to prevent further volatility . 
To answer that question requires understanding how China got to this point . 
For years , with the authorities &quot; encouragement ( or at least acquiescence ) , China &apos;s securities companies spared no effort in pumping up China &apos;s stock exchanges with fashionable financial instruments and practices , the sole aim being to realize capital gains from rising prices ( dividends are rarely distributed ) . 
As a result , after years of poor performance , the Shanghai Composite Index soared by more than 100 % in less than seven months , from 2,505 points in November 2014 to over 5,178 last June - a level that was not merited by China &apos;s economic fundamentals . 
The most important instrument driving this surge was margin trading , which enabled investors to borrow heavily to purchase shares . 
According to Bank of America strategist David Cui , some CN ¥ 7.5 trillion ( $ 1.2 trillion ) in market positions are being carried on margin , &quot; equivalent to some 13 % of A-share &apos;s market cap and 34 % of its free float . &quot; 
Part of the problem was that margin trading was not limited to institutional investors . 
Lightly regulated &quot; fund matching &quot; companies , for example , would distribute margin loans to virtually anyone , resulting in about CN ‎ ¥ 2.3 trillion in online private fund matching and CN ¥ 1 trillion in offline private fund matching , with a leverage ratio of up to 5 : 1 for the latter . 
In mid-June , the prolonged surge in stock prices finally drove an unnerved China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ) to impose restrictions on offline private fund matching . 
The decision immediately triggered a sell-off , with the Shanghai Composite Index falling 2 % in just one day . 
Initially , this looked like a natural correction . 
But the prevalence of margin trading caused the decline to turn quickly into a rout . 
First , as plummeting stock prices caused the equity in investors &quot; accounts to fall below the maintenance margin , brokers began issuing margin calls , forcing investors to offload more assets to come up with the needed cash . 
When they failed to pay margin calls on time , their shares were sold by brokers , pushing stock prices down further . 
The authorities scrambled to stanch the bleeding . 
On June 27 , the People &apos;s Bank of China lowered the reserve requirement ratio and the benchmark interest rate . 
But the Shanghai Composite Index kept falling , reaching 4,200 on July 1 . 
At that point , the CSRC launched a succession of desperate measures : it suspended initial public offerings , allowed companies to stop trading , and limited short selling . 
It even organized a &quot; national team &quot; of 21 large securities companies , led by a government-controlled financial corporation , to purchase shares to buttress the Shanghai Composite Index . 
In doing so , China &apos;s regulatory authority changed many well-established rules of the game virtually overnight . 
And , while massive official intervention may have halted the rout , it could have permanently damaged regulators &quot; credibility . 
And it was not even merited ; the banks were not overly exposed , so there were no systemic risks . 
But the policy failures fueling this stock-market fiasco go back further , to the massive government-fueled surge in credit since the global financial crisis . 
Without that , brokerages would not have had all of that liquidity to lend for margin trading . 
After the crisis struck , instead of recognizing the decline in potential growth and adjusting accordingly , the government remained implicitly wedded to an unrealistic target of 10 % annual GDP growth . 
But , while the CN ¥ 4 trillion stimulus package propped up growth temporarily , return on investment was deteriorating , because potential growth was already lower than actual growth . 
As a result , credit demand was relatively weak ; in many cases , commercial banks had to persuade enterprises to accept loans , with a large proportion of the credit ultimately devoted to chasing assets in the capital market . 
At first , the excess liquidity fueled real-estate bubbles . 
After the government clamped down on lending for residential and commercial projects , risky shadow banking activity surged . 
After the government clamped down on that too , the liquidity was channeled toward stock exchanges ; once those crashed , it sloshed into the bond market . 
But the bond market is not large enough to absorb it all , so some has now returned to the stock exchanges , leading to a partial recovery in share prices , with the Shanghai index reaching 3,500 . 
Declining economic growth strengthens the temptation to loosen monetary policy . 
But in today &apos;s deflationary environment , typical monetary expansion alone can do little to help the real economy , because the money either remains idle or fuels asset bubbles and capital outflows . 
If China &apos;s government is to prevent a debt-deflation spiral from causing a hard landing , it should shift its focus to targeted expansionary fiscal policy . 
With a budget deficit of 2.3 % of GDP , China can certainly afford to increase government expenditure and reduce taxes . 
Critically , the package should be financed by government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance , not by commercial banks via local-government financing vehicles . 
Any loosening of monetary policy should be aimed directly at accommodating fiscal policy . 
That way , financial resources would be channeled into the real economy , rather than inflating asset bubbles . 
To support this effort , China &apos;s government should loosen its grip on the exchange rate , while maintaining appropriate capital controls . 
Renminbi internationalization should not be a policy priority . 
China &apos;s experience in recent years holds valuable lessons for the country &apos;s leaders . 
With a more balanced approach to intervention that reflects those lessons , they could put China &apos;s economy on a much more stable path . 
That said , as China undergoes structural economic transition , the stabilization potential of macroeconomic policy is limited . 
Without more fundamental reforms , even an impeccable macroeconomic policy mix would not work . 
Reforms take time , which means that China may need to brace itself for more troubles and a protracted period of slow growth .
