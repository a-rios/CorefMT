Is China Closing or Opening ? 
Despite the dominance of the Iraq story , China is back in the headlines , with the country excoriated for its evasiveness about the SARS epidemic , and praised for its suddenly constructive role in helping to bring about negotiations between the US and North Korea , over North Korea &apos;s nuclear insubordination . 
What do these two seemingly disparate responses tell us about China and its evolving place in the world ? 
China &apos;s response to the SARS epidemic suggests an almost automatic defensiveness when the outside world seems to impinge on it or threaten it in some potentially harmful or embarrassing way . 
In this sense , the legacy of China &apos;s humiliation at the hands of the West and Japan in the 19th and early 20th centuries still exerts a powerful influence , despite the emergence of a globalized &quot; New China &quot; over the last two decades . 
These experiences became burned so deeply into the Chinese psyche that even China &apos;s current economic and political rise has not overcome an underlying sense of victimization and grievance . 
It would not be too extreme to say that China has fashioned a whole identity out of its historical victimization . 
The Maoist ideological mindset grew out of Lenin &apos;s theory of imperialism , which , aided by endless barrages of propaganda against capitalism , colonialism , and foreign hegemony , tended to reinforce the sense of national humiliation . 
Party spokesmen still often say that some foreign intervention has &quot; wounded the feelings of the Chinese people &quot; when they feel that China has been unfairly victimized . 
This deep-seated suspicion of international exploitation fuels a predator / victim perspective that focuses blame on the outside world . 
So China &apos;s first reaction to SARS was to bury the news of a public health epidemic in the making . 
Such secretiveness - rooted in fear of humiliation - has been the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s traditional response to bad news . 
It was better to hush up the mass famine that killed 30 million people following the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950 &apos;s and early 1960 &apos;s than to seem to be in need of foreign help . 
Nowadays , the country &apos;s communist leaders acted as if they believed that disclosing SARS would risk tarnishing China &apos;s &quot; economic miracle &quot; and driving away foreign direct investment - some $ 50 billion last year , or 80 % of all FDI made in Asia . 
Why not just keep the fledgling epidemic under wraps and hope that it goes away without the world ever knowing ? 
When the SARS epidemic broke out in Guangdong in South China , the government &apos;s first impulse was , indeed , to be secretive , manipulate statistics , pressure the media into silence , distort the magnitude of the epidemic , and impede the World Health Organization ( WHO ) from getting involved early . 
Even after the epidemic appeared in Hong Kong and then spread to Beijing , officials continued to withhold information . 
Only under the most biting international criticism and censure did China grudgingly admit that there were 340 cases in Beijing , with over 400 more suspected cases . 
This kind of insular reaction to a fundamentally global problem is self-destructive . 
It reflects lingering discomfort with a global world of greater transparency , freedom of expression , and a diminished reliance on absolute sovereignty . 
In short , China &apos;s initial reaction to SARS - like its disastrous early handling of its AIDS epidemic - is a throwback to its old pre-reform approach to problems . 
But if the SARS epidemic exposed the retro side of China &apos;s approach to involvement in global affairs , China has shown its newer , more cosmopolitan and internationalist side by hosting the three-way discussion between America , North Korea , and China . 
These talks , represent a more open , forward-looking , multilateral view of China &apos;s place in the world , hinting at a more pro-active and constructive diplomatic role as matchmaker and reconciler on the global stage . 
In the past , China shied away from most multilateral problem solving , fearing that it might set a precedent for other countries to intervene in internal Chinese affairs . 
After all , if China helps to resolve the stand-off between Pyongyang and Washington , Seoul , and Tokyo , what is to prevent these same countries from proposing initiatives to resolve the Taiwan Straits problem , the question of Tibetan autonomy , or the challenge of insurgent Muslims in Xinjiang ? 
Of course , by hosting the talks , China &apos;s leaders also tacitly recognize that absolute sovereignty is no longer a viable position , or one that benefits China . 
Indeed , if they are successful in bringing about some sort of rapprochement , or even if they only manage to ease the crisis somewhat , their accomplishment will be significant . 
Any success will confer a new sense of dignity and status on China . 
For this reason , China &apos;s reluctant and belated entrance onto the international diplomatic stage is a hopeful trend that bears watching . 
If China comports itself well , and if the meetings are productive , this will be important in its own right .
