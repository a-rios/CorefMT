Poland &apos;s Successful Losers 
WARSAW - How can a government with the best economic record in Europe ( indeed in the entire OECD ) be humiliated at the polls by a Euroskeptic , nationalistic , and economically illiterate opposition - one deemed unelectable only a year ago ? 
That is the question many Poles , and friends of Poland , are now asking , following the defeat on October 25 of the Civic Platform government . 
If creating jobs and boosting incomes can &apos;t get you re-elected , what can ? 
One reason for the opposition &apos;s victory is , of course , universal : after a time , people everywhere want change , and Civic Platform had been in power since 2007 . 
And impatience with the status quo is arguably stronger in the post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe , where much of the social , political , and economic order is yet to be generally accepted . 
Indeed , Civic Platform &apos;s Donald Tusk was Poland &apos;s first post-communist prime minister to win successive terms . 
Moreover , as parties govern longer , their strongest personalities tend to be replaced by weaker ones . Civic Platform contested this election after replacing Tusk with Ewa Kopacz , and has had the same problem with a number of other &quot; substitutions . &quot; 
What is specific to Poland is that the past eight years have apparently created a pronounced case of cognitive dissonance . 
Annual GDP growth averaged 3.2 % over this period ; and , unlike in the rich West , both inequality and unemployment have actually fallen , with growth mainly benefiting the middle three quintiles of the income distribution . 
This segment of the population - usually politically crucial - enjoyed a 28 % rise in per capita real income from 2007 to 2014 . 
At one level , Poles are aware of this , with large majorities describing financial conditions in their own families , workplaces , and social environments as either &quot; good &quot; or &quot; very good . &quot; 
The dissonance is that equally large majorities also describe Poland &apos;s economic situation and the &quot; direction in which the country is moving &quot; as either &quot; bad &quot; or &quot; very bad . &quot; 
Poland &apos;s transformation is visible not only in the form of new motorways , local roads , airports , hospitals and stadiums , but also in the appearance of vast numbers of new and refurbished housing units , supermarkets , and modern factories . 
Poland has recorded the fourth lowest increase in public debt ( as a percentage of GDP ) in the European Union . 
And yet the disconnect between this reality and the Poland &quot; in ruins &quot; or &quot; on the verge of catastrophe &quot; perceived by many voters was too strong to ignore . 
Even Kopacz admitted the contrast between the &quot; public affluence &quot; that everyone sees and the &quot; private penury &quot; that many feel persists ( at least relative to Germany , the preferred benchmark for Poles ) . 
In today &apos;s Poland , it is harder to accept wages - nominally about a third of those in Germany - that had seemed perfectly adequate in 2007 , when they were only a quarter of the German level . 
But , unsurprisingly , Kopacz &apos;s campaign slogan , &quot; A strong economy - higher wages , &quot; and her implicit promise to address the issue in one parliamentary term , did not appear credible . 
Although the problem faced by Kopacz and Civic Platform was specifically Polish , it contains a universal truth : to win , politicians must define the context in which they operate . 
During Tusk &apos;s premiership , the government was perversely reluctant to claim credit for Poland &apos;s economic success . 
He never even reminded voters that the government &apos;s choices in managing the fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis - which were neither obvious nor easy , because they required rejecting the EU &apos;s austerity consensus - was the right one . 
Given that most voters do not consider themselves able to judge competence in government , they base their choice of party on the general direction in which it intends to take the country and the overarching principles by which it intends to govern . 
Civic Platform came to power in 2007 with a strongly pro-business and free-market ethos . 
During the financial crisis , it had to moderate these views considerably , taking steps that ran counter to its ideology : increasing deficits in the trough of the crisis ( 2009-2010 ) and raising taxes once growth resumed ( 2011 ) . 
And then , when the government reduced the size of the absurdly expensive , but popular , funded pension system ( 2011-2014 ) , Tusk attempted to compensate voters by pumping all additional free resources into family benefits . 
Although this was justified , given Poland &apos;s very low birth rate , it was also intended to appeal to his urban electorate . 
By 2014 , the government was perceived as being so pragmatic as to be almost value-free . 
That perception naturally raised the suspicion that self-interest had become Civic Platform &apos;s main motivation . 
As the party &apos;s narrative became an endless litany of the good social things it had done ( or was about to do ) , Poles came to view the campaign as a cynical attempt to buy their votes - and to do so with their own money . 
Even the fact that these promises , though plentiful , were mostly inexpensive ( certainly compared to those of the opposition ) was not used to convey a commitment to fiscal responsibility . 
Elections are a choice , not an auction between competing lists of promises , with victory simply going to the highest bidder . 
Civic Platform lost because it failed to explain to Poles its own view of that choice . 
It hardly mattered that the opposition &apos;s program lacked credibility : Civic Platform had already become the architect of its own defeat .
