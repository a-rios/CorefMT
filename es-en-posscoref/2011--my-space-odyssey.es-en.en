2011 : My Space Odyssey 
MOSCOW - Most people who know of me think of me as an information-technology expert , someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups . 
In fact , my formal residence is in New York City , but I am about to spend most of the next five months in Russia , training to be a cosmonaut in Star City , just outside Moscow . 
It all came about in a number of ways . 
First of all , as a kid , I just assumed that I would go to the moon , without having to do much in particular to make it happen . 
I just took it for granted that , by the time I was , say , 40 , space travel would be a common thing . 
My father was involved with the United States space program , and we had some moon rocks at home , so I thought it was no big deal . 
Then I got distracted for about 40 years . 
A few years ago , however , I started paying attention to space again . 
A lot of people I knew in the IT industry were doing the same : Elon Musk , a co-founder of PayPal , founded Space-X ; 
Jeff Bezos of Amazon started a spacecraft company called Blue Origin ; 
Jeff Greason , a senior manager at Intel , started XCOR Aerospace ( in which I &apos;m an investor ) . 
In 2005 , the last year I held my PC Forum conference for IT entrepreneurs , I started a conference called Flight School for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation . 
Meanwhile , in about 2005 , I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy . 
One of the group was Mark Shuttleworth , founder of Thawte ( sold to VeriSign ) , who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second &quot; space tourist . &quot; 
One evening , the group sat around a campfire as the sun set , and around 50 African schoolchildren were bussed in . 
Altogether , there were about 100 of us , President Mbeki included , around a roaring fire . 
Once it was dark , a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space . 
He gave a fascinating talk about his adventures , complete with clips of him floating around , catching bubbles in his mouth , and so on . 
The kids loved it , and I &apos;m sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science . 
Eventually , I invested in Space Adventures , the company that organized Shuttleworth &apos;s trip into space . 
Later , I went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of Charles Simonyi , the fifth ( and soon seventh ) space tourist , from Baikonur in Kazakhstan . 
Soon after , I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team . 
Yes , I would love to actually go , but the trip to space costs $ 35 to $ 40 million , whereas backup training costs &quot; only &quot; $ 3 million . 
So I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in 2011 - the year that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is ( very ) tentatively slated to go . 
Space Adventures was pushing for 2009 , but I was pretty busy . 
Then something happened last spring : my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy . 
( She is doing well now and , in fact , just won a mini-marathon . ) 
A couple of weeks later , I was faced with one of those conflicts : a board meeting here , a conference there , another opportunity at the same time somewhere else . 
&quot; Aaagh , &quot; I thought , &quot; if only I had a double mastectomy : I could cancel all these things and no one would complain ! &quot; 
Good grief ! I realized my priorities were all out of whack . So in some odd way , this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy - a positive one , to be sure , but the same kind of reset-button experience . 
It is also the answer to another question I hear a lot because of my work on human genetics through 23andMe ( www.23andme.com ) and the Personal Genome Project ( www.personalgenome.org ) : If you learned you had a high chance of developing Alzheimer &apos;s in a few years , what would you do ? 
Why , I &apos;d go train to be a cosmonaut , of course ! And why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer &apos;s ? Next month , I will write about what training to go into space actually involves .
