Global Imbalances and Domestic Inequality 
WASHINGTON , DC - Despite years of official talk about addressing global current-account imbalances , they remained one of the world &apos;s main economic concerns in 2011 . 
Global imbalances were , to be sure , smaller overall than before the crisis , but they did not disappear . 
Now some are increasing again , alongside inequality in many countries . 
That link is no accident . 
One often hears calls for global rebalancing whereby emerging-market countries with payments surpluses - China is the most-often mentioned - would stimulate internal demand , so that advanced countries ( the largest being the United States ) could reduce their deficits and public debts with less threat to their economies &quot; recovery . 
The net foreign demand created by a reduction in balance-of-payments surpluses abroad would partly offset the weakening of public demand in the US and other high-debt countries as they tightened fiscal policy . 
The story should not , however , be just about current-account deficits in advanced countries and surpluses in the emerging countries . 
Many emerging-market countries - including India , South Africa , Brazil , and Turkey - actually run current-account deficits . 
There are also many advanced countries that run a current-account surplus : Germany &apos;s has been well publicized since the eurozone crisis started , but Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , and Sweden run surpluses as well . 
So , while global rebalancing does require a reduction of surpluses , the issue is not simply one of shrinking emerging-market surpluses in order to allow a corresponding decline in the deficits of the advanced countries . 
As we enter 2012 , a reduction in Germany &apos;s surplus may be more urgent than a reduction in China &apos;s , since reducing Germany &apos;s surplus will yield more immediate benefits for Europe , where the greatest risks to global recovery lie . 
Moreover , the Chinese renminbi is experiencing a fairly steep real appreciation , as inflation in China is rising much more rapidly than in the US or the eurozone . 
Indeed , the &quot; German &quot; euro is losing value , despite Germany &apos;s large surplus , because it is also the currency of the southern European countries that are in so much trouble . 
The Chinese and German current-account surpluses are correctly viewed as an obstacle to recovery , because they subtract from potential world effective demand and contribute to global &quot; planned savings &quot; exceeding &quot; planned investments &quot; - a recipe for recessionary pressure . 
But the increasing concentration of income and wealth within many countries , foremost the US , should attract similar &quot; Keynesian &quot; worries . 
An increasing concentration of income and wealth can be viewed as an &quot; internal &quot; imbalance similar in some ways to &quot; external &quot; current-account imbalances , because the highest-earning groups tend to save a much larger share of their income . 
An ongoing income shift towards the highest earners will tend to lead to higher overall savings , which would have to be compensated by higher investment , higher net exports , or higher public expenditures to avoid recessionary pressure . 
While levels of inequality around the world vary widely , the tendency towards greater concentration at the top appears to be a general one , and it is changes in concentration that lead to changes in planned savings . 
An ongoing trend towards income concentration should be expected to lead to deflationary pressure wherever it takes place . 
Of course , other factors , including government policies , can compensate for that pressure . 
In the US , low interest rates and debt-financed consumption by lower-income groups , encouraged by government policy and financial-sector practices , compensated for higher savings at the very top during the pre-crisis years . 
Thus , despite record income concentration , the US ran a large current-account deficit . 
In China , net exports and strong government-supported investment ensured continuous expansion . 
In Germany , too , net exports increased . 
Nonetheless , shifts of income to high-saving groups and increasing current-account surpluses have similar first-round effects on aggregate world savings . 
Of course , it is only the first-round effects that are similar . 
Much then depends on whether an increase in a current-account surplus leads to more reserve accumulation or more direct investment abroad ; on how different income groups allocate their spending between imports and domestic goods ; and on what kind of macroeconomic policies are being pursued . 
The full story of imbalances has to include propensities to spend on imports and domestic goods in various countries , as well as the balance between public and private savings . 
Moreover , it is necessary to complement our concerns about &quot; global imbalances &quot; with an analysis of how increasing income concentration may be leading to &quot; internal imbalances &quot; and recessionary pressures that are similar in magnitude . 
These imbalances are linked , and both threaten sustainable rapid growth . 
Global imbalances and rising domestic inequality need to be analyzed and debated together . 
Only then can they be addressed effectively .
