Betting the House 
Homeowners around the world effectively gamble on home prices . 
Their risks today are often big due to real estate bubbles in such glamour cities as London , Paris , Madrid , Rome , Istanbul , Moscow , Shanghai , Hangzhou , Sydney , Melbourne , Vancouver , Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Boston , New York , Washington , D.C. , and Miami . 
Those bubbles may keep expanding , or may burst , leaving many homeowners mired in debt . 
The risk to home prices in the aftermath of a bubble is real and substantial . 
In the last cycle of real estate busts , real ( inflation-corrected ) home prices fell 46 % in London in 1988-95 , 41 % in Los Angeles in 1989-1997 , 43 % in Paris in 1991-98 , 67 % in Moscow in 1993-97 , and 38 % in Shanghai in 1995-1999 . 
All of these drops were eventually reversed , and all of these markets have boomed recently . 
But this does not guarantee that future drops will have a similar outcome . 
Most homeowners are not gambling for pleasure . 
They are just buying real estate because they need it . 
But , because they do nothing to protect themselves against their real estate price risks , they are unwitting gamblers . 
In fact , home buyers in most countries do nothing to protect themselves - short of selling their homes - because there is nothing to be done . 
A market for real estate derivatives that can help balance these risks is only just beginning to appear . 
Well-developed markets for real estate derivatives would allow homeowners to kick the gambling habit . 
A liquid , cash-settled futures market that is based on an index of home prices in a city would enable a homeowner living there to sell in a futures market to protect himself . 
If home prices fall sharply in that city , the drop in the value of the home would be offset by an increase in the value of the futures contract . 
That is how advanced risk management works , as financial professionals know . 
But the tools needed to hedge such risks should be made available to everyone . 
Attempts to set up derivatives markets for real estate have  -  so far  -  all met with only limited success . 
In May 2003 , Goldman , Sachs &amp; Co. began offering cash-settled covered warrants on house prices in the United Kingdom , based on the Halifax House Price Index and traded on the London Stock Exchange . 
In October 2004 , Hedgestreet.com began offering &quot; hedgelets &quot; on real estate prices in US cities - contracts that pay out if the rate of increase in home prices based on the OFHEO Home Price Index falls within a pre-specified range . 
My former student Allan Weiss and I have been campaigning since 1990 for better risk management institutions for real estate . 
In 1999 , we co-founded a firm , Macro Securities Research , LLC , to promote the development of such institutions , working with the American Stock Exchange to create securities that would allow people to manage real estate as well as other risks . 
These will be long-term securities that pay regular dividends , like stocks , whose value is tied - either positively or negatively ­ - to a real estate price index . 
Early this month , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that it will also work with us to explore the development of futures markets in US metropolitan-area home prices . 
Because even many financially sophisticated homeowners will find direct participation in derivative markets too daunting , the next stage in the development of real estate risk management will be to create suitable retail products . 
For example , the derivative markets should create an environment that encourages insurers to develop home equity insurance , which insures homeowners not just against a bust but also against drops in the market value of the home . 
Such insurance ­ should be attractive to homeowners if it is offered as an add-on to their existing insurance policies . 
Derivatives markets for real estate should also facilitate the creation of mortgage loans that help homeowners manage risks by , say , reducing the amount owed if a home &apos;s value drops . 
Such products should appeal to homebuyers when the mortgage is first issued . 
Insurance companies and mortgage companies ought to be willing to offer such products if they can hedge the home-price risks in liquid derivative markets . 
Creating these retail products will require time , experimentation , and some real innovation . 
Over the next decade , we might expect that a broad spectrum of insurance , lending , and securities companies will become involved . 
As these retail products start to take shape , they will spur increased activity in the derivative markets . 
As the new risk-management industry develops , its components will gradually boost each other . 
These developments offer hope that current and future homeowners will be spared the agony of worrying about the vicissitudes of the real estate market . 
They will be able to leave the game of real estate speculation to professionals and rest assured about the value that they have accumulated in their homes . 
That is good news , because there is a pretty strong chance that we are going to see major price declines in a number of cities around the globe in the next few years , and these price declines will cause real pain to many homeowners . 
But if the momentum toward better risk management continues , it will be the last real estate cycle in which homeowners are unable to protect themselves .
