Developing Economies &quot; Long-Term Financing Shortfall 
WASHINGTON , DC - Since the global financial crisis , &quot; banking &quot; has practically become a swear word . 
But , while banks undoubtedly have the capacity to inflict serious damage on economies and livelihoods , a well-run financial system can offer significant benefits . 
A growing body of evidence , highlighted in the World Bank Group &apos;s recent Global Financial Development Report , shows that financial institutions and markets have a profound influence on economic development , poverty alleviation , and the stability of economies worldwide , and that a pragmatic assessment of the state &apos;s role in finance is warranted . 
On the surface , the most unusual feature of the ongoing financial crisis is that developed economies have been affected much more strongly and directly than developing economies , many of which have learned from previous crises , put their fiscal houses in order , made progress on structural reforms , and improved supervision and regulation . 
But this distinction misses the larger point : the quality of policy matters much more than the level of economic development . 
Some financial systems in developed economies - for example , in Australia , Canada , and Singapore - have shown remarkable resilience , while others have gotten into trouble . 
At the same time , the focus on financial reform in developed economies , while warranted , has contributed to complacency in developing economies . 
For example , many are facing their own version of the &quot; too big to fail &quot; problem - which the crisis reinforced - but have done little to address it . 
Moreover , measures taken during the crisis may have helped to mitigate financial contagion , but some do not support robust long-term development of the sector . 
Many developing economies weathered the crisis at the cost of massive direct state intervention , while their financial sectors lack breadth and access . 
The financial crisis has had a particularly profound impact on the supply of finance at longer maturities . 
To some extent , this is understandable , given the focus on short-term liquidity and capital flows . 
But the sharply decreased availability of longer-term funding is heightening financial-sector vulnerabilities . 
While developing economies &quot; share of the global economy has risen from roughly one-third to one-half over the last decade , developed economies continue to dominate the supply of long-term funding . 
The mismatch between the time horizon of available funding and that of investors and entrepreneurs , particularly those in developing economies , is a source of vulnerability that acts as an impediment to growth . 
Several factors have diminished investors &quot; willingness to extend long-term credit . 
The financial crisis reduced private financiers &quot; risk appetite , making long-term exposures unappealing . 
Net private capital flows , particularly to developing economies , have become more volatile . 
Private capital , which accounts for more than 90 % of capital flows to developing economies , will remain the dominant source of long-term financing . 
But the availability of long-term capital appears to have been impaired , as traditional providers of equity to infrastructure projects , for example , have become less able or willing to invest . 
Financing from banks has also been constrained owing to deleveraging , particularly by European banks . 
The new Basel III package of global banking reforms may increase funding costs further for some borrowers , while reducing the availability of finance , especially for longer-term debt . 
Institutional investors , such as pension funds and life-insurance companies , with more than $ 70 trillion in assets , are a major additional source of long-term capital . 
While such investment in long-term productive assets like infrastructure is essential to generating the income that these investors demand , less than 1 % of pension-fund assets are allocated directly to infrastructure projects . 
Meanwhile , net savings in developing economies are increasing , and low yields in developed economies are providing an incentive for investors to channel more resources to productive investment in these countries . 
Recently , several banks have been able to issue long-term bonds at affordable rates . 
Another promising development is the growth of local-currency bond markets . 
These markets can become a strong source of financing for longer-term domestic investment , including in infrastructure , thereby reducing currency risk for borrowers and investors . 
But strong and sustainable development of these markets cannot occur without institutional and regulatory reforms that ensure an attractive environment , as well as capacity-building in both the public and private sectors to facilitate further market development . 
Investors &quot; willingness to make capital available over the longer term for infrastructure development , job creation , and economic growth depends on their perceptions of various kinds of risk . 
Policymakers can manage these perceptions by improving public-sector governance , ensuring sound macroeconomic management , promoting a transparent and supportive legal framework for private-sector activity , building debt-management capacity , and protecting investors from expropriation . 
Moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to financial reform means committing the time and effort needed to understand the political economy , as well as establishing partnerships with representatives from government , civil society , and the private sector . 
Such tailored solutions are essential to bolstering economic performance in developed and developing economies alike .
