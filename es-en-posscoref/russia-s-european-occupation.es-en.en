Russia \ u0027s European Occupation 
When Gazprom , Russia &apos;s natural gas monopoly , cut off supplies to Ukraine and Georgia in January 2006 , the move was widely seen as a clear warning of the Kremlin &apos;s willingness to use its energy resources to exert political influence over Europe . 
Twelve months later , Russia drummed home the significance of that act by shutting off oil supplies to Belarus for three days , causing a ripple effect on shipments to Western Europe . 
Despite these supply-side threats , there have been few signs of an effective European Union-wide policy that would reduce dependence on Russian energy . 
The European Commission &apos;s energy proposals , issued in January , are a step in the right direction . 
But they will have little direct effect on Russia &apos;s energy relations with Europe , because they do not oblige Russia to adopt more competitive and transparent energy transport and investment policies . 
On the contrary , European countries continue to forge bilateral deals with Russia , with little consideration for common EU interests . 
The West European EU members have shown scant concern over Russian pressure tactics against the new members in Central and Eastern Europe , calling into question the extent of EU solidarity regarding energy supplies . 
Since the Kremlin interrupted energy supplies to the Baltic states in 1990 in a futile attempt to stifle their independence movements , it has continued to use pipeline politics against countries such as Poland , Latvia , and Lithuania - all new EU members . 
For them , and for new democracies like Ukraine , Georgia , and Moldova , Russian energy dominance and its political consequences remain a serious threat . 
Russia has profited from Europe &apos;s disarray by moving to cement greater long-term European dependence on its energy , particularly natural gas by continuing its divide-and-rule tactics toward European governments . 
Since January 2006 , Moscow has negotiated separate deals with energy companies from Germany , France , Italy , Hungary , Serbia , Slovakia , and Denmark that could undercut Europe &apos;s efforts to build additional pipelines aimed at bypassing Russia &apos;s near monopoly of supplies from Central Asia . 
It initially appeared that Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel would be more sensitive to the energy security of Central and Eastern Europe . 
However , Merkel approved the expensive Northern Europe Gas Pipeline ( NEGP ) beneath the Baltic Sea , negotiated between her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder and President Vladimir Putin , and strongly opposed by fellow EU member Poland , which the pipeline will bypass . 
The NEGP will cost at least eight times as much as the alternative Yamal II pipeline , which would have gone overland through Poland . 
Despite the European Commission &apos;s good intentions , the EU &apos;s larger members continue to resist submitting to a common EU energy policy . 
In mid-November , EU foreign ministers failed to agree on a common approach to Russian energy - just as reports resurfaced that Russia may seek to establish a natural gas cartel similar to OPEC . 
The EU &apos;s political will to counter its increasing dependence on Russia in the immediate future is thus open to serious doubt . 
Indeed , for the next five to ten years , Russia will be able to fulfill its gas contracts in Europe only by monopolizing exports of gas to Europe from Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan . 
But the EU so far has chosen to ignore that Gazprom &apos;s monopoly is a clear violation of the anti-trust and competition policies of the revised Rome Treaty and WTO obligations . 
Russia clearly believes that the current tight world energy market and high prices give it enough leverage over the West to maintain its current approach . 
Russia consistently refuses to allow Western companies the same access to Russian facilities that Russian state energy companies already enjoy in Europe and the United States . 
That is likely to remain true as long as the West fails to adopt an energy strategy that causes the Kremlin to change course . 
Putin denies that Russia is using its energy resources to coerce European governments , arguing that the decrease in gas supplies to Western Europe during the cut-off of gas to Ukraine in January 2006 was the result of Ukrainian &quot; theft . &quot; 
In its dispute with Belarus in January 2007 , Russia leveled a similar accusation of theft from the oil pipeline that crosses the country . 
It also claims to have been subsidizing the price of energy to the Commonwealth of Independent States , when in reality it is the Central Asians who have been subsidizing Russia to an even greater extent . 
Although the EU Commission appears to be committed to building a more open , competitive energy market in Europe , action against Russia &apos;s noncompetitive practices within the EU has taken a back seat to internal differences over takeover battles for national energy &quot; champions &quot; involving companies from other member states . 
Russia must be convinced that its resources will be far more valuable if they are opened to international investment , managed transparently , and operated according to the legal and commercial rules of the international trading system . 
But that is unlikely in the absence of strong and unified European action .
