November &apos;s Diplomatic Harvest 
MADRID - Jihadism is flourishing . 
Tensions with Russia are flaring . 
Agreement between Iran and the &quot; E3 + 3 &quot; ( Britain , France , and Germany from the European Union , plus China , Russia , and the United States ) remains elusive , with domestic politics in all of the negotiating partners introducing additional complexities into an already complicated process . 
US President Barack Obama , having suffered a severe midterm election defeat , must now deal with a Congress under full Republican control . 
In the eurozone , economic growth remains anemic , causing leaders to look inward . 
One could easily conclude that the world is being sucked into a vortex of instability . 
Concluding a deal with Iran on its nuclear program remains an unfinished item of global business . The negotiations in Vienna failed to produce a deal that is critically important to both regional and global stability . 
But the atmosphere is positive : Iran fulfilled its obligations under last year &apos;s interim agreement , and the E3 + 3 showed a willingness to end sanctions . 
The deadline to finalize negotiations has now been extended to June 2015 . The West has a unique window of opportunity . 
Achieving a deal is essential to avoid a new - and potentially catastrophic - conflict in the Middle East . 
Negotiation and diplomacy are the only way to resolve the Iranian nuclear question in the long term and to normalize Iran &apos;s critical role in regional security . 
There were several other promising developments in November . 
The new European Commission took office on November 1 , launching its mandate with a plan to boost public and private investment by â‚¬ 315 billion ( $ 392 billion ) over the next three years . 
Similarly , in Brisbane , the G-20 approved a package of economic measures to boost global economic growth by 2.1 percentage points by 2018 . 
Moreover , the 20 leaders endorsed the Global Infrastructure Initiative , which will create a Global Infrastructure Hub to serve as a knowledge-sharing platform for governments , the private sector , development banks , and international organizations . 
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in Beijing featured several important agreements as well . 
At the top of the list is the announcement of a US-China bilateral climate deal , which helps to smooth the path toward the crucial United Nations Climate Change Summit ( COP21 ) in Paris next year . 
If India were to adopt a similar stance , hope would grow stronger still . 
The UN &apos;s Green Climate Fund , meanwhile , has been boosted with additional financing pledges - another critical stepping stone on the path to Paris . 
The Fund , financed by developed countries , is designed to help developing countries meet the costs of mitigating and adapting to climate change . 
The US has now pledged $ 3 billion , with Japan promising $ 1.5 billion , augmenting previous pledges by France and Germany - funding that is essential to ensure developing countries &quot; fruitful participation at COP21 . 
The EU is also looking forward to Paris , following the European Council &apos;s approval of the European Commission &apos;s 2030 framework for climate and energy policies . 
Targets have been set for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions , increasing the percentage of renewables in Europe &apos;s energy mix , enhancing energy efficiency , and promoting electricity interconnection among member states . 
China and the US reached another bilateral deal at the APEC summit , which will serve to unblock the World Trade Organization &apos;s Information Technology Agreement and thus eliminate tariffs on information and communication technology . 
The Obama administration has estimated that , once applied , this agreement - which was frozen for a year as China sought to protect its domestic industry - will increase annual global GDP by $ 190 billion . 
At the same summit , Chinese President Xi Jinping announced steps toward a 17-member Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific ( FTAAP ) . 
Such trade cooperation could provide a much-needed boon to diplomacy in a region that is under perpetual geopolitical strain . 
Meanwhile , the US-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) also moved forward in Beijing . 
Though the two projects are commonly viewed as rivals , owing to China &apos;s absence from the TPP , the initiatives could be complementary . 
If strategic vision prevails and points of convergence are found , stability in Asia could be strengthened significantly . 
The same is true of the Middle East , where an unscheduled meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council in November brought some unexpected good news : Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , and the United Arab Emirates committed to return their ambassadors to Qatar after an eight-month absence . 
In Tunisia , meanwhile , the technocratic government that had taken charge for several months was replaced democratically . 
In a parliamentary election at the end of October , the secular Nidaa Tounes ( Call of Tunisia ) party scored a victory over the Islamist Ennahda ( Renaissance ) . 
One month later , Tunisians went to the polls to elect a president for the first time since President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was removed in 2011 . 
Tunisia remains a beacon of hope in the region . 
The emergence of a coalition government shows that the damaging winner-take-all paradigm of Middle East politics can be broken , and that power can be shared . 
The Arab world should take note . 
In Jerusalem , mounting tension over holy sites has highlighted the difficulty of moving the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward . 
With an escalation in violent attacks in the city - a sacred place for both sides - the conflict has taken on a more religious face . 
And , given this context , the Israeli government &apos;s legislative proposal to define Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people - thereby giving preference to the state &apos;s Jewish identity over its democratic character and endangering minority rights - is especially pernicious . 
Today , more than ever , I believe the peace process could take a new turn if the EU officially recognized Palestine - whose interim institutions it continues to support . 
The effectiveness of such concerted action was on welcome display in November . 
We should strive to maintain the momentum .
