Happiness by Design 
LONDON - Over the last few years , thinking on happiness has undergone a sea change . 
Until recently , it seemed sensible to assume that our happiness was determined by factors such as luck , fate , or genes that are beyond our control . 
It was easy to believe that , in the words of Samuel Beckett , the &quot; tears of the world are a constant quantity . &quot; 
But new discoveries point to fresh ways of thinking about happiness , as something over which we do have control and that can be taught . 
Happiness depends on many factors , from obvious things , like enjoying good health and close relationships , to others that might not seem immediately intuitive , like engaging in generous behavior . 
Some of these can be learned or cultivated , and courses that teach positive mental habits - like appreciating things that matter or avoiding dwelling on setbacks - have demonstrated measurable improvements in wellbeing . 
The Dalai Lama recently helped launch a series of such courses in London , developed by Action for Happiness , an organization that I helped found . 
Whole societies can also try to improve their happiness . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron introduced the measurement of happiness into national statistics , and more recently German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a program to promote citizen &apos;s wellbeing . 
How countries are governed has a huge impact on happiness . 
Success in maintaining peace , the rule of law , and a functioning democracy matter greatly . 
There is very strong evidence that these tend to correlate with wellbeing , and probably cause it , and there are obvious reasons why this should be the case . 
Being in a country at peace does not of itself make everyone happy ; but it removes many obvious causes of unhappiness . 
Individual policies can have a big impact , too . 
There is strong evidence for encouraging greater attention to mental and physical health , and for placing a high priority on reducing unemployment . 
We simply don &apos;t know how different policies on marriage will affect wellbeing , even though we know that marriage correlates with it . 
Similarly , we don &apos;t know whether more or less compulsory schooling , or which curriculum , has a positive or negative effect . 
Overall , education has surprisingly little clear impact on happiness ( perhaps because expectations often rise faster than the possibility of meeting them ) . 
Nor is the science unambiguous about whether rights to parental leave and flexible time , later retirement ages , or laws promoting work sharing , have the effects one might expect . 
The problem is partly a matter of insufficient evidence ; but complex interactions sometimes make tracing causation difficult . 
At first glance , one might think that lowering taxes would make people happier , because having more disposable income increases their wellbeing . 
By contrast , at the level of individual programs , there is now a great deal of strong evidence . 
There are now detailed manuals describing the effects of different kinds of exercise on both physical and psychological health . 
For the elderly , remaining active is a clear source of happiness , whether that means exercising , volunteering , or engaging in paid employment . 
( Indeed , a survey in Canada found that paid employment was the most satisfying activity for people over the age of 65 . ) 
There is also mounting evidence that policy interventions in schools to promote resilience or empathy can have a positive impact on wellbeing . 
It is impossible , of course , to eliminate suffering . 
It is part of the human condition . 
The tears of the world need not be a constant quantity .
