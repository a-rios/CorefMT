The Arrogance of Chinese Power 
NEW DELHI - Success breeds confidence , and rapid success produces arrogance . 
That , in a nutshell , is the problem that both Asia and the West face in China , and which has been demonstrated once again at the G20 summit in Canada . 
Rising economic and military power is emboldening China &apos;s government to pursue a more muscular foreign policy . 
Having earlier preached the gospel of its &quot; peaceful rise , &quot; China is now beginning to take the gloves off , convinced that it has acquired the necessary muscle . 
That approach became more marked with the global financial crisis that began in the fall of 2008 . 
China interpreted that crisis as symbolizing both the decline of the Anglo-American brand of capitalism and the weakening of American economic power . 
That , in turn , strengthened its two-fold belief - that its brand of state-steered capitalism offers a credible alternative , and that its global ascendance is inevitable . 
Chinese analysts gleefully point out that , after having sung the &quot; liberalize , privatize , and let the markets decide &quot; song for so long , the United States and Britain took the lead in bailing out their financial giants at the first sign of trouble . 
By contrast , state-driven capitalism has given China economic stability and rapid growth , allowing it to ride out the global crisis . 
Indeed , despite perpetual talk of an overheating economy , China &apos;s exports and retail sales are soaring , and its foreign-exchange reserves now approach $ 2.5 trillion , even as America &apos;s fiscal and trade deficits remain alarming . 
That has helped reinforce the Chinese elite &apos;s faith in the country &apos;s fusion of autocratic politics and state capitalism . 
The biggest loser from the global financial crisis , in China &apos;s view , is Uncle Sam . 
That the US remains dependent on China to buy billions of dollars worth of Treasury bonds every week to finance its yawning budget deficit is a sign of shifting global financial power - which China is sure to use for political gain in the years ahead . 
The current spotlight may be on Europe &apos;s financial woes , but the bigger picture for China is that America &apos;s chronic deficits and indebtedness epitomize its relative decline . 
Add to the picture the two wars that the US is waging overseas - one of which is getting hotter and increasingly appears unwinnable - and what comes to mind among China &apos;s leaders is the historian Paul Kennedy &apos;s warning about &quot; imperial overstretch . &quot; 
Against that background , China &apos;s growing assertiveness may not surprise many . 
Deng Xiaoping &apos;s advice - &quot; Hide your capabilities and bide your time &quot; - no longer seems relevant . 
Today , China is not shy about showcasing its military capabilities and asserting itself on multiple fronts . 
As a result , new strains are appearing in China &apos;s relationship with the West , and were in full view at last year &apos;s Copenhagen climate-change summit , where China - the world &apos;s largest polluter with the fastest-growing carbon emissions - cleverly deflected pressure by hiding behind developing countries . 
Since then , China has added to the strains by continuing to manipulate the value of the renminbi , maintaining an abnormally high trade surplus , and restricting goods manufactured by foreign companies in China from entering the domestic market . 
On political and security issues , China has aroused no less concern . 
For example , China &apos;s expanding naval role and maritime claims threaten to collide with US interests , including America &apos;s traditional emphasis on freedom of the seas . 
Yet the plain truth is that America &apos;s economic and military travails are crimping its foreign-policy options vis-Ã -vis China . 
The US seems more reluctant than ever to exercise the leverage that it still has to press China to correct policies that threaten to distort trade , foster huge trade imbalances , and spark greater competition for scarce raw materials . 
By keeping its currency undervalued and flooding world markets with artificially cheap goods , China pursues a predatory trade policy . 
This undercuts manufacturing in the developing world more than in the West . 
But , by threatening to destabilize the global economy , China threatens Western interests as well . 
Furthermore , its efforts to lock up supplies of key resources mean that it will continue to lend support to renegade regimes . 
Still , America shies away from exerting any kind of open pressure on China . 
US policy today is a study in contrast relative to America &apos;s unabashed exercise of leverage in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , when Japan emerged as a global economic powerhouse . 
Japan kept the yen undervalued and erected hidden barriers to foreign goods , precipitating strong pressure - and periodic arm-twisting - by the US for Japanese concessions . 
Today , the US cannot adopt the same approach with China , largely because China is also a military and political power , and the US depends on Chinese support on a host of international issues - from North Korea and Burma to Iran and Pakistan . 
By contrast , Japan has remained a fully pacifist economic power . 
It matters greatly that China became a global military player before it became a global economic player . 
China &apos;s military power was built by Mao Zedong , enabling Deng to focus single-mindedly on rapidly building the country &apos;s economic power . 
Before Deng launched his &quot; four modernizations , &quot; China had acquired global military reach by testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile , the DF-5 , with a range of 12,000 kilometers ( 7,500 miles ) , and developing a thermonuclear warhead . 
Without the military security that Mao created , it might not have been possible for China to build economic power on the scale that it has . 
In fact , the 13-fold expansion of its economy over the past three decades generated even greater resources for China to sharpen its military claws . 
China &apos;s rise thus is as much Mao &apos;s handiwork as it is Deng &apos;s . 
But for Chinese military power , the US would treat China like another Japan .
