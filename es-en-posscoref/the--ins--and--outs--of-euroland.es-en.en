The &quot; Ins &quot; and &quot; Outs &quot; of Euroland 
The smooth appearance of euro notes and coins has triggered a valuable reconsideration of European monetary union &apos;s ultimate aims . 
Two views - active since the process began in the late 1980 &quot; s - persist . 
The first claims that monetary union merely seeks to consolidate the Single Internal Market in goods and services ; the second sees the euro as a mechanism to forge closer political union . 
These two motives are complementary , but the euro &apos;s physical arrival has re-opened old divisions over its economic and political aspects and , to some extent , between the euro &apos;s &quot; ins &quot; and &quot; outs &quot; among EU members . 
The euro &apos;s economic impact should not be underestimated . 
Although the biggest step in monetary union was taken when national currencies became subdivisions of the euro , the arrival of euro notes and coins delivers additional advantages . 
Transparency of retail prices will invigorate competition . 
Prices and inflation expectations will now tend to be guided more and more by a common inflation rate - kept low and stable by joint monetary policy - and not by erratic and divergent national prices . 
A deepening of financial integration can also be expected . 
Finally , the irreversible nature of monetary unification will become ever more evident to citizens . 
But will completion of monetary unification enhance Europe &apos;s political union ? 
To obtain a clearer picture , questions related to monetary union should be kept distinct from wider political issues . 
The framework for the joint monetary policy negotiated at Maastricht focussed on medium-term price stability , which is to be assured by the European System of Central Banks - the Eurosystem - made as independent as possible from national and European political authorities . 
Elements that might undermine this framework were addressed by targeting three potential sources of friction : national deviations in budgetary policies . 
These were constrained by upper limits to budget deficits , later elaborated in the Stability and Growth Pact ; obligations to intervene in defence of particular levels for the euro in external currency markets . 
These were made unlikely by giving a major role in designing them to the Eurosystem , committed to internal objectives and hence instinctively averse to undertaking external commitments ; prudential supervision of financial institutions which could in crisis lead to large injections of liquidity . 
These were left in the hands of national regulators . 
Despite the Eurosystem &apos;s clear assignment of responsibilities , this framework remains somewhat flawed . 
The Euro area &apos;s cyclical weakness since early 2001 , the external weakness of the euro , and the ongoing difficulties in harmonising the framework for financial markets ( inciting controversies about legislative control between European institutions ) all provide proof that establishing pro-growth policies while fighting inflation is a difficult trick to pull off . 
Progress in all three areas can only be resolved through continuous coordination of the discretionary powers retained by EU members , which is not what the Maastricht Treaty envisioned . 
To remedy this , the next steps for the euro will demand greater political union , though in a narrow sense . 
Indeed , the comparatively weak economic performance of the euro area has not been addressed . 
Compared to the US since 1995 , European industry &apos;s productivity has failed to pick up . 
But Europe &apos;s macroeconomic and monetary policy options here are , unfortunately , already visible . 
Although various benchmarks were developed over the past five years and an emphasis on structural issues is growing , the gap between rhetoric and achievement remains wide . 
It is to be hoped that the forthcoming Barcelona European Council will boost momentum . 
Certainly the lack of distraction from divergence within the euro area makes attention to structural issues easier . 
Can the euro also spur more political union beyond that need for monetary policy ? 
Major spill-over effects have always seemed questionable . 
Recent advances in joint policies - the European arrest warrant , for example - lead some to see a link , but this does not seem realistic . 
Fundamental policy issues are finding support on their own merits . 
Outside the euro area - in the United Kingdom , Sweden and Denmark - the impressively smooth debut of euro notes and coins has been applauded . 
Public opinion about euro membership has shifted most clearly in Sweden , where a weak Swedish krona is also inspiring a change of heart toward euro membership . 
In response to this , Prime Minister Person , indeed , has moved forward the scheduled referendum on euro membership to 2003 , after parliamentary elections in September this year . 
The Swedes , moreover , are not alone in rethinking their standoffish approach to the euro . 
Norway &apos;s traditional hostility to EU membership has lessened , say pollsters , since the euro &apos;s appearance in shops ; and the UK government has hardened its commitment to evaluate Britain &apos;s potential membership by mid-2003 . 
Aside from continuing to meet the other criteria of the Maastricht Treaty ( as they probably will ) , Sweden and the UK will need to convince their publics and their euro area partners that they can manage their economies without a national monetary policy , and negotiate an entry rate for their currency . 
If they do , the euro can be introduced in 2006 at the earliest , assuming a positive outcome a 2003 referendum . 
In Denmark , my own country , economic readiness is not the issue . 
Indeed , Danish voters have seen most of the benefits of euro membership already , due to the Danish krone &apos;s unchanged link first to the DM , then to the euro , over the past 15 years . 
Public rejection of the euro in the September 2000 referendum hinged on a failure by the euro &apos;s supporters to explain the difference between this uncontested policy and full euro participation . 
As a result , Denmark may be the last to vote , but not necessarily to join . 
Despite the different starting positions , Sweden , Denmark , and the UK have this in common : they prefer to see the euro as a cap stone in constructing the Single Market rather than as a stepping stone to closer union . 
The more the second interpretation is stressed , the more reluctant they become . 
They prefer remedying structural impediments to growth as an important objective in its own right , not as a step on the road to federalism . 
So those enthusiasts who link the euro to political union do their cause a disservice by hazarding public support for adopting the euro .
