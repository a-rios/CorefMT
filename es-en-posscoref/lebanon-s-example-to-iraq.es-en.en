Lebanon &apos;s Example to Iraq 
Iraq &apos;s voters have spoken . 
Now a new government must be formed and a new constitution written . 
Lebanon , argues Paul Salem , may provide a guide for those Iraqis who seek a constitution that can reconcile the country &apos;s Shi-ite , Sunni , Kurdish and Turkmen communities . 
Rebuilding a country devastated by war , riven by internal divisions , and plagued by foreign intervention in a part of the world as volatile as the Middle East is one of the most daunting tasks imaginable . 
Add to it a desire to create a democracy from scratch in a region characterized by authoritarian government and that task becomes almost impossible . 
But the challenge has been met before , in Lebanon after its nightmarishly long civil war ( 1975-1990 ) . 
So perhaps there are lessons from that experience that can be applied in Iraq . 
Both Lebanon and Iraq comprise ancient communities living within the borders of states outlined in the 20th century . 
Although a strong sense of modern nationalism exists in both , ancient ethnic and religious communities play a critical role in shaping political identities and public life . 
Both countries also possess a fairly educated middle class and intelligentsia alongside more traditional elites . 
Both societies have a mixed history that included periods of peaceful , cooperative politics and periods of violence and bloodletting . 
One lesson from Lebanon &apos;s recent history stands out above all others : in divided political societies such as Lebanon and Iraq , coalition democracy is preferable to majoritarian winner-takes-all democracy . 
In Lebanon , the danger of one community monopolizing power over others is avoided because the Lebanese constitution imposes permanent power-sharing arrangements on all major communities . 
These arrangements apply both to parliament and the executive branch . 
In Lebanon &apos;s post-war parliament , seats are widely distributed among the various confessional communities , so that none feels excluded or fears losing political representation if it loses numerical superiority . 
In the executive branch , the council of ministers is balanced among Christians and Muslims in order to encourage , indeed force , cooperation and to avoid the risk of domination the fear of oppression by one group . 
In addition , the three major posts in government - the president of the republic , the prime minister , and the speaker of parliament - are counterbalanced in power and are also divided among the three largest communities . 
Moreover , coexistence and cooperation among the various communities is enshrined as a basic principle in Lebanon &apos;s constitution . 
Promoting any policy or law that increases communal tension is unconstitutional . 
In Iraq , some of these steps have already been taken . 
The Governing Council and the interim Government are both coalition bodies of the Lebanese type , comprising studied proportions from the three main communities in Iraq - the Shia , the Sunni , and the Kurds . 
Iraq , however , still has neither a parliament nor a constitution . 
With regard to parliament , there is no need to follow Lebanon &apos;s rigid apportionment of seats according to confessional identity . 
All the same , Iraq &apos;s parliamentary electoral law should be drawn up to take two important factors into account : 
· First , districts should be drawn to ensure that all major communities in the country are amply represented in parliament and none feels left out ; 
· Second , electoral districts should be multi-member districts and should , as far as is possible , include populations of more than one community in order to encourage cross-communal politics and the election of moderate politicians that can speak to all communities and that know how to resolve tensions among them . 
Until elections can be organized , it may be necessary to do what was done in Lebanon just after the war : appoint members to an interim Iraqi parliament . 
This could be described as a temporary advisory parliament , or &quot; Shura Council , &quot; but it should include hundreds of figures from throughout the country and they should be selected through the Governing Council and interim Government after nationwide consultations . 
Such a large Shura Council would provide a broad Iraqi face and body to the interim administration . 
It would also serve to create the beginnings of Iraqi parliamentary and local politics in advance of the elections , which should be held as soon as possible . 
In terms of drawing up a new constitution , the Lebanese principle of government by power sharing must be a central pillar . 
Beyond the balance of representation in parliament and government , a balance might need to be struck between the highest offices of state . 
As in Lebanon , Iraqis might need to create a balance between the offices of president , prime minister , and speaker of parliament , and to agree that a leader of a different major community will occupy each . 
This would reinforce the need for inter-communal cooperation and minimize the risk of a return to any form of communal domination or dictatorship . 
As someone who knew Lebanon in its darkest hours - when Lebanon was a by-word for chaos , violence , and political hopelessness - and who saw its rapid reconstitution as a functioning participatory political system and its astonishing return to normalcy , I know that Iraq can be politically rebuilt . 
Like the Lebanese , Iraqis have suffered enough . 
By recognizing a permanent say in politics for all of the country &apos;s mutually suspicious communities , Iraqis can pull back from the brink and build for themselves an Iraq worthy of their talents and their history .
