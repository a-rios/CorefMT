Copycat Capitalists 
ZURICH - It is all too easy to envy China . 
At current growth rates , the Chinese economy will double in size in only nine years , raising an estimated 100 million people above the poverty line in the process . 
Compare this to the major economies of the Western world . 
The eurozone &apos;s GDP remains mired below 2008 levels , and the United States last enjoyed Chinese-style growth back in 1984 , when gasoline was $ 1.10 a gallon and the first Apple Macintosh was rolling off the production line in California . 
Given the West &apos;s anemic performance in recent years , it is hardly surprising that envy of China &apos;s economic dynamism has manifested itself in official policy . 
Recent examples range from direct market interventions ( such as America &apos;s effort to boost its automotive industry via the &quot; cash for clunkers &quot; program ) , to the British government &apos;s attempt to reflate the United Kingdom &apos;s housing market by guaranteeing mortgages under its &quot; Help to Buy &quot; scheme . 
Even hitherto independent central banks have not escaped the creep toward state-sponsored capitalism . 
The US Federal Reserve has been gently encouraged to buy 90 % of annual net issuance of US Treasury bills , effectively funding the US fiscal deficit and ensuring , via the resulting negative real interest rates , that businesses and individuals wishing to save , rather than spend , will lose purchasing power by doing so . 
Ironically , Western countries are shifting to statism at the very moment that China appears to be heading in the opposite direction - witness its recent moves to liberalize its financial system . 
In just 10 years , the share of state-directed bank lending in China has fallen from 92 % of new credit creation to less than half . 
But copycat capitalism is not without risk ; indeed , it is unlikely to end without someone getting scratched . 
The West &apos;s efforts to emulate China are hindered by its inability to replicate the conditions of Chinese growth , such as labor mobilization , and its unwillingness to pursue practices such as the one-child policy . 
Thus , the West &apos;s forays into state capitalism are more likely to result in the misallocation of capital , more in the vein of China &apos;s vastly oversupplied steel industry but without the stellar headline economic performance of the national economy . 
Coming from the other direction , China &apos;s crawl toward a more market-oriented brand of capitalism also has potential pitfalls . 
We need look no further than its recent problems with so-called wealth-management products ( WMPs ) for evidence that reform intentions without adequate regulatory institutions can cause problems . 
WMPs were commonly marketed to individuals as alternatives to deposit accounts . 
But the funds contributed were then invested in riskier assets that included &quot; trust loans &quot; to companies such as property developers . 
The number of trust loans rose by 40 % in 2012 , which triggered serious concern among China &apos;s authorities that WMPs could become the next financial &quot; WMDs , &quot; because banks had strong incentives to make uneconomic lending decisions . 
The subsequent state-directed WMP regulation put a brake on credit creation and sent Chinese stock markets plunging . 
Ultimately , however , the measures should enable China &apos;s shadow banking system to continue to grow at a more manageable pace and in a more sustainable way . 
There is a risk that the lack of growth in the West may make economic transformation in the direction of the Chinese model appear more urgent to its governments . 
But the Western economic model has brought about unprecedented standards of living . 
This achievement should not be dismissed because of one crisis , no matter how prolonged , and the economic model that produced today &apos;s living standards should not be cast aside without careful consideration . 
By contrast , China &apos;s rapid growth should not obscure its need for economic change . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , at some point between 2020 and 2025 , China will pass what economists call the &quot; Lewis Turning Point , &quot; at which a country &apos;s vast supply of low-cost workers is exhausted and factors such as labor mobilization provide a diminishing contribution to growth . 
With smaller demographic and resource advantages in the coming years , the consequences of capital misallocation , unavoidable under a state-directed economic model , will come to the fore . 
As China &apos;s recent experience with WMPs demonstrates , economic change can expose old problems and create new ones . 
Ironically , China &apos;s transformation from a state-directed to a market-driven economy may require the greatest amount of planning of all .
