The Risk of European Centralization 
FRANKFURT - For many European leaders , the eurozone crisis demonstrates the need for &quot; more Europe , &quot; the final aim being to create a full-fledged political union . 
Given the continent &apos;s history of war and ideological division , and today &apos;s challenges posed by globalization , a peaceful , prosperous , and united Europe that wields influence abroad is surely a desirable goal . 
But major disagreements about how to achieve that goal remain . 
Historically , monetary union was regarded as the route to political union . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , the French economist Jacques Rueff , a close adviser to Charles de Gaulle , argued that &quot; L &apos;Europe se fera par la monnaie , ou ne se fera pas &quot; ( Europe will be made through the currency , or it will not be made ) . 
Germany &apos;s President Richard von Weizsäcker echoed this view almost a half-century later , declaring that only via a single currency would Europeans achieve a common foreign policy . 
More recently , German Chancellor Angela Merkel asserted that &quot; if the euro fails , Europe will fail . &quot; 
But the crisis confronting &quot; Europe &quot; is not so much about political union as it is about European Economic and Monetary Union . 
If anything , efforts to hold EMU together may have taken us further from the goal of a common foreign policy by re-igniting within member states ( regardless of whether they give or receive financial aid ) nationalist resentments that we hoped had died long ago . 
Politicians launched monetary union in 1999 , despite warnings that the constituent economies were too diverse . 
It wasn &apos;t long before several states violated the Stability and Growth Pact . 
Later , the eurozone &apos;s &quot; no bail-out &quot; principle was abandoned . 
The response to these failings , however , was a demand for greater economic integration , including such intermediate steps as the creation of a &quot; European finance minister &quot; or an EU commissioner with sweeping powers to facilitate closer integration . 
Such ideas , of course , ignored the central issues of national sovereignty and democracy , and specifically the privilege of nationally elected governments and parliaments to determine their own taxes and public spending . 
The fact that sovereign member states did not deliver on their European commitments is hardly a convincing argument for giving up sovereignty now . 
In short , all of the measures that would implicitly support political union have turned out to be inconsistent and dangerous . 
They have involved huge financial risks for eurozone members . 
They have fueled tensions among member states . 
Perhaps most important , they have undermined the basis on which political union rests - namely , persuading European Union citizens to identify with the European idea . 
Public support for &quot; Europe &quot; depends to a large degree on its economic success . 
Indeed , it is Europe &apos;s economic achievements that give it a political voice in the world . 
But , as the current crisis indicates , the best-performing EU economies are those with ( relatively ) flexible labor markets , reasonable tax rates , and open access to professions and business . 
Moreover , the impetus for economic reform has come not from the EU , but from national governments , one of the most successful examples being &quot; Agenda 2010 , &quot; launched a decade ago by then-German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder . 
Numerous academic studies , following the work of the American economic historian Douglass North , support the notion that it is competition among states and regions that lays the groundwork for technological progress and economic growth . 
The total failure of the Lisbon Agenda , launched in March 2000 to make the EU &quot; the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-base economy in the world &quot; demonstrated the weakness of a centralized approach . 
Arguably , in earlier centuries , it was competition within Europe that generated unparalleled dynamism and prosperity across much of the continent . 
To be sure , this was also a time of wars . 
However , this does not mean that centralization is the best - much less the only - way to guarantee peace . 
But , once again , EU leaders responded by concluding the opposite : the Lisbon Agenda &apos;s failure was interpreted as justifying still more harmonization and centralization of national policies . 
True to form , in his &quot; State of the Union &quot; address to the European Parliament in September 2012 , European Commission President José Manuel Barroso called for a more powerful Commission . 
This approach - harmonization , coordination , and centralized decision-making - continues to be regarded as a panacea for Europe &apos;s problems . 
It is the sort of pretense of knowledge that the economist Friedrich von Hayek denounced as a recipe for constraining freedom and ensuring economic mediocrity . 
Indeed , the European project should start from the premise that appropriate institutions , property rights , and competition , together with a growth-friendly tax system and solid fiscal policies , are the basis of economic success . 
The dangers of a centralizing approach can also be seen in the relationship between the 17 current eurozone members and the 11 non-eurozone EU states . 
As the former press on with greater integration , the adverse economic consequences of doing so are likely to deter the latter from EMU participation ( which may be another sign that institutional competition cannot be suppressed forever ) . 
There are plenty of areas in which common action at the EU level is both appropriate and efficient . 
Environmental policy is clearly one . 
But centralization of economic decision-making , as an end in itself , cannot underpin a prosperous and powerful Europe . 
Jean Monnet , one of the EU &apos;s founding fathers , once said that , given the chance to start the European integration process again , he would have begun with culture - a dimension in which we neither need nor want centralization . 
Europe &apos;s cultural richness consists precisely in its diversity , and the basis for its finest achievements has been competition between people , institutions , and places . 
Its current economic malaise reflects European leaders &quot; prolonged efforts to deny the obvious .
