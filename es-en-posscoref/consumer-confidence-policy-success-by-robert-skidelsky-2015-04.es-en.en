Debating the Confidence Fairy 
LONDON - In 2011 , the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman characterized conservative discourse on budget deficits in terms of &quot; bond vigilantes &quot; and the &quot; confidence fairy . &quot; 
Unless governments cut their deficits , the bond vigilantes will put the screws to them by forcing up interest rates . 
But if they do cut , the confidence fairy will reward them by stimulating private spending more than the cuts depress it . 
Krugman thought the &quot; bond vigilante &quot; claim might be valid for a few countries , such as Greece , but argued that the &quot; confidence fairy &quot; was no less imaginary than the one that collects children &apos;s teeth . 
Cutting a deficit in a slump could never cause a recovery . 
Political rhetoric can stop a good policy from being adopted , but it cannot stop it from succeeding . 
Above all , it cannot make a bad policy work . 
I recently debated this point with Krugman at a New York Review of Books event . 
My argument was that adverse expectations could affect a policy &apos;s results , not just the chances that it will be adopted . 
For example , if people thought that government borrowing was simply deferred taxation , they might save more to meet their expected future tax bill . 
On reflection , I think I was wrong . 
The confidence factor affects government decision-making , but it does not affect the results of decisions . 
Except in extreme cases , confidence cannot cause a bad policy to have good results , and a lack of it cannot cause a good policy to have bad results , any more than jumping out of a window in the mistaken belief that humans can fly can offset the effect of gravity . 
The sequence of events in the Great Recession that began in 2008 bears this out . 
At first , governments threw everything at it . 
This prevented the Great Recession from becoming Great Depression II . 
But , before the economy reached bottom , the stimulus was turned off , and austerity - accelerated liquidation of budget deficits , mainly by cuts in spending - became the order of the day . 
Once winded political elites had recovered their breath , they began telling a story designed to preclude any further fiscal stimulus . 
The slump had been created by fiscal extravagance , they insisted , and therefore could be cured only by fiscal austerity . 
And not any old austerity : it was spending on the poor , not the rich , that had to be cut , because such spending was the real cause of the trouble . 
Any Keynesian knows that cutting the deficit in a slump is bad policy . 
A slump , after all , is defined by a deficiency in total spending . 
To try to cure it by spending less is like trying to cure a sick person by bleeding . 
So it was natural to ask economist / advocates of bleeding like Harvard &apos;s Alberto Alesina and Kenneth Rogoff how they expected their cure to work . 
Their answer was that the belief that it would work - the confidence fairy - would ensure its success . 
More precisely , Alesina argued that while bleeding on its own would worsen the patient &apos;s condition , its beneficial impact on expectations would more than offset its debilitating effects . 
Buoyed by assurance of recovery , the half-dead patient would leap out of bed , start running , jumping , and eating normally , and would soon be restored to full vigor . 
The bleeding school produced some flaky evidence to show that this had happened in a few instances . 
Conservatives who wanted to cut public spending for ideological reasons found the bond vigilante / confidence fairy story to be ideally suited to their purpose . 
Talking up previous fiscal extravagance made a bond-market attack on heavily indebted governments seem more plausible ( and more likely ) ; the confidence fairy promised to reward fiscal frugality by making the economy more productive . 
With the help of professors like Alesina , conservative conviction could be turned into scientific prediction . 
And when Alesina &apos;s cure failed to produce rapid recovery , there was an obvious excuse : it had not been applied with enough vigor to be &quot; credible . &quot; 
The cure , such as it was , finally came about , years behind schedule , not through fiscal bleeding , but by massive monetary stimulus . 
When the groggy patient eventually staggered to its feet , the champions of fiscal bleeding triumphantly proclaimed that austerity had worked . 
The moral of the tale is simple : Austerity in a slump does not work , for the reason that the medieval cure of bleeding a patient never worked : it enfeebles instead of strengthening . 
Inserting the confidence fairy between the cause and effect of a policy does not change the logic of the policy ; it simply obscures the logic for a time . 
Recovery may come about despite fiscal austerity , but never because of it . 
Although Krugman invented his discourse for an American readership , it perfectly fits the British case as well . 
In his first budget in June 2010 , Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned that &quot; you can see in Greece an example of a country that didn &apos;t face up to its problems , and that &apos;s a fate I am determined to avoid . &quot; 
In presenting the United Kingdom &apos;s 2015 budget in March , Osborne claimed that austerity had made Britain &quot; walk tall &quot; again . 
On May 7 , that claim will be put to the test in the UK &apos;s parliamentary election . 
British voters , still wobbly from Osborne &apos;s medicine , can be forgiven if they decide that they should have stayed in bed .
