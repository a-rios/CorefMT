Greece and the Limits of Anti-Austerity 
CAMBRIDGE - Is austerity dead ? 
At last month &apos;s G-8 meeting at Camp David , the German-led austerity program for the eurozone &apos;s troubled southern members ran up against substantial resistance . 
Likewise , France &apos;s recent presidential election bolstered those who argue that Europe must grow its way out of its debt-heavy public sector , rather than aim for immediate fiscal orthodoxy . 
And there is no guarantee that Greece &apos;s newly elected center-right New Democracy party , which favors honoring the country &apos;s bailout terms , will be able to form a majority government . 
The United States , by contrast , has pursued expansionary and growth-oriented macroeconomic policies since the 2007-2009 financial crisis , despite massive budget deficits . 
Thus far , judging from the modest recovery in the US versus non-recovery in Europe , American policy accommodation is performing better than European austerity . 
But simply choosing between expansion and austerity is not the whole story . 
Macroeconomic policies interact with on-the-ground microeconomic realities in subtle but powerful , rarely remarked-upon ways . 
Simply put , Europe &apos;s microeconomic structure makes the same growth-based macroeconomic policies less effective in the European Union than in the US . 
Here &apos;s why : macroeconomic easing , by lowering interest rates or otherwise pumping money into the economy , aims to increase economic activity . 
With more money moving around , businesses rehire employees and ask existing employees to work more hours . 
Entrepreneurs considering whether or not to start a business decide to proceed , and their bank lends them the money to make the new business viable . 
The newly hired workers and newly formed businesses spend money , which induces more hiring , more start-ups , and yet more spending . 
The economy grows , yielding higher tax revenues , thereby helping governments to put their fiscal house in order . 
The country grows its way out of its economic problems . 
But the EU cannot realize this scenario as easily as the US can , because micro-level rules in the EU generate friction that slows that kind of an expansion . 
The EU &apos;s stricter labor rules are a well-known and often-cited example . 
European labor-market rigidities mean that it is difficult in many EU countries to downsize a company . 
Anticipating that difficulty , companies are less willing to hire in the first place , until they are sure that long-term demand for their products is sufficient to justify long-term hires . 
Hence , even if businesses get easier access to money and loans , many firms will still decline to hire on a large scale , fearing that they would be saddled with a large payroll in a future downturn . 
For example , The Economist &apos;s recent portrait of Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti shows that Italy continues to be stymied by labor rules that make businesses reluctant to expand beyond 15 employees ( after which it becomes hard for a firm to downsize ) . 
To work smoothly , expansive macroeconomic policies require compatible microeconomic rules . 
There is some irony in the fact that the strongest proponent of austerity has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government , because Germany , particularly under her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder &apos;s Social Democrat-led government , did much more to liberalize the country &apos;s rules for labor and business than other EU governments . 
Expansive , growth-based policy could work better in Germany than in many eurozone countries for which it is being prescribed . 
Rules that impede business start-ups may be an even more important obstacle to making monetary expansion effective . 
It is simply too difficult to launch many types of businesses in many places , and to expand those that are started . 
Necessary licenses are often not routinely obtained . 
The simple start-up paperwork is still more burdensome than it is in the US . 
Indeed , while this process has become easier in Europe in recent years , the World Bank estimates that it still takes twice as long to start up a small business in Greece and much of the rest of the EU as it does in the US - and four times as long in Spain . 
While the relative absence of Facebook-style mega-entrepreneurial successes in Europe is regularly bemoaned , the difficulties of opening hairdressers , basic retailers , and simple mail-order businesses may have an equally profound overall effect . 
Consider taxi licensing . 
Many people can drive a cab , including many who are unemployed , but not so many can get permission to do so in many major cities in Europe and the US . 
Imagine much of the economy organized like the taxi industry . 
Most kinds of economic stimulus won &apos;t generate more taxis , until entry restrictions are reduced . 
Magda Bianco , Silvia Giacomelli , and Giacomo Rodano , researchers at the Bank of Italy , report that these institutional roadblocks to expansion remain substantial in Italy . 
A factory might get easier access to funds , and it might see more demand for its products , but , rather than hiring new workers , it might decide to raise its prices . 
A potential competitor might consider entering that market ; but , given substantial regulatory entry barriers , it might ultimately decide to remain in its current business . 
Expansionary monetary policy in such an environment might fail . 
Perhaps for this reason , France &apos;s new president , Fran√ßois Hollande , favors using the government to direct specific outcomes - for example , by hiring 60,000 new teachers . 
One can imagine a grand bargain in Europe , with expansionary macroeconomic policies coupled with the easing of microeconomic impediments . 
But existing businesses and already-employed workers prefer the status quo , and can powerfully inhibit policymakers . 
There may be more than a little of this in Greek politics , and that of other EU countries .
