The Lasting Damage of Iraq 
MADRID - The folding of the American flag in Iraq amid a collapse of public security and a severe crisis in the country &apos;s fragile political order seals a tragic chapter in the history of the United States . 
Violently torn by religious and ethnic rivalries , Iraq is in no condition to play its part in America &apos;s vision of an Arab wall of containment of Iran . 
Unless the Iranian regime is terminally humbled in the course of its showdown with the West over its nuclear program , the more plausible scenario is that Shia-dominated Iraq moves closer to Iran &apos;s strategic orbit rather than become part of America &apos;s regional designs . 
After ten years of war , more than a hundred thousand casualties , mostly Iraqis , and an astronomical cost of almost $ 1 trillion , the US leaves behind an Iraq that is neither more secure nor especially democratic . 
It is , however , one of the most corrupt countries ( 175th out of 178 , according to Transparency International ) . 
The war that was supposed to be a central pillar in a drive to restructure the Middle East under America &apos;s guidance ended up marking the decline of its influence there . 
The Middle East sucked America &apos;s resources and energies , but the results are desperately meager . 
Turkey , with its &quot; dangerous foreign minister &quot; ( as Ahmet Davutoğlu was portrayed in a US cable released by WikiLeaks ) , is defining its regional policies in a way that frequently clashes with US designs . 
Israel rebuffed US President Barack Obama &apos;s peace initiatives , and even refused to extend a freeze on settlement construction for a mere three months , despite a lavish offer of strategic compensation . 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas defiantly disregards the US threat to stop aid if Palestine persists in its bid for United Nations membership . 
And Arab leaders ridicule Obama &apos;s naïve trust in negotiations as a way to cut short Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
The &quot; Arab awakening &quot; is about homegrown democratic change ; it is therefore a repudiation of both US complicity with local autocrats and the American paradigm , so evident in Iraq , of &quot; democracy &quot; imported on the wings of F-16s . 
The future remains uncertain , but the assumption that Arabs &quot; demands for fair governments and civil dignity can still be repressed , like a genie squeezed back into the bottle , is a self-serving fantasy of irremediable autocrats - and of some in the West . 
Arab governments &quot; policies will become more reflective of their peoples &quot; wishes , even when these are represented , as we now see , by Islamist majorities . 
America was taught the hard way that it can live with Islamists ; after all , it leaves behind a Shia-led government in Baghdad that has close ties to Iran , and is engaging the Taliban in Afghanistan as a last-resort strategy to exit an unwinnable war . 
The Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis in Egypt , al-Nahda in Tunisia , and the Party of Justice and Development in Morocco are now the West &apos;s interlocutors . 
Israel &apos;s diplomacy , however , is a particularly startling example of cognitive dissonance . 
Neither dominating the politics of the region nor truly leading it , the US is a spectator in the unfolding Arab drama . 
The integrity of Iraqi statehood remains uncertain , as is the outcome of the Egyptian revolution . 
Saudi power and US acquiescence managed to stifle democratic agitation in the Gulf , but the region &apos;s dynasties cannot expect to slip history &apos;s noose once and for all . 
Meanwhile , US weakness has opened the door to Russia &apos;s resumption of Cold War practices in the region . 
Russia &apos;s diplomatic protection of Syria &apos;s brutal regime from the ire of the international community , and of Iran from the West &apos;s drive to cripple its economy , stems from its conviction that ten years of costly and inconclusive wars have seriously diminished America &apos;s global standing . 
The Kremlin &apos;s defiance of the US extends to southwest Asia as well . 
Russia &apos;s ambassador to NATO , Dmitry Rogozin , threatened recently that his country might shut down the US supply line to Afghanistan . 
America , in short , faces a time of reckoning that should usher in a period of comprehensive strategic rebalancing . 
The legacy of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , like that of the Vietnam War before them , is bound to teach the US caution in the use of military might . 
It should also counsel a greater emphasis on international legitimacy and multilateral alliances in dealing with hostile regimes . 
Most fundamentally , America &apos;s excessive focus on the Middle East will now need to be tempered by a shift to other regions of vital national interest . 
This should lead to healthy economic competition with a rising China , alongside protection of US interests in the Pacific Rim now threatened by China &apos;s expanding influence . 
It might also mean engaging Russia in the hope that its emerging civil society will give rise to a more truly democratic regime , one that might be ready to supersede the traumas of the Cold War and be drawn to closer cooperation with the West . 
At the same time , the dismissive attitude towards Europe that one senses in America is unjustified and self-defeating . 
Intimate ties with a revitalized European Union remain vital to the global projection of Western values and interests . 
Sterile isolationism runs counter to America &apos;s self-conception as a nation with a global mission . 
But the dire legacy of its two recent wars calls for a focus on internal improvement . 
Enhancing America &apos;s soft power , safeguarding its supremacy as a hub of unparalleled innovation , upgrading its decaying infrastructure and faltering educational system , and ridding itself of its addiction to foreign credit might do more to secure America &apos;s global leadership than the most successful of wars .
