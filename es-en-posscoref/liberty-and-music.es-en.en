Liberty and Music 
NEW YORK - North Korea , officially known as the Democratic People &apos;s Republic of Korea , is one of the world &apos;s most oppressive , closed , and vicious dictatorships . 
It is perhaps the last living example of pure totalitarianism - control of the state over every aspect of human life . 
Is such a place the right venue for a Western orchestra ? 
Can one imagine the New York Philharmonic , which performed to great acclaim in Pyongyang , entertaining Stalin or Hitler ? 
All totalitarian systems have one thing in common : by crushing all forms of political expression except adulation of the regime , they make everything political . 
There is no such thing in North Korea as non-political sports or culture . 
So there is no question that the invitation to the New York Philharmonic was meant to burnish the prestige of a regime , ruled by The Dear Leader , Kim Jong-Il , whose standing is so low - even in neighboring China - that it needs all the burnishing it can get . 
Interviews with some of the musicians revealed an awareness of this . 
A violinist was quoted as saying that &quot; a lot of us are ... not buying into this party line that music transcends the political . &quot; 
She was &quot; sure that it &#91; would &#93; be used by Pyongyang and our own government in attempting to make political points . &quot; 
The conductor , Lorin Maazel , who chose a program of Wagner , Dvorak , Gershwin , and Bernstein , was less cynical . 
The concert , he said , would &quot; take on a momentum of its own , &quot; and have a positive effect on North Korean society . 
Well , he would say that , wouldn &apos;t he ? 
But could he possibly be right ? 
No one , not even Maazel , pretends that one concert by a great Western orchestra can blow a dictatorship away , but authoritarians &quot; wariness of the subversive power of music dates back to Plato &apos;s Republic . 
In Plato &apos;s view , music , if not strictly controlled , inflames the passions and makes people unruly . 
He wanted to limit musical expression to sounds that were conducive to harmony and order . 
This , more or less , has been the line taken by dictatorships as well . 
The officially prescribed musical diet of North Koreans consists of patriotic hymns to the Communist Party , odes to the Dear Leader , to his father , the Great Leader , Kim Il-Song , and to the heroic spirit of the Korean people . 
Almost nothing else is permitted - except in the inner sanctum of the rulers themselves . 
The Dear Leader &apos;s son , Kim Jong-chol , is said to be a fan of Eric Clapton . 
An invitation has now gone out to the British rock star to perform in North Korea , which really would be something new . 
Rock music was severely restricted in Communist dictatorships , just as jazz was in Nazi Germany , for all the Platonic reasons : uncontrolled passions were seen as a threat to the perfect order of the state . 
Precisely because of this , &quot; forbidden &quot; music was politicized . 
Subversive youths in Hitler &apos;s Germany - the &quot; Swing Jugend &quot; - secretly listened to jazz . 
The air of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was electric with the imported sounds of the Rolling Stones and Frank Zappa &apos;s Mothers of Invention . 
After the Soviet tanks put an end to the Prague Spring , a Russian policeman threatened one young Czech that he would &quot; beat the Zappa music out &quot; of him . 
VÃ¡clav Havel was a fan of Zappa . 
Of course , that was the point . 
Hlavsa and his long-haired fans , celebrated in Tom Stoppard &apos;s brilliant play , Rock n &apos;Roll , didn &apos;t want the state to spoil their party . 
They didn &apos;t care what the commissars thought . 
They wanted to dance to their own tunes . 
Obviously , Dvorak and Wagner are not Zappa and the Stones . 
When the Stones themselves finally performed in China , in 2003 , they agreed to cut some of their racier numbers from the program , because , as their local promoter put it , &quot; They know there are differences between Chinese and Western cultures . 
They don &apos;t want to do anything against the Chinese government . &quot; 
So much for the spirit of 1968 . 
Nevertheless , Maazel may have a point . 
Performing good music in North Korea just might have a positive effect . 
Stalin &apos;s empire needed no foreign classical orchestras . 
They had enough of their own . 
China no longer needed the Stones , either . 
There are plenty of rock bands in China already . 
For half a century , the North Koreans have been deprived of any art , ideas , or music not authorized by the state . 
They were told that North Korea was a heroic little country besieged by Satanic enemies , led by the United States . 
This permanent diet of paranoia has created something akin to a nationwide insane asylum , where ignorance , terror , and suspicion rule . 
In such conditions , even a conventional program of classical music by the New York Philharmonic comes as a gust of fresh air . 
It may not topple the dictatorship , but it will offer some solace to those who are forced to live in it .
