Ukraine &apos;s Vote , Russia &apos;s Fate 
STOCKHOLM - When Ukraine &apos;s voters go to the polls on October 26 , not only the fate of their country will be at stake ; so will the future of a significant part of Europe . 
To put it simply : the future of Ukraine will decide the future of Russia , and the future of Russia will have a substantial impact on the future of Europe . 
When the Soviet Union collapsed more than two decades ago , and Ukraine opted for independence , many expected the country to do better than Russia in the years to come . 
But events turned out differently . 
The reversal of sought-after economic diversification , and the reduction of &quot; modernization &quot; to little more than a slogan , caused no immediate concern . 
By contrast , Ukraine became the worst managed of all the post-Soviet states , with cronyism and corruption thwarting productive capacity , and causing the country to fall further and further behind other post-communist countries in transition . 
Most notable is the comparison with Poland : at independence , the two countries had roughly the same GDP per capita ; today , Poland &apos;s is more than three times higher . 
The Orange Revolution in 2004 was a failure for most Ukrainians . 
The hoped-for break with the past did not occur , as political infighting among the country &apos;s new leaders blocked the implementation of any serious reform agenda . 
But 2004 was also a bitter failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin , who tried to bring his favored presidential candidate , Viktor Yanukovych , to power in Kyiv by supporting massive vote manipulation . 
The failure was a bitter blow to the Kremlin , one that was neither forgiven nor forgotten . 
Then , in 2010 , the Orange Revolution &apos;s failure brought Yanukovych to power in a free and fair election , and in 2012 Putin selected himself for a third presidential term in Russia . 
The creation of a new Eurasia Union was a key part of his platform . 
In the meantime , Ukraine had been negotiating with the European Union for a free-trade and association agreement since 2007 , and these talks were completed in early 2012 . 
Though entirely compatible with the existing free-trade agreement between Ukraine and Russia , the proposed pact with the EU certainly was not compatible with Putin &apos;s Eurasia project . 
A little more than a year ago , the Kremlin began its offensive to turn Ukraine away from an EU agreement that was supported even by Yanukovych and his Party of Regions . 
The rest - Yanukovych &apos;s renunciation of the EU agreement , the popular uprising that ousted him in response , two invasions by Russia , and thousands of people killed in the country &apos;s eastern Donbas region - is history . 
The Kremlin is seeking more than the annexation of Crimea and control over the Donbas rust belt ; its aim is to prevent Ukraine from going West , force it to turn East , and quash any risk within Russia &apos;s wider orbit of further revolutions like the one that brought down Yanukovych . 
Western sanctions against Russia have certainly highlighted the seriousness with which the EU and the United States view Putin &apos;s efforts to challenge and undermine the core principles of European security and international law . 
At the end of the day , it is only the strength and determination of Ukraine that can block Russia &apos;s revisionist ambitions . 
But to strengthen a Ukraine plagued by corruption and cronyism , and heavily burdened by Russian aggression and destabilization , is no easy task . 
The election on Sunday must give rise to a government that is truly determined to bring radical reform to the country . 
Such a government must be able to count on the strong and determined support of the wider international community . 
A revised and reinforced International Monetary Fund package is imperative if the necessary reforms are to be enacted . 
The country &apos;s irrational energy policy , based on immensely wasteful subsidies to consumers , must be fundamentally altered . 
If this agenda succeeds , the Kremlin &apos;s revisionist bid will be blocked ; as this becomes apparent , there might even be an opening for a new and urgently needed wave of reform in Russia itself . 
Putin is in no hurry , but he clearly knows what he wants . 
Then , set on a course of continued confrontation with the West , Russia might hunker down into a siege mentality , with the risk that the Kremlin might seek to compensate for economic failure with further revisionist behavior . 
Anyone familiar with the aggressively nationalist posturing of Russian state-controlled media nowadays knows the danger of this . 
It is in these circumstances that the real danger for Europe could arise . 
The ambitions of such a Russia will not stop at the Dnieper River . 
Revisionism might turn into outright revanchism as the Kremlin seeks to counter-balance internal weakness with demonstrations of external strength . 
By that time , it might be too late to stop a slide toward a wider confrontation . 
That is why the emergence of a strong and democratic Ukraine from decades of failure is needed now . 
The election this Sunday is crucial for Ukraine , but it also holds the key to encouraging the transformation of Russia into a true member of the democratic European family .
