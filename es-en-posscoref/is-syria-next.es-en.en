Is Syria Next ? 
The recent allegation by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that Syria is smuggling war materiel into Iraq raises the ominous prospect that America &apos;s attention will turn toward Damascus the moment it is finished with Baghdad . 
Rumsfeld &apos;s charge - vehemently denied by Syria - now tops a long list of unresolved issues in Syria &apos;s relations with the US : Syria &apos;s open-ended military intervention in Lebanon and continued support of Hezbollah there ; its supposed involvement in the 1982 suicide attack in Beirut that killed 241 US Marines ; its continued support of various &quot; outlawed &quot; Palestinian groups ; and its allegedly growing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons . 
Indeed , Syria has long been included on the US State Department &apos;s list of nations that support terrorism . 
For these reasons , Syria could well become a potential target for American military adventurism . 
Even before the onset of the current hostilities , the possibility was raised by certain members of the Bush Administration , such as Richard Perle , and conservative media commentators , all of whom would gladly add Syria to the &quot; Axis of Evil . &quot; 
Recognizing this possibility , the Syrian regime has made clear its opposition to the American war in Iraq , which has been branded by President Bashir Assad and other senior officials as &quot; a war of aggression . &quot; 
Top-level thinking about the risks that Syria runs were recently made clear in an interview that President Assad gave to a Lebanese newspaper . 
Assad compared the situations in Lebanon and Iraq , insisting that Iraq could achieve what Lebanon had already accomplished two decades before , namely the forced withdrawal by American and British troops in the face of steadfast , bloody resistance . 
&quot; The US and Britain will not be able to control Iraq , &quot; Assad claimed . 
Declaring that &quot; Arab popular resistance &quot; to the American invasion has spread through the region , Assad referred to the increasing numbers of Arab , including Syrian , &quot; volunteers &quot; who have gone to Iraq to fight alongside Saddam &apos;s soldiers . 
The Arabs , Assad said , would resist American efforts &quot; to rearrange the region as it sees fit &quot; in order to control its oil wealth and accommodate Israeli interests . 
In response , he called for the enactment of the Arab Mutual Defense Pact . 
Recently , the 90-year-old Grand Mufti of Syria , Sheik Ahmad Kiftaro , called on Muslims worldwide to carry out &quot; martyr operations &quot; against American interests , a call that could not have been made without advance government approval . 
It seems that the Syrian regime is painting itself into a dark and dreary corner , a development that could set the stage for a potential showdown with the US in the not-so-distant future . 
This said , however , there is also an unpublicized aspect of Syrian-American relations to consider . 
Since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on September 11 , 2001 , security cooperation between the two countries seems to have intensified . 
The Syrian intelligence apparatus has provided much valuable information on the activities of Muhammad Atta and others suspected of involvement in those attacks , as well as information about other al-Qaeda activities . 
There are even indications of some Syrian intelligence-sharing with the Americans regarding Iraqi military readiness in the weeks preceding the attacks . 
This should not be surprising , for Syria &apos;s rulers over the last thirty years have proven skillful at hedging their bets . 
It is even possible that the regime &apos;s loud anti-American stance might be meant to hide some secret arrangement with the Americans , especially regarding the Kurds and Iraqi opposition members living in Syria . 
Nonetheless , if the Americans win in Iraq - which they must in order to maintain their global credibility as a superpower - their relations with their new Syrian neighbors will not be easy . 
Resolving all outstanding issues will not happen quickly . 
Moreover , the Syrian view of the Arab-Israeli dispute cannot be glossed over , because Syrian agreement is necessary for any peaceful settlement . 
If the US attempts to isolate Syria , it will not have an easy time of it . 
Damascus maintains good political and economic relations with Russia , China , and key EU members , especially France , with its paternalistic attitude towards its former colony and its young president . 
On the other hand , with Americans controlling Iraq , Syria will find itself surrounded by three unfriendly ( if not outright hostile ) and allied neighbors : the Americans in the East , and the Turks and Israelis in the north and south , both of which occupy Syrian territories . 
Nonetheless , outstanding issues between Syria and the US would be better resolved using smart diplomacy than smart bombs . 
Considering the evidence on display in Iraq , Syrian leaders must be wondering whether the Bush administration is capable of thinking in these terms . 
At the same time , will Syria &apos;s new rulers prove capable of striking the kind of Machiavellian bargain for which the late Syrian president , Hafiz Al-Assad , was famous ? 
Because the country &apos;s rulers include many members of his team , such a possibility probably exists . 
But are the Americans willing to see it ?
