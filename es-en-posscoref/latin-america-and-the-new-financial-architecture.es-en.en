Latin America and the New Financial Architecture 
Argentina &apos;s ongoing crisis demonstrates , if demonstrations are still needed , that emerging market crises remain with us . 
Indeed , so frequent have such crises been over recent years that we seem almost to take them for granted . 
In the 120 months of the 1990s , 40 emerging markets ( i.e. , 33 % of the world &apos;s developing countries ) , experienced serious financial distress . 
So it is time to ask : what viable steps have been taken to create a financial architecture able to contain and reduce this number ? 
Real progress , I believe , has taken place , but it is insufficient and asymmetric . 
Positive developments include the expansion and adaptation of new IMF lending facilities for crisis prevention and management , as well as an increase in the IMF &apos;s total resources . 
Important institutional innovations have also been introduced , including creation of the Financial Stability Forum . 
Based on a British initiative and developed by Hans Tietmeier ( former head of the Bundesbank ) , the Forum will attempt to identify sources of systemic risk and develop consistent financial regulation across different financial sectors and countries . 
The FSF was set up by the G-7 in early 1999 . 
The Forum was initially made up of just the G-7 countries , but four new members - Australia , Holland , Hong Kong and Singapore - were added this year . 
In addition to national representatives , the Forum &apos;s members include international organizations concerned with financial stability . 
In its first year of operation , the Forum commissioned five working groups to examine issues affecting international financial stability , including highly leveraged institutions , capital flows and offshore financial centers . 
Yet , despite these developments , overall progress remains insufficient . 
An international financial system to support - not undermine - growth and development is what the times demand . 
The steps that need to be taken internationally for such a system to take root have already been mapped in what was achieved by individual countries over recent decades , when institutions , such as central banks and regulatory agencies , were created to help manage the rapid growth of private banks and financial markets . 
Drawing a parallel from this national evolution , developing a financial architecture to perform similar functions in the international arena is essential . 
The rapid , and seemingly ceaseless globalization of private capital makes this more urgent by the day . 
Such architecture requires : 
appropriate transparency and international regulation of loan and capital markets . 
Such regulation should discourage severe surges of short-term capital flows to developing countries because , when these are reversed , crisis usually follows ; 
provision of sufficient official liquidity in when countries face distress . 
One valuable suggestion is to transform the IMF Contingency Credit Line , which has never been used since its creation two years ago . 
This Contingency Credit could be adapted so that any country could use it in times of crisis , provided it received a positive report in its annual consultation with the IMF ; 
a general framework for working out a country &apos;s debt problems , to be activated when crises occur . 
Progress in reforming the international financial system is also disfigured by the fact that developing countries , most particularly those in Latin America , have not been allowed to participate sufficiently in the key discussions and institutions where decisions are made . 
For example , Latin American countries have little voice in the Basle Committees and in the Financial Stability Forum . 
But a Financial Stability Forum without the emerging economies of Latin America is a bit like Hamlet without the Prince ! 
A more sensible policy would be to have a few emerging market countries participate - on a rotating basis - in this Forum . 
The issues discussed profoundly affect their economies . 
Moreover , they can offer valuable insights on financial instability as they have borne the brunt of recent crises . 
Across Latin America policymakers fear that if insufficient changes are made in the international financial architecture , there is a serious risk that frequent and costly crises will continue to occur . 
This would not only have deeply damaging economic and political effects for those countries , such as Argentina today , but could also threaten the public good of global financial stability .
