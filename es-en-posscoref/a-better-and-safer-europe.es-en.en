A Better and Safer Europe 
To many , myself included , NATO &apos;s enlargement to take in , among others , the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania  -  which were once Soviet republics  -  is an impossible dream come true . 
When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago , expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people . 
Until recently , Russia &apos;s robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle , because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called &quot; near abroad &quot; as a zone of special interest and influence . 
NATO &apos;s enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country &apos;s &quot; zone . &quot; 
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors ( Hitler &apos;s Reich and Stalin &apos;s USSR ) , which they endured for half-a-century  -  will not be repeated . 
By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics , Europe is made a safer place , and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire . 
Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO &apos;s political values , including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities . 
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement . 
Rightly so : enlargement of NATO is not an &quot; expansion &quot; that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms . 
On the contrary , expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union . 
The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law , due in no small part to NATO demands . 
Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia , Europe , and America now work out their disagreements . 
Indeed , enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad . 
This small piece of Russia , with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea , is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania , two future members of the EU . 
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper . 
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime . 
This , in turn , created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia . 
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month , the conclusion is clear : Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in , thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002 . 
But this is no cause for complacency . 
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety . 
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly . 
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights . 
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations . 
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave . 
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad &apos;s fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures . 
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow . 
In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU , where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea . 
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself . 
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams . 
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true . 
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe .
