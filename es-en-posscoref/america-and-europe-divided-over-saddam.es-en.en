America and Europe Divided Over Saddam 
Talk is growing of a change in US defense doctrine to allow for pre-emptive strikes on states that harbor weapons of mass destruction . 
That talk is sending shudders across Europe , where many people connect it with America &apos;s oft-stated desire to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq . 
Ever since the Gulf war , Iraq has been a source of friction among the western permanent members of the UN Security Council . 
By the end of 1999 , divergence was complete : the United States and Britain were employing their air power to enforce the no-fly zones while France joined Russia and China in abstaining on resolution 1284 . 
As this UK-sponsored resolution was meant to bring the Iraq issue back to the Security Council after the withdrawal of the UN weapons inspectors and subsequent American air strikes of December 1998 , hope for progress on Iraq within the Security Council was scant . 
This rapidly changed after last September 11 th . 
On May 14 , 2002 , the Security Council gave the tottering sanctions regime a new lease on life by unanimously adopting a simplified screening procedure . 
Even Iraq showed signs of being prepared to consider a possible return of the UN weapons inspectors . 
At first sight this seems to bode well for the transatlantic relationship . 
In reality , the current relaxation is more likely a lull before the storm . 
Most Europeans take it for granted that the US will attack Iraq , and that this act of unilateralism , coming in the wake of all the other irritants such as the ABM Treaty , the Kyoto Agreement , the steel tariffs and the International Criminal Court , will have a devastating effect on transatlantic relations . 
Europe would be ill-advised to become mesmerized by this approaching disaster . 
Everyone understands that the Iraqi government &apos;s improved attitude is caused by the Bush administration &apos;s sabre-rattling , but no one can tell whether this is a prelude to an inevitable war or a stratagem to make Iraq cooperate with UN weapons inspectors . 
Obviously , the US cannot remove this uncertainty without robbing the sabre-rattling of its beneficial effect . 
Given this ambiguity , there remains time for Europe to engage the US in a serious discussion of the options for dealing with Saddam . 
The common aim should be to remove the threat posed by a dictator with so well-documented a predilection for weapons of mass destruction . 
The options vary from resumed inspections to &apos; regime change &apos; . 
There are arguments which make the choice far less clear-cut than it may seem . 
Several of these are also being advanced within the Bush administration . 
Europe can constructively participate in such discussion provided it first clears the way by : 
1. ridding itself of its constant 
2. showing some understanding for the view of some in the Bush administration that the US should not be bogged down by a continent that is soft , decadent and moralizing . 
This is not a pleasant way of putting it , but many Americans remember how on two occasions in the former Yugoslavia - a pre-eminently European theatre - Europe was helpless until American warplanes showed up ; 
3. making clear that Europe and the US are 
This debate about how to deal with Saddam might go as follows . 
It is not difficult to overthrow Saddam , but it is impossible to predict who or what will take his place . 
Iraq may even disintegrate , leaving us with a much stronger Iran , also a member of the 
Moreover , Saddam may already possess a weapon of mass destruction but has been deterred from using it . 
Once he is attacked by the US , he may use it against Israel , which will retaliate . 
So it may well be wiser to induce Iraq to readmit the UN weapons inspectors and make sure they can do their job . 
This will not entirely remove the Iraqi threat but will make it controllable . 
Should this be the outcome , European governments would breathe a sigh of relief . 
But the debate may also go the other way . 
Saddam will cooperate with UN inspectors only as long as the American threat remains , and the US may conclude that it cannot afford that . 
If President Bush then opts for regime change , Europe should not opt out . 
This is easier said than done . 
Many Europeans will argue that they cannot condone military action without a Security Council mandate . 
But they already did , twice . 
They condoned or even supported American air strikes against Baghdad in December 1998 , and they supported or even participated in NATO &apos;s air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in March 1999 . 
True , some will say , but that was under the Clinton administration . 
If Europe conveys the impression that its friendship with America depends on who wins the US presidential elections , it is likely to freeze the transatlantic relationship for years . 
That hardly seems a rational policy for a continent in profound transition .
