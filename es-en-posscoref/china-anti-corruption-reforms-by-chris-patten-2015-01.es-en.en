Emperor Xi &apos;s Dilemma 
LONDON - I once spoke with a Chinese academic whose parents had fled China during the 1930s , appalled by the greed and corruption rampant in the country before the communist revolution . 
They returned after 1949 , leaving comfortable jobs in California universities to help build a new China . 
The academic &apos;s father suffered during the anti-rightist campaigns of the 1950s and the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s , and died a broken man after a prison sentence . 
But her mother always remained faithful to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . 
She regarded her husband &apos;s travails as a personal price paid for a greater good . 
In her last years , however , the academic &apos;s mother grew increasingly depressed by the rising tide of corruption . 
When she died , it was with the sense that she and her husband had offered a lifetime of sacrifice in vain . 
The poisonous immorality of the 1930s had returned . 
Today , the fight against corruption is consuming a large share of Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s energy and attention - and rightly so . 
The anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International lists China as the world &apos;s 80th most corrupt country , between Greece and Tunisia . 
As story follows story of government officials flashing Rolex watches , driving Maseratis , and being overly familiar with overseas tax havens , public distrust of the CCP is growing . 
So , does China &apos;s most powerful leader in a generation have enough clout to stop the rot ? 
After the death of Mao Zedong , his successor , Deng Xiaoping , decided that one-man rule was too dangerous for China , because it exposed the country to the worst excesses of capricious tyranny . 
So , from Deng &apos;s retirement in 1992 until Xi &apos;s selection for the top job two years ago , China &apos;s leadership was collective and consensual . 
Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao were less emperors than primi inter pares . 
Now , however , the pendulum has swung back toward &quot; imperial &quot; leadership , after a growing perception of drift at the top of the Party hierarchy led many to worry that big decisions - not least those regarding economic reforms - were being ducked . 
Since assuming his post , Xi has rapidly consolidated all of the main levers of power , elbowing aside his prime minister , the ineffectual Li Keqiang . 
Moreover , many CCP members have been spooked by the arrest of Bo Xilai , a top official whom some suspected of plotting a power grab . 
And they have likely become even more frightened following the arrest of Zhou Yongkang , the longtime head of China &apos;s security services and the highest-ranking member of the Politburo yet detained . 
The success of Xi &apos;s anti-corruption campaign is crucial for China &apos;s future . 
It is the only way to ensure that merit trumps favoritism - and thus to end the country &apos;s colossal misallocation of resources . 
When credit is politicized , investment priorities quickly become distorted . 
Xi is what the Chinese call a &quot; princeling , &quot; the son of a Party leader and military hero . 
He behaves with aristocratic self-confidence . 
But even he has had to obey the first rule of the game : Don &apos;t name the corrupt until the Party decides who they are . 
Call it graft-busting with Chinese characteristics : It would have been straightforward ( though politically hazardous ) to insist that public officials declare their sources of income . 
Instead , the leadership has been arresting the activists who have called for it to do just that . 
When Bloomberg and the New York Times published details about top leaders &quot; families ( including Xi &apos;s ) who had their snouts deep in the trough , both came under severe official attack and were forced to curtail their China coverage rapidly . 
Some speculate that one reason Xi may have tapped former Vice Premier Wang Qishan to lead the fight against corruption is that he and his wife have no children - no grasping offspring to compromise his efforts . 
Xi plainly has no intention of changing China &apos;s political culture , even though it leans against the task that he has set out to accomplish . 
Transparency , pluralism , the rule of law , a free press , and democratic accountability are the best guarantees of honesty in public life - and the surest route to securing the sort of economic reforms that Xi wants . 
China has increasingly sought to project the success of its markets-and-mandarins development model .
