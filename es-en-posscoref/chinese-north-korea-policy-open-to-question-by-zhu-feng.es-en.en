North Korea &apos;s Step Too Far ? 
BEIJING - After nearly a month of belligerent bluster from North Korea , China appears to have had enough , ending its silence about North Korea &apos;s brinkmanship and suddenly roaring its disapproval of its ally &apos;s reckless threats . 
China &apos;s exceptional tough talk does not necessarily mean that it intends to abandon Kim Jong-un &apos;s regime ; but , at the very least , it does suggest that a radical shift in China &apos;s policy toward North Korea might no longer be unthinkable . 
When Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi exchanged phone calls with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on April 6 , he expressed China &apos;s rejection of rhetoric and action aimed at destabilizing the Northeast Asian region . 
Moreover , Wang made clear that China would not allow &quot; troublemaking on China &apos;s doorstep . &quot; 
The next day , Chinese President Xi Jinping , speaking to an assembly of primarily Asian political and business leaders at the annual government-sponsored Boao Forum for Asia , declared that no country &quot; should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gain . &quot; 
Xi did not mention any country by name , but his implicit condemnation of North Korea was clear to all . 
Before these official rebukes , there had been much speculation about whether China would risk a fundamental change in its relations with North Korea , the socialist &quot; little brother &quot; that it continues to subsidize heavily . 
Following the rare display of open indignation by Xi and Wang , such speculation has now become stronger than ever . 
Some ask what &quot; value &quot; Kim &apos;s hermit kingdom provides that prevents China from acting decisively ; others wonder to what extent Chinese leaders &quot; domestic concerns continue to inhibit their willingness to switch course on North Korea . 
In fact , China &apos;s leaders have agonized over North Korea &apos;s recent provocations . 
They have been struggling to persuade the Kim regime to temper its volatility and accept a &quot; grand bargain &quot; : official recognition and normalization of relations with all of its neighbors , and with the United States , in exchange for denuclearization . 
Indeed , this has led to considerable squabbling between the two countries in recent years . 
China understands that North Korea &apos;s intractability is rooted in its deep isolation from the world , mass deception of its people , and Kim &apos;s fear of losing control of a country that only his family has ruled . 
So the country &apos;s rulers have come to believe that they can gain attention and resources only through provocation . 
For China , the Kim regime &apos;s survival can be assured only if it follows China &apos;s lead in reforming and opening up . 
But , faced with South Korea &apos;s shining democracy and booming economy , the Chinese model is irrelevant to the North : following it would mean acknowledging the South &apos;s supremacy on the Korean Peninsula , and thus an instant loss of legitimacy . 
During the past two decades , North Korea &apos;s leaders have experimented lightly with minimal &quot; reform , &quot; only to retreat from it quickly . 
China patiently bore this pattern of intermittent brinkmanship and timid reform , largely owing to its belief that the risks posed by the Kim dynasty could be controlled as long as China did not cut off the regime &apos;s lifeline of oil , food , and other necessities . 
More important , China &apos;s leaders believed that by shielding the North from US pressure , it was acting in the interest of its own national security . 
But here China &apos;s analysis has been completely wrong , for it underestimates the Kim regime &apos;s unmanageable desperation whenever it believes that its survival in doubt . 
Moreover , North Korea does not want to be beholden to any power , including China . 
So it exploits China &apos;s goodwill and national-security concerns , and even regards Chinese patronage as its due . 
A further complication concerns North Korea &apos;s nuclear aspirations . 
The North appears to be convinced that , with nuclear weapons , it can maintain complete diplomatic independence , and that China , fearing nuclear blackmail , will never abandon it . 
Now , however , it is North Korea &apos;s turn to make a mistake . 
Kim Jong-un &apos;s childish tantrums have genuinely enraged China . 
Yes , the country &apos;s leaders have sometimes complained about the heavy burden of subsidizing North Korea ; but , until now , they had never shown such open disgust with the North &apos;s performance . 
China &apos;s warning that it will not allow North Korean &quot; troublemaking on China &apos;s doorstep &quot; can be considered the equivalent of a &quot; yellow card &quot; in soccer . 
China has not decided to abandon North Korea . 
But the warning is a stern one for Kim Jong-un : China may send him to the sidelines if he does not change his behavior . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry is set to visit Beijing in the coming days . 
It is now time for American and Chinese leaders to negotiate a real and viable exit from the current crisis , while productively exploring ways to restart the denuclearization process on the Korean peninsula . 
If Kim &apos;s bombast and nuclear threats lead to China-US bonding over a joint North Korea settlement , the entire world will be the safer for it .
