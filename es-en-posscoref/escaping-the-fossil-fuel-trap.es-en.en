Escaping the Fossil Fuel Trap 
MILAN - There are many problems with fossil fuels . 
They are expensive and a source of political and supply volatility . 
As consumption rises globally , the costs associated with them will probably rise sharply . 
Worst of all , they carry large and unsustainable costs in terms of carbon emissions . 
Indeed , their contribution to rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is beginning to overshadow the other problems . 
But use of fossil fuels , and hence higher CO2 emissions , seems to go hand in hand with growth . 
This is the central problem confronting the world as it seeks to forge a framework to combat climate change . 
Compared to the advanced countries , the developing world now has both low per capita incomes and low per capita levels of carbon emissions . 
Imposing severe restrictions on the growth of their emissions growth would impede their GDP growth and severely curtail their ability to climb out of poverty . 
The developing world also has a serious fairness objection to paying for climate-change mitigation . 
The advanced countries are collectively responsible for much of the current stock of carbon in the atmosphere , as well as for a significant ( though declining ) share of the world &apos;s annual emissions . 
As a consequence , the developing world &apos;s representatives argue , the advanced countries should take responsibility for the problem . 
But a simple shift of responsibility to the advanced countries by exempting developing countries from the mitigation process will not work . 
To be successful , a strategy of fighting climate change must be not only fair , but also effective . 
If developing countries are allowed to grow , and there is no corresponding mitigation of the growth in their carbon emissions , average per capita CO2 emissions around the world will nearly double in the next 50 years , to roughly four times the safe level , regardless of what advanced countries do . 
Advanced countries by themselves simply cannot ensure that safe global CO2 levels are reached . 
Just waiting for the high-growth developing countries to catch up with the advanced countries is even less of a solution . 
So the world &apos;s major challenge is to devise a strategy that encourages growth in the developing world , but on a path that approaches safe global carbon-emission levels by mid-century . 
The way to achieve this is to decouple the question of who pays for most efforts to mitigate climate change from the question of where , geographically , these efforts take place . 
In other words , if the advanced countries absorb mitigation costs in the short run , while mitigation efforts lower emissions growth in developing countries , the conflict between developing countries &quot; growth and success in limiting global emissions may be reconciled - or at least substantially reduced . 
These considerations suggest that no emission-reduction targets should be imposed on developing countries until they approach per capita GDP levels comparable to those in advanced countries . 
While such targets should be self-imposed by advanced countries , they should be allowed to fulfill their obligations , at least in part , by paying to reduce emissions in developing countries ( where such efforts may yield greater benefits ) . 
A crucial corollary of this strategy is large-scale technology transfer to developing countries , allowing them both to grow and to curtail their emissions . 
The closer these countries get to being included in the system of restrictions , the greater incentive they will have to make their own additional investments to mitigate their emissions . 
The world has already accepted the basic principle that the rich should bear more of the cost of mitigating climate change . 
The Kyoto Protocol established a set of &quot; common but differentiated responsibilities &quot; that imply asymmetric roles for advanced and developing countries , with the obligations of developing countries evolving as they grow . 
The ingredients for such a grand bargain are fairly clear . 
The advanced countries will be asked to reduce their CO2 emissions at a substantial rate , while emissions in developing countries can rise to allow for rapid , catch-up economic growth . 
The goal is not to prevent developing countries &quot; growth-related emissions , but to slow their rise and eventually reverse them as these countries become richer . 
The best way to implement this strategy is to use a &quot; carbon credit trading system &quot; in the advanced countries , with each advanced country receiving a certain amount of carbon credits to determine its permissible emission levels . 
If a country exceeds its level of emissions , it must buy additional credits from other countries that achieve emissions lower than their permitted levels . 
Such a system would trigger entrepreneurial searches for low-cost mitigation opportunities in developing countries , because rich countries would want to pay less by lowering emissions abroad . 
As a result , mitigation would become more efficient , and the same expenditures by advanced countries would produce higher global emission reductions . 
As for developing countries , while they would not have explicit credits or targets until they graduate to advanced-country status , they would know that at some point ( say , when their carbon emissions reach the average level of advanced countries ) they would be included in the global system of restrictions . 
Conflict between advanced and developing countries over responsibility for mitigating carbon emissions should not be allowed to undermine prospects for a global agreement . 
A fair solution is as complex as the challenge of climate change itself , but it is certainly possible .
