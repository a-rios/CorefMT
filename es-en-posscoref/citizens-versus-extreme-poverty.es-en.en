Citizens versus Extreme Poverty 
Twenty years ago , a grass-roots movement led by Rotary International , a voluntary organization with around 1.2 million members in more than 200 countries , decided to attack . 
As of the mid-1980 &quot; s , there were more than 300,000 cases of polio per year worldwide , despite the disease &apos;s virtual elimination in the richest countries , where vaccination was routine . 
Rotary took on the challenge of getting vaccines to the poor , in regions with weak or non-existent public health systems . 
Rotarians dreamed not only of reducing the number of polio cases , but of eradicating the disease entirely . 
This goal is now within reach . 
Rather than wait for politicians to take up the fight against polio , Rotarians led the way . 
A few years later , the World Health Organization , and then other international agencies and donor countries , joined the cause , creating a coalition of official and private organizations that now support Rotary &apos;s vision . 
By 2006 , the number of polio cases had been cut dramatically , to well under 3,000 cases per year . 
Complete eradication is in reach , but is still proving elusive , as small outbreaks have plagued one country or another in recent years . 
In some cases , such as Northern Nigeria , social resistance to the vaccine has blocked adequate coverage of the population . 
Pockets of polio transmission also persist in India , Pakistan , and Afghanistan . 
In a few other countries , the disease has been sporadically reintroduced by travelers from regions where polio has not yet been eliminated . 
And , in rare cases , the vaccine itself has failed and led to infection . 
Still , despite the difficulties of rooting out the very last cases , the progress made against polio has been historic . 
More importantly , Rotary &apos;s leadership on polio offers a more general lesson in the fight against extreme poverty , hunger , and disease . 
Even when politicians don &apos;t lead , it is still possible for committed individuals and voluntary organizations to change the world . 
The key is to link a bold idea with a practical and powerful technology , and then to push the idea and technology forward through mass citizen action . 
These same lessons can be applied to the Millennium Development Goals ( MDG &apos;s ) , the targets for fighting poverty , disease , and hunger that the world &apos;s governments adopted in 2000 . 
The MDG &apos;s are bold but achievable . 
For example , they call for reducing by 2015 the proportion of the world &apos;s population that was chronically under-nourished in 1990 , and for cutting the child mortality rate by three quarters . 
The MDG &apos;s also address the scourges of maternal death in childbirth , lack of access to safe drinking water , and killer diseases such as malaria , tuberculosis , and AIDS . 
Just as with polio , the fight against hunger , disease , and lack of access to safe water and sanitation can be carried forward with practical and powerful technologies . 
Indeed , these technologies are so powerful that they can enable families currently trapped in poverty to escape it once and for all . 
Consider hunger in Africa . 
Most of Africa &apos;s farmers , working tiny plots , do not produce enough food to feed their families , much less to earn an income . 
The root of the problem is that Africa &apos;s farmers are too poor to obtain the basic modern inputs - including high-yield seed varieties , fertilizers , and small-scale water management systems - that could enable them to double or triple their output of food and cash crops . 
The solution is therefore not much more complicated than a polio vaccine . 
If organizations like Rotary International can help African farmers to get a 50 kilogram bag of appropriate fertilizer and a 10 kilogram tin of improved seeds , the rise in farm output could be enough to relieve extreme hunger and help farm households begin to earn some income . 
Such practical approaches can solve many of the key problems of extreme poverty . 
Consider , similarly , the death and illness caused by malaria , which can be reduced very sharply through the use of mosquito nets for beds and anti-malaria medicines . 
An anti-malaria bed net costs just $ 5 , lasts five years , and can accommodate two children . 
Thus , for just $ 0.50 per year , each child can be protected by a bed net . 
And a $ 1 medical treatment can cure malaria if the child gets infected despite the bed net . 
Yet bed nets and anti-malaria medicines do not reach the people who need them , because the people who need them are too poor . 
Fortunately , the American Red Cross and other organizations have been following the Rotary model , using private donations and private volunteers to fill the gap left by our political leaders . 
Red Cross chapters across Africa , in partnership with other organizations , are now distributing bed nets free of charge to impoverished families , in the same way that Rotary has been distributing polio vaccines . 
The time has arrived for a massive effort by voluntary organizations to take up the MDG &apos;s through private action . 
We need not wait for the politicians . 
In a short period of time , the world &apos;s citizens can make deep inroads in the fight against disease , hunger , and poverty . 
Then the politicians will follow . 
The key is practicality , boldness , and , most importantly , a commitment by those who are better off to volunteer their time and money to bring practical help-in the form of high-yield seeds , fertilizers , medicines , bed nets , drinking wells , and materials to build school rooms and clinics - to the world &apos;s poorest people .
