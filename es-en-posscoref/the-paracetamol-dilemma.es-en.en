The Paracetamol Dilemma 
WELLINGTON - Paracetamol ( known as acetaminophen in the United States ) is one of the world &apos;s most commonly used drugs . 
It is the preferred medication for relieving fever and pain because of its safety profile . However , 10 years ago , a hypothesis was proposed that the use of paracetamol may increase the risk of developing asthma . It was suggested that a change from the use of aspirin to paracetamol among children in the US during the 1980 &quot; s may have contributed to the increasing prevalence of childhood asthma noted during this period . 
Substitution of paracetamol for aspirin , researchers proposed , may have led to an enhanced allergic immune response , thereby increasing susceptibility to asthma and other allergic disorders . 
Since then , a number of epidemiological studies have reported an association between asthma and exposure to paracetamol in the womb , in childhood , and in adulthood . 
These studies led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol may represent an important risk factor in the development of asthma . 
The latest evidence to support this hypothesis comes from a large international epidemiological study of childhood asthma that was recently published in the medical journal The Lancet . 
This analysis , from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC ) , involved more than 200,000 six- and seven-year-old children from 73 centers in 31 countries . 
The children &apos;s parents or guardians completed written questionnaires about current symptoms of asthma , rhinitis ( hayfever ) , and eczema , and about several risk factors , including use of paracetamol for fever in the child &apos;s first year of life and frequency of paracetamol use in the past 12 months . 
The study identified that the reported use of paracetamol for fever in the first year of life was associated with symptoms of asthma in the six- and seven-year-old children . 
The association was present in all major regions of the world , with an estimated 46 % increased risk following adjustment for other risk factors . 
A dose-dependent association between asthma symptoms at 6-7 years and paracetamol use in the previous 12 months was also observed . 
Similar associations were observed between the use of paracetamol and the risk of severe asthma symptoms . 
The proportion of asthma cases that could be attributed to exposure to paracetamol was calculated to be between 22 % and 38 % . 
Paracetamol use both in the first year of life and in children aged 6-7 was also associated with an increased risk of symptoms of rhinitis and eczema . 
This suggests that the potential effect of paracetamol is not restricted to the airways and may affect a number of organ systems . 
Identifying the potential mechanisms that might underlie the association between paracetamol and asthma ( and other allergic disorders ) was not a part of this study . 
But other researchers have proposed a number of plausible mechanisms , primarily related to paracetamol &apos;s negative effect on the body &apos;s ability to withstand oxidant stress and its potential enhancement of the allergic immune response . 
The authors emphasised that causality could not be established from a retrospective study of this design due to the numerous potential biases that may confound the association . For example , it is known that viral respiratory tract infections in infancy such as respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) are associated with an increased risk of asthma in later childhood and that paracetamol use for such episodes could have caused confounding in the study . 
The study has contributed to the debate as to whether it is beneficial to treat fever in children , an issue comprehensively reviewed by Fiona Russell and colleagues in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization . 
They propose that the available scientific evidence suggests that fever is a universal , ancient , and usually beneficial response to infection , and that its suppression under most circumstances has few if any demonstrable benefits . 
On the contrary , they suggest that suppressing fever may occasionally produce harmful effects , and conclude that widespread use of drugs to reduce fever should not be encouraged . 
They recommend that in children their use should be restricted to situations of high fever , obvious discomfort , or conditions known to be painful . 
What is agreed is the need for randomized controlled trials of the long-term effects of repeated use of paracetamol in children . 
Only then will it be possible to develop evidence-based guidelines for its recommended use . 
Pending the results of such research , paracetamol remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in childhood , to be used in accordance with WHO guidelines , which recommend that it should be reserved for children with a high fever ( 38.5Co or above ) . 
The use of aspirin in young children is contraindicated , owing to the risk of Reye &apos;s syndrome , a rare but serious complication . 
Paracetamol also remains the preferred drug to relieve pain or fever in children or adults with asthma , because aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provoke attacks of asthma in susceptible people with this condition .
