Blaming the Fed 
FRANKFURT - Critics of the US Federal Reserve are having a field day with embarrassing revelations of its risk assessments on the eve of the financial crisis . 
By law , the Fed is required to publish the transcripts of its Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meetings with a five-year lag . 
While the full-blown crisis did not erupt until the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , it was clear by the summer of 2007 that something was very wrong in credit markets , which were starting to behave in all sorts of strange ways . 
Yet many Fed officials clearly failed to recognize the significance of what was unfolding . 
One governor opined that the Fed should regard it as a good thing that markets were starting to worry about subprime mortgages . 
Another argued that the summertime market stress would most likely be a hiccup . 
Various critics are seizing on such statements as evidence that the Fed is incompetent , and that its independence should be curtailed , or worse . 
This is nonsense . 
Yes , things could and should have been done better ; but to single out Fed governors for missing the coming catastrophe is ludicrous . 
The Fed was hardly alone . 
In August 2007 , few market participants , even those with access to mountains of information and a broad range of expert opinions , had a real clue as to what was going on . 
Certainly the US Congress was clueless ; its members were still busy lobbying for the government-backed housing-mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , thereby digging the hole deeper . 
Nor did the International Monetary Fund have a shining moment . 
In April 2007 , the IMF released its famous &quot; Valentine &apos;s Day &quot; World Economic Outlook , in which it declared that all of the problems in the United States and other advanced economies that it had been worrying about were overblown . 
Moreover , it is misleading to single out the most misguided comments by individual governors in the context of an active intellectual debate over policy . 
It is legitimate to criticize individual policymakers who exercised poor judgment , and they should have a mark on their record . 
But that does not impugn the whole FOMC , much less the entire institution . 
Central banks &quot; state-of-the-art macroeconomic models also failed miserably - to a degree that the economics profession has only now begun to acknowledge fully . 
Although the Fed assesses many approaches and indicators in making its decisions , there is no doubt that it was heavily influenced by mainstream academic thinking - including the so-called real business cycle models and New Keynesian models - which assumed that financial markets operate flawlessly . 
Indeed , the economics profession and the world &apos;s major central banks advertised the idea of the &quot; great moderation &quot; - the muting of macroeconomic volatility , owing partly to monetary authorities &quot; supposedly more scientific , model-based approach to policymaking . 
We now know that canonical macroeconomic models do not adequately allow for financial-market fragilities , and that fixing the models while retaining their tractability is a formidable task . 
Frankly , had the models at least allowed for the possibility of credit-market imperfections , the Fed might have paid more attention to credit-market indicators as a reflection of overall financial-market conditions , as central banks in emerging-market countries do . 
Last but not least , even if the Fed had better understood the risks , it would not have been easy for it to avert the crisis on its own . 
The effectiveness of interest-rate policy is limited , and many of the deepest problems were on the regulatory side . 
And calibrating a response was not easy . 
By late 2007 , for example , the Fed and the US Treasury had most likely already seen at least one report arguing that only massive intervention to support subprime loans could forestall a catastrophe . 
The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices - which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse - that it had constructed . 
Such a bailout would have cost an estimated $ 500 billion or more , and the main beneficiaries would have included big financial firms . 
Was there any realistic chance that such a measure would have passed Congress before there was blood in the streets ? 
Indeed , it was precisely this logic that me led to give a very dark forecast in a widely covered speech in Singapore on August 19 , 2008 , a month before Lehman Brothers failed . 
I argued that things would not get better until they got much worse , and that the collapse of one of the world &apos;s largest financial firms was imminent . 
My argument rested on my view that the global economy was entering a major recession , and I had the benefit of my quantitative work , with Carmen Reinhart , on the history of financial crises . 
I was not trying to be sensational in Singapore . 
I thought that what I was saying was completely obvious . 
Nevertheless , my prediction gained bold front-page headlines in many major newspapers throughout the world . 
It gained headlines , evidently , because it was still far from a consensus view , although concerns were mounting . 
Were concerns mounting at the Fed as well in the summer of 2008 ? 
We will have to wait until next year to find out . 
But , when we do , let us remember that hindsight is 20-20 .
