A Surfing Reflection 
MELBOURNE - For me , as for most Australians , summer holidays have always meant going to the beach . 
I grew up swimming and playing in the waves , eventually moving on to a body board , but somehow missing out on learning to stand on a surfboard . 
I finally made up for that omission when I was in my fifties - too old ever to become good at it , but young enough for surfing to give me a decade of fun and a sense of accomplishment . 
This southern summer , I &apos;m back in Australia and in the waves again . 
At the beach where I surfed today , I heard about a ceremony that had taken place there earlier in the season - a farewell to a local surfer who had died at a ripe old age . 
His fellow-surfers paddled out into the ocean and formed a circle , sitting on their boards , while his ashes were scattered over the surface . 
Other friends and family stood and watched from the beach and cliff top . 
I was told that he was one of the best surfers around , but at a time when there was no money in it . 
Was it his bad luck , I wondered , to be born too early to take part in today &apos;s lucrative professional surfing circuit ? 
Or was it his good luck to be part of a surfing scene that was less about stardom and more about enjoying the waves ? 
This is not a general rant against the corrupting influence of money . 
Having money opens up opportunities that , if used well , can be very positive . 
Surfers have created environmental organizations like the Surfrider Foundation , which has a special concern for the oceans ; and SurfAid , which tries to spread some of the benefits of surfing tourism in developing countries to the poorest of the local people . 
Still , the spirit of surfing &apos;s early days ( think of the harmony of wave and human action portrayed in the 1971 movie Morning of the Earth ) contrasts sharply with the razzamatazz of today &apos;s professional circuit . 
Some sports are inherently competitive . 
Tennis fans may admire a well-executed backhand ; but watching players warm up on court would soon become dull if no match followed . 
The same is true of football ( soccer ) : Who would go to watch a group of people kicking a ball around a field if it wasn &apos;t all about winning or losing ? 
Players of these sports cannot exhibit the full range of their skills without being pushed by a competitive opponent . 
Surfing is different . 
It offers opportunities to meet challenges that call on a variety of skills , both physical and mental ; but the challenges are intrinsic to the activity and do not involve beating an opponent . 
In that respect , surfing is closer to hiking , mountaineering , or skiing than to tennis or football : The aesthetic experience of being in a beautiful natural environment is an important part of the activity &apos;s attractiveness ; there is satisfaction to be found in the sense of accomplishment ; and there is vigorous physical exercise without the monotony of running on a treadmill or swimming laps . 
To make surfing competitive requires contriving ways to measure performance . 
The solution is to judge certain skills displayed in riding a wave . 
There is nothing wrong with surfers competing to see who can do the most difficult maneuvers on a wave - just as there is nothing wrong with seeing who can pull off the most difficult dive from the ten-meter platform . 
But when we make surfing competitive , a recreational activity in which millions of people can happily participate is transformed into a spectator sport to be watched , for most , on a screen . 
It would be highly regrettable if the competitive sport &apos;s narrow focus on point-scoring were to limit our appreciation of the beauty and harmony we can experience riding a wave without fitting as many turns as possible into our time on it . 
Many of the highlights of my surfing have more to do with experiencing the splendor and power of the waves than with my ability to ride them . 
In fact , at the time of my single most magical surfing moment , I wasn &apos;t on a wave at all . 
At Byron Bay , Australia &apos;s easternmost point , I was paddling out to where the waves were breaking . 
The sun was shining , the sea was blue , and I was aware of the Pacific Ocean stretching ahead thousands of miles , uninterrupted by land until it reached the coast of Chile . 
A pulse of energy generated in that vast expanse of water neared a submerged line of rocks and reared up in front of me in a green wall . 
As the wave began to break , a dolphin leapt out ahead of the foam , its entire body clear of the water . 
It was a sublime moment , but not such an unusual one . 
As many of my fellow wave riders know , we are the only animal that plays tennis or football , but not the only animal that enjoys surfing .
