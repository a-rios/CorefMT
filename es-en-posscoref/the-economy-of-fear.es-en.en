The Economy of Fear 
The global economy seems to be walking on water , shrugging off soaring oil prices , policy paralysis in Europe , unsustainable borrowing by the United States , and record housing prices . 
Is it because , as G-8 leaders would have us believe , investors are in a buoyant mood , confident in their leaders &quot; stewardship of the global economy ? 
Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear , fed by events such as the recent London bombings , that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems ? 
The role of phenomenally low long-term ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent . 
Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries , and , according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund , continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise . 
Europe has benefited less , but its economies would be a lot worse off if long-term interest rates climbed back to their 25-year average . 
Similarly , Latin America has been booming in recent years , despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform . 
Low long-term interest rates have kept the region &apos;s debts manageable , while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region &apos;s commodity exports . 
Why hasn &apos;t the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees , as it has on so many other occasions ? 
Again , the answer is low interest rates . 
Ordinarily , a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations , followed by rising interest rates at all maturities . 
But this time , even as the US Federal Reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to keep inflation in line , long-term interest rates - which are far more important - have been magically declining . 
Indeed , America has been the single biggest beneficiary of this freakish low-interest-rate environment , with everyone seeming to borrow money like it is going out of style . 
Homeowners , backed by rising house prices , are piling up debt . 
The Federal government has thrown fiscal prudence out the window . 
The country as a whole is absorbing an astounding three-quarters of global excess savings . 
But , as long as interest rates remain low and growth high , Americans can laugh at predictions that their excesses are laying the seeds of ruin . 
But if low long-term interest rates are helping so many economies walk on water , why are rates so low , and will they stay that way ? 
Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe . 
Perhaps people have come to feel less , not more , secure about their long-term future , either because of fears about terrorism , a global pandemic , or a severe rash of financial crises . 
I am not claiming that investors are hysterical , just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook . 
As a consequence , they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view , rightly or wrongly , as safe vehicles . 
Other convincing explanations are lacking . 
To be sure , emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree , rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets , but nobody expects this to go on forever . 
Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters , has declared the current situation &quot; a conundrum . &quot; 
History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out , with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world , raising growth rates everywhere . 
Ordinarily , rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates - that is , unless , deep down , people have become nervous . 
Suppose investors are worried about a small chance of catastrophe over the next five to ten years . 
( According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics , the dangers are real . ) 
Suppose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong , but that maybe - just maybe - things will fall apart . 
In this case , it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co-exist with strong growth . 
True , some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950 &quot; s and early 1960 &quot; s , when Europe , the US , and Japan prospered , but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth . 
Since that was a golden era for global growth , why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today ? 
What the optimists forget is that the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s were also a period of massive insecurity . 
Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III - and with good reason , according to many historians . 
Back then , the specter of the Apocalypse helped keep borrowing cheap . 
Happily , investors &quot; darkest fears were not realized , and we can only hope for the same . 
But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today &apos;s record-low interest rates , then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation . 
Investors &quot; collective psychology is notoriously fragile . 
If they ever calm down , interest rates will shoot up , and that could well bring the global economy &apos;s simmering imbalances to a raging boil .
