China &apos;s Bad Growth Bet 
LONDON - I recently took two trips to China just as the government launched its 12th Five-Year Plan to rebalance the country &apos;s long-term growth model . 
My visits deepened my view that there is a potentially destabilizing contradiction between China &apos;s short- and medium-term economic performance . 
China &apos;s economy is overheating now , but , over time , its current overinvestment will prove deflationary both domestically and globally . 
Once increasing fixed investment becomes impossible - most likely after 2013 - China is poised for a sharp slowdown . 
Instead of focusing on securing a soft landing today , Chinese policymakers should be worrying about the brick wall that economic growth may hit in the second half of the quinquennium . 
Despite the rhetoric of the new Five-Year Plan - which , like the previous one , aims to increase the share of consumption in GDP - the path of least resistance is the status quo . 
The new plan &apos;s details reveal continued reliance on investment , including public housing , to support growth , rather than faster currency appreciation , substantial fiscal transfers to households , taxation and / or privatization of state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , liberalization of the household registration ( hukou ) system , or an easing of financial repression . 
China has grown for the last few decades on the back of export-led industrialization and a weak currency , which have resulted in high corporate and household savings rates and reliance on net exports and fixed investment ( infrastructure , real estate , and industrial capacity for import-competing and export sectors ) . 
When net exports collapsed in 2008-2009 from 11 % of GDP to 5 % , China &apos;s leader reacted by further increasing the fixed-investment share of GDP from 42 % to 47 % . 
Thus , China did not suffer a severe recession - as occurred in Japan , Germany , and elsewhere in emerging Asia in 2009 - only because fixed investment exploded . 
And the fixed-investment share of GDP has increased further in 2010-2011 , to almost 50 % . 
The problem , of course , is that no country can be productive enough to reinvest 50 % of GDP in new capital stock without eventually facing immense overcapacity and a staggering non-performing loan problem . 
China is rife with overinvestment in physical capital , infrastructure , and property . 
To a visitor , this is evident in sleek but empty airports and bullet trains ( which will reduce the need for the 45 planned airports ) , highways to nowhere , thousands of colossal new central and provincial government buildings , ghost towns , and brand-new aluminum smelters kept closed to prevent global prices from plunging . 
Commercial and high-end residential investment has been excessive , automobile capacity has outstripped even the recent surge in sales , and overcapacity in steel , cement , and other manufacturing sectors is increasing further . 
In the short run , the investment boom will fuel inflation , owing to the highly resource-intensive character of growth . 
But overcapacity will lead inevitably to serious deflationary pressures , starting with the manufacturing and real-estate sectors . 
Eventually , most likely after 2013 , China will suffer a hard landing . 
All historical episodes of excessive investment - including East Asia in the 1990 &quot; s - have ended with a financial crisis and / or a long period of slow growth . 
To avoid this fate , China needs to save less , reduce fixed investment , cut net exports as a share of GDP , and boost the share of consumption . 
The trouble is that the reasons the Chinese save so much and consume so little are structural . 
It will take two decades of reforms to change the incentive to overinvest . 
Traditional explanations for the high savings rate ( lack of a social safety net , limited public services , aging of the population , underdevelopment of consumer finance , etc . ) are only part of the puzzle . 
Chinese consumers do not have a greater propensity to save than Chinese in Hong Kong , Singapore , and Taiwan ; they all save about 30 % of disposable income . 
The big difference is that the share of China &apos;s GDP going to the household sector is below 50 % , leaving little for consumption . 
Several Chinese policies have led to a massive transfer of income from politically weak households to politically powerful companies . 
A weak currency reduces household purchasing power by making imports expensive , thereby protecting import-competing SOEs and boosting exporters &quot; profits . 
Low interest rates on deposits and low lending rates for firms and developers mean that the household sector &apos;s massive savings receive negative rates of return , while the real cost of borrowing for SOEs is also negative . 
This creates a powerful incentive to overinvest and implies enormous redistribution from households to SOEs , most of which would be losing money if they had to borrow at market-equilibrium interest rates . 
Moreover , labor repression has caused wages to grow much more slowly than productivity . 
To ease the constraints on household income , China needs more rapid exchange-rate appreciation , liberalization of interest rates , and a much sharper increase in wage growth . 
More importantly , China needs either to privatize its SOEs , so that their profits become income for households , or to tax their profits at a far higher rate and transfer the fiscal gains to households . 
Instead , on top of household savings , the savings - or retained earnings - of the corporate sector , mostly SOEs , tie up another 25 % of GDP . 
But boosting the share of income that goes to the household sector could be hugely disruptive , as it could bankrupt a large number of SOEs , export-oriented firms , and provincial governments , all of which are politically powerful . 
As a result , China will invest even more under the current Five-Year Plan . 
Continuing down the investment-led growth path will exacerbate the visible glut of capacity in manufacturing , real estate , and infrastructure , and thus will intensify the coming economic slowdown once further fixed-investment growth becomes impossible . 
Until the change of political leadership in 2012-2013 , China &apos;s policymakers may be able to maintain high growth rates , but at a very high foreseeable cost .
