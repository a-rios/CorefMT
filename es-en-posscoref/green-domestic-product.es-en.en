Green Domestic Product ? 
SANTIAGO - One of the recurrent themes at the United Nations &quot; spectacularly unsuccessful Rio + 20 summit in June was the need to change how we measure wealth . 
Many argue that we must abandon our &quot; obsession &quot; with Gross Domestic Product and develop a new &quot; green &quot; accounting standard to replace it . 
In fact , doing so could be a serious mistake . 
GDP is really just an account of the market value of all goods and services . 
This sounds like a good indicator of wealth , but , as is frequently pointed out , it includes things that do not make us richer and leaves out things that do . 
For example , if people are not compensated for the harm done by pollution , its adverse effects will not be included in GDP . 
If we pay to clean up pollution , this increases GDP , but no wealth has been created . 
Likewise , there is economic value produced when wastewater is naturally cleaned by wetlands , but no transaction has occurred , so it is not counted in GDP . 
It is worthwhile to consider these limitations of GDP as a measure of wealth . 
Unfortunately , many of the proposed &quot; green &quot; substitutions , however well intentioned , may not address these limitations adequately and could , in fact , produce worse outcomes . 
One prominent example reported in the run-up to Rio + 20 and used to support &quot; greening &quot; GDP centered on the Nakivubo Swamp in Uganda &apos;s capital , Kampala , where wastewater flows from the city toward Lake Victoria . 
Without the swamp &apos;s purification services , a study showed , Kampala would need a sewage plant costing at least $ 2 million a year . 
According to economist Pavan Sukhdev , the former head of the United Nations &quot; Green Economy Initiative , the point was simple : &quot; It &apos;s going to cost $ 2 million per year to do what the swamp was doing for free , and they don &apos;t have that money . &quot; 
Thus , swayed both by the uncounted benefits from wastewater treatment - estimated at up to $ 1.75 million a year - and the potential outlay to build a sewage plant , Kampala decided to protect the area . 
&quot; Economic logic prevailed , &quot; says Sukhdev . 
The Nakivubo Swamp is an excellent example of the need for careful valuation of the environment . 
Such information is crucial for making good decisions . 
For example , if the wetland were to be destroyed to make way for a new district , we know that its benefits would have to be at least $ 1.75 million higher than the costs . 
But there is also a significant risk of political misuse of such information . 
Kampala &apos;s decision-makers decided to protect the area . 
In other words , they rejected ever considering alternative possibilities for the area . 
Green campaigners often seek such outcomes , but they are entirely unjustified . 
The swamp is close to the city center and its industrial center , and there is a land shortage in Kampala . 
In all likelihood , the net benefits of job creation and economic growth that could result from creating a new district ( in place of the swamp ) would be dramatically higher than the $ 1.75 million . 
There is a reason why few large , rich cities , if any , have undeveloped wetlands in their midst . 
If green measures are used to shortcut the political process , we can actually end up worse off , because countries will be deprived of jobs , wealth , and welfare , while relatively small environmental benefits will be achieved . 
The Nakivubo Swamp is not a case of economic logic prevailing , but exactly the opposite - a failure to consider all options and choose the best . 
Imagine if our ancestors had made a similar valuation in the past , deciding to protect swampland at all cost . 
Much of lower Manhattan would still be a swamp , rather than being turned into the powerhouse of New York City , at a huge cost to society . 
In general , green accounting may end up being more biased than conventional GDP measures . 
Green GDP does include uncounted losses , so it avoids the problem of overestimating our wealth , but it fails to account for the potentially much larger benefits of innovation . 
For example , the World Bank claims that in order to be green , we need to take into account that consuming fossil fuels will deprive future generations of those resources . 
In reality , burning fossil fuels over the past 150 years has enabled us to be free to create and innovate an amazingly richer world of antibiotics , telecommunications , and computers . 
These will further enrich the future , but are not counted . 
Moreover , as we have burned fossil fuels , we have simultaneously found new resources and discovered new methods , such as horizontal fracturing , which has dramatically increased the availability of natural gas while driving down its cost . 
In practice , green accounting might easily have led our forefathers not to cut down forests , because this would entail losing a valuable resource . 
But converting forests to agriculture led to cities and civilization . 
Most policymakers still focus on GDP , because , while not perfect , it is strongly correlated with highly prized real-world outcomes . 
A country with higher GDP generally has lower child mortality rates , higher life expectancy , better education , more democracy , less corruption , greater life satisfaction , and often a cleaner environment . 
So , while green accounting certainly can play a role , we must not allow it to become a roadblock to development .
