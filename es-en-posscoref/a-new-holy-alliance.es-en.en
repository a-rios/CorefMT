A New Holy Alliance ? 
LONDON  -  
It was also the clearest sign yet of a rising &quot; Holy Alliance &quot; among the world &apos;s conservative leaders . 
The first &quot; Holy Alliance &quot; was a creation of Austria &apos;s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars . 
It was an attempt to preserve the peace ( and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire ) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values . 
Metternich &apos;s &quot; Holy Alliance &quot; was the one original political idea to emerge from Napoleon &apos;s defeat . 
Behind its exalted name lay an innovation of great diplomatic significance : the introduction of an element of calculated moral restraint into international relations . 
The vested interests that the Alliance members - Austria , Prussia , and Russia - had in the survival of their domestic institutions led each to seek to avoid conflicts that , in the past , they would have pursued as a matter of course . 
Metternich &apos;s system worked through much of the nineteenth century , because it protected a genuine balance of power between countries that shared common values . 
That such a meeting took place is a sign that both Pope and King believed that there was something to achieve . 
Indeed , Abdullah , who believes himself to be the paramount leader of the Muslim world , is the first Saudi king to initiate a meeting with a leader of the Christian faith . 
The two men met , seemingly as equals , not to express the common values of conservatism , but to confirm and promote their authority to uphold traditional values . 
Both agreed that reform must be slow , cautious and that it must never undermine established institutions , especially religion and the patriarchal family . 
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives . 
Until then , he and Bush shared a common worldview , emphasizing the importance of religion , the traditional family ( as both countries understood it ) , social discipline , and the state &apos;s role in supporting these institutions . 
But Bush , following the terrorist attacks of 2001 , turned his back on conservatism . He sought to radically reinvent the Middle East , not only by overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime in Iraq , but also through his strident calls for democratization . 
American radicalism , however , resulted in increasing tensions between religious communities in the Middle East , and the rise of radical Iran with its bid for regional hegemony . 
Since 2001 , Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region , including even Lebanon &apos;s Maronite Christian community . 
Here is where the Holy Alliance concept of moral restraint comes in . 
Abdullah , perhaps earlier than most others , understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all . 
Moreover , Abdullah understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability-seeking alliance that Metternich built . 
The King , like Metternich and the Austrian Kaisers , understands de Tocqueville &apos;s dictum that the most dangerous moment for a regime is when it starts to reform . 
Having begun , ever so carefully , to politically open his country , the King knows that he needs regional peace and a lowering of Islamic holy rage . 
The problem is that Abdullah cannot rely on his domestic conservative allies to give him the time that the Kingdom needs . 
The Wahhabi religious establishment , the Saudi state &apos;s hidden co-rulers , could very well obstruct Abdullah &apos;s attempts at regional religious reconciliation . 
Members of the religious police remain adamant that the country &apos;s Christian guests must continue to live according to strict Wahhabi rules of behavior . 
While the Wahhabis could yet be bribed again with oil money , the sect &apos;s power-hungry judges eagerly await the next beheading , stoning , or lashing in Riyadh &apos;s public square . 
Thus , uniting the forces of status quo conservatism , even if some of those conservatives are Christian , is the only viable diplomatic strategy open to Saudi Arabia . For conservative rulers usually fall when they fail to grasp their own vulnerability , especially when the revolutionary challenge is cloaked in conservative garb . After all , few political systems can defend against those , like Saudi Arabia &apos;s Islamic radicals , who claim that they can preserve the system and its religious values more effectively than the current rulers . 
Only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers ( including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism ) , Abdullah believes , can restore some stability to the Middle East .
