Piñata Politics 
George Bush &apos;s immigration policy is a big piñata hanging across the border between Mexico and the United States . 
Some immigrants believe it &apos;s shaped like a star to guide them across the Rio Grande to work in the promised land , others think it resembles a devil , offering the tantalizing prospect of legal jobs in the US , only to discover that this is a mirage . 
Many are thankful that the piñata is available to liven up bilateral relations and can &apos;t wait to give it a good whack . 
But if Mexico &apos;s President Vicente Fox is to benefit from his turn hitting the piñata , he will need to take off the blindfold he wears in public where President Bush is concerned . 
Fox has every right to celebrate the recent initiative announced by President Bush to assist some currently illegal immigrants to the US come out of the shadow economy , and he should congratulate himself for pressing Bush to make this effort . 
It was his constant prodding that helped design and fill the piñata . 
But Fox needs to move quickly from self-congratulation to action , because Mexico needs a more fulfilling relationship with America than the scanty prizes that are now dropping from Bush &apos;s piñata . 
He will have time to do so , because no new proposal is likely to be launched in a US presidential election year . 
To start , Fox must listen more carefully than he has to the people he governs . 
For some immigrants , the Bush proposal offers the possibility of stepping out of the shadows into legal jobs , for others it represents the possibility of legalization today but deportation from the US tomorrow . 
On one side , there is the carrot of living and earning like a US resident . 
On the other , there &apos;s the stick of probably never becoming a citizen . 
While many immigrants would welcome the idea of returning to Mexico after temporary employment in the US , many others would prefer to immigrate permanently to the US . 
In fact , a majority of Mexican immigrants already in the US don &apos;t know exactly how to respond to Bush &apos;s proposal , and Vicente Fox will have to listen to them , too , if he wants to speak in their name . 
There are those who welcome what Bush has brought to the bilateral party because it will allow them to live without fear . 
For them , Bush &apos;s proposal is a big step forward . 
Others , however , have reacted skeptically , and for good reason . 
They think that the piñata is a distraction from the goal of earned legalization . 
They don &apos;t want a job that will solve their problems for three years , but rather a precise path to residency in the US that will solve their problems forever . 
For those who have worked in the US for 10 or 15 years , the Bush piñata is a mere decoration . 
They don &apos;t want a legal status that will vanish in three years . 
Vicente Fox will have to acknowledge these differences and work with them . 
Immigrants themselves are divided and Vicente Fox will have to understand why . 
Therefore , he should not embrace the Bush proposal as is . 
Three years ago , Fox wanted the &quot; whole enchilada &quot; : a temporary workers accord , more Green Cards to allow Mexicans to work in the US , legalization of immigrants already in the US , development funds for Mexican communities that send immigrants to the US , and a bilateral approach to managing the problem . 
Without these five components , any immigration proposal will not cut back on the number of deaths among those seeking to cross the border , or the existence of an abused underclass , or the persistence of temporary and legal employment that becomes permanent and illegal employment . 
Vicente Fox probably feels tempted to hit the piñata as it hangs there and go back home with whatever he can get . 
But he has long-term responsibilities - both to Mexicans in Mexico and to Mexicans in the US - that go beyond obtaining a short-term political victory . 
Bush &apos;s proposal is full of holes , and Fox should figure out how to fill them . 
Since Bush &apos;s proposal doesn &apos;t incorporate Mexico &apos;s interests , Fox should spell them out . 
If Bush &apos;s piñata can &apos;t spell out all the details , Fox should define them in Mexican and bilateral terms . 
The Italian word &quot; pignatta &quot; means &quot; fragile pot . &quot; 
Bush &apos;s immigration piñata is indeed a fragile one . 
It is swaying in fierce electoral winds , it was made exclusively in the USA without Mexican help , and it doesn &apos;t contain enough candy . 
Vicente Fox has said that he wants more , and he should keep his word . 
He needs to remember that in Mexico , piñatas are symbols of hope .
