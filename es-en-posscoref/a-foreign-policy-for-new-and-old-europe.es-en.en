A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe 
Watching the news from Iraq , I recall when I was Poland &apos;s Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991 . 
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad . 
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq . &quot; Yes , I know , &quot; I said . &quot; I &apos;ve been watching the bombardment on TV . &quot; 
Twelve years later , Poland &apos;s Prime Minister didn &apos;t need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq . 
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US , now Poland &apos;s NATO ally . 
Indeed , Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq &apos;s occupation . 
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism &apos;s collapse in 1989 ! 
Little of this , however , is the result of design , for ( unfortunately ) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union . 
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us . 
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia - some Poles think that by &quot; simply existing &quot; we influence Europe &apos;s fate ; others suffer crippling pessimism , consigning Poland to permanent &quot; second-class &quot; status - and you have a recipe for inertia . 
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out . 
Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset : we say that we want a common foreign and security policy , but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges . 
Then we squabble about what to do . 
The time for such laxity is over . 
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO , membership in the Alliance didn &apos;t really require debate . 
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was the 
EU membership and the global war on terror , however , demand a more deeply considered response . 
Why ? 
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state , economy , and society , while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy . 
Today &apos;s crisis in transatlantic relations , and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s &quot; New Europe , &quot; means that Poland ( like every other European state ) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO . 
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests , as well what it really means to be an EU partner . 
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the &quot; new &quot; and &quot; old &quot; Europe , as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds . 
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder . 
Instead , the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today &apos;s emerging European order . 
They see new players ( say , Spain ) rising to shape EU policy , particularly foreign policy , and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged . 
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades . 
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American &quot; Trojan Horse . &quot; 
Instead , the EU &apos;s structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe &apos;s role in the world , but also new means to achieve consensus . 
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power . 
The world needs a united continent , ready to go into action . 
That consensus must include the US . 
During the Cold War , most Europeans tolerated America &apos;s tendency to lead unilaterally , because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power . 
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era . 
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic , and its belief that Europe &apos;s ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won &apos;t spend the money necessary to achieve that goal . 
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus . 
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective . 
Intentions don &apos;t deter invasions . 
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said , &quot; France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country &apos;s security . 
The US is , but security does not come free of charge . &quot; 
Most Poles think that Poland &apos;s situation is akin to Denmark &apos;s . 
Indeed , all of Europe is in thrall to American power . 
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America . 
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth , many of today &apos;s divisions will disappear . 
The EU &apos;s foreign policy should be guided by the following goals : 
fight terrorism ; 
prevent local conflict ; 
promote human rights and democracy ; 
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible ; 
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US ; 
help poor countries . 
Polish foreign policy , like that of the EU , can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps - and spends the necessary money - to realize these objectives . 
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations , in an expanded Union , and in relations between the &quot; New &quot; and &quot; Old &quot; Europe .
