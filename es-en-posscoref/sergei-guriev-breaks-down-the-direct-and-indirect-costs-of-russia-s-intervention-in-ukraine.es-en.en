Putin &apos;s Imperial Road to Economic Ruin 
PARIS - The debate around Crimea is no longer centered on international law : Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly recognized that he does not feel bound by it and does not care if the rest of the world deems Russia &apos;s actions illegal . 
What is not clear is whether Russia &apos;s economy can bear the burden of Putin &apos;s objectives in Ukraine . 
Regardless of the West &apos;s response to the Crimean crisis , the economic damage to Russia will be vast . 
First , there are the direct costs of military operations and of supporting the Crimean regime and its woefully inefficient economy ( which has been heavily subsidized by Ukraine &apos;s government for years . ) 
Given the uncertainty surrounding Crimea &apos;s future status , these costs are difficult to estimate , though they are most likely to total several billion dollars per year . 
A direct cost of this magnitude amounts to less than 0.5 % of Russia &apos;s GDP . 
While not trivial , Russia can afford it . 
Russia just spent $ 50 billion dollars on the Sochi Olympics and plans to spend even more for the 2018 World Cup . 
It was prepared to lend $ 15 billion to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s government and to provide $ 8 billion annually in gas subsidies . 
Then there are the costs related to the impact of sanctions on trade and investment . 
Though the scope of the sanctions remains uncertain , the effect could be enormous . 
Annual inward foreign direct investment is estimated to have reached $ 80 billion in 2013 . 
A significant decline in FDI - which brings not only money but also modern technology and managerial skills - would hit Russia &apos;s long-term economic growth hard . 
In the short run , however , it is trade that matters much more than investment . 
Russia &apos;s annual exports ( mostly oil , gas , and other commodities ) are worth almost $ 600 billion , while annual imports total almost $ 500 billion . 
Any non-trivial trade sanctions ( including sanctions on Russian financial institutions ) would be much more painful than the direct cost of subsidizing Crimea . 
Of course , sanctions would hurt Russia &apos;s trading partners , too . 
Moreover , the most important source of potential damage to Russia &apos;s economy lies elsewhere . 
Russian and foreign businesses have always been worried about the unpredictability of the country &apos;s political leadership . 
Lack of confidence in Russian policymaking is the main reason for capital flight , low domestic asset prices , declining investment , and an economic slowdown that the Crimea crisis will almost certainly cause to accelerate . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s response to events in Ukraine has exceeded the worst expectations of those who were already questioning whether Putin is , as German Chancellor Angela Merkel put it , &quot; in touch with reality . &quot; 
The move to annex Crimea has reversed any soft-power benefit that Putin might have gained from the Sochi Olympics and the pardons he granted ( as recently as December ) to imprisoned opponents like Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the members of Pussy Riot . 
The sacrifice of these gains suggests that the Crimea adventure was not part of long-considered plan . 
On the contrary , since the crisis began , Russia &apos;s leaders have repeatedly contradicted their previous statements , backtracked , reversed decisions , and denied easily verifiable facts . 
All of this indicates that Russian political leaders have no strategy and do not foresee the consequences of their decisions . 
Even the Kremlin &apos;s own supporters acknowledge that Putin &quot; is improvising . &quot; 
It is also clear that the decisions to violate international law , despite the risk of economic isolation , were made in an ad hoc fashion by Putin &apos;s innermost circle . 
For example , Valentina Matviyenko , the chairwoman of the Federation Council ( the parliament &apos;s upper house ) , announced that Russia would not send troops to Ukraine - just two days before she and the Council voted unanimously to authorize Putin to do precisely that . 
And Matviyenko is one of the 12 permanent members of Russia &apos;s National Security Council , the supreme decision-making authority on such matters . 
Regardless of whether the Kremlin is irrational or simply uninformed , its policy in Crimea sends an unmistakable signal to investors : Russia &apos;s political leaders are impossible to predict . 
With credit-fueled consumer spending - the engine driving GDP growth since 2010 - now running out of steam , the economy is stagnating . 
Meanwhile , investment is still below its 2008 peak . 
Despite a wealth of opportunities across the Russian economy , the country &apos;s hostile business climate - including bloated bureaucracies , widespread corruption , and the expansion of state-owned companies - has weakened Russian and foreign investors &quot; incentive to start new projects or expand existing ones . 
The realization that Putin has entered , to quote Merkel again , &quot; another world &quot; will only make matters worse . 
Will Russians notice the economic costs of the Kremlin &apos;s irrationality ? 
GDP growth has already slowed and may turn negative . The stock market has already fallen sharply and may fall further . 
Of course , equity ownership in Russia is narrow ; most Russians do not even follow market indices . 
But increased capital flight will also affect something that ordinary Russians know and care about : the ruble &apos;s exchange rate . 
On the Monday after Putin &apos;s Crimea adventure began , the Central Bank of Russia reportedly spent $ 11.3 billion to prop up the ruble . 
Such support is clearly unsustainable ; in fact , the CBR recently announced that it will allow the ruble to float , implying an exchange rate that reflects the market &apos;s expectations concerning oil prices and future capital outflows . 
Thus , worries about a Putin who has &quot; lost touch with reality &quot; imply not only a lower ( or even negative ) GDP growth rate , but also - and more immediately - a weaker currency , driving up prices of imported consumer goods . 
All Russians will soon feel the effects ; whether that will bring their president back from his world to this one is another matter .
