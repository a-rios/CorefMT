Anatomy of a Crisis 
BERKELEY - Getting out of our current financial mess requires understanding how we got into it in the first place . 
The fundamental cause , according to the likes of John McCain , was greed and corruption on Wall Street . 
Though not one to deny the existence of such base motives , I would insist that the crisis has its roots in key policy decisions stretching back over decades . 
In the United States , there were two key decisions . 
The first , in the 1970 &quot; s , deregulated commissions paid to stockbrokers . 
The second , in the 1990 &quot; s , removed the Glass-Steagall Act &apos;s restrictions on mixing commercial and investment banking . 
In the days of fixed commissions , investment banks could make a comfortable living booking stock trades . 
Deregulation meant competition and thinner margins . 
Elimination of Glass-Steagall then allowed commercial banks to encroach on the investment banks &quot; other traditional preserves . 
In response , investment banks branched into new businesses like originating and distributing complex derivative securities . 
They borrowed money and put it to work to sustain their profitability . 
This gave rise to the first causes of the crisis : the originate-and-distribute model of securitization and the extensive use of leverage . 
It is important to note that these were unintended consequences of basically sensible policy decisions . 
Other things being equal , deregulation allowed small investors to trade stocks more cheaply , which made them better off . 
But other things were not equal . 
In particular , the fact that investment banks , which were propelled into riskier activities by these policy changes , were entirely outside the regulatory net was a recipe for disaster . 
Similarly , eliminating Glass-Steagall was fundamentally sensible . 
Conglomerates allow financial institutions to diversify their business , and combining with commercial banks allows investment banks to fund their operations using relatively stable deposits instead of fickle money markets . 
This model has proven its viability in Europe over a period of centuries , and its advantages are evident in the US even now with Bank of America &apos;s purchase of Merrill Lynch . 
But conglomeratization takes time . 
In the short run , Merrill , like the other investment banks , was allowed to double up its bets . 
It remained entirely outside the purview of the regulators . 
As a stand-alone entity , it was then vulnerable to market swings . 
A crisis sufficient to threaten the entire financial system was required to precipitate the inevitable conglomeratization . 
The other element in the crisis was the set of policies that gave rise to global imbalances . 
The Bush administration cut taxes . 
The Fed cut interest rates in response to the 2001 recession . 
Financial innovation , meanwhile , worked to make credit even cheaper and more widely available . 
This , of course , is just the story of subprime mortgages in another guise . 
The result was increased US spending and the descent of measured household savings into negative territory . 
Of equal importance were the rise of China and the decline of investment in Asia following the 1997-1998 financial crisis . 
With China saving nearly 50 % of its GNP , all that money had to go somewhere . 
Much of it went into US treasuries and the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
This propped up the dollar and reduced the cost of borrowing for US households , encouraging them to live beyond their means . 
It also created a more buoyant market for the securities of Freddie and Fannie , feeding the originate-and-distribute machine . 
Again , these were not outright policy mistakes . 
Lifting a billion Chinese out of poverty is arguably the single most important event in our lifetimes . 
The fact that the Fed responded quickly prevented the 2001 recession from worsening . 
But there were unintended consequences . The failure of US regulators to tighten capital and lending standards when abundant capital inflows combined with loose Fed policies ignited a furious credit boom . 
The failure of China to move more quickly to encourage higher domestic spending commensurate with its higher incomes added fuel to the fire . 
Now , a bloated financial sector is being forced to retrench . 
Some outcomes , like the marriage of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch , are happier than others , like the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers . 
But , either way , there will be downsizing . 
Foreign central banks are suffering capital losses on their unthinking investments . 
As they absorb their losses on US treasury and agency securities , capital flows toward the US will diminish . 
The US current-account deficit and the Asian surplus will shrink . 
US households will have to start saving again . 
The one anomaly is that the dollar has strengthened in recent weeks . 
With the US no longer viewed as a supplier of high-quality financial assets , one would expect the dollar to have weakened . 
The dollar &apos;s strength reflects the knee-jerk reaction of investors rushing into US treasuries as a safe haven . 
It is worth remembering that the same thing happened in August 2007 , when the sub-prime crisis erupted . 
But once investors realized the extent of US financial problems , the rush into treasuries subsided , and the dollar resumed its decline . 
Now , as investors recall the extent of US financial problems , we will again see the dollar resume its decline . 
Emphasizing greed and corruption as causes of the crisis leads to a bleak prognosis . 
We are not going to change human nature . 
We cannot make investors less greedy . 
But an emphasis on policy decisions suggests a more optimistic outlook . 
Unintended consequences cannot always be prevented . 
Policy mistakes may not always be avoidable . 
But they at least can be corrected . That , however , requires first looking more deeply into the root causes of the problem .
