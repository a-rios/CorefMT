Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact 
In mid-July the great-and-good finance ministers of the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) gathered to consider the euro zone &apos;s economic condition . 
They ruminated over the most recent economic forecast , which projects annual GDP growth in the euro zone this year at a pathetically anemic 0.7 % . 
Then , to a minister , without exception , they all but decided that their economies should suffer more of the same , if not worse . 
They reiterated their commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact , which requires euro-zone countries to raise taxes and cut spending , putting even more downward pressure on their economies . 
The Pact is already knocking Germany into recession , and Italy &apos;s government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts fast enough to keep up with falling output . 
But none of this is apparently enough to force officials to re-examine their priorities . 
Some EU finance ministers still view the Stability Pact as the &quot; cornerstone &quot; of EMU . 
Others talk of the importance of obeying the &quot; rules of the game . &quot; 
Still others say that while it is clearly essential to restore economic growth , the recovery must occur &quot; within the spirit of the Pact . &quot; 
From the American side of the Atlantic , all of these rationales seem utterly bizarre . 
The last time an American government tried to ensure a balanced budget in the face of a recession was over seventy years ago , during the presidency of Herbert Hoover at the outset of the Great Depression . 
Since then the broad consensus in the US has been that cyclical economic distress requires the use of budget deficits to ameliorate suffering , stimulate aggregate demand , and hasten recovery . 
Economists call these cyclical fiscal boosts &quot; automatic stabilizers . &quot; 
When private incomes fall , so do public revenues . 
The reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income . 
But , more importantly , when private incomes fall , government social-welfare expenditures rise , sparking a recovery in demand , output , investment , and employment . 
The fall in taxes and the rise in spending do widen the budget deficit , but in a healthy and useful way . 
On the American side of the Atlantic , the usefulness of these automatic fiscal stabilizers is unchallenged . 
On the contrary , whenever recession threatens , political debate revolves around whether they need to be reinforced by additional stimulus via discretionary fiscal policy . 
No one considers how to put further downward pressure on the economy by raising tax rates and cutting back on spending programs . 
Neither Democrats nor Republicans have an interest in choking off economic activity . 
This is not a partisan issue . 
Nor is it even a fiscal discipline issue . 
Whenever proposals have surfaced for some sort of balanced-budget amendment to the US Constitution , proponents have typically included exemptions not just for war , but also for recessions . 
We know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact . 
Northern European countries - particularly Germany and the Netherlands - prided themselves on traditionally maintaining moderate debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively low interest rates . 
These countries saw that Southern European countries - Italy and Greece were the biggest worries - traditionally had high debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively high nominal interest rates because of their perceived tolerance of inflation . 
The Northern European countries feared that deficit spending by the South might ultimately create pressure for partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro - or , more precisely , their leaders feared that investors , fearing the same thing , would demand higher interest rates . 
The Stability and Growth Pact was intended to keep the public debts of southern Europe low , and thus keep interest rates low by reassuring investors that national debts would never be allowed to rise high enough to generate serious inflationary pressures . 
But if you look at the euro zone &apos;s economic problems today , the danger of high long-term nominal interest rates does not even rank among investors &apos; top ten concerns . 
At the very least , investors clearly do not fear that high debt will lead governments to stoke inflation by printing more money . 
The EU &apos;s problems are stagnant output , high structural unemployment , weak productivity growth , the wasteful and unfair Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) , and the forthcoming structural adjustments from the expansion of the EU itself . 
From one perspective , it is good that the euro zone &apos;s finance ministers are eager to keep their national debts low in the long term : it is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970 &apos;s will not be casually thrown away . 
But it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past . 
There is no more certain route to economic disaster than to put on historical blinders . 
As Herbert Hoover could attest , when we see only the economic policy problems of a generation ago , we risk missing the hazards that lie directly in front of our eyes .
