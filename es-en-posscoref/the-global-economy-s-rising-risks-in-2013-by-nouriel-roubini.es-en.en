The Economic Fundamentals of 2013 
NEW YORK - The global economy this year will exhibit some similarities with the conditions that prevailed in 2012 . 
No surprise there : we face another year in which global growth will average about 3 % , but with a multi-speed recovery - a sub-par , below-trend annual rate of 1 % in the advanced economies , and close-to-trend rates of 5 % in emerging markets . 
But there will be some important differences as well . 
Painful deleveraging - less spending and more saving to reduce debt and leverage - remains ongoing in most advanced economies , which implies slow economic growth . 
But fiscal austerity will envelop most advanced economies this year , rather than just the eurozone periphery and the United Kingdom . 
Indeed , austerity is spreading to the core of the eurozone , the United States , and other advanced economies ( with the exception of Japan ) . 
Given synchronized fiscal retrenchment in most advanced economies , another year of mediocre growth could give way to outright contraction in some countries . 
With growth anemic in most advanced economies , the rally in risky assets that began in the second half of 2012 has not been driven by improved fundamentals , but rather by fresh rounds of unconventional monetary policy . 
Most major advanced economies &quot; central banks - the European Central Bank , the US Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , and the Swiss National Bank - have engaged in some form of quantitative easing , and they are now likely to be joined by the Bank of Japan , which is being pushed toward more unconventional policies by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s new government . 
Moreover , several risks lie ahead . 
First , America &apos;s mini-deal on taxes has not steered it fully away from the fiscal cliff . 
Sooner or later , another ugly fight will take place on the debt ceiling , the delayed sequester of spending , and a congressional &quot; continuing spending resolution &quot; ( an agreement to allow the government to continue functioning in the absence of an appropriations law ) . 
Markets may become spooked by another fiscal cliffhanger . 
And even the current mini-deal implies a significant amount of drag - about 1.4 % of GDP - on an economy that has grown at barely a 2 % rate over the last few quarters . 
Second , while the ECB &apos;s actions have reduced tail risks in the eurozone - a Greek exit and / or loss of market access for Italy and Spain - the monetary union &apos;s fundamental problems have not been resolved . 
Together with political uncertainty , they will re-emerge with full force in the second half of the year . 
After all , stagnation and outright recession - exacerbated by front-loaded fiscal austerity , a strong euro , and an ongoing credit crunch - remain Europe &apos;s norm . 
As a result , large - and potentially unsustainable - stocks of private and public debt remain . 
Moreover , given aging populations and low productivity growth , potential output is likely to be eroded in the absence of more aggressive structural reforms to boost competitiveness , leaving the private sector no reason to finance chronic current-account deficits . 
Third , China has had to rely on another round of monetary , fiscal , and credit stimulus to prop up an unbalanced and unsustainable growth model based on excessive exports and fixed investment , high saving , and low consumption . 
By the second half of the year , the investment bust in real estate , infrastructure , and industrial capacity will accelerate . 
And , because the country &apos;s new leadership - which is conservative , gradualist , and consensus-driven - is unlikely to speed up implementation of reforms needed to increase household income and reduce precautionary saving , consumption as a share of GDP will not rise fast enough to compensate . 
So the risk of a hard landing will rise by the end of this year . 
Fourth , many emerging markets - including the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) , but also many others - are now experiencing decelerating growth . 
Their &quot; state capitalism &quot; - a large role for state-owned companies ; an even larger role for state-owned banks ; resource nationalism ; import-substitution industrialization ; and financial protectionism and controls on foreign direct investment - is the heart of the problem . 
Whether they will embrace reforms aimed at boosting the private sector &apos;s role in economic growth remains to be seen . 
Finally , serious geopolitical risks loom large . 
The entire greater Middle East - from the Maghreb to Afghanistan and Pakistan - is socially , economically , and politically unstable . 
Indeed , the Arab Spring is turning into an Arab Winter . 
While an outright military conflict between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other side remains unlikely , it is clear that negotiations and sanctions will not induce Iran &apos;s leaders to abandon efforts to develop nuclear weapons . 
With Israel refusing to accept a nuclear-armed Iran , and its patience wearing thin , the drums of actual war will beat harder . 
The fear premium in oil markets may significantly rise and increase oil prices by 20 % , leading to negative growth effects in the US , Europe , Japan , China , India and all other advanced economies and emerging markets that are net oil importers . 
While the chance of a perfect storm - with all of these risks materializing in their most virulent form - is low , any one of them alone would be enough to stall the global economy and tip it into recession . 
And while they may not all emerge in the most extreme way , each is or will be appearing in some form . 
As 2013 begins , the downside risks to the global economy are gathering force .
