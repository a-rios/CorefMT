The Federal Reserve in a Time for Doves 
CAMBRIDGE - The battle is on to replace current US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke . 
One might expect the Fed chairmanship - arguably the second most powerful official position in the United States , and certainly the world &apos;s most powerful financial position - to be determined by a conclave of central bankers . 
In fact , the choice is largely at the discretion of the US president . 
So let us consider two of the leading candidates , Lawrence Summers , a former US treasury secretary , and current Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen . 
Both Summers and Yellen are brilliant scholars with extensive experience in public service . 
Whereas the mainstream press seems intent on exploring their candidacies as a contest of contrasting personalities , the fact is that both candidates are extremely well qualified . 
Moreover , both have a reputation for believing that the Fed should not place excessive weight on price stability relative to unemployment . 
Normally , this dovish bias would be a handicap ; nowadays , it is an advantage . 
The importance of technical competence in monetary policy has been proved repeatedly by central banks around the world . 
According to research published in 2003 by the economists Christina Romer and David Romer , the quality of monetary policy depends critically on whether central bankers have a clear and nuanced understanding of policy making and inflation . 
The 1920 &quot; s , 1930 &quot; s , and 1970 &quot; s are replete with examples of central bankers who did not understand the basics , and whose economies paid the price . 
What this means is not just competence in setting interest rates , but also competence in regulatory policy . 
Some are criticizing Summers &apos;s ardent pursuit of financial deregulation during the 1990 &quot; s , when he headed the US Treasury under President Bill Clinton . 
But these critics overlook his role in helping to fight that decade &apos;s sovereign-debt crises , and his insistence that the US begin issuing inflation-indexed bonds . 
In a complex and ever-changing policy setting , it is almost impossible to get every call right , and the important thing is to learn from one &apos;s mistakes . 
Winston Churchill famously regretted overseeing the United Kingdom &apos;s catastrophic return to the gold standard in 1925 , when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer . 
His performance , needless to say , improved in later years . 
As for Yellen , it is true that she was President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve during the last years of the massive US housing bubble - which was particularly acute in her district . 
But Yellen &apos;s speeches on financial risks showed more foresight than those of most of her peers . 
Typically , one looks to the head of the central bank to serve as a bulwark against political pressure to push down interest rates and raise inflation . 
My own research in 1985 on inflation and central-bank independence showed that , in normal times , one generally wants a central banker who places greater emphasis on price stability relative to unemployment than an ordinary informed citizen might do . 
Installing a &quot; conservative &quot; central banker helps to keep inflation expectations in check , thereby holding down long-term interest rates and mitigating upward pressure on wages and prices . 
For the past 25 years , the mantra of &quot; inflation targeting &quot; ( introduced in my 1985 paper ) has served as a mechanism for containing inflation expectations by reassuring the public of the central bank &apos;s intentions . 
But excessive emphasis on low inflation targets can be counterproductive in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis in 75 years . 
Rather than worrying about inflation , central bankers should focus on reflating the economy . 
The real problem is that they have done such a good job convincing the public that inflation is the number-one evil that it is difficult for them to persuade anyone that they are now serious about reflation . 
That is why appointing a &quot; dove &quot; would not be a bad thing at all . 
Yellen has already developed a reputation as a dove within the Fed , with speeches consistently showing strong concern about today &apos;s high unemployment . 
And , though many on the left regard Summers as suspiciously conservative , that is hardly the case when it comes to inflation . 
His 1991 paper on monetary policy is widely cited as among the first to make the case for avoiding very low inflation targets , in part to give the central bank more room to lower interest rates . 
Back then , Summers clearly viewed himself as a monetary-policy dove : &quot; I would support having someone in charge of monetary policy who is more inflation-averse than I. &quot; 
But now Summers &apos;s dovishness is not a problem . 
In the face of downward nominal-wage rigidity , higher inflation would facilitate sectoral adjustment and achieve a small but useful impact on reducing debt burdens . 
If normal times call for a conservative central banker who helps to anchor inflation expectations , now is the rare time when we need a more unorthodox central banker who will fight deflation expectations . 
A central-bank version of the Vatican &apos;s papal conclave would have a hard time deciding whether to send up the fumata bianca for Yellen or for Summers - or perhaps for someone else ( another former Fed vice chair , Donald Kohn , now appears to be in the mix ) with similar inclinations .
