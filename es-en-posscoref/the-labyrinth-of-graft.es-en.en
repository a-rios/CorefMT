The Labyrinth of Graft 
Corruption is not exactly a new phenomenon in Latin America . 
Indeed , corruption scandals have been a fixture on the region &apos;s landscape since time immemorial . 
So there is nothing in principle new or surprising about the ongoing , almost endless drama that has engulfed Brazil &apos;s President Luis Ignacio &quot; Lula &quot; da Silva , his political organization - the Partido dos Trabalhadores ( PT , or Workers &quot; Party ) - and much of the country &apos;s political elite . 
But this scandal , unlike many others before it , is taking place in a consolidated democratic environment , and on the left . 
Of course , there has never been any reason to expect the left to be more honest than anyone else . To be sure , socialist , communist , or Castroite movements and leaders in Latin America have traditionally denounced graft , influence-peddling , and government grand larceny by the hemisphere &apos;s traditional right-wing dictatorships or even centrist constitutional regimes . 
It is also undeniable that the left , rarely having held power , has enjoyed fewer opportunities to lay its hands on national treasuries for one purpose or another . 
It is always easier to be honest when in opposition , although it also has always been far more dangerous , sometimes fatally so , to be out of power or favor in Latin America . 
But , as Latin America &apos;s left claims more governments - today in Brazil , Chile , Venezuela , Uruguay , and partly Argentina , and perhaps Mexico , Bolivia , and Nicaragua in the near future - there is no reason why it should be immune from the region &apos;s eternal ills . 
Clearly , the Brazilian left , like its Venezuelan , Argentine , Uruguayan , Mexican , and Bolivian counterparts , has not been inoculated against corruption . 
If Chile &apos;s left seems to be somewhat impervious to the trend , this has much more to do with the country &apos;s history and culture than with its socialist parties . 
Thus , the accusations - and facts - about the PT &apos;s flagrant violations of Brazil &apos;s campaign-finance laws , together with its apparently brazen attempts to buy votes in Congress ( not unlike what often occurs in more mature democracies ) is not very surprising . 
Only a naive belief in the left &apos;s intrinsic honesty could lead anyone to think that a totally dysfunctional institutional framework - in Brazil , in Argentina , in Mexico - and a history of what Octavio Paz called a patrimonial culture of the state would not generate the same consequences on the left that it did on the right and center . 
But there is another explanation for Lula &apos;s tragedy . 
It is one thing for corruption to thrive and graft to spread throughout government in the shadows of dictatorship and authoritarian rule . 
( There is no way of really knowing just how corrupt left-wing regimes in Cuba , Nicaragua , or Venezuela truly were , or are . ) 
It is quite another for this to happen in a radically different environment , in which transparency , a free press , an independent Congress , and a vibrant civil society are firmly in place , as is true of today &apos;s Brazil , Mexico , or Chile . 
The paradox of Brazil &apos;s current corruption scandal , and of the widespread corruption of the Mexican left in Mexico City , is that the advent of democracy , which has unveiled , documented , and focused attention on corruption , is largely a product of the left &apos;s struggle over the past two decades in both countries . 
Without the left , it is unlikely that democratic rule would have come as soon as it did , or that it would be as solidly rooted as seems to be the case today . 
But the left appears to have ignored that democracy and transparency apply to it as much as they do to the right or anyone else . 
Will Lula survive the flood of charges and revelations plaguing his government today ? 
Will former Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador be elected Mexico &apos;s President next year , despite the outrageous corruption that characterized his administration of the world &apos;s largest city ? 
The answers lie mostly in the extent of the scandal and the facts , but also in the jaded nature of many Latin Americans to accusations of corruption : everybody does it , and the left is no worse than the rest . 
One hopes that Lula can survive without having to rely on such cynicism . 
But Mexicans have been duly warned about how López Obrador will run the country should he be elected to succeed Vicente Fox as president : the same way he ran their capital city .
