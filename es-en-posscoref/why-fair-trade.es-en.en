Why Fair Trade ? 
LONDON - Historically , the term &quot; fair trade &quot; has meant many things . 
The Fair Trade League was founded in Britain in 1881 to restrict imports from foreign countries . 
In the United States , businesses and labor unions use &quot; fair trade &quot; laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls &quot; barbed-wire barriers to imports . &quot; 
These so called &quot; anti-dumping &quot; laws allow a company that suspects a foreign rival of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tariffs to protect it from &quot; unfair &quot; competition . 
Such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the minds of the benevolent organizers of the United Kingdom &apos;s annual &quot; Fairtrade Fortnight , &quot; during which I just bought two bars of fair-trade chocolate and a jar of fair-trade chunky peanut butter . 
Their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to developing-country farmers for their produce by excluding the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets . 
Fair-trade products like cocoa , coffee , tea , and bananas do not compete with domestic European production , and therefore do not have a protectionist motive . 
This is how it works : In exchange for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting &quot; agreed labor and environmental standards &quot; ( minimum wages , no pesticides ) , poor-country farming cooperatives receive a FAIRTRADE mark for their products , issued by the FAIRTRADE Labeling Organization . 
This certification enables supermarkets and other retailers to sell the products at a premium . 
Third-world farmers get a boost to their income , while first-world consumers get to feel virtuous : a marriage made in heaven . 
The fair-trade movement , launched in the 1980 &quot; s , has been growing rapidly . 
In a notable breakthrough in 1997 , the British House of Commons decided to serve only fair-trade coffee . 
By the end of 2007 , more than 600 producers &quot; organizations , representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries , were selling fair-trade products . 
Today , a quarter of all bananas in UK supermarkets are sold under a FAIRTRADE mark . 
But FAIRTRADE-labeled products still represent a very small share - typically less than 1 % - of global sales of cocoa , tea , coffee , etc . 
The economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known : stabilizing the prices of primary products , which are subject to sharp fluctuations , stabilizes their producers &quot; incomes . 
This argument inspired proposals - most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 - to create &quot; buffer stocks &quot; for the main commodities , which would take supply off the market when prices fell , and add to supply when prices rose . 
Keynes &apos;s proposal never made it into the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 , and , while buffer-stock schemes re-surfaced in the 1970 &quot; s , they , too , went nowhere . 
Left-wing economists like Ra√∫l Prebisch , moreover , later advanced the theory of &quot; declining terms of trade &quot; for primary products : their prices &quot; long-run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods . 
This tendency seemed to be at work from the mid-1980 &quot; s , as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices . 
In addition , price fluctuations throughout that decade were huge , with dire effects on sub-Saharan African and other developing countries that were largely dependent on commodities for export earnings . 
Since then , however , the price decline has been reversed . 
Food commodity prices have increased by 150 % since 2001 . 
This has raised farm producers &quot; income independently of the fair-trade movement &apos;s efforts . 
The &quot; declining terms of trade &quot; argument has collapsed . 
But primary-product prices remain much more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods and services , causing large fluctuations in producers &quot; incomes . 
This exaggerates the effects of booms and busts . 
So the issue of price stabilization has not gone away . 
It is difficult to see how the fair-trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem , because the only serious policy for stabilizing producers &quot; incomes is to control supply . 
But that is beyond the scope of fair trade . 
The target of all versions of fair trade is &quot; free trade , &quot; and the most damaging attacks on FAIRTRADE have come from free traders . 
In Unfair Trade , a pamphlet published in 2008 by the Adam Smith Institute , Mark Sidwell argues that FAIRTRADE keeps uncompetitive farmers on the land , holding back diversification and mechanization . 
According to Sidwell , the FAIRTRADE scheme turns developing countries into low-profit , labor-intensive agrarian ghettos , denying future generations the chance of a better life . 
This is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries - not farmers but casual laborers - who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards . 
In other words , FAIRTRADE protects farmers against their rivals and against agricultural laborers . 
Consumers , Sidwell argues , are also being duped . 
Nor is FAIRTRADE necessarily a guarantee of quality : because producers get a minimum price for fair-trade goods , they sell the best of their crop on the open market . 
But , despite its shaky economics , the fair-trade movement should not be despised . 
While cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases - rather like buying indulgences in the old Catholic Church - this is to sell fair trade short . 
In fact , the movement represents a spark of protest against mindless consumerism , grass-roots resistance against an impersonal logic , and an expression of communal activism . 
That justification will not convince economists , who prefer a dryer sort of reasoning . 
But it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureaucrats need not always have things their own way .
