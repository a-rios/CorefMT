The Middle East &apos;s Three Timelines 
BERLIN - Three distinct timelines are shaping developments in the Middle East : the short-term timeline of daily struggles and politics ; the medium-term timeline of geopolitical shifts , which is measured in decades ; and the long-term timeline of sociocultural transformation , or what the historian Fernand Braudel called the longue durée . 
Understanding each is essential to craft an effective strategy in the region . 
The first timeline certainly receives the most attention . 
The media report relentlessly on the latest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas ; recent negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program ; ongoing opposition activity and political repression in Egypt and Bahrain ; and the slaughter and humanitarian tragedies unfolding in Syria and Iraq . 
But political thinking in the Middle East is often linked to the second timeline . 
Indeed , it is impossible to grasp the region &apos;s contemporary history and politics without understanding the emergence of the regional state system after World War I and the demise of the Ottoman Empire . 
For example , there are the constant reminders that external powers - most notably , the United Kingdom and France - established the existing borders . 
Resistance against the so-called Sykes-Picot order nurtured the founding myths of many states and political movements in the region . 
That order has remained largely intact for almost a century , enabling the emergence of separate , though not necessarily exclusive , political identities in Syria , Iraq , Jordan , Lebanon , and , to varying degrees , in Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries . 
It has dictated the political parameters for 4-5 generations in the Arab world , including today &apos;s main protagonists , who have battled over it , adapted to it , and attempted to manipulate it . 
But the system may finally be unraveling . 
The border between Iraq and Syria is evaporating , as the Sunni militants of the Islamic State capture a widening swath of territory . 
And the rise of Kurdish military forces against them raises the possibility that a full-fledged Kurdish state will eventually emerge . 
Meanwhile , the tenuous status quo in Israel and Palestine is crumbling . 
With a two-state solution less likely than ever , the area is likely to experience the creeping consolidation of a one-state reality . 
In the Persian Gulf , ongoing international negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program are but the latest chapter in a struggle over strategic hegemony , security , and economic interests . 
And , though the world &apos;s appetite for energy resources from the Gulf will not diminish anytime soon , the structure of influence may be set to change again . 
When it comes to external power brokers , the United States plays the largest role , having replaced Great Britain by the 1970s . 
It now must learn to cope with the growing influence of India and China , as well . 
But it is the leading regional powers - Iran and Saudi Arabia - that have the greatest potential to transform the Middle East . 
The question is whether they will continue their competition for regional dominance , regardless of its destabilizing impact , or become pillars of a new regional security structure . 
Such a structure has become all the more important as the major external powers &quot; appetite for sustained involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts wanes . 
Having learned the hard way that they cannot dictate regional political outcomes , Western powers - as well as Russia , China , and India - will likely limit their involvement to protecting their direct interests and , if necessary , containing regional threats . 
Wherever the political and socioeconomic conditions of the short- and medium-term timelines fail to provide order and stability , the confessional , ethnic , or tribal identities that emerged over the longue durée gain prominence . 
The extent to which identities are invented matters little , as long as their invocation helps to appropriate elements of history and harness them to current political goals . 
Episodes from this timeline thus become as relevant as recent events . 
The conflict over the succession of religious leadership following the death of the Prophet Muhammad nearly 1,400 years ago is the origin of the split between Sunni and Shia Islam . 
The battles between the Fatimids and the Abbasids , the Crusades , the Mongol invasion , the Ottoman conquest , and , of course , Western imperialism all serve as points of reference for today &apos;s struggles . 
But these events provide more than explanation ; they often provoke powerful responses . 
Consider the Islamic State &apos;s recent declaration of a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria . 
Most Sunnis are outraged by the brutal behavior of the Islamic State &apos;s self-appointed caliph , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , and consider his claim that he will eventually &quot; conquer Rome &quot; ridiculous . 
Nonetheless , the symbols and &quot; memories &quot; from the longue durée that Baghdadi uses - such as the black flag of the Abbasids and the glorious stories of a time when the caliphate constituted a great power and a lodestar for all Sunnis - have an enduring impact . 
Of course , these ideas would amount to little were they not backed by modern weaponry , and had the countries whose territory the Islamic State is seizing not failed to create inclusive social contracts . 
But they imbue the Islamic State &apos;s project with a powerful historical narrative that cannot be dismissed . 
Navigating this narrative can be tricky for external actors . 
More generally , these actors &quot; actions in the region must never be shaped by the delusion that the Sunnis , Shia , or any other ethnic or religious minority is on their side . 
One lesson common to all of the Middle Eastern timelines is that all local actors are on their own side - and more than willing to draw foreigners into their wars if doing so fortifies them against their enemies .
