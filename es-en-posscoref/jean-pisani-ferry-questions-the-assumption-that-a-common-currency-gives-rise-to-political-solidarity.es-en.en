Will Vladimir Putin Bolster the Eurozone ? 
PARIS - Jacek Rostowski , Poland &apos;s finance minister until last November , recently suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have dared to annex Crimea if he had not observed Europe agonizing over a solution to the euro crisis . 
Is Rostowski right ? 
At first sight , such a connection seems far-fetched . 
Putin &apos;s show of strength involved military force and the implicit threat of a gas embargo , not monetary power ( which he does not have ) . 
Throughout the conflict over Crimea , the focus has been on Ukraine &apos;s relationship with the European Union , not with the eurozone . 
Moreover , Ukraine &apos;s recent monetary history has been defined by an exchange-rate peg to the US dollar , not the euro . 
So how could the euro be relevant to Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea ? 
Rostowski &apos;s point is that European countries demonstrated throughout the euro crisis that they had very little appetite for solidarity , even with their partners in the monetary union . 
How much solidarity would they be willing to display vis-Ã -vis a non-European Union country ? 
Russia , the reasoning goes , interpreted the EU &apos;s hesitant management of the turmoil as a license to act . 
And it could go further for the same reason . 
Clearly , the series of events following the financial meltdown in 2008 can be viewed as a crisis of solidarity . 
When a common response to Europe &apos;s banking debacle was needed , the answer was that each country should take care of its own financial institutions . 
When Greece lost access to financial markets , several months were needed to engineer a response , which took great care not to rely on EU funds and to limit each country &apos;s financial commitment . 
Indeed , when a &quot; firewall &quot; was finally created , its size was strictly limited and no form of joint liability was permitted . 
And Eurobonds were quickly rejected , because they would have created open-ended mutualized-debt obligations . 
Similarly , though it had been envisaged that the European Stability Mechanism could be used to recapitalize banks , it was eventually decided that the ESM would lend only to governments , rather than assuming bank risk directly . 
And , most recently , negotiations to establish an EU banking union once again confronted the challenge of forging a common resolution mechanism while limiting each member state &apos;s commitment . 
In short , each time the question of European solidarity was raised , the answer was : &quot; Yes , but only if absolutely necessary , and only to the minimum possible extent . &quot; 
Russian reactions to the Ukrainian uprising , meanwhile , have shown how vivid the memory of World War II remains in Moscow . 
It is fair to assume that the Kremlin may have noticed that Europe had no wish to emulate the United States and engineer a Marshall Plan of its own . 
More generally , Putin may have concluded that an EU that is so reluctant to take risks for the good of its own members would certainly not take risks for a mere neighbor . 
A key dimension of the current standoff over Ukraine is energy , and it raises the same question about European solidarity . 
As a recent study by Bruegel has shown , the EU as a whole could , with some effort , dispense with gas imports from Russia . 
But doing so would require EU member states to regard security of supplies as a matter of common concern , not as an issue that each country must address on its own . 
For example , in response to an embargo affecting a particular country , other EU members would draw on their reserves , increase their own production , pay more for imports , or cut consumption a bit . 
But this sense of solidarity has been consistently lacking in the EU &apos;s energy-policy debate . 
The underlying question is whether it is right to assume that the euro should have created more solidarity . 
Those who first imagined the single currency expected it to have profound consequences . 
In their eyes , it would be a means to forge a community . 
Currency borders generally coincide with political borders , so the creation of a monetary union was expected to give rise to some sort of common polity . 
Sharing a currency was expected to create a sense of common destiny , and hence solidarity , among the participants . 
That did not happen . 
Even before the crisis , it was clear that citizens and governments alike regarded ( wrongly ) the euro as a mere practicality . 
Its introduction was viewed as a technocratic affair , to be handled by central bankers and finance ministers , not as the cornerstone of a common European identity . 
Its creation did not cause the EU budget to increase by a single euro , nor did it lead to deeper political integration . 
The commitment called for by a common currency was consistently underestimated . 
In hindsight , it was a mistake to believe in the euro &apos;s spontaneous community-creating power . 
Though there clearly is a link between currency areas and political communities ( consider the dissolution of the ruble zone at the time of the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse ) , it is political community that creates the solidarity needed to foster currency linkages , not vice versa . 
Rostowski is certainly right : the euro &apos;s weakness has emboldened Putin . 
In the end , however , the right question may be whether the Crimea crisis will eventually bolster European solidarity - and thus the euro .
