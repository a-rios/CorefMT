Latin America &apos;s Reform Priorities 
SAN JOSE , COSTA RICA  -  
Yet their priorities are often set in an ad hoc way with little regard for achieving the largest welfare gains possible . 
Recently , a rare attempt was made to improve the quality of decision-making in Latin America and the Caribbean . 
The Consulta de San Jos√© in Costa Rica asked a group of leading economic experts to rank solutions to the biggest challenges facing the region . 
For the first time , all the costs and benefits of more than 40 different policy options were laid out side-by-side . 
The results were eye-opening . 
Over three days , experts heard evidence about the region &apos;s biggest challenges . 
It became clear that politicians often make decisions based on limited knowledge . 
There is no clear evidence , for example , that shows how we can actually improve the quality of education in schools . 
A program to provide teachers with monetary incentives and professional training was recently established in Mexico , but research shows no significant impact on educational outcomes . 
Domestic violence rates appear to be high in Latin America . 
The cost and damage is significant . 
Latin American and Caribbean governments need to know how to raise educational quality and combat domestic violence . 
Having no proven strategies or relevant estimates of costs and benefits is frightening . Both for domestic violence and educational quality , the Consulta highlighted a need for urgent research . 
But the experts &quot; ranking of priorities also revealed some exciting and promising policy options . 
At the top , they rated early childhood development programs . 
There is a compelling case for increased public investment at the start of a child &apos;s life . 
This could mean providing day-care services and preschool activities , improving hygiene and health services , or teaching parenting skills . 
Research shows that early childhood development programs in Latin America lead to higher levels of school readiness , enrollment , and academic performance . 
Mothers and older siblings become free to work or to further their own education . 
These programs should be emulated throughout the region . 
They are relatively cheap and have benefits between five and 19 times greater than the costs . 
The next most important strategy that the panel identified - better fiscal rules - may not seem sexy , but it is attractive because it effectively costs nothing . 
Though Latin America &apos;s economies are doing well now thanks to reform and high commodity prices , there are underlying problems . 
The goal is to implement a comprehensive set of fiscal responsibility laws that curb the ability of legislatures and ministers to increase spending relentlessly . 
The rules need to impose limits on deficits , spending , and debt , and require transparency so that the public knows what &apos;s going on . 
If matched by a genuine commitment to develop fiscal credibility , countries could increase their economic growth substantially . 
Third on the panel &apos;s list is increased investment in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure . 
Most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean spend less than 2 % of GDP on infrastructure , compared with 3 % to 6 % in China and Korea . 
Investment is particularly needed in the road network to build the arteries that bring jobs and prosperity : most of the extreme poor in Latin America &apos;s rural communities live five kilometers or more from the nearest paved road . 
Other highly ranked policy options include the establishment of independent agencies to evaluate rigorously government spending programs , and more use of conditional cash transfer programs that provide regular payments to poor households for meeting conditions like sending children to school . 
At the bottom of the list , the expert panel gave very low rankings to the idea of restricting alcohol sales ( as a proposed solution to health problems ) , educational voucher programs , and prison drug treatment and reintegration programs . 
This doesn &apos;t mean that these policies don &apos;t work , but that their benefits are much smaller than those of higher-ranked strategies . 
And there is debate about how effective some of them are . 
Educational voucher programs , for example , took a knock when careful analysis of a Chilean program found no positive effect on students &quot; performance . 
While climate change and biodiversity have become hot issues elsewhere , the panel concluded that the policy option of preserving rain forests to create carbon sinks would have international benefits but local costs , so these problems should properly be thought of as global issues rather than specifically Latin American ones . 
The Consulta succeeded in its goal of highlighting the most cost-effective ways to combat the region &apos;s biggest problems . 
However , it also underscored the areas where politicians are fumbling in the dark without decent research , and created a yardstick against which we can now measure policymakers &quot; spending decisions .
