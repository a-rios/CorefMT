America &apos;s Strategy Vacuum 
NEW HAVEN - Apparently , policymakers at the Federal Reserve are having second thoughts about the wisdom of open-ended quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
They should . 
Not only has this untested policy experiment failed to deliver an acceptable economic recovery ; it has also heightened the risk of another crisis . 
The minutes of the January 29-30 meeting of the Fed &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) speak to a simmering discontent : &quot; &#91; M &#93; any participants ... expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases . &quot; 
The concerns range from worries about the destabilizing ramifications of an exit strategy from QE to apprehension about capital losses on the Fed &apos;s rapidly ballooning portfolio of securities ( currently $ 3 trillion , and on its way to $ 4 trillion by the end of this year ) . 
As serious as these concerns may be , they overlook what could well be the greatest flaw in the Fed &apos;s unprecedented gambit : an emphasis on short-term tactics over longer-term strategy . 
Blindsided by the crisis of 2007-2008 , the Fed has compounded its original misdiagnosis of the problem by repeatedly doubling down on tactical responses , with two rounds of QE preceding the current , open-ended iteration . 
The FOMC , drawing a false sense of comfort from the success of QE1 - a massive liquidity injection in the depths of a horrific crisis - mistakenly came to believe that it had found the right template for subsequent policy actions . 
That approach might have worked had the US economy been afflicted by a cyclical disease - a temporary shortfall of aggregate demand . 
In that case , countercyclical policies - both fiscal and monetary - could eventually be expected to plug the demand hole and get the economy going again , just as Keynesians argue . 
But the US is not suffering from a temporary , cyclical malady . 
It is afflicted by a very different disease : a protracted balance-sheet recession that continues to hobble American households , whose consumption accounts for roughly 70 % of GDP . 
Two bubbles - property and credit - against which American families borrowed freely , have long since burst . 
But the aftershocks linger : Household-debt loads were still at 113 % of disposable personal income in 2012 ( versus 75 % in the final three decades of the twentieth century ) , and the personal-saving rate averaged just 3.9 % last year ( compared to 7.9 % from 1970 to 1999 ) . 
Understandably fixated on balance-sheet repair , US consumers have not taken the bait from their monetary and fiscal authorities . 
Instead , they have cut back on spending . 
Gains in inflation-adjusted personal-consumption expenditure have averaged a mere 0.8 % over the past five years - the most severe and protracted slowdown in consumer demand growth in the post-World War II era . 
The brute force of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus rings hollow as a cyclical remedy to this problem . 
Another approach is needed . 
The focus , instead , should be on accelerating the process of balance-sheet repair , while at the same time returning monetary and fiscal policy levers to more normal settings . 
Forgiveness of &quot; underwater &quot; mortgages ( where the outstanding loan exceeds the home &apos;s current market value ) , as well as reducing the foreclosure overhang of some 1.5 million homes , must be part of that solution . 
How else can the crisis-battered housing market finally clear for the remainder of US homeowners ? 
The same can be said for enhanced saving incentives , which would contribute to longer-term financial security for American households , most of which suffered massive wealth losses in the Great Recession . 
Expanded individual retirement accounts and 401K pension schemes , special incentives for low-income households ( most of which have no retirement plans ) , and an end to the financial repression that the Fed &apos;s zero-interest-rate policy imposes on savers must also be part of the solution . 
Yes , these are controversial policies . 
Debt forgiveness raises thorny ethical concerns about condoning reckless and irresponsible behavior . 
But converting underwater &quot; non-recourse &quot; mortgage loans , where only the house is at risk , into so-called &quot; recourse liabilities , &quot; for which nonpayment would have consequences for all of a borrower &apos;s assets , could address this concern , while simultaneously tempering America &apos;s culture of leverage with a much greater sense of responsibility . 
Timing is also an issue , especially with respect to saving incentives . 
To avoid the shortfall in aggregate demand that might arise from an abrupt surge in saving , these measures should be phased in over a period of 3-5 years . 
The main benefit of these proposals is that they are more strategic than tactical - better aligned with the balance-sheet problems that are actually afflicting the economy . 
As the quintessential laissez-faire system , the US has outsourced strategy to the invisible hand of the market for far too long . 
That has left the government locked into a reactive and often misguided approach to unexpected problems . 
Thus , the Fed is focused on cleaning up after a crisis rather than on how to avoid another one . 
The same is true of US fiscal policy , with an event-driven debate that now has ever-shorter time horizons : the fiscal cliff on January 1 , sequestration of expenditures on March 1 , expiration of the continuing budget resolution on March 27 , and the new May 18 debt-ceiling limit . 
A compliant bond market , which may well be the next bubble , is mistakenly viewed as the ultimate validation of this myopic approach . 
The dangers of America &apos;s strategy vacuum and the related penchant for short-termism have been mounting for some time . 
Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously raised this concern in a 1996 article in the Harvard Business Review . 
His focus was on corporate decision-making and misaligned incentives leading to a worrisome dichotomy between the short-term tactics of &quot; operational effectiveness &quot; ( cost cutting , outsourcing , and reengineering ) and the long-term visionary bets that frame successful strategies . 
While Porter &apos;s critique was directed at business managers , it bears critically on the current US policy debate . 
A successful long-term strategy cannot be seen as a succession of short-term fixes . 
The internal debate in the FOMC represents a healthy and long-overdue recognition that the central bank may be digging itself into an ever-deeper hole by committing to misguided policies aimed at the wrong problem . 
A comparable debate is raging over fiscal policy . 
Can America finally face up to the perils of its strategy vacuum ?
