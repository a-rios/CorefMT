A Balance-Sheet Approach to Fiscal Policy 
WASHINGTON , DC - Everyone is talking about debt , citing huge nominal figures that strongly affect public-policy debates worldwide . 
For starters , when it comes to public debt , there is a big difference between the gross and net figures . 
While Japan &apos;s gross public debt , for example , is a massive 246 % of GDP , the net figure , accounting for intra-government debts , is 127 % of GDP . 
Moreover , what should really matter about a country &apos;s public-debt burden is the expected annual cost of servicing it . 
As Daniel Gros recently pointed out , debt that can be rolled over indefinitely at zero interest rates is no debt at all . 
This is an extreme example ; but the closer a fixed interest rate gets to zero , and the longer the maturity becomes , the lower the burden of the stock of debt . 
Although Greece &apos;s public debt amounts to about 175 % of GDP , low interest rates - which are fixed for a large proportion of it - and long maturities mean that it may be more manageable than it seems . 
Greece &apos;s ratio of public-debt service to GDP is similar to that of Portugal , or even Italy . 
Indeed , that is why the latest deal with Greece , which entails even more bailout funds , could work , as long as the country is accorded the debt reprofiling that it needs to reverse the decline of its GDP , reduces its primary surpluses , and pursues balance-sheet-strengthening reforms . 
Such considerations underscore why it is a mistake to focus only on annual budgets , without adequate regard for the long-term balance-sheet implications of how borrowed money is used . 
This narrow , short-term focus differs from the approach taken for publicly traded companies , for which the strength of the balance sheet and the economy &apos;s potential are emphasized , alongside annual income statements . 
Imagine , for example , that Germany borrows at a 1 % fixed real interest rate with a ten-year maturity and invests the proceeds in repairing domestic transport infrastructure . 
These investments bring a modest real financial rate of return of 4 % through fees , tolls , and , in the longer run , tax revenues ( stemming from an increase in GDP ) . 
Such investments would directly strengthen Germany &apos;s public-sector balance sheet . 
Beyond infrastructure , spending to improve education - specifically to ensure that the next generation receives the skills they need to contribute to the twenty-first-century economy - would also result in faster GDP growth . 
For governments with access to today &apos;s extremely low - and often negative - real interest rates , it may seem like a no-brainer to borrow and invest more in projects with long-term benefits . 
Doing so would strengthen their balance sheets , crowd in the private sector , and generate employment . 
To be sure , some progress is being made toward bringing longer-term considerations into annual budget rules . 
Bodies like the European Commission increasingly distinguish between the structural and cyclical components of a budget deficit , and thus consider potential output , which increases with investment , in their calculations . 
For a long-term balance-sheet approach to gain traction , politicians will have to drop the ideological biases that are distorting fiscal policy . 
Proponents of austerity currently use nominal debt figures to scare voters , even in countries with record-low interest rates and large private-sector profits that are not being channeled toward investment . 
To counter their arguments , opinion-makers should emphasize the expected long-term returns on incremental public investment , not with ideological arguments , but with concrete examples from various sectors in the recent past that have had reasonably good rate of returns . 
Of course , as the economist Charles Wyplosz has explained , debt sustainability analysis is inherently uncertain . 
But some needs can reasonably be anticipated . 
In many countries , one could realistically expect a 4 % average return on at least one percentage point of GDP worth of incremental investment . 
If the marginal real interest rate is 1 % , an increase in public investment would actually reduce future indebtedness . 
Of course , it is possible for too large of an increase to put pressure on real interest rates , thereby crowding out potential private investment . 
If there is significant exchange-rate risk , such as in non-reserve currency countries , that , too , should be taken into account . 
Current fiscal-policy debates should not focus on simplistic headline numbers . 
To strengthen public accounts , both conservatives and progressives should start promoting a long-term balance-sheet-oriented approach to policymaking , ensuring that the debates are based on relevant data . 
Otherwise , the wrong policies - and , with them , anemic GDP growth and sluggish job creation - will continue to prevail .
