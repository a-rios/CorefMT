Let A Thousand Growth Models Bloom 
Over recent decades a simplistic view about the fundamentals that govern the theory and practice of development has taken root . 
Stated nakedly , this view holds that growth requires two things : foreign technology and good institutions . 
Failure to grow can be attributed to either ( or both ) of two pathologies . 
Call one the &quot; protection &quot; pathology , in which governments stymie progress by reducing access to foreign investment and technology . 
The other pathology is &quot; corruption , &quot; where political leaders fail to respect property rights and the rule of law . 
The natural remedies for these pathologies are claimed to be economic openness and improved governance . 
Reforms focused on governance and openness thus became the cornerstones of development strategy in virtually every country during the last fifteen years . 
Experience presents an awkward fit ( at best ) with this conception . 
Consider Latin America , where there has been greater enthusiasm for the so-called &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; on growth than in any other corner of the world . 
By the standards of the consensus view , policymaking in Latin America was better in the 1990s than ever before , nonetheless few countries in the region grew faster than in the period before 1980 . 
Or consider more successful countries . 
Some of the most important - South Korea and Taiwan since the early 1960s , China since the late 1970s , India since the early 1980s - have done extremely well under heterodox arrangements . 
All emphasized exports ; none grossly violated property rights . 
Their strategies bear only passing similarity to today &apos;s consensus . 
South Korea and Taiwan retained high levels of protection for a long time , and made active use of industrial policies . 
China &apos;s reforms are marked by partial liberalization , two-track pricing , limited deregulation , financial restraint , an unorthodox legal regime , and the absence of clear private property rights . 
India barely reformed its cumbersome trade and industrial regime before its economy took off in the 1980s . 
These and other success stories share one thing : they are instances of growth strategies that combine orthodoxy with local heresies - unconventional institutional innovations that relax constraints on growth at least cost to the social and political fabric . 
Of course , heterodoxy does not always produce payoffs . 
Most countries with protected economies and lax protection of property rights languish . 
But the fact that some of the world &apos;s most successful economies prospered while doing things that are not in the rule-book is something that cannot be dismissed easily . 
To grasp the conventional view &apos;s deficiencies , begin with the problem of technology adoption . 
Learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a key challenge . 
Neither economic nor management theory is of much help in helping entrepreneurs ( or the state ) choose appropriate investments among the range of modern-sector activities . 
Yet making the right investment decisions is essential to growth , because they determine the pattern of specialization . 
Today &apos;s intellectual property regime protects innovators in advanced countries by issuing temporary monopolies , i.e. , patents . 
But the investor in the developing country who figures out that an existing good can be produced profitably at home and sets up a model for others to emulate does not normally get such protection , even though the social returns can be high . 
Laissez-faire is not the optimal solution here , just as it is not in the case of research and development of new products . 
Desirable government policy consists of a carrots and stick : encouraging investment and entrepreneurship in the modern sector ex ante , but , equally important , rationalizing production and driving out poor performers ex post . 
Institutional arrangements also have large elements of specificity . 
Discovering which institutions are suitable to local conditions requires experimentation . 
Reforms that succeed in one setting may do poorly or fail in other settings . 
Two-track reform worked well in Deng &apos;s China but not in Gorbachev &apos;s Soviet Union . 
Import-substitution fostered competitive industries in Brazil , but not in Argentina . 
Gradualism may be appropriate to India , not Chile . 
Specificity helps explain why successful countries -China , South Korea , Taiwan , and Chile among others - usually combine unorthodox elements with orthodox policies . 
It may also account for why important institutional differences persist among advanced countries in areas such as the public sector &apos;s role , the nature of legal systems , corporate governance , financial markets , labor markets , and social insurance mechanisms . 
It is not that economic principles work differently in different places , or need to be tailored to local conditions . 
An important distinction between economic principles and their institutional embodiment is that most key economic principles are institution-free . 
Incentives , competition , hard-budget constraints , sound money , fiscal sustainability , property rights are central to the ways in which economists think about policy and its reform . 
But these principles do not demand specific institutional solutions . 
Property rights can be implemented through common law , civil law , or , for that matter , Chinese-style socialism . 
Competition can be maintained by a combination of free entry and laissez-faire , or by a well-functioning regulatory authority . 
Macroeconomic stability can be achieved under a variety of fiscal institutions . 
Because policymakers operate in second-best environments , optimal reform trajectories - even in apparently straightforward cases such as price reform - cannot be designed without due regard to prevailing conditions and without weighing the consequences for multiple distorted margins . 
Neither technology nor good institutions can be acquired without significant domestic adaptations . 
Those adaptations require a pro-active role for the state and civil society , and collaborative strategies that foster entrepreneurship and institution building . 
What the world needs right now is less consensus and more experimentation in the service of such strategies .
