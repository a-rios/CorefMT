Deterring Arab Democracy 
CAMBRIDGE - The lack of democracy in the Arab world results from an unholy alliance between Western interests and local autocrats , justified by what both sides claim to be the region &apos;s &quot; cultural specificity . &quot; 
In a nutshell , it has been much easier for the West to do business in the post-colonial Middle East with un-democratic regimes , which have found Western support and recognition useful in marginalizing local liberal and democratic forces , even as it paved the way for the rise of Islamist radicalization . 
Sticks as well as carrots have been used - by both sides - to maintain this alliance . 
For example , the Western emphasis on reform and democracy in recent years has been used more often than not as a threat , a typical message being : &quot; Help us in Iraq or we will press for democracy and human rights in your own country . &quot; 
And the Arab reply is equally threatening : &quot; Stop pressing us on the reform issue or we won &apos;t cooperate in the &quot; war on terror &quot; ! &quot; 
Two other major issues have sustained the trade-off : Israel and the rise of the Islamist movements . 
The Arab public overwhelmingly regards Israel as an alien and illegitimate entity imposed by force on Palestinian land with Western support . 
If this perception was channeled democratically and allowed to shape Arab countries &quot; policies toward Israel , any peace negotiations would be even more complicated than they are now . 
So it is far easier for authoritarian regimes like Egypt and Jordan ( and in the future perhaps Syria ) , where there is no need for parliamentary agreement , to launch negotiations and sign peace agreements with Israel . 
Likewise , in Morocco , Tunisia , Mauritania , Qatar , Oman , and Bahrain , where various low-level contacts and Israeli representations exist , undemocratic regimes can define whatever relationship with Israel they choose . 
The rise of radical Islamism has been no less obstructive when it comes to Arab democracy . 
Decades of unholy alliance between Arab autocrats and the West have seen radical Islam emerge as a &quot; salvation &quot; force . 
If free and fair elections were to be held in any Arab country , Islamists would come to power . 
That was the case in Algeria in 1991-92 , in Iraq in 2005 , and in the West Bank and Gaza in 2006 . 
Other countries , such as Jordan , Morocco , Kuwait , Yemen , and Bahrain , have created more limited space for democracy . 
There , too , Islamists have immediately filled it . 
The West has wasted decades , missing countless chances to establish regimes that could empower Arab liberal and democratic forces . 
The West &apos;s blind support for autocratic Arab rulers has reduced all hope of peaceful change . 
The democratic process has lost its aura and its thrust , not least because democratization seems to lead to the rise of political movements the West finds unacceptable . 
The whole notion of democracy has been eroded and discredited , with the radicalization that engulfs many Muslim societies now spilling over into their emigrant communities in the West . 
When US President George W. Bush &apos;s administration launched its Middle East Partnership Initiative for democratization in 2002 , it turned out to be too little too late - and it died too soon . 
The allocated budget was just $ 29 million , but its rapid death can also be ascribed to its short-sighted design - and to Barack Obama , who has shown little interest in the issue . 
Obama &apos;s praise of Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak as a man with whom one could do business demoralized Egyptian opposition groups , which have been struggling against the long-serving autocrat and his efforts to ensure that his son , Gamal Mubarak , succeeds him . 
The US is not the only guilty party . 
Europe has played a major role in retarding democratic reform in Libya and Saudi Arabia . 
Libya has become a Mecca for European leaders trying to win multi-billion dollar oil and investment deals . 
The rehabilitation of the Qaddafi regime has never included any push to ease political repression in Libya . 
An even more telling case is Saudi Arabia . 
No European leader risks antagonizing the Saudis by raising the issue of democracy and human rights . 
Saudi women remain prohibited from driving cars , traveling on their own , and working or studying without the permission of a male relative . 
Saudi society , and those of some other Gulf States , lacks minimum levels of political freedom and participation . 
The status quo is excused by Arab regimes in the name of cultural specificity - the same pretext used by Western governments to justify their &quot; value-free &quot; policies toward these regimes . 
Add together all the trade-offs between the West and the Arab regimes , along with the Israeli and Islamist factor , and the conclusion at which one arrives is as inescapable as it is alarming : the West cannot afford democracy in the region .
