Nato \ u0027s Next Moves East 
BERLIN : Nato &apos;s next summit will take place in Prague in the winter of 2002 - that is , if President Bush doesn &apos;t call his allies together before then . 
But the questions to be answered leading up to the summit are already clear : which , if any , country will be asked to join Nato ; when will any new member join ? 
Whatever decisions are taken , it is also clear that preparatory work must begin as soon as possible , and at least before the end of the year . 
All this is different from 1997 , when Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic joined Nato . 
Back then , the outcome of the Madrid summit that agreed to their membership was uncertain until the final moments . 
That uncertainty ended when America succeeded in limiting invitations to three chosen countries , surprising those Alliance members who supported other candidates . 
Today , the most important issue facing Nato concerns whether or not to admit the Baltic states - Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania - now , after some delay , or never . 
Turning down or delaying Baltic state membership will be seen as a concession to Russia ; acting in their favor will be regarded by Moscow as a slap-in-the-face . 
No matter what decision Nato takes , containing the negative fall-out - in Russia or the Baltics - will not be easy . 
So a surprise conclusion in the manner of Madrid will only make matters worse , because careful preparations will be needed to contain the damage , and too much time will be lost if everything is put off until the meeting in Prague . 
Some Nato members hope to evade these problems altogether through delay . 
Why not postpone enlargement , they ask , until some of the states demanding to join Nato have gained EU membership , where elements of their security concerns may be met ? 
But postponement is not a viable option , for the following reasons : 
- Russia itself placed membership for the Baltic three atop Nato &apos;s agenda . 
Time and again Moscow has thundered that Nato &apos;s first eastward enlargement must be its last . 
Bringing the Baltic states into Nato , Russia claims , would severely compromise its security ( for that read Russian self-esteem ) . 
The strength of these protests , however , will make dawdling over Nato enlargement appear as a kowtow to President Putin ; 
- The West promised to continue enlargement at the Washington Summit of April 1999 . 
Back then Nato heads-of-state welcomed the progress of various candidate countries , commending the Baltic states in particular . 
Nato &apos;s leaders also promised to revisit enlargement by 2002 at the latest . 
So they cannot repeat the same formula in Prague and remain credible in both Russia and Eastern Europe ; 
- EU enlargement takes time while Nato enlargement is relatively speedy . 
Were negotiations over EU-admission of the Baltics near conclusion , postponing Nato-membership could be justified because the EU , with its new defense identity , is now both a security and prosperity union . 
As EU members , the Baltic states would indirectly come under Nato &apos;s security shield , making explicit membership unnecessary perhaps . 
Unfortunately , years will elapse before negotiations over EU membership will conclude and be ratified . 
Stalling until that time is postponement by other means . 
- At the Cold War &apos;s end , Nato redefined itself as a stability network for all the Euro-Atlantic community , which includes Eastern Europe &apos;s new democracies . 
Arguments which say that , because no direct security risk exists there is no need for a Nato guarantee of the Baltics - a view that sometimes gains attention in Berlin - break with this redefinition . 
Even if some Nato members want to distance themselves from this strategy , the Bush Administration unambiguously supports Nato &apos;s role as a stability network . 
Neither putative EU membership nor today &apos;s favorable security conditions justify postponing enlargement . 
Diplomatic tricks cannot finesse the issue . 
Nato must either say &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No &quot; to the Baltic states . 
( To be precise , Nato must treat the applications of all three Baltic countries together . 
If only one were invited to join as a symbol of western determination , Russia would interpret this as appeasement , not steadfastness ) 
If Nato says &quot; Yes &quot; to the Baltics , it must make both Moscow and the Baltic three understand that enlargement is meant to increase stability along Russia &apos;s western border , not threaten Russia . 
As a signal to both , Nato &apos;s military presence in the Baltics should be kept to a minimum . 
In addition , the prospect of a democratic Russia eventually joining Nato might be openly acknowledged . 
Both must be done before any new enlargement is announced . 
If Nato rejects the Baltic states it will need to prevent Moscow from interpreting that decision as confirmation that Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania remain locked within Russia &apos;s sphere of influence and that its Great Power posturing has paid off . 
Both inferences are potentially disastrous , not only for relations between West and Eastern Europe but , more importantly , for relations between Russia and the West . 
Russia must be persuaded to confirm - explicitly and formally - the right of the Baltics , on their own , to choose their allies . 
In view of Moscow &apos;s insistence that it will never accept such a decision , this will not be easy . 
Moreover , if Nato membership for the Baltics is rejected , they will need reassurance that the West will assist them , concretely , should their security be put at risk . 
Admission or postponement are both legitimate decisions . 
But each will require considerable early efforts to reduce their fall-out . 
In weighing these options , admission of the Baltic countries quickly seems the better solution . 
Efforts to contain the damage caused by postponement will likely be far more demanding than any effort needed to ease tension after enlargement is announced . 
Moreover , at the next Summit following Prague , the Baltics must be at any rate be granted what , in view of their history , they have every right to demand : to be part of a stability alliance that is a matter of course for western democracies .
