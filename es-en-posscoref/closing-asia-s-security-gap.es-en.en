Closing Asia &apos;s Security Gap 
TOKYO - There was little surprise in President Barack Obama &apos;s announcement late last year that the United States will strengthen its position in East Asia while drawing down its forces in Europe . 
After all , the security environment in East Asia is unpredictable and rapidly changing , unlike in Europe , where it is relatively stable . 
Against this background , efforts now underway to establish a comprehensive multilateral framework for the region can learn from the recent history of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
The US is not alone in shifting its security focus to East Asia . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s decision to host Russia &apos;s first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) meeting in Vladivostok in September reflects his country &apos;s growing interest in the region . 
And , like the US , Russia attended last November &apos;s East Asia Summit ( EAS ) . 
The EAS , along with the ASEAN Regional Forum ( ARF ) ministerial meetings last July , made important contributions to improving the region &apos;s security environment . 
The ARF &apos;s effort to build a more predictable and constructive pattern of relations for the Asia-Pacific region is based on three stages : confidence-building , preventive diplomacy , and conflict resolution . 
At its 18th ministerial conference last year , ARF entered the second phase , preventive diplomacy , while continuing to strengthen confidence-building measures . 
Maritime cooperation was a focus of attention at both the ARF ministerial meeting and at the EAS , not least because China &apos;s activities in the South and East China Seas have generated fresh uncertainty in the region . 
The ARF welcomed the adoption of &quot; Guidelines for Implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea . &quot; 
Likewise , the EAS focused on combating &quot; sea piracy , search and rescue at sea , marine environment , maritime security , maritime connectivity , freedom of navigation , fisheries , and other areas of cooperation . &quot; 
Both meetings also focused on disaster management , with the ARF ministers reaching a common understanding on furthering regional cooperation . 
The ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance in Jakarta is expected to play a central role in building a disaster-related information network across the region , and in developing concrete measures for disaster management . 
Similarly , many of the countries attending the EAS stressed the need for response capabilities , such as emergency disaster relief . 
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda announced his country &apos;s readiness to host an international conference this summer on major disasters , giving Japan an opportunity to share lessons learned from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami . 
The aim must be to make the region more resilient to natural disasters as part of a broader framework for regional cooperation . 
The rapid changes occurring in the Asia-Pacific region demand policies to maximize growth opportunities while minimizing risks . 
That is why Koichiro Gemba , Japan &apos;s foreign minister , has proposed new &quot; open and multilayered networks &quot; with other Asia-Pacific countries . 
&quot; Multilayered &quot; means multinational cooperation on various activities that can be promoted through bilateral , trilateral , or multilateral mechanisms . 
Work within the ARF and EAS frameworks is already aligned with this concept , and Japan is pursuing its own trilateral dialogues with China and the Republic of Korea , as well as with the US and Australia . 
Japan believes that these networks must be open to all of the Asia-Pacific region &apos;s countries , as their establishment requires China &apos;s full participation . 
But the rule needed to form the foundation of such a network must obviously adhere to international law , and the ARF meeting &apos;s final declaration clearly reflected this concern . 
This is where lessons from the OSCE &apos;s experience are relevant to Asia &apos;s budding efforts to establish a regional architecture . 
In particular , despite the significant socioeconomic and political differences between the Asia-Pacific region and Europe , the OSCE &apos;s confidence- and security-building measures are worthy of careful consideration . 
Such measures aim to reduce the risk of conflict by increasing trust among participating OSCE states , and by contributing to greater transparency in the field of military planning and other activities . 
The Vienna Document , which is the key to understanding these OSCE efforts , obliges annual exchanges of information on existing military forces , the structure of armed forces , and major weapons and defense systems . 
It also requires annual information exchanges on defense planning and budgets . 
Adoption of such measures in the Asia-Pacific region would do much to promote confidence and trust among Asian countries . 
A few steps in this direction have already been taken within the ARF framework , including the publication for more than a decade of an Annual Security Outlook based on contributions from ARF countries . 
In 2010 , ARF ministers widened the Outlook &apos;s scope with the Simplified Standardized Format , which includes publication of national defense doctrines , defense expenditure , and the total number of personnel in a country &apos;s armed forces . 
There have been two main approaches to meeting modern regional-security challenges : traditional alliances of the NATO type , which prepare for any potential threat to members , and comprehensive multilateral frameworks of the OSCE type , which include all relevant players within a region . 
As Europe &apos;s post-1945 history clearly shows , traditional alliances and a comprehensive multilateral framework can be complementary , and are essential to maintaining regional peace and stability . 
Now the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing efforts to establish a similar comprehensive and multilateral framework through the ARF and the EAS . 
But , however successful such efforts may be , they will enhance , not lessen , the importance of existing bilateral relationships , such as the Japan-US alliance .
