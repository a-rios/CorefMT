The Harmony Trap 
A widespread feeling exists that European integration is proceeding sideways , if not backwards . 
But in at least one field , real progress has been made : the Commission &apos;s endeavor to build a single market for financial services . 
An ambitious Financial Services Action Plan - launched in 1999 to bring about a single European wholesale market , open and secure retail markets , and state-of-the-art prudential rules and supervision - envisaged 42 measures to be implemented by 2003-2005 . 
After a slow start , rapid progress has been achieved , with 36 measures formally adopted , including important directives on market abuse , prospectuses , financial collateral , distance marketing , collective investment schemes , and a common set of International Accounting Standards for the consolidated accounts of all listed companies . 
A common position has been reached on four more measures , including directives on investment services , on transparency , and on takeovers . 
There has also been an institutional leap forward with the adoption of the so-called Lamfalussy method for quick adoption of implementing measures and approval of a European regulators &apos; committee . 
Impressive results . 
But to assess their relevance , three questions must be asked : was such harmonization necessary ? 
How satisfactory are its results , over and above the sheer number of measures adopted ? 
Most importantly , is completion of the FSAP sufficient to achieve the single financial market ? 
The first question reflects a long-standing and apparently philosophical dispute between Britain - more accurately , the so-called British financial industry , which comprises almost exclusively non-British firms - and the Continent . 
A one-size-fits-all approach , the British argue , is incompatible with existing differences between EU states : all that is needed is mutual recognition , leaving the rest to competition and investors &apos; choices . 
Insufficient harmonization , however , has often allowed member states to erect barriers to competition , which can only be removed by consistent implementation of laws and standards . 
This is why securities law , unlike company law , has federal status in the US . 
A more level playing field , achieved by a gradual increase in the level of harmonization that is driven by both institutions and markets , will in the end provide a better opportunity for the fittest to survive . 
As for what has already been achieved , some measures deserve unqualified praise . 
Adoption of a common set of advanced accounting principles will remove a key obstacle to meaningful comparison of European listed companies &apos; profitability , although more needs to be done to achieve common standards of enforcement , as recent corporate scandals show . 
The directive on market abuse provides European regulators with greater investigative and sanctioning power , as well as enhancing cooperation . 
The prospectus directive allows companies to issue shares and raise capital in all European markets by using the same prospectus as approved by each company &apos;s national authority . 
The most delicate issues are those raised by the Investment Services Directive , on which only a majority of member states have reached a common position . 
The directive firmly , and rightly , frees competition among all trading venues , removing the privileges enjoyed by &quot; official &quot; exchanges . 
Trades must no longer be concentrated on an officially regulated market , which means that assessment of &quot; best execution &quot; remains an open question , especially when trades are &quot; internalized &quot; by intermediaries acting as counterparts to their customers . 
No obvious solution to this problem exists in a multi-venue world , where &quot; best execution &quot; can neither be presumed nor categorically defined . 
But the fullest possible information in executing trades is a necessary condition : hence the imposition of pre-trade ( posting orders and prices ) and post-trade transparency for intermediaries trading on their own account with retail investors - a requirement that has been firmly opposed by all the states where the relevant &quot; internalizers &quot; reside . 
This resistance should not be allowed to prevent the European Parliament from endorsing the common position : markets and regulators alike urgently need a new ISD , as innovations have made the old one obsolete . 
Thus , while certain necessary requirements for the existence of a single European financial market have been established , they are far from sufficient , at least at the retail level . 
This is not so much because further top-down measures are needed , but because market failures hamper the required bottom-up drive . 
&quot; Markets are created and developed by market participants , not by rules and regulation , &quot; says the City of London . 
True , perhaps but the record is far from brilliant . 
The persistent fragmentation of privately owned European exchanges is not due primarily to regulatory obstacles . 
More relevantly , the high cost of cross-border transactions reflects inefficiencies in the post-trade stage , especially clearing and settlement . 
As stated in the so-called Giovannini Report to the European Commission , &quot; The post-trade landscape could be significantly improved by market-led convergence across national systems . &quot; 
But a major obstacle to this is the existence of local rent-seeking franchises and monopolies . 
Silent progress is instead being made on another front . 
As a result of the Lamfalussy report , not only was the legislative process improved , but an important institutional status was conferred upon the Committee of European Securities Regulators . 
Apart from its consultative role in drafting legislation , the CESR has now been mandated to set guidelines and common standards for national regulation and enhancing cooperation . 
This is potentially the most important step towards establishing a level playing field , as the transposition of Community legislation into national regulation still leaves too much room for discretion . 
The plea for a single European regulator ( a &quot; European SEC &quot; ) is , at the moment , misguided : there is no legal basis in the Treaty ( or in the draft constitution ) , member states &apos; legal systems are too different , rules are not sufficiently harmonized , and Community law appears to be moving towards decentralization . 
A gradual approach , based on growing coordination of national regulations and regulatory practices at the CESR level , appears to be the most viable alternative .
