The New Bush Doctrine 
President George W. Bush &apos;s second inaugural address set forth an ambitious vision of the role of the United States in advancing the cause of freedom worldwide , fueling worldwide speculation over the course of American foreign policy during the next four years . 
The ideas expressed in Bush &apos;s speech thus deserve serious consideration . 
&quot; It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture , &quot; Bush declared , &quot; with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world . &quot; 
There is a bow to diplomacy in the assurance that fulfilling this mission &quot; is not primarily the task of arms , though we will defend our friends and ourselves by force of arms when necessary . &quot; 
Similarly , Bush recognizes that outsiders cannot force liberty on people . 
Instead , &quot; Freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities . &quot; 
Finally , there is acceptance of diversity , for &quot; when the soul of a nation finally speaks , the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own . 
America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling . 
Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice , attain their own freedom and make their own way . &quot; 
I agree with this goal , and have devoted the last fifteen years of my life and several billion dollars of my fortune to attaining it . 
Yet I find myself in sharp disagreement with the Bush administration . 
It is not only that there is a large gap between official words and deeds ; 
When Bush declared war on terror , he used that war to invade Iraq . 
When no connection with Al Qaeda could be established and no weapons of mass destruction could be found , he declared that we invaded Iraq to introduce democracy . 
Now the elections in Iraq are about to be converted into a civil war between a Shi &apos;a-Kurd dominated government and a Sunni insurrection . 
In Iraq and beyond , when Bush says that &quot; freedom will prevail , &quot; many interpret him to mean that America will prevail . 
This impugned America &apos;s motives and deprived the US of whatever moral authority the country once had to intervene in other countries &quot; domestic affairs . 
If , for example , America offers support to Iranian students who are genuinely striving for greater freedom , they are now more likely to be endangered by US support , as the regime &apos;s hardliners are strengthened . 
To explain what is wrong with the new Bush doctrine , I have to invoke the concept of open society . 
That is the concept that guides me in my efforts to foster freedom around the world . 
The work has been carried out through foundations operating on the ground and led by citizens who understand the limits of the possible in their countries . 
Occasionally , when a repressive regime expels our foundation - as happened in Belarus and Uzbekistan - we operate from the outside . 
Paradoxically , the most successful open society in the world , the US , does not properly understand the first principles of an open society ; indeed , its current leadership actively disavows them . 
The concept of open society is based on the recognition that nobody possesses the ultimate truth . 
To claim otherwise leads to repression . 
In short , we may be wrong . 
That is precisely the possibility that Bush refuses to acknowledge , and his denial appeals to a significant segment of the American public . 
An equally significant segment is appalled . 
This has left the US not only deeply divided , but also at loggerheads with much of the rest of the world , which considers our policies high-handed and arbitrary . 
President Bush regards his reelection as an endorsement of his policies , and feels reinforced in his distorted view of the world . 
The &quot; accountability moment &quot; has passed , he claims , and he is ready to confront tyranny throughout the world according to his own lights . 
But the critical process that is at the core of an open society - which the US abandoned for eighteen months after September 11 , 2001 - cannot be forsaken . 
That absence of self-criticism is what led America into the Iraq quagmire . 
A better understanding of the concept of open society requires that promoting freedom and democracy and promoting American values and interests be distinguished . 
If it is freedom and democracy that are wanted , they can be fostered only by strengthening international law and international institutions . 
Bush is right to assert that repressive regimes can no longer hide behind a cloak of sovereignty : what goes on inside tyrannies and failed states is of vital interest to the rest of the world . 
But intervention in other states &quot; internal affairs must be legitimate , which requires clearly established rules . 
As the dominant power in the world , America has a unique responsibility to provide leadership in international cooperation . 
America cannot do whatever it wants , as the Iraqi debacle has demonstrated ; but , at the same time , nothing much can be achieved in the way of international cooperation without US leadership , or at least active participation . 
Only by taking these lessons to heart can progress be made towards the lofty goals that Bush announced .
