Henry Paulson is Wrong 
CHICAGO - When a profitable company is hit by a very large liability , the solution is not to have the government buy its assets at inflated prices . The solution , instead , is protection under bankruptcy law , which in the United States means Chapter 11 . 
Under Chapter 11 , companies with a solid underlying business generally swap debt for equity . Old equity holders are wiped out and old debt claims are transformed into equity claims in the new entity which continues operating with a new capital structure . 
Alternatively , the debt-holders can agree to reduce the face value of debt , in exchange for some warrants . 
So why not use this well-established approach to solve the financial sector &apos;s current problems ? 
The obvious answer is that we do not have time ; 
But we are in extraordinary times , and the government has taken and is prepared to take unprecedented measures . 
But at what price ? 
Will government do better at valuing those assets ? 
In a negotiation between government officials and a banker with a bonus at risk , who will have more clout in determining the price ? 
Paulson &apos;s plan would create a charitable institution that provides welfare to the rich - at taxpayers &quot; expense . 
If the government subsidy is large enough , it will succeed in stopping the crisis . 
Aside from costing billions of taxpayer dollars , Paulson &apos;s plan violates the fundamental capitalist principle that whoever reaps the gains also bears the losses . 
Remember that in America &apos;s Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980 &quot; s , the government had to bail out those institutions , because their deposits were federally insured . 
Since we do not have time for Chapter 11 proceedings and we do not want to bail out all the creditors , the lesser evil is to do what judges do in contentious and overextended bankruptcy processes : impose a restructuring plan on creditors , with part of the debt forgiven in exchange for equity or warrants . 
There is precedent for such a bold move . 
During the Great Depression , many debt contracts were indexed to gold . 
President Roosevelt &apos;s administration declared the clause invalid , forcing debt forgiveness . 
My colleague and current Fed Governor Randall Koszner studied this episode and showed that not only stock prices , but also bond prices , soared after the Supreme Court upheld the decision . 
How is that possible ? 
As corporate finance experts have been saying for 30 years , having too much debt and too little equity is costly , so reducing the face value of debt can sometimes benefit not only equity-holders , but also debt-holders . 
But , while debt forgiveness benefits holders of both equity and debt , debt-holders don &apos;t voluntarily agree to it for two reasons . 
First , even if each individual debt-holder benefits , he or she will benefit even more if everybody else cuts the face value of their debt and he or she does not . 
Hence , everybody waits for others to move first , creating obvious delay . 
Second , from a debt-holder &apos;s point of view , a government bailout is better . 
Even talk of a government bailout reduces the debt-holders &quot; incentive to act , making the bailout more necessary . 
As during the Great Depression and in many debt restructurings , it makes sense in the current contingency to mandate partial debt forgiveness or a debt-for-equity swap in the financial sector . 
It is a well-tested strategy , and it leaves taxpayers out of the picture . 
Forcing a debt-for-equity swap or debt forgiveness would be no greater a violation of private property rights than a massive bailout . 
Indeed , for the financial industry , the appeal of Paulson &apos;s proposal is precisely that it taxes the many and benefits the few . 
Since the many ( taxpayers ) are dispersed , we cannot put up a good fight in the US Congress , whereas the financial industry is well represented politically . 
For six of the last 13 years , the Treasury Secretary was a Goldman Sachs alumnus . 
The decisions that Congress must make now will affect not only the US economy &apos;s short-term prospects , but will shape the type of capitalism that we will have for the next 50 years . 
Do we want to live in a system where profits are private , but losses are socialized , where taxpayer money is used to prop up failed firms ? 
Or do we want to live in a system where people are held accountable for their decisions , where imprudent behavior is penalized and prudent behavior rewarded ? 
For anyone who believes in free markets , the most serious risk of the current situation is that the interest of a few financiers will undermine the capitalist system &apos;s fundamental workings . 
The time has come to save capitalism from the capitalists .
