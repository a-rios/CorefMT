Redesigning Capitalism 
PARIS - When the heads of state of the world &apos;s 20 largest economies come together on short notice , as they just did in Washington , D.C. , it is clear how serious the current global crisis is . 
They did not decide much , except to call for improved monitoring and regulation of financial flows . 
More importantly , they committed themselves to launching a lasting process to reform the world &apos;s financial system . 
Of course , those who dreamed of a Bretton Woods II were disappointed . 
The recent G-20 summit occurred with virtually no real preliminary work . 
Three tasks must now be addressed . 
First , a floor must be put under the international financial system in order to stop its collapse . 
Second , new regulations are needed once the system revives , because if it remains the same way , it will only produce new crises . 
Finding the right mix will not be easy . 
For 25 years , the world has experienced a huge financial crisis every five years , each seemingly with its own cause . 
The third task is to focus on real economic activity , end the recession , sustain growth , and , above all , reform the capitalist system to make it be less dependent on finance . 
Long-term investments , not short-term profits , and productive work , rather than paper gains , need to be supported . 
The first task is already being tackled . 
After all , if the economy is to grow again , banks need borrowers , but the recession has led entrepreneurs to cut their investments . 
The second task remains open . 
Disagreements about how to re-regulate the financial markets are deep , owing to countless taboos and the huge interests at stake . 
Moreover , there can be no comprehensive agreement that does not take into account the relationship between finance and the real economy . 
The essential problem in addressing the third task is to find out precisely what is going on in the real economy . 
Some states ( Iceland and Hungary ) are clearly bankrupt . 
Some merely face a hazardous financial situation ( Denmark , Spain , and others ) . 
Their financial crisis is the main reason for their weakness . 
All of these problems are so difficult to resolve because they have been festering for so long . 
It is now increasingly evident that today &apos;s crisis has its roots in February 1971 , when US President Richard Nixon decided to break the link between the dollar and gold . 
Until that point , America &apos;s pledge to maintain the gold standard was the basis for the global fixed-exchange-rate system , which was the heart of the Bretton Woods framework . 
During the 27 years that it lasted , huge growth in international trade , supported by non-volatile pricing , was the norm , and large financial crises were absent . 
Since then , the international financial system has been highly volatile . 
The era of floating exchange rates that followed the end of the gold standard required the development of products that could protect international trade from price volatility . 
This opened the way to options , selling and buying on credit , and derivatives of all kinds . 
These innovations were considered technical successes . 
Prices were ( mostly ) stabilized , but with a slow , if continuous , rising trend . 
The market for these financial products grew over 30 years to the point that they delivered huge opportunities for immediate gain , which provided a strong incentive for market participants to play with them more and more . 
During this time , capitalism - smooth and successful between 1945-1975 ( sustained high growth , low unemployment , and no financial crises ) - weakened . 
Through pension funds , investment funds , and arbitrage ( or hedge ) funds , shareholders became well organized and seized power in developed countries &quot; firms . 
Under their pressure , more and more processes were &quot; outsourced . &quot; 
In real terms , wages no longer rose ( indeed , the average real wage has been stagnant for 25 years in the US ) , and a growing share of manpower ( currently around 15 % ) was without steady employment . 
Everywhere , the share of wages and incomes began to fall as a proportion of GDP . 
As a result , consumption weakened , unsteady employment grew , and unemployment stopped declining . 
Under such circumstances , the upper middle classes in developed countries increasingly came to look for capital gains instead of improving their living standards through productive work . 
This promoted inequality , and led to the under-regulated financial system &apos;s seizure of power over the entire economy , destabilizing the real economy by fatally weakening its capacity to react to external shocks . 
Today &apos;s crisis marks the end of economic growth fueled only by credit . 
But untying the knot that an overweening financial sector has drawn around the economy will take time . 
Indeed , there is still no consensus that this needs to be done . Yet the G-20 has opened the way to discussion of these fundamental issues . 
Today &apos;s recession will be a long one , but it will compel everybody to consider its root causes .
