The Human Stew 
LONDON - What defines a modern human ? 
The biological answer is simple : a member of the species Homo sapiens that is characterized by such features as a relatively large brain set in a globular braincase , small brow ridges over the eyes , a small retracted face , a chin on the lower jaw , and a lightly built skeleton . 
Many of modern humans &quot; biological traits - at least those that can be preserved as fossils - were already present in Africa and Israel more than 100,000 years ago . 
But other factors - such as complex societies , ceremonies , spiritual beliefs , art , music , technology , and language - also characterize modern human populations . 
Which traits are crucial to the definition of a &quot; modern human , &quot; and how far back can the classification be applied ? 
Given that humans &quot; morphological and behavioral characteristics evolved at different rates , this question is a source of controversy . 
Indeed , paleontologists studying the physical origins of Homo sapiens will inevitably differ from archaeologists reconstructing ancient behavior over what constitutes an early modern human . 
Recent discoveries in paleontology , archaeology , and especially genetics of striking similarities between extant humans and some ancient populations are further complicating assessments of modern humans &quot; origins . 
One leading idea was that modern humans &quot; primitive ancestor Homo erectus left Africa nearly two million years ago , and dispersed into other areas of the world . 
Regional populations then steadily evolved into Homo sapiens , with modern human behaviors first emerging in Europe roughly 40,000 years ago . 
But new evidence suggests that modern humans evolved relatively recently in Africa - and that the transformation that they underwent after their departure some 60,000 years ago was far from seamless . 
Specifically , studies of Homo sapiens &quot; close but extinct relatives , the Neanderthals , are revealing new facets of modern human development , while intensifying the long-running debate over the differences between the two species &quot; behavioral capabilities . 
Growing archaeological evidence of key elements associated with Homo sapiens is emerging at sites in Africa that are more than 60,000 years old . 
These include complex tools ( which require several stages of manufacture ) , symbolism ( for example , red hematite pigments for notation and beads for display , made from sea shells and ostrich eggshells ) , and long-distance networks of contact and exchange . 
These discoveries support some archaeologists &quot; view that only Homo sapiens was advanced enough to be considered truly modern humans , while non-modern groups like the Neanderthals displayed , at best , only incipient signs of such complexity . 
Moreover , genetic evidence , based on distinct DNA coding that is known to be related to brain functions in modern humans , suggests at least some cognitive contrasts between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens . 
And demographic differences ( small , low-density populations ) may have hindered Neanderthals &quot; cultural evolution , compared with the wider networks established by early modern human groups , initially in Africa , and subsequently worldwide . 
But evidence also suggests that some Neanderthals buried their dead with grave goods ( items presumably intended to help the deceased in the afterlife ) , produced complex tools ( such as stone armatures mounted with mastics ) , and developed personal symbols ( including manganese oxide pigments and pendants made from animal teeth ) . 
They apparently also used plants with medicinal properties . 
Furthermore , increasingly sophisticated DNA studies of extinct populations have shown that , despite their general classification as the distinct species Homo neanderthalensis , Neanderthals interbred with modern human groups as they dispersed out of Africa . 
As a result , many people &apos;s genomes contain roughly 1 % Neanderthal DNA . 
Given this hybridization , some researchers argue that the species boundary between modern humans and Neanderthals should be reconsidered , and that both should be classified as Homo sapiens . 
But I believe that a morphology-based species distinction is still warranted . 
In fact , the scientific dispute reflects the real-world limitations of the concept of distinct biological species , which does not allow for interbreeding . 
The situation is further complicated by additional instances of ancient interbreeding among native populations in Africa and Australasia ( for example , Australia , New Guinea , and Bougainville ) . 
In the latter case , the interbreeding derived from a population known so far from only one site - Denisova cave in southern Siberia . 
Fossils from there contain DNA related to , but distinct from , that of the Neanderthals . 
Today , remnants of this DNA - amounting to roughly 3 % of some people &apos;s genomes - are present in Australasia . 
This indicates that the &quot; Denisovans &quot; must have existed not just in Siberia , but also along the southeast Asian route that early modern humans used to reach Australasia , where the hypothesized hybridization occurred . 
Even Sub-Saharan Africans of today show traces of a distinct episode of interbreeding within the last 50,000 years . 
In this case , the source may have been as-yet-unknown remnants of the ancient species Homo heidelbergensis - a direct ancestor of both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis - surviving somewhere in southern Africa . 
But the real-world implications of the persistence of DNA from such interbreeding should not be misconstrued . 
The fact that paleoanthropologists commonly refer to the Neanderthals as &quot; archaic &quot; humans , owing to their primitive features , could lead to the semantic trap of regarding living humans with greater inputs of DNA from ancient interbreeding as somehow less &quot; evolved &quot; than the rest of humanity . 
In reality , given that most human DNA shares recent African origins , all living humans should be considered equally &quot; modern . &quot; 
But the recent discoveries cannot be ignored . 
The availability of commercial genetic tests that reveal roughly how much Neanderthal DNA an individual possesses provides an opportunity to appreciate the complex origins of modern humans . 
While continuing to highlight humankind &apos;s shared modernity and African origins , we must also begin to accept and understand the emerging patchwork nature of our biological history .
