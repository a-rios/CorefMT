An Epidemic of Politics 
Americans , like citizens in countries throughout the world , have come to accept that politics plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials . 
Few of us are surprised ( though some may be disappointed ) when a federal judgeship is awarded or a senior diplomat appointed because the candidate passes a litmus test of loyalty to some principle that is important to the President &apos;s or Prime Minister &apos;s party . 
But science , almost everyone agrees , is different , and here the United States is beginning to stand as a cautionary example to the rest of the world . 
Scientific appointments should rest on objective criteria of training , ability , and performance . 
Clearly , it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) about his views on abortion . 
But it is entirely out of place when appointees to scientific advisory committees are subjected to tests of political loyalty . 
Similarly , membership of bodies that conduct peer review of scientific proposals - a process that is fundamental to scientific progress - surely ought to be free of all barriers to entry that are unrelated to professional qualifications . 
Unfortunately , scientists in the US are running up against such barriers more and more often . 
During the past fall , the journal Science published several news stories related to the issue . 
One involved the wholesale replacement of members of the advisory committee to the National Center for Environmental Health , a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , without consulting the center &apos;s director . 
Similar cases involved the CDC &apos;s Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and Prevention , the Advisory Committee on National Human Research Protections , and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing . 
The current epidemic of ideology , in which advisory committees are shut down and reassembled with new members , and candidates are subjected to loyalty tests , seems old hat to some observers . 
Officials at the HHS call it &quot; fairly standard practice . &quot; 
Well , it isn &apos;t standard practice in America - or at least it wasn &apos;t . 
In any case , what &apos;s really worrisome is not that the Bush administration examines candidates for compatibility with its &quot; values . &quot; 
The most alarming development is how deep the ideological vetting now cuts , invading areas that once were immune to this kind of manipulation . 
Indeed , perhaps the most telling case in the widening political epidemic was a membership re-shuffle of the study section at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health that evaluates grants for studying workplace injuries . 
Advisory committees might have been vulnerable to occasional stacking of this kind in the past . 
After all , they recommend the policies that politicians may or may not want to consider . 
But study sections ? 
In October 2002, 
Their piece was a story in itself , but what followed was even more interesting . 
It set off a volley of letters in which scientists told of similar experiences . 
A nominee for the National Institutes of Health &apos;s Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee told of being vetted by a White House staff member . 
After being asked about her views on various Bush administration policies , none of them related to the work of the committee , she was asked whether she supports the president &apos;s policy on embryonic stem cells . 
Another letter writer , a distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology , reported receiving a call from the White House about his nomination to serve on the National Council on Drug Abuse . 
The caller declared that he must vet him to &quot; determine whether he held any views that might be embarrassing to the president . &quot; 
According to the professor , a series of questions followed , with the White House official keeping a running score . 
One example : &quot; You &apos;re two for three ; the president opposes needle exchange &#91; for intravenous drug users &#93; on moral grounds , regardless of the outcome . &quot; 
Then the exchange took an even more chilling turn . 
The official asked the nominee whether he had voted for Bush , and , on being informed that he had not , asked : &quot; Why didn &apos;t you support the president ? &quot; 
This is the stuff of dictatorship , not democracy . 
The purpose of scientific advisory committees is to provide balanced , thoughtful advice to the policy process . 
Nothing is gained - and much is lost - when a desired policy outcome is put first . 
This is why deciding which research projects to support has always been a matter for objective peer review , not politicians . 
In fact , the applicable statute for all this - the Federal Advisory Committee Act - specifically 
US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and the White House Personnel Office ought to set an example to the rest of the world . 
They can do so very easily : by following the law .
