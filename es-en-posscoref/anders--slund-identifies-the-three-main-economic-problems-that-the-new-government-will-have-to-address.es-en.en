Reviving Ukraine &apos;s Economy 
WASHINGTON , DC - Ukraine has suddenly arrived at a democratic breakthrough . 
After former President Viktor Yanukovych incited major bloodshed , many of his MPs defected to the opposition , creating a large majority . 
In order to consolidate its authority , whatever new government emerges will need to act fast and resolutely - and receive considerable international support - to overhaul the country &apos;s crisis-ridden economy . 
Ukraine suffers from three large economic problems . 
First , its foreign payments are unsustainable . 
Its current-account deficit last year was an estimated 8.3 % of GDP , and its foreign-currency reserves are quickly being depleted , covering just over two months of imports . 
Second , public finances are also unsustainable , with the budget deficit reaching almost 8 % of GDP and government-bond yields skyrocketing . 
Third , the economy has been in recession for five quarters since mid-2012 . 
These problems reflect Yanukovych &apos;s economic policy , which had one aim : enriching him , his family , and a few of his cronies . 
During the last four years , Ukraine has experienced unprecedented embezzlement by its rulers , with estimates putting the Yanukovych family &apos;s wealth at $ 12 billion . 
Here , too , the new government will need international assistance if it is to recover at least some of this loot . 
With Yanukovych out of the way , official extortion of Ukrainian business should end , enabling the economy to recover . 
In fact , Ukraine &apos;s GDP actually grew by 3.3 % in the last quarter of 2013 , because his cronyism was stifled by the protests . 
Yet much can and must be done very quickly , because Ukraine is running out of money . 
For starters , the new parliamentary majority needs to appoint a new government , so that a fresh economic-policy agenda can be launched . 
A new central bank governor also should be named , with the first order of business being to float the exchange rate . 
This would lead to a substantial devaluation of perhaps 10 % , thereby ending the current run on the hryvnia , eliminating the current-account deficit , and enabling a reduction in Ukraine &apos;s extremely high interest rates , which would stimulate investment . 
As soon as a government has been appointed , the International Monetary Fund should send a mission to Ukraine . 
Within two weeks , the IMF mission could conclude a new financial stabilization program with the new administration . 
The IMF works fast and could make a first large disbursement in late March . 
These two sources alone could cover much of the $ 35 billion in external financing that Yuriy Kolobov , Ukraine &apos;s acting finance minister , has said the country could need over the next two years . 
Moreover , IMF loans carry a lower interest rate and a longer maturity than the Russian loans on which the Yanukovych government relied ( and which are unlikely to continue ) . 
The conditions that the IMF places on its loans can help Ukraine undo Yanukovych &apos;s venal policies . 
First and foremost , Ukraine will have to reduce its budget deficit sharply , which , given large tax revenues , should be accomplished through expenditure cuts and freezes . 
Large industrial subsidies - for example , to the coal industry - amount to nothing but giveaways to Yanukovych &apos;s supporters and should be eliminated immediately . 
Likewise , gas prices should be liberalized to stop corrupt enrichment from regulatory arbitrage . 
Needy consumers , not wealthy producers , should receive assistance . 
Similarly , the IMF will insist on the reintroduction of competitive tenders . 
Naturally , sales of state enterprises to loyalists - typically at rock-bottom prices - must end as well . 
Another source of corruption has been refunds of value-added tax for exporters , for which top tax officials charge a commission . 
In addition , Ukraine should reintroduce the simplified tax code for small businesses that Yanukovych abolished . 
Two million small enterprises were wiped out by that change ; many of them could be revived if tax procedures were no longer prohibitive . 
Ukraine also needs to work with the EU . 
Within a week , the new government can fulfill the EU &apos;s conditions for signing the long-concluded Association Agreement , and doing so should be on the agenda at the EU-Ukraine summit in March . 
Parliament has already scheduled new elections , and former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko has been released from prison . 
The only remaining EU condition - legislation reforming the prosecutor &apos;s office - can be adopted quickly . 
It amounts to a comprehensive reform program for the Ukrainian state apparatus , including its law-enforcement bodies . 
Sixty state agencies in various EU countries have already concluded agreements with their Ukrainian counterparts concerning the necessary reforms . 
The agreement also contains a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area , which will open the vast European market to Ukrainian exporters - and thus attract more foreign direct investment to Ukraine . 
Here , diplomacy will play an important role as well . 
The United States and the EU need to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach an understanding with Ukraine &apos;s new leaders , rather than follow through on his threat to impose sanctions . 
Peaceful co-existence , not mounting bilateral tension , is in both countries &quot; best interest .
