Europe &apos;s Competitiveness Trap 
LONDON - A flawed understanding of what drives economic growth has emerged as the gravest threat to recovery in Europe . 
European policymakers are obsessed with national &quot; competitiveness , &quot; and genuinely appear to think that prosperity is synonymous with trade surpluses . 
This largely explains why Germany is routinely cited as an example of a strong , &quot; competitive &quot; economy . 
But economic growth , even in traditionally export-led economies , is driven by productivity growth , not by the ability to capture a growing share of global markets . 
While imports must , of course , be financed by exports , the focus on trade competitiveness is drawing attention away from Europe &apos;s underlying problem - very weak productivity growth . 
And this is as serious a problem in the economies running trade surpluses as it is in those running deficits . 
The idea that economic growth is determined by a battle for global market share in manufactured goods is easy for politicians to grasp and to communicate to their electorates . 
Economies running external surpluses are regarded as &quot; competitive , &quot; regardless of their productivity or growth performance . 
The trade balance is seen as a country &apos;s &quot; bottom line , &quot; as if countries were firms . 
In fact , they have little in common - the trade balance is simply the difference between domestic savings and investment or more broadly , between aggregate spending and output - but referring to Deutschland AG , or UK plc , is conceptually attractive and seductively easy . 
Governments obsessed with national competitiveness are likely to pursue damaging economic policies . 
If economic growth is seen as being dependent on the cost competitiveness of exports , governments will focus on things that might make sense for exporters , but not for their economies as a whole , such as labor-market policies aimed at artificially holding down wage growth , which redistributes income from labor to capital and exacerbates inequality . 
Indeed , the secular decline in the proportion of national income accounted for by wages and salaries over the last 10 years in nearly every EU economy is a major obstacle to a recovery in private consumption . 
And the flipside of the decline in wage and salaries - a steep rise in the proportion of national income accounted for by corporate profits - has not resulted in booming investment . 
This should come as no surprise . 
An individual firm can cut wages without undermining demand for whatever good or service it produces . 
But if all firms cut wages simultaneously , the resulting weakness of overall demand undermines companies &quot; incentives to invest , in turn depressing productivity growth . 
In short , cutting the proportion of national income accounted for by wages , accepting a secular rise in inequality , and boosting the proportion of national income accounted for by corporate profits is no way to deliver sustainable economic growth . 
But that is precisely what happens when governments believe that economic salvation lies in winning a growing share of export markets . 
It doesn &apos;t . 
There is a very strong correlation between rising labor productivity and economic growth , which holds for countries with trade surpluses as well as those with deficits . 
So the European Union &apos;s rate of productivity growth , not the size of its trade surplus , will largely determine its economic prospects . 
Unfortunately , productivity growth is declining across Europe , from around 3.5 % annually in the 1970 &quot; s to barely 1 % in the 2000 &quot; s . 
And productivity growth has been almost as weak in the eurozone &apos;s core as in its troubled periphery . 
Governments throughout the EU should focus on raising productivity - not just in the most internationally exposed sectors , like manufacturing , but also in less tradable sectors , such as services , which now account for around two-thirds of economic activity . 
Without stronger productivity gains there , economic growth will prove elusive . 
But improvement presupposes diagnosing why Europe &apos;s productivity performance , with a few notable exceptions , has been so bad . 
There are two core problems . 
The first is inadequate skills levels , aggravated by complacency . 
Some countries - Scandinavia and the Netherlands , for example - do well . 
But the picture elsewhere is patchy at best . 
Germany has good vocational training , Britain more than its fair share of top universities , and France good technical education . 
Other countries , especially in the south , perform poorly in most areas . 
The second problem is inadequate competition . 
In too many sectors , incumbents are protected . 
This is justified in terms of upholding &quot; social justice &quot; or defending &quot; national champions . &quot; 
Where this tendency is strongest , productivity levels are weakest . 
While Europe &apos;s economic growth prospects may be poor , this has little to do with what is happening elsewhere . 
Europe &apos;s leaders will find that improving education and training - and throwing open hitherto protected markets - is a long and arduous task . 
But , unlike the obsession with &quot; competitiveness , &quot; such reforms would lead Europe onto the path of sustainable growth .
