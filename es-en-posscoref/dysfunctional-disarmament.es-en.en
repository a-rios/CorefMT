Dysfunctional Disarmament 
GENEVA - As the United Nations Conference on Disarmament begins a seven-week session in Geneva , its future is on the line . 
Whereas countries and civil-society initiatives are on the move , the Conference has stagnated . 
Its credibility - indeed , its very legitimacy - is at risk . 
The &quot; CD , &quot; as it is informally known , has long served as the world &apos;s only multilateral forum for negotiating disarmament . 
Its many impressive accomplishments include the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions , the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty . 
Much of this progress was achieved during the Cold War , proving that it is possible to create global legal norms even in times of deep political division . 
Yet today , all is not well at the CD . 
It operates under a consensus rule , and its member states have different priorities . 
Some want negotiations on nuclear disarmament ; others want to ban the production of fissile material for weapon purposes ; and still others insist that such a treaty should also cover existing stocks . 
Some want a treaty on security guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon states to assure them against the threat or use of nuclear weapons ; others want a treaty to prevent an arms race in outer space . 
But , instead of compromise and the give-and-take of good-faith discussions , there has been paralysis . 
There was a brief glimmer of hope in 2009 , when the sense of paralysis led the Conference to consensus on a program of work . 
Unfortunately , that agenda was never implemented . 
As a result , the CD has failed to make any substantive progress for 15 years . 
We simply must not let one lost decade turn into a second . 
The CD &apos;s future is in the hands of its member states . 
But the disarmament and non-proliferation agenda is too important to let the CD lapse into irrelevancy as states consider other negotiating arenas . 
Last September , I convened a high-level meeting at the UN to consider ways to revitalize the CD &apos;s work and to advance multilateral disarmament negotiations . 
The participants - who included dozens of foreign ministers - were unanimous in stressing that membership of the CD is a privilege . 
So is the consensus rule . 
Just one or two countries should not be able to block the organization &apos;s work indefinitely . 
The message was clear : no more business as usual . 
The CD &apos;s member states must recognize that the Conference &apos;s future is at a critical juncture . 
Continued stalemate increases the risk that some like-minded countries might take up the matter elsewhere . 
After all , the deadlock has ominous implications for international security ; the longer it persists , the graver the nuclear threat - from existing arsenals , from the proliferation of such weapons , and from their possible acquisition by terrorists . 
I have urged the CD to adopt an agenda based either on the consensus that was forged in 2009 , or on an alternative arrangement . 
Upon my request , the UN &apos;s entire membership will take up the matter in a first-of-its-kind General Assembly meeting this July . 
That schedule makes the CD &apos;s current session crucial to its future . 
Reaffirming the CD &apos;s agenda offers the prospect of renewed negotiations on disarmament issues . 
Prior agreement on the scope or outcome should not be a precondition for talks - or an excuse to avoid them - but rather a subject of the negotiations themselves . 
The current stalemate is all the more troubling in view of recent momentum on other disarmament tracks , including last year &apos;s successful NPT Review Conference and heightened attention to nuclear security . 
With the world focused so intently on advancing disarmament goals , the CD should seize the moment . 
Shakespeare once wrote that &quot; there is a tide in the affairs of men . &quot; 
The tide of disarmament is rising , yet the CD is in danger of sinking . 
And it will sink unless it fulfills its responsibility to act .
