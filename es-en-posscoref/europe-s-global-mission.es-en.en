Europe &apos;s Global Mission 
Europe is in search of its identity . 
I believe it is easy to find : the European Union embodies the principle of open society , which could serve as a force for a global open society . 
Let me explain what I mean . 
The concept of an open society was first used by the French philosopher Henri Bergson in his book The Two Sources of Morality and Religion . 
One source , according to Bergson , is tribal and leads to a closed society whose members feel affinity for each other but fear or hostility towards others . 
The other source is universal , leading to an open society guided by universal human rights that protects and promotes the freedom of the individual . 
Karl Popper modified this scheme in his seminal book The Open Society and Its Enemies , published in 1944 . 
Popper pointed out that an open society can be endangered by abstract , universal ideologies like communism and fascism . 
Because these ideologies &quot; claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth is bound to be false , they can be imposed on society only through repression and compulsion . 
By contrast , an open society accepts uncertainty , and it establishes laws and institutions that allow people with divergent views and interests to live together in peace . 
The EU embodies the principles of an open society to a remarkable extent . 
Although its guiding principles have not been enshrined in a constitution , even this may be appropriate to an open society because , as Popper argued , our imperfect understanding does not permit permanent and eternally valid definitions of social arrangements . 
The EU was brought into existence by a process of piecemeal social engineering - the method Popper considered appropriate to an open society - directed by a far-sighted , purposeful elite who recognized that perfection is unattainable . 
It proceeded step by step , setting limited objectives with limited timetables , knowing full well that each step would prove inadequate and require a further step . 
That step-by-step approach ground to a halt with the defeat of the European Constitution . 
The EU is left in an untenable position , with an enlarged membership of 27 states and a governing structure designed for six . 
The political will to keep the process moving forward has eroded . 
The memory of past wars has faded , and the threat posed by the Soviet Union has disappeared . 
Nationalist , xenophobic , and anti-Muslim sentiments are on the rise , aggravated by the failure to integrate immigrant communities . 
Unfortunately the disarray within the EU is part of a broader global turmoil . 
The United States used to be the dominant power and set the agenda for the world . 
But President George W. Bush &apos;s war on terror undermined the basic principles of American democracy by expanding executive powers . 
It undermined the critical process that is at the heart of an open society by treating any criticism of the administration &apos;s policies as unpatriotic , thereby allowing Bush to order the invasion of Iraq . 
Worse still , the war on terror was counterproductive . 
It increased the terrorist threat by creating innocent victims , while leading to a precipitous decline in American power and influence . 
As a result , the US is no longer in a position to set the world &apos;s agenda . 
The EU cannot possibly take the place of the US as the world &apos;s leader . 
But it can set an example , both within its own borders and beyond . 
The prospect of membership has been the most powerful tool in turning candidate countries into open societies . 
Although most of its citizens do not realize it , the EU serves as an inspiring example . 
All that is needed now is for Europe &apos;s people to be inspired by the idea of the EU as the prototype of a global open society . 
What this means in principle can be stated concisely : the EU needs a common foreign policy . 
That is the one part of the European constitution that urgently needs to be rescued . 
In the meantime , the absence of institutional reform should not be allowed to serve as a pretext for inaction . 
The EU already possesses ample resources to make an impact on the world stage : 
half of the world &apos;s overseas development assistance ; the biggest single market in the world ; 45,000 diplomats ; almost 100,000 peace-keepers serving on every continent ; and the prospect of using trade , aid , and membership as catalysts to encourage neighboring states to become open societies . 
Where Europe has adopted a common policy - such as on Iran - it has succeeded in persuading others , including the US , to change long-held positions . 
But all too often the EU fails to live up to its potential . 
For example , Europe has made little progress in formulating a common energy policy , leaving it increasingly dependent on Russia , which has not hesitated to exploit its bargaining position . 
Likewise , the EU has failed to give adequate support to Georgia , or to impose appropriate sanctions on Uzbekistan for last year &apos;s massacre at Andijon . 
Nor has the European Neighborhood Policy gathered any momentum , while the EU &apos;s treatment of Turkey is pushing an important ally in the wrong direction . 
There is also trouble brewing in some of the newly admitted member countries , such as Hungary and Poland , where the EU could play a more proactive role in promoting democratic stability . 
Needless to say , a common EU foreign policy should not be anti-American . 
Such a posture would be self-defeating , because it would reinforce the division of the international community that the Bush administration has initiated . 
But the EU can set an example of international cooperation that the US , under a different leadership - which is bound to come - would eventually emulate .
