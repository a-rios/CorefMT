Green Shoots or Yellow Weeds ? 
New York - Recent data suggest that the rate of contraction in the world economy may be slowing . 
But hopes that &quot; green shoots &quot; of recovery may be springing up have been dashed by plenty of yellow weeds . 
Europe &apos;s first quarter GDP growth data is dismal ; 
Thus , the consensus view that the global economy will soon bottom out has proven - once again - to be overly optimistic . 
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , the global financial system nearly melted down and the world economy went into free fall . 
Indeed , the rate of economic contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 reached near-depression levels . 
At that point , global policymakers got religion and started to use most of the weapons in their arsenal : vast fiscal-policy easing ; conventional and unconventional monetary expansion ; trillions of dollars in liquidity support , recapitalization , guarantees , and insurance to stem the liquidity and credit crunch ; and , finally , massive support to emerging-market economies . 
In the last two months alone , one can count more than 150 different policy interventions around the world . 
This policy equivalent of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell &apos;s doctrine of &quot; overwhelming force , &quot; together with the sharp contraction of output below final demand for goods and services ( which drew down inventories of unsold goods ) , sets the stage for most economies to bottom out early next year . 
Even so , the optimists who spoke last year of a soft landing or a mild &quot; V-shaped &quot; eight-month recession were proven wrong , while those who argued that this would be a longer and more severe &quot; U-shaped &quot; 24-month recession - the US downturn is already in its 18th month - were correct . 
And the recent optimism that economies will bottom out by mid-year have been dashed by the most recent economic data . 
The crucial issue , however , is not when the global economy will bottom out , but whether the global recovery - whenever it comes - will be robust or weak over the medium term . 
One cannot rule out a couple of quarters of sharp GDP growth as the inventory cycle and the massive policy boost lead to a short-term revival . 
But those tentative green shoots that we hear so much about these days may well be overrun by yellow weeds even in the medium term , heralding a weak global recovery over the next two years . 
First , employment is still falling sharply in the US and other economies . 
Indeed , in advanced economies , the unemployment rate will be above 10 % by 2010 . 
This will be bad news for consumption and the size of bank losses . 
Second , this is a crisis of solvency , not just liquidity , but true deleveraging has not really started , because private losses and debts of households , financial institutions , and even corporations are not being reduced , but rather socialized and put on government balance sheets . 
Lack of deleveraging will limit the ability of banks to lend , households to spend , and firms to invest . 
Third , in countries running current-account deficits , consumers need to cut spending and save much more for many years . 
Shopped out , savings-less , and debt-burdened consumers have been hit by a wealth shock ( falling home prices and stock markets ) , rising debt-service ratios , and falling incomes and employment . 
Fourth , the financial system - despite the policy backstop - is severely damaged . 
Most of the shadow banking system has disappeared , and traditional commercial banks are saddled with trillions of dollars in expected losses on loans and securities while still being seriously undercapitalized . 
So the credit crunch will not ease quickly . 
Fifth , weak profitability , owing to high debts and default risk , low economic - and thus revenue - growth , and persistent deflationary pressure on companies &quot; margins , will continue to constrain firms &quot; willingness to produce , hire workers , and invest . 
Sixth , rising government debt ratios will eventually lead to increases in real interest rates that may crowd out private spending and even lead to sovereign refinancing risk . 
Seventh , monetization of fiscal deficits is not inflationary in the short run , whereas slack product and labor markets imply massive deflationary forces . 
But if central banks don &apos;t find a clear exit strategy from policies that double or triple the monetary base , eventually either goods-price inflation or another dangerous asset and credit bubble ( or both ) will ensue . 
Some recent rises in the prices of equities , commodities , and other risky assets is clearly liquidity-driven . 
Eighth , some emerging-market economies with weaker economic fundamentals may not be able to avoid a severe financial crisis , despite massive IMF support . 
Finally , the reduction of global imbalances implies that the current-account deficits of profligate economies ( the US and other Anglo-Saxon countries ) will narrow the current-account surpluses of over-saving countries ( China and other emerging markets , Germany , and Japan ) . 
But if domestic demand does not grow fast enough in surplus countries , the resulting lack of global demand relative to supply - or , equivalently , the excess of global savings relative to investment spending - will lead to a weaker recovery in global growth , with most economies growing far more slowly than their potential . 
So , green shoots of stabilization may be replaced by yellow weeds of stagnation if several medium-term factors constrain the global economy &apos;s ability to return to sustained growth . 
Unless these structural weaknesses are resolved , the global economy may grow in 2010-2011 , but at an anemic rate .
