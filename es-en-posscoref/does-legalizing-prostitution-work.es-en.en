Does Legalizing Prostitution Work ? 
AMSTERDAM - Prostitution is virtually the only part of the personal services industry in the Netherlands that works . 
One can &apos;t get a manicure in Amsterdam without booking an appointment two weeks in advance , but men can buy sex anytime - and at an attractive price . 
The legalization of prostitution in October 2000 merely codified a long-standing Dutch tradition of tolerance towards buying and selling sex . 
But is legalization the right approach ? 
Even in the Netherlands , women and girls who sell their bodies are routinely threatened , beaten , raped , and terrorized by pimps and customers . 
In a recent criminal trial , two German-Turkish brothers stood accused of forcing more than 100 women to work in Amsterdam &apos;s red-light district ( De Wallen ) . 
According to the attorney who represented one of the victims , most of these women come from families marred by incest , alcohol abuse , and parental suicide . 
Or they come from countries in Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia and have fallen victim to human trafficking , lured by decent job offers or simply sold by their parents . 
These women are Amsterdam &apos;s leading tourist attraction ( followed by the coffee shops that sell marijuana ) . 
It is incomprehensible that their clients are not prosecuted for rape , but Dutch politicians argue that it cannot be established whether or not a prostitute works voluntarily . 
Appalled by their daily routine , police officers from the Amsterdam vice squad have asked to be transferred to other departments . 
Only this year , the city administration has started to close down some brothels because of their ties to criminal organizations . 
According to a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology , the average age of death of prostitutes is 34 . 
In the United States , the rate at which prostitutes are killed in the workplace is 51 times that of the next most dangerous occupation for women , working in a liquor store . 
Other studies show that nine out of ten prostitutes urgently want to escape the job . 
Almost half have attempted suicide at least once . 
In 1999 , the Swedish government decriminalized the sale of sex , but made it an offense to pimp or to buy sex . 
Under Sweden &apos;s so-called &quot; Sex Purchase Law , &quot; paying for sex is punishable by fines or up to six months in prison , plus the humiliation of public exposure . 
According to the Swedish authorities , the number of prostitutes in Sweden has dropped 40 % as a result . 
Human trafficking rings tend to avoid Sweden , because business has gone sour . 
Norway , a country that has a reputation to lose when it comes to women &apos;s rights , carefully compared the Swedish and Dutch models and concluded that Sweden &apos;s was the one to follow . 
It has now changed its legislation accordingly . 
The success of the Swedish approach is not so surprising . 
For example , 79 % said that they would be deterred if there was a chance that their families would be notified . 
And a whopping 87 % said that they would be deterred by the threat that the police might publish their photographs or names in the local newspaper . 
Most of these men showed pathological behavior towards women . 
One in five admitted to having raped a woman , while four out of five said that going to prostitutes was an addiction . 
Prostitution is often dubbed &quot; the oldest profession . &quot; 
It takes leadership and a vision of true gender equality to put an end to prostitution . 
The Swedish practice of naming and shaming is quite un-Dutch . 
But , for some men , part of the pleasure of buying sex may be the humiliation conferred on the woman involved . 
For others , like former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer , the promise of discretion and anonymity may be the most appealing aspect of buying sex . 
In any case , pillorying the clients is both a just punishment and an effective deterrent .
