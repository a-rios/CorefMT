The Shale Revolution &apos;s Global Footprint 
MADRID - Thousands of negotiators are currently gathered at the United Nations climate-change talks in Warsaw , creating a blueprint for a comprehensive global agreement to be delivered by 2015 . 
But , as the negotiators work , the world &apos;s energy landscape is in enormous flux . 
Given that most of the world &apos;s CO2 emissions stem from energy production and transport , it is critical to monitor these changes closely . 
In particular , the shockwaves triggered by the shale-energy revolution unleashed in the United States are reverberating globally . 
With the advent of hydraulic fracturing , or &quot; fracking , &quot; US oil production has risen by 30 % , and gas production by 25 % , in just five years . 
Shale gas contributed almost nothing to US natural-gas supplies at the start of the century ; by last year , its share had soared to 34 % , with the US Energy Information Administration predicting a further rise to one-half by 2040 . 
As a result of this bonanza , US domestic energy prices have plummeted . 
The US , with all its geographical blessings , is on the road to energy self-sufficiency and is reaping clear economic benefits . 
Development of unconventional oil and gas supported 2.1 million jobs and contributed $ 74 billion in tax revenues and royalty payments to government coffers in 2012 . 
Industrial competitiveness has soared , owing to much higher gas prices in Europe and Asia . 
Refiners and petrochemical companies are flocking to the US . 
But this does not mean that the US can withdraw into splendid energy isolation . 
After all , energy is a global commodity . 
Although oil accounts for a smaller part of the energy mix nowadays and spare capacity is currently well ensured , chiefly by Saudi Arabia , a price shock would still have global effects - as such shocks have had in the past . 
Gas prices , by contrast , vary widely across regions : from under $ 4 / MMBtu in the US to around $ 10 in Europe and $ 15 in Asia . 
Until the gas market becomes more liquid and more global , this spread will remain . 
Nonetheless , global economic interdependence means that every country has a stake in others &quot; energy bills . 
If one region &apos;s economy falters , all countries feel the effects . 
In Europe , shale-energy resources have largely remained in the ground . 
Even so , the shale revolution across the Atlantic has been felt in diverse ways . 
For example , decreased US demand for liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) has allowed gas prices to come down in Europe . 
European utilities &quot; bargaining power vis-Ã -vis Russian gas giant Gazprom has risen considerably - despite long-term oil-indexed supply contracts . 
Yet European competitiveness is in danger . 
This is unlikely to change in the near future , as liquefaction and transport costs will keep LNG prices high even if the US issues more export permits . 
Finally , Europe &apos;s energy mix is gradually shifting from the one that it needs to reach its climate-change goals . 
As inexpensive natural gas has eroded coal &apos;s traditional share of electricity generation in the US , importing cheap coal from the US has become more attractive to Europe . 
Especially in Germany , the Energiewende ( the shift away from nuclear energy following the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 ) has led to an increase in coal consumption . 
Indeed , coal is on track to provide more than half of Germany &apos;s electricity supply . 
The EU &apos;s position as a climate-change champion is in danger . 
Coal is king in China too , providing two-thirds of its power supply . 
But China &apos;s rulers know that this situation is unsustainable . 
Not only is air pollution a growing source of concern , but diversification of energy sources is a crucial national-security interest . 
The scale of China &apos;s unconventional energy endowments is still relatively uncertain . 
But population density and water scarcity will certainly be inhibiting factors in their exploitation . 
China maintains robust relationships with energy producers in the Middle East , Russia , and elsewhere ( including booming Myanmar ) - to secure and diversify its conventional sources . 
Just last month , Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s first visit to China as Russia &apos;s prime minister resulted in a ten-year , $ 85 billion oil-supply deal for the state-owned energy giant Rosneft . 
Natural gas , however , is the weak link . 
Asia &apos;s pipeline network is far too thin , and gas prices are among the highest in the world . 
That implies a potential boon to Russia &apos;s main gas producers , especially as Europe &apos;s energy-diversification campaign weakens export demand . 
Indeed , given that oil and gas revenues account for half of Russia &apos;s federal budget , adapting to new realities is virtually an existential imperative for the Russian state . 
There is opportunity in Siberia &apos;s frozen taiga , particularly the Bazhenov field , which may hold some of the largest unconventional reserves in the world . 
But the investment needed to develop these resources may remain in short supply in the absence of tax reforms . 
The shale-energy revolution that started in the US is thus causing sweeping changes worldwide . 
And incorporating shale gas into the world &apos;s energy mix could help to combat climate change by creating a bridge to a low-carbon future . 
So long as methane leakage is contained , CO2 emissions from natural-gas combustion can be significantly lower than those caused by reliance on oil . 
Cheap energy sources , however , can eventually come at a high price , albeit with a politically tricky time lag . 
Simply put , the current cost of pollution is too low , while the level of urgency is high . 
In Warsaw and beyond , it is vitally important that the international community reaches a sufficiently high common denominator in limiting greenhouse-gas emissions . 
If not , we will not be able to limit the global temperature increase to a sustainable level .
