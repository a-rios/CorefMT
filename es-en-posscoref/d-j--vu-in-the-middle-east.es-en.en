Déjà-vu in the Middle East 
BERLIN  -  
Does history repeat itself , after all ? 
Recent developments in the Middle East suggest that the answer is &quot; yes , &quot; because the situation at the end of President George W. Bush &apos;s tenure increasingly resembles that of Bill Clinton &apos;s final year in the presidency . 
Both presidents , at the end of their respective terms , sought to resolve one of the world &apos;s most dangerous conflicts , while facing the threat that time was running out on them . 
One could despair : the Bush administration has obviously wasted almost seven years during which it could have pursued a solution . 
We are now back to the starting point : the Camp David and Taba talks - flippantly abandoned in January 2001 - are to be taken up again . 
Still , as the wise saying goes , better late than never ! 
The Middle East conference to be held in Annapolis , Maryland should be a forum for final status negotiations between the parties , dealing above all with the establishment of a Palestinian state and its borders ( those of June 1967 , with some negotiated exchanges of territory ) , its capital ( Jerusalem ) , Israeli settlements , and the right of return for Palestinian refugees . 
It should also address questions of security , the termination of the decades-long state of war , and recognition of Israel by the Arab states . 
Indeed , it is high time for progress on a two-state solution , because the Palestinians are increasingly losing hope of ever having a state of their own . 
Without it , the Middle East conflict will remain at a stalemate and violence will only intensify . 
Acceptable compromises on all of these questions have been negotiated repeatedly by the parties and stowed away for many years . 
The only missing ingredient is the political will and strength to enter into a peace agreement . 
But this very political strength is precisely what both the Israeli and Palestinian governments lack . 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are very weak domestically , and , given the compromises needed on both sides , they will be risking a lot . 
The same is true of President Bush . 
Indeed , the US government does not even stand whole-heartedly behind its own initiative . Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wants the conference to happen and has done much to push it ahead . 
But how much risk is Bush - without whom a real breakthrough will be impossible - prepared to accept ? 
Fortunately , existing taboos about what is acceptable in the final status talks have fallen - on both sides . 
The parallel weakness of Olmert and Abbas has produced a parallel interest in a peace settlement . 
Indeed , both men hope for political survival through a peace agreement : Olmert by means of new elections and Abbas by a referendum through which he can regain ascendancy over Hamas . 
So will a failed &quot; Peace of the Strong &quot; be followed by a successful &quot; Peace of the Weak &quot; ? 
As the domestic situations in Israel and Palestine have changed , so , too , has the regional political environment changed in a positive direction , because most Arab states today are more afraid of Iran &apos;s regional domination than they are of Israel . 
This development offers an unprecedented opportunity . 
There are obvious pitfalls , to be sure . 
Olmert &apos;s room for maneuver within his party , and particularly within his coalition , is very small . 
Can he make sufficient concessions on borders and Jerusalem ? 
Similar doubts apply to Abbas . 
Can he deliver the security guarantees that Olmert needs , especially given the Palestinians &quot; fear that , in the end , they will give too much , without getting back concessions on what they see as their fundamental demands ? 
Moreover , the critical hurdle will not be the negotiations , but rather implementation of whatever agreement may emerge - and its political cost will be very high . 
The Palestinians are already in the midst of a civil war . 
The compromises necessary for peace are likely to lead to a stark political confrontation in Israel as well . 
Obviously , Olmert is thinking of fusing an agreement on the final status with the Road Map mechanism . 
Such an agreement should be implemented gradually , and progress should depend on the parties &quot; fulfillment of their obligations each step of the way . 
Yet a mechanism of this kind can only work if a third party ( the US , the &quot; US plus , &quot; or the Middle East Quartet ) is available to monitor the agreement . 
Otherwise , disputes about fulfillment of this or that provision will lead the entire process back into the familiar quicksand of Middle East futility . 
So , from a realistic point of view , a positive outcome for the Annapolis talks seems almost impossible . 
Why should this conflict , which has proven to be unsolvable in the past , be suddenly solved ( or brought closer to a solution ) by three actors - Bush , Olmert , and Abbas - who are all in a state of profound domestic weakness ? 
Karl Marx wrote that history always repeats itself , first as tragedy , then as farce . 
One might fear that Camp David proves to be the tragedy and Annapolis the farce . 
So one should never give up hope , even when hope seems impossible to sustain .
