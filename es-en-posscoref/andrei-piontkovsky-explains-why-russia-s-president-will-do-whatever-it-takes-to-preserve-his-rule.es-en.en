Putin &apos;s Brave New World 
MOSCOW - Three months after protesters toppled Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych and his government , unleashing a wave of unrest and chaos , the country has elected a new president . 
But Russian President Vladimir Putin , who deployed troops to annex Crimea at his earliest opportunity , remains the key figure shaping Ukraine &apos;s future - and he is continuing to propel Ukraine toward something far more dangerous than a new Cold War . 
By placing himself firmly in the driver &apos;s seat of Russia &apos;s future , Putin has simplified the task of those who seek to understand the country . 
In fact , his actions are guided by a single goal , and it is not the imperial ambition that is usually thought to determine Putin &apos;s actions . 
Instead , every policy is subordinate to Putin &apos;s goal of ruling Russia for as long as he lives . 
Putin &apos;s ambition is not the result of a pathological lust for power . 
He understands the laws of the autocratic system that he has helped to rebuild in Russia - a system in which leaders may , like Libya &apos;s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi or Iraq &apos;s Saddam Hussein , ultimately find themselves being hauled out of sewers or rat holes to face execution if their power fails them . 
Viewed from this perspective , Putin &apos;s strategy in Ukraine has been consistent and logical at every stage . 
In the protests in Kyiv &apos;s Maidan ( Independence ) Square , he saw the prospect of Ukraine transcending the corrupt post-communist authoritarianism that his own regime embodies . 
In order to prevent such an outcome , Ukraine &apos;s revolution against Yanukovych , the monumentally corrupt Kremlin puppet , had to be strangled in its cradle and discredited in the eyes of the Russian people . 
These goals were evident in the speech that Putin delivered to Russia &apos;s political elites in March , following the annexation of Crimea . 
But Putin &apos;s actions in Ukraine have done more than humble Russia &apos;s democrats . 
By focusing on the ethnic Russian majority in Crimea and declaring his right to &quot; protect &quot; ethnic Russians abroad , his legitimating myth now includes the role of national savior , which could enable him to retain power indefinitely . 
Of course , Putin &apos;s rise to power was buttressed by another myth - that of a vigorous young KGB officer capable of stopping the Russian Federation &apos;s disintegration by &quot; drowning &quot; the Chechens in &quot; an outhouse , &quot; stabilizing the economy , and using the country &apos;s vast natural-resource wealth to enhance prosperity . 
But that myth has now worn thin . 
Putin has seen firsthand what happens when a ruling myth collapses . 
The Soviet Union was sustained by the population &apos;s belief in communism as the route to a just society . 
When the myth disintegrated , so did the union . 
From the outset of his rule in 2000 , Putin has been determined not to make the same mistake . 
With the help of Russia &apos;s media , he hopes to recast himself as the Russian messiah , compelling ethnic kin everywhere to support his leadership in perpetuity . 
The annexation of Crimea was met with widespread support in Russia . 
But Putin &apos;s strategy carries serious risks - not least because it bears a disturbing resemblance to Hitler &apos;s call to unite all ethnic Germans . 
By valuing ethnicity over citizenship , he is challenging the very basis of the international system and fueling rapid deterioration in Russia &apos;s relationship with the West . 
During the Cold War , both sides &quot; acceptance of &quot; mutual assured destruction &quot; ensured that nuclear weapons served as a deterrent and thus supported strategic stability . 
For Putin , by contrast , the threat to use such weapons is a perfectly logical tactic . 
Given his relatively weak conventional army , he can assert international authority only by claiming a free hand in the entire post-Soviet space and menacing the West with a limited nuclear war ( which he is certain he can win ) if it interferes with his imperial ambitions . 
This has proved to be a winning strategy . 
The immediate response of the United States and the European Union to Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea was to declare that military intervention was &quot; absolutely excluded , &quot; given that Ukraine is not a member of NATO . 
International relations today are at their most volatile since Joseph Stalin &apos;s final months in power , when he created a three-part strategy to restore his authority : preparation for a third world war , liquidation of the Communist Party hierarchy , and exterminationist anti-Semitism . 
It was only his death in 1953 that saved Russia - indeed , the world - from this outcome . 
Who will save the world from Putin ?
