Democracy in Tea Party America 
BERKELEY - When the French politician and moral philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville published the first volume of his Democracy in America in 1835 , he did so because he thought that France was in big trouble and could learn much from America . 
So one can only wonder what he would have made of the Republican National Convention in Tampa , Florida . 
For Tocqueville , the grab for centralized power by the absolutist Bourbon monarchs , followed by the French Revolution and Napoleon &apos;s Empire , had destroyed the good with the bad in France &apos;s neo-feudal order . 
Decades later , the new order was still in flux . 
In Tocqueville &apos;s imagination , at least , the old order &apos;s subjects had been eager to protect their particular liberties and jealous of their spheres of independence . 
They understood that they were embedded in a web of obligations , powers , responsibilities , and privileges that was as large as France itself . 
Among the French of 1835 , however , &quot; the doctrine of self-interest &quot; had produced &quot; egotism ... no less blind . &quot; 
Having &quot; destroyed an aristocracy , &quot; the French were &quot; inclined to survey its ruins with complacency . &quot; 
To the &quot; sick &quot; France of 1835 , Tocqueville counterposed healthy America , where attachment to the idea that people should pursue their self-interest was no less strong , but was different . 
The difference , he thought , was that Americans understood that they could not flourish unless their neighbors prospered as well . 
Thus , Americans pursued their self-interest , but in a way that was &quot; rightly understood . &quot; 
Tocqueville noted that &quot; Americans are fond of explaining ... &#91; how &#93; regard for themselves constantly prompts them to assist each other , and inclines them willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property to the general welfare . &quot; 
The French , by contrast , faced a future in which &quot; it is difficult to foresee to what pitch of stupid excesses their egotism may lead them , &quot; and &quot; into what disgrace and wretchedness they would plunge themselves , lest they should have to sacrifice something of their own well-being to the prosperity of their fellow-creatures . &quot; 
For Tocqueville , France &apos;s sickness in 1835 stemmed from its Bourbon patrimony of a top-down , command-and-control government , whereas America &apos;s health consisted in its bottom-up , grassroots-democratic government . 
Give the local community enough control over its own affairs , Tocqueville argued , and one &quot; will see at a glance ... the close tie which unites private to general interest . &quot; 
It was &quot; local freedom which leads a great number of citizens to value the affection of their neighbors and of their kindred , perpetually brings men together , and forces them to help one another , in spite of the propensities which sever them . &quot; 
Nearly two centuries have passed since Tocqueville wrote his masterpiece . 
The connection between the general interest and the private interest of individual Americans has , if anything , become much stronger , even if their private interest is tied to a post office box in the Cayman Islands . 
Indeed , no private-equity fortunes were made over the past generation without investing in or trading with the prosperous North Atlantic industrial core of the world economy . 
But the mechanisms that individuals can use to join with their immediate neighbors in political action that makes a difference in their lives have become much weaker . 
If , say , 25 % of the 1,000 households in the 30-block Brookside &quot; fiberhood &quot; in Kansas City , Missouri , pre-subscribe , Google will provide all 1,000 with the opportunity to get very cheap , very fast Internet service very soon . 
But that is the proverbial exception that proves the rule . 
And the Republicans gathered in Tampa to celebrate the rule - to say that the America that Tocqueville saw no longer exists : Americans no longer believe that the wealth of the rich rests on the prosperity of the rest . 
Rather , the rich owe their wealth solely to their own luck and effort . 
The rich - and only the rich - &quot; built &quot; what they have . 
The willingness to sacrifice some part of their private interest to support the public interest damages the souls and portfolios of the 1 % . 
Perhaps the moral and intellectual tide will be reversed , and America will remain exceptional for the reasons that Tocqueville identified two centuries ago . 
Otherwise , Tocqueville would surely say of Americans today what he said of the French then . 
The main difference is that it has become all too easy &quot; to foresee to what pitch of stupid excesses their egotism may lead them &quot; and &quot; into what disgrace and wretchedness they would plunge themselves . &quot;
