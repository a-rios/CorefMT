France is Not Working 
France &apos;s chronic malaise is marked by periodic explosions of protest . 
The two most recent episodes - the rioting and arson in French cities last autumn and the successful student campaign earlier this year against a new law governing young labor-market entrants - seem to have little in common . 
But their unifying thread is youth , unemployment , and uncertainty about the future , as well as the suffocating state paternalism that underlies the wider malaise itself . 
Take , for example , the desirable goal of job security . 
French governments have sought it in the only way they know - by ever more regulation . 
Unsurprisingly , rules that make it difficult to fire established workers discourage employers from hiring new ones . 
Insiders enjoy lavish protections , while entry barriers to the millions left outside are insurmountable . 
As a result , unemployment is averaging 10 % this decade and has not been below 8 % for 20 years . 
And , while the overall level of unemployment has remained stable - albeit at a shockingly high level - the unemployment rate among young men ( in the 16-24 age group ) jumped from 15.3 % in 1990 to 21.4 % in 2005 . 
France &apos;s benevolent paternalism penalizes the young beyond the labor market as well . 
On paper , wealth redistribution through high taxes and state transfers , reflecting Republican ideals of equality and social cohesion ( fraternité ) , has brought good results . 
Unlike most other OECD countries , where inequalities have increased over the last 30 years , in France pre-tax income inequality decreased slightly , or at worst remained stable , from 1970 to 2000 . 
But this aggregate stability masks shifts in income distribution that have favored older age cohorts . 
Those around retirement age ( 51-65 ) saw their share in total income rise by three percentage points in the last ten years , while younger groups , particularly those aged 18-25 , lost ground , with their income share falling by five percentage points . 
By 1995 , relative poverty was increasing sharply for young adults , while the opposite trend occurred among the elderly . 
In 1970 , a quarter of all pensioners lived in poverty ; today , the figure is only 4 % . 
Joblessness is the main cause of poverty , and the best protection against it is earned income , for which even France &apos;s generous welfare payments are an inadequate substitute . 
Moreover , the high payroll taxes needed to finance these benefits constitute another deterrent to hiring , as does the high minimum wage , which tends to price unskilled labor above its potential productivity . 
The relatively generous dole and the prospect of high taxes once in work merely reduces the incentive to take low-paid jobs . 
As a result , 40 % of all transfers go to poor but able-bodied people of working age . 
The full extent of the French system &apos;s pathology becomes fully clear in the light of successive governments &quot; attempts at reform , with piecemeal measures the norm - and thus proving counter-productive on balance , or failing altogether . 
Minimum-wage increases , for example , counteract income-tax credits and lower payroll taxes aimed at encouraging youth employment . 
The unspoken premise is that there must be no losers , not even in the short term . 
The logical answer would be to reduce equally the degree of job security enjoyed by the entire labor force . 
But no French government in recent decades has been remotely strong enough to face down opposition - often involving illegal action that goes unpunished - to any reduction in entrenched privileges . 
Perhaps the only way out of France &apos;s current impasse is the no-less traditional French route of revolution . 
According to this view , the system is unreformable , and real change will be possible only after it finally collapses , perhaps owing to fiscal weakness , since the combination of deficit-financed transfers , low growth , and low labor-market participation may prove unsustainable . 
After all , whatever the deeper causes of the French Revolution of 1789 , the immediate trigger was a public-finance crisis . 
The social strains of high unemployment - especially among young people - may force decisive change even before any fiscal meltdown . 
But evolutionary progress is always preferable to revolutionary upheaval , and , despite all the difficulties of genuine incremental reform , the prospects are not absolutely hopeless . 
This is clear from the remarkable recent experience of &quot; Sciences Po , &quot; one of the elite grandes écoles in the center of Paris . 
An ostensibly meritocratic competitive admission system to the grandes écoles is in fact monopolized by the socially privileged , who accounted for 81 % of students admitted to Sciences Po in 1998 ( compared to the roughly 60 % of students at Oxford and Cambridge who come from fee-paying private schools ) . 
The head of Sciences Po , Richard Descoings , implemented a program of positive discrimination that favors disadvantaged candidates , such as those from immigrant suburbs and rural areas , and charges increased fees to wealthier students . 
Descoings faced strong - and often cogent ­ - opposition . 
But the dynamic of all reform is clinched when even weighty arguments succumb to the urgency of change . 
For France as a whole , the long-term cost of withholding tough medicine will ultimately be much higher than the short-term pain of reforming the country &apos;s fiscally unsustainable and spiritually impoverishing welfare state . 
Young people in France will rediscover trust and hope when they can be shown a world where fairness consists not just in egalitarian and unconditional redistribution , but also in hard work and good behavior . 
Change for the better will be founded on the basic conviction that one should get what one deserves and deserve what one gets .
