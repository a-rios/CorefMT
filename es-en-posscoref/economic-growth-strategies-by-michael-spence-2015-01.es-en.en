Half-a-Loaf Growth 
MILAN - At a time of lackluster economic growth , countries around the world are attempting to devise and implement strategies to spur and sustain recovery . 
The key word is strategy : to succeed , policymakers must ensure that measures to open the economy , boost public investment , enhance macroeconomic stability , and increase reliance on markets and incentives for resource allocation are implemented in reasonably complete packages . 
Pursuing only some of these objectives produces distinctly inferior results . 
China provides a telling example . 
Before Deng Xiaoping launched the policy of &quot; reform and opening up &quot; in 1978 , the country had relatively high levels of public-sector investment . 
But the centrally planned economy lacked market incentives and was largely closed to the global economy &apos;s major markets for goods , investment , and technology . 
As a result , returns on public investment were modest , and China &apos;s economic performance was mediocre . 
China &apos;s economic transformation began with the introduction in the 1980s of market incentives in the agricultural sector . 
These reforms were followed by a gradual opening to the global economy , a process that accelerated in the early 1990s . 
Economic growth surged ahead , and returns on public investment soared , reaching an annual growth rate above 9 % of GDP , shortly after the reforms were implemented . 
The key to a successful growth strategy is to ensure that policies reinforce and enhance one another . 
For example , boosting returns on public investment - critical to any growth plan - demands complementary policies and conditions , in areas ranging from resource allocation to the institutional environment . 
In terms of effectiveness , the policy package is more than the sum of its parts . 
Of course , the specific portfolio of policies varies depending on the stage of a country &apos;s development ; early-stage growth dynamics are distinctly different from those in middle-income and advanced countries . 
But the imperative is the same . 
Just as a developing China achieved rapid growth only when a comprehensive policy package was implemented , the advanced countries struggling to restore sustainable growth patterns today have found that incomplete policy packages produce slow recoveries and below-potential growth and job creation . 
Consider the post-crisis performance of the European Union and the United States . 
Though both have had their share of problems , the US is performing somewhat better ( though it still faces major challenges in generating middle-income employment ) . 
The difference is not that the US launched a large fiscal stimulus focused on public-sector investment ; no such stimulus was implemented , though many economists , including me , believe that it would have generated a faster recovery and stronger long-term growth . 
Nor is the difference greater political effectiveness ; few would say that the US government is functioning well nowadays , given rising partisanship and sharp disagreement about its proper role . 
The US economy has benefited from two factors : its greater structural flexibility and dynamism relative to Europe , and the broader mandate of the US Federal Reserve , which has pursued a far more aggressive monetary policy than has the European Central Bank . 
Though analysts differ on the relative importance of these two factors - and , indeed , it is difficult to weight them - it is safe to say that both played a role in facilitating the US recovery . 
Europe is now placing a large bet on an increase in public-sector investment , using a combination of EU-level funding and national investment programs , perhaps augmented by a modification of the EU &apos;s fiscal rules . 
Given that public-sector underinvestment is a common cause of subpar growth , this is a step in the right direction . 
But public investment is not enough . 
Without complementary structural reforms that encourage private investment and innovation - and thus enable economies to adapt and compete in a global , technology-driven economy - a public-investment program will have a disappointingly weak impact on growth . 
Instead , debt-financed public investment will produce a short-run stimulus , at the cost of longer-term fiscal stability . 
The problem is that structural reforms are notoriously difficult to implement . 
For starters , they face political resistance from short-run losers , including the companies and sectors that existing rigidities protect . 
Moreover , in order to ensure that such reforms ultimately benefit everyone , there must be a strong culture of trust and a determination to prevent more flexible arrangements from leading to abuses . 
Finally , structural reforms require time to take effect . 
This is particularly true in the eurozone , whose members abandoned a crucial tool for accelerating the process - exchange-rate adjustments to account for different economies &quot; productivity levels - when they adopted the common currency . 
ECB President Mario Draghi recently argued that , because individual EU countries &quot; growth-retarding policies have negative external effects , perhaps they should not have unimpeded control in certain policy areas . 
Though member countries &quot; financial supervisory authority is already being limited through centralization of bank regulation and resolution mechanisms , Draghi &apos;s suggestion is more far-reaching . 
One wonders if Draghi &apos;s proposal is politically feasible in the EU context . 
Even if it were , would it be necessary ? 
All economies have sub-units across which economic productivity , growth , and dynamism vary considerably . 
Indeed , differentials in the quality of governance and policies seem persistent , even in economies that perform pretty well overall . 
Perhaps part of the answer is to prevent sub-units - in the EU &apos;s case , member countries - from falling short on reforms . 
But centralization carries its own costs . 
Given the risk inherent in betting on policy convergence , labor mobility - which enables highly valuable human capital , especially well-educated young people , to leave lagging regions for those that offer more and better employment opportunities - could prove to be a critical tool for adjustment . 
As it stands , labor mobility is imperfect in the EU . 
But , with language training and the implementation of something like the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs ( which aimed to create an innovative &quot; learning economy , &quot; underpinned by inclusive social and environmental policies ) , mobility could be enhanced . 
But more fluid labor mobility is no panacea . 
As with every other element of a growth strategy , mutually reinforcing efforts are the only way to achieve success . 
Half a loaf may be better than none , but half the ingredients do not translate into half of the hoped-for results .
