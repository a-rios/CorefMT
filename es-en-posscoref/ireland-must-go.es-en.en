Ireland Must Go 
Copenhagen - Ireland should do the rest of Europe a favor and withdraw from the European Union . That seems to be the only tenable solution to the situation created by the Irish &quot; No &quot; to the Lisbon Treaty . 
The Irish have created a problem for themselves . 
They should not let it be a problem for others . 
It would be sad to lose the merry people of the Emerald Island from the EU family . 
But it would be even sadder if , because of the Irish &quot; No , &quot; all those who wish to secure the same benefits from European integration that made it possible for the Irish to prosper are left out in the cold . 
EU enlargement cannot continue without the many practical and pragmatic elements included in the Lisbon Treaty . 
And the enlargement process is the most important endeavor the EU has undertaken , including the creation of the euro . 
The Union has already taken in countries that need a lot of attention - and others are knocking at the door . 
They want to catch up with all those who prospered in freedom during the Cold War , and they should be given that opportunity as a matter of fairness . 
Moreover , enlargement should be regarded as an important element of Europe &apos;s security policy , helping countries that have only recently democratized to secure stability at home and giving them the strength to deal with external pressures . 
It is a pity that the Irish - and their partners - did not learn the lesson from Ireland &apos;s rejection of the Treaty of Nice seven years ago . 
Then as now , only a minority of voters bothered to vote , and a mere 54 % of those who did participate , then as now , voted no . 
A year later , a new referendum approved the Nice Treaty , after it became clear that Ireland &apos;s EU membership was at stake . 
The unfortunate Irish tradition for referenda should have been addressed after that dismaying experience . 
Now the EU is again in the Irish stew . 
Renegotiating the treaty is out of the question , since doing so would open a Pandora &apos;s Box of demands from everybody else . 
So the problem lies with the Irish , and they must solve it . 
I cannot help but recall the situation in the summer of 1992 , when a small majority of Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty . 
Back then , there were 12 members in what was then still called the European Community . 
Following their vote , the Danes were told in unmistakable terms that one way or another the country would have to leave the EU family if we did not find a way out . 
As Denmark &apos;s foreign minister at the time , I was able to secure some opt-outs from EU directives , and then a second referendum was held . 
The result was a &quot; Yes &quot; to the Maastricht Treaty . 
We in Denmark have been marred by those opt-outs ever since . 
Our European partners could not throw us out in June 1992 - but the other 11 could create their own EC-11 , and we could have been left alone in the empty shell of an EC-12 . 
This time , however , it seems very difficult to see how all others could agree to create an EU-26 while isolating Ireland in an empty EU-27 , though that would be a reasonable solution . 
That is why the Irish should show magnanimity and tell the others to go on without them . 
The Irish have been a good example for the new member states . 
When Ireland joined the EC back in 1972 , they were so poor that many feared they would become a burden for the other members . 
The Irish never were . 
On the contrary , over a surprisingly short span of time the Irish proved how a small and determined country could use European integration to rise to the status of one of 
Indeed , Ireland has made itself a shining example to those who strive to catch up with the rest of Europe . 
That is one reason it will be a loss to say goodbye to the Irish , and why their frivolous rejection of the Lisbon Treaty is so tragic . 
But Europe must go on .
