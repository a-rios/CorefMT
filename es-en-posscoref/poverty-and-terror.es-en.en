Poverty and Terror 
Glib assertions that poverty breeds terrorism have been tossed around of late . 
Of course , no simple equation between the two can be drawn . 
Yet , such statements do contain grains of truth . 
Poverty may not cause Islamic terrorism , but Islamic terrorists manipulate poverty to their advantage . 
Thus , any viable strategy to prevent terrorism must address core issues of economic development . 
The first issue to be recognized is that development took a wrong turn about 30 years ago , when OPEC imposed two severe oil-shocks on the global economy . 
Developed countries shifted from promoting growth to fighting inflation . 
World growth slowed dramatically ( except in East Asia ) and the growth of world trade was halved . 
OPEC countries grew rich , while the rest of the developing world struggled with unsustainable trade deficits and indebtedness . 
Most experienced negative growth . 
During the 1980s and 1990s , half of the IMF &apos;s member developing countries endured severe financial crises and were forced to scale back social expenditures so that poverty , inequality and the potential for civil strife increased substantially . 
In the wake of this , development policies changed . 
America , the IMF , and the World Bank began to emphasize globalization by stressing trade liberalization , restrictive macro-economic policies and the institutional strengthening of markets - the policy package known as &quot; The Washington Consensus . &quot; 
International assistance was recast : development loans became &quot; structural adjustment loans , &quot; intended to help heavily indebted developing countries avoid default and made conditional upon countries undertaking reforms favored by the Washington Consensus . 
Aid fatigue set in and , as the Cold War diminished , official aid flows declined as it was no longer necessary to bribe countries to keep them out of the Soviet camp . 
For the average developing country the results were stagnation , widened economic inequalities , climbing unemployment , and increased numbers of poor people . 
Economic modernization and poverty reduction suffered . 
In Africa , per capita GNP dropped at an average rate of .7 % annually between 1970 and 1995 . 
The median rate of growth in developing-country per capita GNP between 1980 and 1998 was 0.0 % - no ringing endorsement of Washington Consensus policies . 
The 1980s became a lost decade for development . 
Of course , some bright spots emerged : &quot; high-development-level &quot; developing countries - Taiwan , Korea and most of Latin America - became democracies . 
Between 1970 and 1990 , the share of trade in GNP increased and the share of developing country manufactured exports rose , except in oil-countries . 
Chile , China , India and Vietnam increased their growth rates substantially through labor-intensive export-led growth and market-oriented reforms , albeit at the cost of burgeoning inequality . 
But poverty was not the only wound inflicted in these years . 
Escalating oil-prices created a super-rich feudal aristocracy in the Gulf States . 
The gaps between the cosmopolitan oil-sheiks and the disaffected , disenfranchised , and nearly hopeless remainder of the population widened . 
Economic modernization was practically non-existent . 
Significant increases in education coupled with little modern-job creation and rapid rural-urban migration added to social and political unrest . 
The oil-regimes were oppressive , quelled dissent through torture , and were venal and corrupt . 
Nonetheless , because of oil , they retained US support . 
Small wonder some Arab youths became radicalized . 
A small band of fiery Imams seized upon this youthful discontent . 
Recalling the achievements of Islamic culture during the Middle Ages , they offered a ( self-serving ) nostrum for lifting Moslems out of dependence , degradation and misery : the reestablishment of theocratic Islamic States that would be more pure and just than secular ones . 
Largely unnoticed by the West , they created a fanatical , totalitarian , movement that would stop at nothing , including self-immolation , to achieve its goals . 
Who were their enemies ? 
Modernizing secular leaders ( Nasser and Sadat in Egypt ; the Shah in Iran ) ; intellectuals who preached of a just secular order and exposed the excesses of the fundamentalist movement ( Salman Rushdie ) ; the small moderate Moslem middle class ; the feudal , secular elites ; infidels ( moderate Moslems , Christians and Jews ) ; and foreign powers that supported their enemies . 
For several decades , their activities were largely limited to their own countries . 
When Arab governments clamped down , they exported violence westward . 
For now , the terrorist war is the policy response to the spread of Islamic terrorism . 
In the long run , something beyond a military response is needed . 
I believe that the West can learn a great deal about what to do by studying the policies pursued in the world &apos;s only two mid-development Moslem states , Tunisia and Indonesia , because each successfully avoided becoming prey to Islamic fundamentalism . 
Tunisia &apos;s achievement is noteworthy given its proximity to violence-prone Algeria . 
Both countries combined substantial increases in secular education with rapid job creation in manufacturing jobs ; stressed rural development and labor-intensive exports ; and pursued rapid , egalitarian development . 
Egalitarian development of this sort is the only viable answer to the problems of the Moslem world &apos;s mal-development . 
However , it provides no short-term answer to terrorism for several reasons : it does not supply an ideology compelling enough to compete with fundamentalism , which has captured at least two generations in the Moslem world . 
Once radicalized , the genie of violence can rarely be put back into his bottle by civilized means . 
Violence arises when there is hope rather than when things are hopeless . 
Note that the terrorist leaders are not the poor and uneducated , and that the usual suspects among countries that sponsor terrorism are not the poorest Arab states . 
Indeed , 1999 , the year before the current Palestinian Intifada erupted , was a good year economically for the West Bank and Gaza . 
Sadly , the politics of crackdown appears to be the only immediate answer to terrorist violence . 
But if peace , once achieved , is to be maintained , genuine development that is more balanced among different aspects of development , which delivers more benefits to the poor and promotes economic convergence among countries , must become the West &apos;s goal . 
While such policies might take decades to lessen Islamic terrorism , they may prevent radicalization in other developing countries .
