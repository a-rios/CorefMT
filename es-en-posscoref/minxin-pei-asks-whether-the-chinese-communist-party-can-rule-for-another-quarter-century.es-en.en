Surviving Tiananmen 
HONG KONG - It may be hard to imagine , but 25 years ago , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) was nearly toppled by a nationwide pro-democracy movement . 
It was the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping &apos;s steely nerves and the tanks of the People &apos;s Liberation Army - dispatched to enforce martial law and suppress the protests in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square - that enabled the regime , at the cost of several hundred civilian lives , to avoid collapse . 
On the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4 , 1989 , two questions stand out : how has the CCP survived the last quarter-century , and can its rule endure for another 25 years ? 
The answer to the first question is relatively straightforward . 
Policy adjustments , clever tactics of manipulation , and a healthy dose of luck enabled the CCP to win the support it needed to retain power and suppress destabilizing forces . 
To be sure , serious mistakes were made . 
Following the massacre , China &apos;s conservative leaders attempted to reverse the liberalizing reforms that Deng had initiated in the 1980 &quot; s , plunging the Chinese economy into recession . 
And the Soviet Union &apos;s implosion in 1991 caused a panic in the CCP . 
But Deng again managed to save the Party . 
Mustering all of his energy and political capital , the 87-year-old leader revived pro-market economic reforms , unleashing an economic revolution that delivered an unprecedented wave of growth and development , thereby boosting the CCP &apos;s credibility considerably . 
Deng and his successors buttressed this trend by granting Chinese citizens considerable personal freedoms , fueling the emergence of a culture of crass consumerism and mass entertainment . 
In this new world of &quot; bread and circuses , &quot; it was far easier for the CCP to regain public support and suppress the opposition . 
Carefully orchestrated moves to promote Chinese nationalism and exploit xenophobia also helped . 
Even repression , the mainstay of the regime &apos;s survival , was fine-tuned . 
China &apos;s newly acquired wealth enabled its leaders to build one of the world &apos;s most technically sophisticated Internet firewalls and equip its internal security forces with the most effective tools . 
In dealing with China &apos;s small but resilient dissident community , the regime depends on the strategy of &quot; decapitation . &quot; 
In other words , the government eliminates the threat posed by leading opposition figures by jailing them or forcing them into exile , regardless of their prominence . 
Liu Xiaobo - who won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize - was sentenced to 11 years in prison , despite worldwide protest . 
However cynical , the approach has worked . 
But the CCP might not have been quite so successful had it not gotten lucky in a few critical areas . 
For starters , the post-1992 reforms coincided with a surge of globalization , which provided China with massive capital inflows ( about $ 1 trillion in foreign direct investment since 1992 ) , a slew of new technologies , and virtually unimpeded access to Western consumer markets . 
China thus became the workshop of the world , with its exports rising more than tenfold by 2007 . 
Another factor that worked in the regime &apos;s favor was the so-called demographic dividend ( an abundant labor force and a relatively small percentage of children and elderly dependents ) . 
This provided China with plentiful low-cost labor , while saving the government large expenditures on pensions and health care . 
The problem facing the CCP now is that most of the factors that enabled it to survive since Tiananmen either have already disappeared or are headed in that direction . 
Indeed , for all practical purposes , pro-market reforms are dead . 
A kleptocracy of government officials , their families , and well-connected businessmen has colonized the Chinese state and is intent on blocking any reforms that might threaten their privileged status . 
Moreover , the CCP can no longer count on rising prosperity to sustain public support . 
Rampant corruption and rising inequality , together with obvious environmental decay , are causing ordinary Chinese - especially the middle class , which once had high hopes for reform - to become increasingly disillusioned . 
At the same time , given rapid population aging , China &apos;s demographic dividend has all but dissipated . 
And , given that China is already the world &apos;s largest exporter , with more than 11 % of the global market share , there is little room left for export growth in the coming years . 
That leaves only repression and nationalism in the CCP &apos;s post-Tiananmen toolkit . 
And , indeed , both of them continue to play a central role in President Xi Jinping &apos;s strategy for ensuring the Party &apos;s survival . 
But Xi is also experimenting with two new devices : an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign and an attempt to revive pro-market reforms . 
So far , his war on corruption has made a bigger impact than his plan for economic reform . 
On the surface , Xi &apos;s strategy seems sound . 
But waging war on corrupt officials and pressing for deep reforms aimed at dismantling China &apos;s kleptocracy will inevitably bring Xi into conflict with China &apos;s political and economic elites . 
The question is how he can overcome their resistance without rallying the Chinese people , whose political mobilization could endanger the one-party system . 
The CCP defied the doomsayers after 1989 : It survived and preempted any further threats to its power . 
But the odds that it can hold on for another quarter-century have grown long - and are unlikely to improve .
