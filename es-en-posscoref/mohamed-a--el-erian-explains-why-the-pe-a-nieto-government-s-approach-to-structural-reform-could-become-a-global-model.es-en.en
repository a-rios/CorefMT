Mexico &apos;s Breakout Moment ? 
MEXICO CITY - Less than two years into Enrique Pe単a Nieto &apos;s presidency , Mexico is implementing an ambitious structural-reform package designed to lift its economy out of a multi-decade low-growth trap and create new opportunities for its citizens . 
The reforms involve restructuring economic sectors once deemed politically untouchable , and are backed by constitutional amendments and a bold legislative agenda . 
Indeed , thanks to the &quot; Pact for Mexico , &quot; much of this agenda has the support not only of Pe単a Nieto &apos;s government , but also of the two main opposition parties . 
This unique arrangement soon will be tested as the reforms begin to bite , and the outcome could have important and lasting consequences for efforts to implement structural reforms elsewhere around the world . 
Such reforms are never easy to initiate and are usually difficult to complete . 
Politicians advocate them when they are in opposition , but rarely embrace and sustain them when in government . 
The reason is simple : front-loaded costs and back-loaded benefits make structural reforms politically perilous . 
Governments that do embark on structural reform often find it frustrating to wait for that often-elusive &quot; critical mass &quot; of revitalized sectors to materialize ; and economists find it very difficult to predict the timing and magnitude of the growth liftoff that should follow . 
Complicating matters further , the inevitability of unanticipated developments , whether homegrown or external in origin , means that course corrections often are needed . 
As a result , there are only a few good historical examples - including China , Poland , and South Korea - of successful structural reforms . 
Against this background , it is fascinating to observe what is happening in Mexico . 
The &quot; why , &quot; &quot; how , &quot; and &quot; what &quot; of the country &apos;s ambitious structural-reform efforts could - and should - have important signaling effects around the world . 
Mexican officials are the first to point out their country &apos;s relatively poor economic performance over the last 33 years . 
Average annual growth , at only 2.4 % , is well below what is needed and possible for a country with such enormous human and natural endowments , a prime location on the United States &quot; doorstep , and considerable catch-up potential . 
Moreover , Mexico &apos;s growth record is far inferior to that of some other countries that started with a lot less and yet leap-frogged it ( and other Latin American economies ) . 
Policymakers could easily dodge responsibility for Mexico &apos;s middling performance by hiding behind the various emerging-market crises , Latin America &apos;s &quot; lost decade , &quot; and the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession . 
But Mexico &apos;s officials are not looking for excuses . 
They also note that Mexico &apos;s impressive accomplishments in terms of macroeconomic stabilization , while necessary , have not proved sufficient to unleash the country &apos;s growth potential . 
Yes , Mexico has built strong domestic and foreign financial buffers , put its fiscal house in order , opened up its economy to the outside world , and concluded many free-trade arrangements , led by the North American Free Trade Agreement . 
But now the time has come to build on this progress by simultaneously reforming five large and influential sectors : education , energy , finance , telecommunications , and the labor market . 
And Pe単a Nieto &apos;s government has worked hard - and successfully - in recent months to adopt the necessary constitutional amendments and enact initial legislation . 
Indeed , I remember my own experience in Mexico in the late 1980s and early 1990s , when I was part of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s team working with officials there to assist with the country &apos;s recovery from the Latin American debt crisis . 
Any mention of energy reforms was met with immediate resistance , including references to national sovereignty and constitutional protections . 
All of this is anchored by a clear political mandate , as well as by Pe単a Nieto &apos;s stated personal commitment to overcome three decades of inadequate growth and productivity deficits . 
Given the possibility of a domestic political backlash , the inherent complexities of implementing a multi-dimensional reform package , and the cyclical headwinds implied by still-sluggish growth in the US ( which accounts for roughly 80 % of exports ) , Mexico may need both anchors if it is to sustain reform momentum . 
Fortunately , the government has room for countercyclical policy , and has already responded with more accommodating fiscal and monetary policies . 
Mexico has a good chance to realize its impressive structural-reform agenda . 
Doing so would give the rest of the world an important example of how such programs can be designed and implemented for the long term , thereby enabling a critical mass of strong sectors - and thus faster growth and greater prosperity - to be achieved and citizens &quot; legitimate aspirations to be met .
