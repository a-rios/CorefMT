Transition in Crisis ? 
LONDON - Europe &apos;s emerging markets have this year experienced their worst output collapse since the great &quot; transitional recession &quot; that followed the end of communism . 
Five countries are expected to suffer double-digit declines in GDP . 
Non-performing loans in the banking sector and unemployment continue to rise in many countries . 
There is no doubt that the European transition region is in deep crisis . 
But is the transition from communism to a market economy itself in crisis ? 
How have the institutions and policy frameworks that were the outcome of the transition process coped ? 
Will the crisis lead to a backlash against market-oriented reforms ? 
While Central and Eastern Europe has been the emerging-market region to suffer the most in the crisis , it has generally avoided the currency collapses , systemic banking failures , and spikes in inflation that were the staple of previous crises . 
Given how deeply integrated the region has become with the rest of the world , this is remarkable . 
That deep integration cuts both ways . 
On the one hand , it created economic ties and financial dependence that have made many transition countries highly susceptible to the crisis in the West . 
On the other hand , it mitigated the large capital outflows that were a destructive force in past crises , contributed to more mature institutions and domestic policy responses , and helped mobilize vigorous international support . 
The two faces of integration ( explored in the EBRD &apos;s 2008 Transition Report ) have been particularly visible in finance . 
Financial integration has been an important force for long-term growth in the transition region , and the presence of strategic foreign banks helped mitigate the impact of the crisis . 
At the same time , integration into the wider European and global economy has no doubt contributed to excessively fast expansion in private-sector and foreign-currency debt , which has complicated the crisis in many countries . 
But the lesson from this experience is not that countries should attempt to reverse financial integration - to do so would be both unfeasible and unwise - but that they should reduce its risks . 
Further east , resource-rich transition economies such as Russia and Kazakhstan are facing what is arguably an even bigger challenge . 
Like the financially integrated economies of Central and Eastern Europe , the commodity-rich countries have had to manage the complications of rapid inflows of foreign currency . 
But these capital inflows also seem to discourage institutional development . 
In some areas , particularly macroeconomic management involving the accumulation and use of stabilization funds , resource-rich transition countries have performed fairly well . 
But the ultimate goal - diversification and associated improvements in economic ( and political ) institutions and the business climate - has mostly proved elusive . 
The crisis has also tested ideas about the ultimate aims of transition . 
It confirmed the view that the transition from communism is about much more than building markets and shifting economic responsibilities from the state to the private sector . 
It also involves developing certain state functions , and improving how the state interacts with the private sector . 
The crisis that began in 2008 underscored the importance of market-supporting policy institutions and policies , particularly in the financial sector . 
This does not necessarily mean more regulation , but it certainly means better regulation , focused on improving incentives . 
A long agenda of institutional reform remains , particularly in Central Asia and some East European and Western Balkans countries . 
Moreover , significant sector-specific reforms are needed even in some Central European and Baltic countries , particularly in sustainable energy and energy efficiency , transport , and the financial sector , where regulatory and supervisory regimes require strengthening , financing of small and medium-sized firms needs to be improved , and local capital markets must be developed . 
In light of today &apos;s crisis , what is the likelihood of such reforms actually being implemented ? 
Will this crisis act as a catalyst for more reform , or will it lead to a backlash against the market model ? 
One year into the crisis in the transition region , we can almost rule out the latter scenario . 
While the crisis clearly slowed the pace of new reforms , it has led to far fewer reform reversals than in 1998-1999 , for example , following the crisis in Russia . 
Furthermore , government changes since early 2008 have either led to no change with respect to reform or favored pro-reform parties . 
But an acceleration of reforms also appears unlikely , with the possible exception of the financial sector . 
Thus , while the global recession plunged the transition region into crisis , at the same time it demonstrated the resilience of the reforms and economic integration achieved over the last 15 to 20 years . 
It also highlighted the pitfalls of the development models that countries in the transition region have pursued . 
Yet it is clear that the way to address these pitfalls is to extend the transition agenda , not to replace it .
