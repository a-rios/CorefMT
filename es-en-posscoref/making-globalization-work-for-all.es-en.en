Making Globalization Work for All 
We are now in a one-year countdown to establish a new approach to globalization . 
In September 2005 , world leaders will meet at the UN to review the progress made since the Millennium Assembly in September 2000 , when they pledged to support a set of ambitious objectives - the Millennium Development Goals Â­ - to help the world &apos;s poorest people escape poverty , hunger , disease , and illiteracy . 
Setting goals was the easy part . 
When they return next fall , world leaders must decide on how to achieve them . 
Fortunately , a proposal by UK Chancellor Gordon Brown might provide the needed global breakthrough . 
Here is the problem : globalization offers people everywhere the chance to escape extreme poverty , but it is not working in many parts of the developing world . 
While China and India grow rapidly , most of Africa is stagnating . 
Similarly , large parts of Latin America and Central Asia are experiencing rising , not falling , rates of poverty . 
In most cases , geography plays an important role in success or failure . 
The big development success stories are places like Shanghai , port cities with ready access to world markets . 
The biggest development failures tend to be in rural areas far from the coast . 
Communities living in mountainous areas , such as in the Andes , or Central Asia , or the highlands of East Africa , are especially isolated . 
Geographical isolation is even more extreme if the country is landlocked , like Bolivia , Afghanistan , Ethiopia , or Burkina Faso . 
In addition to isolation , other problems include droughts in Africa , where farmers depend on rainfall rather than irrigation , and high disease burdens in tropical countries suffering from malaria , dengue fever , and other killer diseases . 
All of these problems are solvable , but they are not being solved in many places . 
Instead of hearing more lectures from the IMF about cutting budgets , poor countries need larger budgets to pay for the required investments - roads , power supplies , ports , schools , and health clinics - to jump-start economic growth . 
The IMF should spend less time telling the poorest of the poor to cut their spending , and more time telling rich countries to give more money to help the poor meet their investment needs . 
Rich countries have promised more help for years , but continue to renege . 
Thirty-five years ago , they promised to give 0.7 % of their GNP to poor countries as development aid . 
Instead they give 0.25 % - a shortfall that amounts to $ 120 billion per year . 
The United States causes half the total shortfall . 
If the US lived up to its pledge of 0.7 % of GNP in donor aid , it would be giving $ 75 billion per year . 
Instead , it gives around $ 15 billion . 
The US could easily afford to do more . 
The Bush administration gave $ 250 billion per year in tax cuts to the richest Americans , raised military spending by $ 150 billion per year , and then turned to the poorest people of the world and told them that there is no money available to meet America &apos;s promise . 
None of this makes sense for global security , or even for the financial interests of donor countries . 
The failures of economic development in the Andes , Central Asia , and Africa contribute to global instability , local insurrections and violence , drug trafficking , and bases for terrorism . 
Military approaches alone will not work , because the root of the problem is the vulnerability of poor , hungry people to the prophets of hate . 
If donors keep giving only a little bit of help , but not enough to solve the problems of the poorest countries , these countries will never escape poverty &apos;s grip . 
By financing a much higher level of investment in the next few years , rich countries would give poor countries the chance to achieve economic growth - promising an eventual end to further aid . 
Chancellor Brown &apos;s proposal - an initiative called the International Finance Facility ( IFF ) - does precisely this . 
The idea of the IFF is to guarantee that donor countries double their aid levels during the next decade , so that well-governed poor countries can make the investments they need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals . 
Brown is exactly right : let &apos;s put Africa and other impoverished regions on a path of sustained economic growth by frontloading the aid during the period until 2015 . 
Great Britain has made the Millennium Development Goals , and hence the IFF , the centerpiece of the G-8 Summit , which will be held in Scotland next July . 
French President Jacques Chirac has joined Blair and Brown in a bold call for rich countries to honor their promises to the poor . 
The richest countries - the US , Germany , and Japan - must join this vital initiative . 
Building a more peaceful and prosperous world is in everyone &apos;s best interest .
