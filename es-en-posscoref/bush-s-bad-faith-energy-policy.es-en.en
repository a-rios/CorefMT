Bush &apos;s Bad-Faith Energy Policy 
One of the more surreal sessions at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum in Davos had oil industry experts explaining how the melting of the polar ice cap - which is occurring faster than anyone anticipated ­ - represents not only a problem , but also an opportunity : vast amounts of oil may now be accessible . 
Similarly , these experts concede that the fact that the United States has not signed the Law of the Sea , the international convention determining who has access to offshore oil and other maritime mineral rights , presents a risk of international conflict . 
But they also point to the upside : the oil industry , in its never-ending search for more reserves , need not beg Congress for the right to despoil Alaska . 
President George W. Bush has an uncanny ability not to see the big message . 
For years , it has become increasingly clear that much is amiss with his energy policy . 
Scripted by the oil industry , even members of his own party referred to an earlier energy bill as one that &quot; left no lobbyist behind . &quot; 
While praising the virtues of the free market , Bush has been only too willing to give huge handouts to the energy industry , even as the country faces soaring deficits . 
There is a market failure when it comes to energy , but government intervention should run in precisely the opposite direction from what the Bush administration has proposed . 
The fact that Americans do not pay the full price for the pollution - especially enormous contributions to greenhouse gases - that results from their profligate energy use means that energy is under-priced , in turn sustaining excessive consumption . 
The government needs to encourage conservation , and intervening in the price system ­ ­ - namely , through taxes on energy - is an efficient way to do it . 
But , rather than encouraging conservation , Bush has pursued a policy of &quot; drain America first , &quot; leaving America more dependent on external oil in the future . 
Never mind that high demand drives up oil prices , creating a windfall for many in the Middle East who are not among America &apos;s friends . 
Now , more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , Bush appears to have finally woken up to the reality of America &apos;s increasing dependence ; with soaring oil prices , it was hard for him not to note the consequences . 
But , again , his administration &apos;s faltering moves will almost surely make matters worse in the immediate future . 
Bush still refuses to do anything about conservation , and he has put very little money behind his continuing prayer than technology will save us . 
What , then , to make of Bush &apos;s recent declaration of a commitment to make America 75 % free of dependence on Middle East oil within 25 years . 
For investors , the message is clear : do not invest more in developing reserves in the Middle East , which is by far the lowest-cost source of oil in the world . 
But , without new investment in developing Middle East reserves , unbridled growth of energy consumption in the US , China , and elsewhere implies that demand will outpace supply . 
If that were not enough , Bush &apos;s threat of sanctions against Iran poses the risks of interruptions of supplies from one of the world &apos;s largest producers . 
With world oil production close to full capacity and prices already more than double their pre-Iraq War level , this portends still higher prices , and still higher profits for the oil industry - the only clear winner in Bush &apos;s Middle East policy . 
To be sure , one shouldn &apos;t begrudge Bush for having at last recognized that there is a problem . 
But , as always , a closer look at what he is proposing suggests another sleight of hand by his administration . 
Aside from refusing to recognize the importance of global warming , encourage conservation , or devote enough funds to research to make a real difference , Bush &apos;s grandiose promise of a reduction of dependence on Middle East oil means less than it appears . 
With only 20 % of US oil coming from the Middle East , his goal could be achieved by a modest shift of sourcing elsewhere . 
But surely , one would think , the Bush administration must realize that oil trades on a global market . 
Even if America were 100 % independent of Middle East oil , a reduction in supply of Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world price - and on the American economy . 
As is too often the case with the Bush administration , there is no flattering explanation of official policy . 
Is Bush playing politics by pandering to anti-Arab and anti-Iranian sentiment in America ? 
Or is this just another example of incompetence and muddle ? 
From what we have seen over the past five years , the correct answer probably contains more than a little bad faith and sheer ineptitude .
