Reforming Economic Reform 
Economists have been more influential over the last 15 years than at probably any other time in history . 
The policies of central planning , dirigisme , and import substitution , which many newly independent countries adopted in the 1950 &apos;s and 1960 &apos;s , could be labeled as the ideas of communists , Fabian socialists , and nationalists , not trained economists . 
The policies of deregulation , privatization , and trade liberalization ( the so-called Washington Consensus ) that countries adopted in the 1980 &apos;s , supposedly marked the victory of professional economists over populist politicians . 
The paradox is that this was no victory for economics . 
Indeed , the last two decades have proved dismal for the practice of the &quot; dismal science . &quot; 
With few exceptions , countries in which the US-educated economic technocracy gained the upper hand performed worse than they did prior to the 1980 &apos;s . 
Latin America &apos;s stalled and stagnant economies , which embraced the Washington Consensus more than most , stand out as exhibit &quot; A. &quot; 
The biggest development successes in recent years have been in places like China and Vietnam , where Western economic ideas , to the extent that they were considered at all , lost out to more practically oriented policymakers . 
The puzzle is not &quot; why did economics fail us ? &quot; but &quot; why were economists so overconfident ? &quot; 
After all , much of the Washington Consensus cannot be deduced from proper economic analysis . 
Any graduate student in economics knows that deregulation , privatization , and trade liberalization cannot be expected to produce economic benefits without a long list of unlikely conditions being satisfied . 
Moreover , there is nothing in economic theory that should have made economic technocrats think that Anglo-American institutions of corporate governance or &quot; flexible labor markets , &quot; to pick just two examples , produce unambiguously superior economic performance when compared to German-style insider control or institutionalized labor markets . 
On closer scrutiny , what passed as state-of-the-art thinking on economic policy turns out to have been based on some crude rules of thumb . 
More often than not , the advocacy of simple panaceas was based on one or more of the following pathologies : 
· Flimsy empiricism . 
South Korea has done better than North Korea , and Burma &apos;s path is hardly one that leads to prosperity . 
Therefore we know that markets do better than central planning , and that foreign trade is better than autarky . 
But it takes a huge leap of faith to conclude from this that one can &apos;t go wrong by deregulating , privatizing , and opening domestic markets as much as possible . 
Even in areas where the empirical record appears clear , closer analysis reveals major flaws . 
Analysts who focused only on those elements of China &apos;s or South Korea &apos;s experience that fit their beliefs missed the larger story that these countries were undergoing massively heterodox experiments . 
· Implicit political theorizing . 
Economists who become policy advisors are great fans of simplicity , uniformity , and arm &apos;s-length relations between government and the private sector , not because of economic theory or empirical evidence , but because of unexamined and untested assumptions . 
Governments , they believe , are run by crooks , so tie their hands ; bureaucrats are beholden to rent-seeking private agents , so ensure non-discretion and apply uniform taxes and incentives ; domestic political systems cannot be trusted , so import laws and institutions from abroad ; external influences are always more benign than domestic ones , so ensure maximum openness to international trade and investment ; reformers have a limited &quot; honeymoon period , &quot; so implement reforms fast . 
Economists ended up practicing public administration without license . 
· Lack of institutional imagination . 
No Western-trained economist could have envisioned China &apos;s household responsibility system or township and village enterprises - institutional innovations that lie at the core of the Chinese miracle . 
Any economist from Washington ( or Harvard ) would have pushed a recipe of privatization and across-the-board liberalization if asked in 1978 to advise the Chinese government . 
Only with hindsight can we see that China &apos;s innovations were truly demanding reforms . 
Of course , economic principles do not work differently in different places . 
Property rights and the rule of law are always important so that investors - both current and prospective - can expect to retain the money they make . 
Private incentives always need to be aligned with social costs and benefits if productive efficiency is to be achieved . 
Macroeconomic and financial stability require debt sustainability , prudential regulation , and sound money . 
Any economist can mouth these platitudes to his / her hosts immediately upon arrival in a foreign land , without fear of going astray . 
The trouble is that these universal principles are not self-executing : they do not automatically translate into clear-cut institutional arrangements or policy prescriptions . 
For example , the principle that property rights should be protected implies very little about the best way to achieve this under a society &apos;s existing institutional preconditions . 
It certainly does not imply that a system of private property rights and Anglo-American corporate governance is the right approach for all countries at all times . 
Consider the vast investment and entrepreneurial activity that China has elicited through a hybrid system of property rights and a legal regime that is as far as imaginable from the Anglo-American system . 
Similarly , the principle that private incentives should be aligned with social costs and benefits hardly results in unconditional support for policies of trade liberalization , deregulation , and privatization . 
Neither does it preclude the use of activist trade and industrial policies in pursuit of economic restructuring . 
Finally , debt sustainability , fiscal prudence , and sound money are also obviously compatible with diverse institutional arrangements . 
For economists , the challenge is to work out the operational implications of these universal principles in specific economies . 
We must take full account of predicates , conditionals , and contingencies in order to specify more completely which countries should adopt what policies . 
Failing that , it is time for economists to stop pretending that we have all the answers .
