Achieving Growth in a Rebalanced World 
MILAN - Although the financial crisis is winding down , the prospects for growth in the global economy are unlikely to pick up . 
This is , in part , inevitable . 
But it is also the result of poor coordination between governments as the world economy rebalances . 
Prior to the crisis , American consumers , on average , either saved nothing or accumulated debt . 
That has now changed . 
With household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other asset-price declines , pensions and retirement provisions are in disarray . 
Because asset prices will not reach pre-crisis levels anytime soon ( that is , without inflating another bubble and risking renewed instability ) , household saving in the United States has risen to about 5 % of disposable income , and probably will rise further . 
This withdrawal of the US consumer is part ( perhaps half ) of the process of rebalancing the global economy . 
Restoring America &apos;s savings-investment balance implies a reduction in global aggregate demand of around $ 800 billion . 
To be sure , fiscal deficits and emergency measures in advanced economies and some major developing countries have cushioned the sharp decline , substituting in part for missing consumers . 
But this substitution cannot continue indefinitely . 
In advanced countries , governments will eventually be forced to reduce spending , and central banks will withdraw from emergency credit provisions and guarantees . 
As a result , many believe that a &quot; new normal &quot; of slower advanced-country growth is upon us . 
Despite a recovery in asset prices in many countries and the deceleration of negative growth , unemployment is high and rising . 
Risk spreads have declined from their mid-crisis highs , but credit in many sectors remains tight or barely available , while the financial sector is set to become more conservative - and is likely to be re-regulated with higher capital , reserve , and margin requirements . 
And this is just the baseline scenario . 
Downside risks include fiscal destabilization resulting from a failure to rein in deficits , inflation and withdrawal of central bank autonomy , and loss of confidence in the dollar , which continues to be the reserve currency for the global economy . 
Little wonder , then , that many knowledgeable analysts reasonably expect post-crisis growth in advanced countries to be lower , perhaps by 0.5 to 1 % . 
A 1 % slowdown in advanced-country growth translates into roughly $ 350 billion of missing aggregate demand every year , in addition to the shortfall because of rebalancing in the US . 
If the slowdown in advanced countries persists , pre-crisis growth levels will not be achievable in the developing world either , owing to insufficient demand to absorb the implied increase in output . 
Of course , individual developing countries may be spared . 
But it is an unfortunate mathematical fact that not everyone can gain market share . 
If the advanced-country scenario is right , many developing countries will lose out and experience sharply diminished growth . 
Prior to the crisis , many suspected that the mix of aggregate demand that was supporting high growth was unsustainable , though the problem perhaps seemed too hypothetical to compel collective action . 
Not anymore . 
But the collective action problem is no less daunting , and it requires urgent attention if the world &apos;s growth aspirations are to be achieved . 
The problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher private-sector competitiveness , but also by means of protectionist measures . 
And , as we have seen in many countries &quot; efforts to ameliorate the crisis , the non-cooperative protectionist response is much more likely to be adopted - despite wide recognition that it is highly destructive - when aggregate demand is in short supply . 
So what can be done to shore up global aggregate demand and growth prospects , while preserving the economic openness that has benefited major parts of the developing world so greatly in the past 30 years ? 
First , countries with current-account surpluses such as Germany , Japan and China must recognize that their own growth ( and that of others ) depends on reducing the global savings-investment imbalance , which will result in narrowing external deficits elsewhere . 
This needs to be done on a sustained basis following the withdrawal of extraordinary fiscal stimulus . 
Second , everyone must recognize their stake in restoring balanced advanced-country growth as much and as soon as possible in order to counter the ongoing shortfall in aggregate demand . 
After all , advanced countries account for about two-thirds of global GDP , so slow growth in these countries will inevitably impede global growth and truncate the growth potential of much of the developing world . 
This challenge , however , is very complex because deleveraging and rebalancing cannot be completed overnight . 
But key steps can and should be taken : restoration of fiscal balance in well-communicated plans , commitment to central bank autonomy and low inflation , and striking a thoughtful balance between under- and over-regulation of the financial sector . 
Externally , major trading partners and holders of advanced-country assets can support rebalancing by agreeing to avoid sudden and potentially destabilizing shifts in the composition of their balance sheets . 
So , two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world &apos;s economic agenda in the months ahead . 
The first is re-regulation of advanced countries financial systems with a view to ensuring greater stability without impairing essential functions or unnecessarily elevating the cost of capital . 
The second is a set of understandings and commitments among the major advanced and developing countries to rebalance the global economy in order to restore aggregate demand and growth . 
If that can be accomplished , the world will have taken a major step toward a relatively smooth , effective , and equitable global economic recovery .
