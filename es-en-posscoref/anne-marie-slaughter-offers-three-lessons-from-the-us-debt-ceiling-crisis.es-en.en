Post-Shutdown America 
WASHINGTON , DC - After 16 days of closed museums , half-empty federal buildings , unnaturally quiet streets , and tens of thousands of workers left in existential limbo , the lights are back on in Washington . 
But , while the shutdown of the United States government , initiated by radical congressional Republicans seeking to block implementation of President Barack Obama &apos;s health-care legislation , is over - at least for now - three enduring lessons have emerged . 
First , the next time the eurozone crisis flares up , the US will simply have to bite its tongue ; after all , the shutdown spectacle revealed pathologies no less severe than those that have characterized the European Union &apos;s economic and political negotiations over the past five years . 
Irresponsible behavior threatening the health of the global economy ? 
Check . 
Political posturing and outlandish claims foreclosing any possibility of compromise ? 
Check . 
Breathtaking brinkmanship and 11th-hour decision-making leaving all bystanders wondering whether this time the cart might in fact go over the cliff ? 
Check . 
Few countries in recent years have been spared the pain of their domestic political spectacles being broadcast around the world . 
The United Kingdom had mass riots in London just two summers ago ; strikes and demonstrations have paralyzed Paris on a regular basis ; 
Greece has a rising fascist party ; 
Mexico City has been practically shut down by teachers occupying the central square ; and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan resorted to violence in June to quell weeks of protests against his increasingly autocratic ways . 
Among non-democracies , China had the Bo Xilai scandal , which was worthy of a spy novel , with illicit affairs , rampant corruption , murder , and a senior police official &apos;s dramatic quest for asylum in a US consulate . 
Against this backdrop , the US government shutdown looks a little different . 
Yes , it was a clear symptom of deep political dysfunction , stemming from the politicized demarcation of electoral districts and the distorting effects of America &apos;s campaign-finance system . 
Nonetheless , it is noteworthy that the entire crisis played out according to constitutional rules . 
Indeed , as the deadline for raising the debt ceiling neared , Henry Aaron , a distinguished senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , pointed out that the US Constitution requires the president &quot; to spend what Congress has instructed him to spend , to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized him to impose , and to borrow no more than Congress authorizes . &quot; 
Honoring all three of those legal obligations simultaneously is impossible if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling , but raising the debt ceiling without Congressional approval , though illegal and an impeachable offense , was the least-bad choice . 
Even in the face of deeper political polarization than the US has seen in many decades ( and , in many places , a visceral hatred of the country &apos;s first African-American president ) , Americans and their politicians understand that breaking the rules means dissolving the constitutional glue that holds the polity together . 
This understanding means that the cure for the current dysfunction will be found at the ballot box rather than in the streets . 
And it is this collective commitment to the law governing how political power can be exercised that is the essence of liberal democracy . 
But Americans are in no mood to celebrate . 
Indeed , the second conclusion to be drawn from the US government shutdown is the virtual disappearance of American triumphalism . 
Chest-thumping exceptionalism has given way to a more sober patriotism , in which ordinary citizens recognize the long-term trends eroding the promise of equal opportunity , particularly the shortcomings that beset the country &apos;s health-care , education , and infrastructure systems . 
The anger of Tea Party Republicans ( like the anger of Occupy Wall Street protesters ) reflects a sense that nothing but dramatic , even revolutionary , measures can change the system . 
In response , however , more pragmatic voters are increasingly irate about political paralysis and their governing institutions &quot; inability to respond to the preferences of a clear majority of the population . 
In the midst of the shutdown , the Republican Party &apos;s popular approval rating sank to barely a quarter of the national electorate , a historic low , while the approval rating for Congress as a whole stood at just 5 % . 
The final lesson of the shutdown is that political systems of every kind benefit from the addition of women . 
Many commented on the critical role played by six women senators - Republicans and Democrats - in reaching the compromises needed to end the crisis . 
These women have maintained relationships with one another across the partisan divide , while those among their male colleagues have steadily deteriorated , giving way to competitive grandstanding and vituperation . 
Equally important , these women felt - and acted upon - the moral necessity of actually governing . 
In the words of Senator Susan Collins , a Republican from Maine who first put together the outlines of a deal and took it to the Senate floor , the shutdown &quot; hurt all the small businesses &quot; around Acadia National Park in her home state , &quot; and that is plain wrong . &quot; 
The world should note . 
Women are not necessarily better than men at governing , but they often have different perspectives and habits of engagement that can be essential for cutting through the standoffs created by the need to defend male egos . 
They are also often more focused on the plight of actual people than on the promotion of grand principles , preferring concrete progress to abstract victory . 
From parliaments to peace negotiations , adding women improves outcomes . 
The US government is back at work , for now . 
Negotiations for a real budget that all sides can live with are beginning . 
And assessments of how the shutdown will affect the Republican Party &apos;s fortunes in the 2014 midterm elections are rife . 
But the country &apos;s social and economic divisions will ultimately find political solutions , through elections and the efforts of millions of Americans to achieve fundamental reforms . 
As frustrating and embarrassing as the last several weeks have been , it could have been much worse .
