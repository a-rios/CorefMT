Remembering Robert McNamara 
NEW YORK - I first met Robert McNamara , the US Secretary of Defense who presided over the American buildup in Vietnam , in the summer of 1967 . 
I had just returned from a trip to South Vietnam , where , as a reporter for The New Yorker , I witnessed the destruction , by American air power , of two provinces , Quang Ngai and Quang Tinh . 
America &apos;s policies were clear . 
Leaflets dropped on villages announced , &quot; The Vietcong hide among innocent women and children in your villages .... If the Vietcong in this area use you or your village for this purpose , you can expect death from the sky . &quot; 
Death from the sky came . 
Afterward , more leaflets were dropped , informing villagers , &quot; Your village was bombed because you harbored Vietcong .... Your village will be bombed again if you harbor the Vietcong in any way . &quot; 
In Quang Ngai province , some 70 % of villages were destroyed . 
I was 23 years old at the time , and had no notion of what a war crime was ; but later it became clear that that was what I was witnessing . 
( Five months later , in March of 1968 , American troops committed the massacre at My Lai . ) 
The familiar figure with the glinting , rimless glasses and the rigid hair forced back , as if it were spun glass , greeted me at the door of his seemingly tennis court-size office . 
I felt a prodigious , restless energy that I suspected he could not turn off if he wanted to . Soon after I began to recount my observations , he took me to a map of Vietnam and asked me to locate the areas of destruction . 
I felt that the request was a test - one that I was prepared to take , as I had carried maps with me in the forward air-control planes . 
He seemed deeply engaged , but made no comment , asking me only if I had anything in writing . 
I said that I did , but that it was in longhand . 
He suggested that I produce a typed copy , and provided me with the office of a general who was away . 
What he did not know was that the article was book-length . 
It took three days to dictate it into the general &apos;s Dictaphone . 
I handed the finished project to McNamara , who thanked me , but said nothing further about the matter , either then or at any time thereafter . 
Fifteen years later , in 1982 , when Neil Sheehan was researching his book about the war , A Bright and Shining Lie , he came across documents concerning my Pentagon-assisted manuscript . 
They showed that McNamara had sent the manuscript to the American Ambassador in South Vietnam , Ellsworth Bunker , who requested a certain Bob Kelly to write an overall report , with a view to discrediting my reporting , and arranged to get The Atlantic magazine ( where Bunker mistakenly thought my article was scheduled to appear ) to &quot; withhold publication . &quot; 
A memo recommending these steps was circulated to McNamara , Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach , and Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy . 
The &quot; action &quot; officer was Secretary of State Dean Rusk . 
The forward air-control pilots , were re-interviewed , and affidavits were taken . 
Two civilian pilots were dispatched to fly over the province and check my calculations of the damage . 
Plans were considered to publicly rebut my findings . 
Perhaps frustrated by his failure to find factual errors in my reporting , the author of the report offered some editorial comments that epitomized the flawed thinking on which the war rested . 
I had been unaware , he thought , of some extenuating factors for the destruction I witnessed . 
I had not known , he thought , that &quot; The population is totally hostile ... &quot; Indeed , in the eyes of the Viet Cong , &quot; the Viet Cong are the people . &quot; 
Thus , the main reason for not fighting the war in the first place , namely the perfectly obvious hatred of the majority of the population for the American invasion and occupation , became a justification for the war . 
When I next spoke at length with McNamara , in 1998 , it was not about Vietnam but about nuclear arms , on which we agreed as much as we had disagreed about Vietnam . 
We both believed that the only sensible thing to do with the bomb was to get rid of it . 
McNamara &apos;s turnabout on this issue was dramatic . 
More than any other government official , he was responsible for institutionalizing the key strategic doctrine of the nuclear age , deterrence , otherwise known as mutual assured destruction . 
Now he wanted to dispense with it . 
Many of McNamara &apos;s critics assert - rightly , I think - that he stopped short of full understanding , that he sought to hold fast to claims of noble intentions that the record could not sustain . 
How noble are intentions when the facts showing their horrific results are readily at hand yet overlooked ? 
Should McNamara have been more forthcoming in his regrets ? 
He should . 
Should he have expressed them earlier ? 
Certainly . 
Should he never have recommended the war , or presided over it in the first place , and should there never been an American war in Vietnam ? 
Oh lord , yes . 
The twentieth century left heaps of corpses in its wake , and now they are piling up again . 
I can name only one : Robert McNamara . 
In the unlikely event that a statue of him is ever unveiled , let it show him weeping . 
That was the best of him .
