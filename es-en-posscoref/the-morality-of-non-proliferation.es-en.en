The Morality of Non-Proliferation 
Nearly all the world &apos;s nations are meeting in New York to review the Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
The NPT was negotiated in the 1960 &quot; s after five countries ( the United States , the Soviet Union , Britain , France , and China ) developed nuclear weapons . 
India , Pakistan , and Israel refused to join the treaty and , over time , constructed their own atomic bombs . 
Now North Korea and Iran stand accused of violating their treaty commitments by pursuing nuclear weapons . 
Aside from the legal issues , is there a moral case for non-proliferation ? 
In a world of sovereign states , is it hypocritical for some to have nuclear weapons and deny them to others ? 
If no one had the bomb today , it would be best if it were not invented . 
But history depends on the paths that were taken in the past . 
Suppose it were 1939 , and states were debating whether the US should invent the bomb . 
They might have argued that all should get it or none . 
But if they knew that Hitler &apos;s Germany would get it , they might have approved Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s decision to develop it before the Nazis . 
Besides , turning back the clock is impossible . 
Even if all countries agree to disarm , some might cheat . 
The successful cheaters would most likely be authoritarian states with little transparency . 
After all , North Korea says that it has developed nuclear weapons despite having signed the NPT . 
Libya was also a party to the NPT while it pursued a covert nuclear program . 
If one regards impartiality and attention to consequences as essential to morality , one could imagine countries accepting the morality of unequal possession of nuclear weapons if certain conditions were met . 
For example , the purposes should be limited to self- defense . 
States possessing weapons should take special steps to reduce the prospect of their use . 
The weapons should be used to help preserve the independence of all states , rather than for imperial aggrandizement , and steps should be taken to reduce arsenals as political conditions permit . 
Today &apos;s NPT comes close to reflecting such conditions . 
Of course , the NPT does not rest solely on moral arguments , but primarily on self-interest and prudence . 
Most states adhere because they believe that their security would be diminished if more states obtained nuclear weapons . 
The treaty helps them to reduce fears of cheating by neighbors because it provides for inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
The credibility of American security guarantees for its allies is one of the reasons that the bomb did not spread to 25 countries within a decade , as President John F. Kennedy once expected . 
Non-proliferation is not hypocritical if it is based on an impartial and realistic estimation of risks . 
Perhaps , if the risks were borne solely by its own people , but they are not . 
Third parties are justified in rejecting the risks that would be imposed upon them . 
The history of proliferation shows that political chain reactions often occur - witness China , India , and Pakistan - and there are real fears that North Korea and Iran might trigger such chains in Northeast Asia and the Middle East . 
Some people argue that nuclear proliferation will actually reduce risks . 
Call it the &quot; porcupine theory . &quot; 
In such a prickly world , no country would dare aggression . 
But this assumes perfect rationality . 
In the real world , accidents occur , so more proliferation means a greater chance of eventual inadvertent use , weaker capacity in managing nuclear crises , and greater difficulty in establishing controls and reducing the role of nuclear weapons in world politics . 
In addition , the more states possess nuclear weapons , the greater the prospects that terrorists will gain access to them . 
Of course , transnational terrorists usually have no &quot; return address &quot; that allows the threat of mutual deterrence to work , but North Korea or Iran has no moral right to impose this risk upon others . 
Three European Union countries - Britain , France , and Germany - are trying to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear enrichment program , which would give it bomb material to use after a quick withdrawal from the treaty . 
Iran claims a right to enrichment under Article 4 of the NPT , but that article has to be read in light of the other articles and of Iran &apos;s past deception vis-Ã -vis the IAEA . 
In East Asia , North Korea withdrew from the NPT after using it to disguise its weapons program , and China , America , Japan , Russia , and South Korea are trying to persuade Kim Jong Il &apos;s regime to reverse course . 
It seems right for these states to use pressure to dissuade Iran and North Korea from imposing new risks on the world . 
But the existing nuclear weapons states also must be mindful of the moral conditions that underlie the NPT bargain . 
The obligation under Article 6 to reduce arsenals cannot be interpreted to require prompt disarmament unless that would enhance stability . 
Such conditions do not yet exist in a world where undemocratic states cheat on legal obligations . 
But the nuclear weapons states should continue to reduce the role of nuclear weapons , and refrain from new programs that suggest the prospect of their use . 
Given the dangers that increased risks imply for everyone , there is a strong moral case for a policy of stopping further proliferation rather than arguing that Iran or North Korea have a right to do whatever they wish as sovereign states . 
But it is also important to remember that obligations of non-proliferation bind nuclear weapons states as well .
