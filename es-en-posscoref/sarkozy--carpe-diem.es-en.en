Sarkozy , Carpe Diem ! 
Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s presidential election triumph in May , and now the victory of his party , the UMP , in the parliamentary election , has created the most favorable opportunity in decades for deep structural reform in France . 
Not only did Sarkozy win the presidency with 53 % of the vote , but his approval rating has since soared , to 62 % , after he formed an inclusive government with high-ranking recruits from the opposition . 
In the first round of the parliamentary election , the UMP won a record-high 40 % of the vote . 
While voters denied the UMP a landslide victory in the second round , its overall win meant that the governing party retained its legislative majority for the first time in 29 years . 
In the days following his election , Sarkozy brought France &quot; back to Europe , &quot; reinvigorating the Franco-German partnership and giving decisive support to German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s campaign to revive the European Union &apos;s draft constitutional treaty . 
He demonstrated pragmatism by not vetoing ongoing EU accession negotiations with Turkey , thus avoiding unnecessary confrontation with Great Britain and Spain , despite maintaining his long-term opposition to full membership for Turkey . 
Likewise , his government &apos;s discreet silence in the wake of the European Central Bank &apos;s latest interest rate increase constitutes eloquent recognition of the ECB &apos;s independence . 
But how will Sarkozy and his government respond to France &apos;s internal challenges ? 
With anemic growth , unemployment stuck between 9 % and 10 % for more than 20 years , and immigrant ghettos that vacillate between lawlessness and despair , France is indeed one of the sick men of Europe . 
Where adaptation to ruthless international competition and rapid technological change calls for flexibility and individual responsibility , the dominant culture in France continues to be one of assistance and entitlement . 
It is now clear that the French government will follow Sarkozy &apos;s presidential program to the letter . 
The program &apos;s flagship measure is the wholesale exemption of overtime hours from social security and income taxes . 
Many economists and some foreign observers are puzzled by the emphasis Sarkozy has placed on this expensive provision . 
Indeed , it might appear disproportionate to give higher priority to encouraging overtime than to stimulating employment . 
But France is not a normal country . 
For ten years , it has struggled with the costs of a mandatory 35-hour week - a ceiling that is now so embedded in the legislation regulating working hours that simple abrogation would lead to chaos . 
The alternative , a targeted tax holiday , constitutes a welcome break with the culture of &quot; time off , &quot; and an encouragement to those who , as Sarkozy &apos;s campaign slogan put it , want to &quot; work more in order to earn more . &quot; 
The program &apos;s other measures are a series of tax cuts for the middle class , entrepreneurs , and the wealthy , which , though expensive , constitute a similarly welcome break with France &apos;s tradition of punitive taxation . 
However , none of these measures goes to the heart of France &apos;s structural problems . 
The Gordian knot paralyzing initiative and blocking employment consists in the maze of regulations that stifle the labor market . 
French companies live under the constant threat of a surprise visit from the labor inspector to determine compliance with a thick book of arcane measures . 
Worse yet , the knowledge that some law or regulation covers every aspect of employment poisons the workplace and discourages attempts to resolve problems pragmatically . 
When both parties to a dispute know that they are likely to end in a labor court , neither has an incentive to compromise . 
The law &apos;s most onerous provisions are those regulating the terms of employment contracts , for they condemn employers who decide to close a plant to a marathon of legal proceedings of uncertain duration and unpredictable outcome . 
A stop-gap measure that permits firms to hire workers for temporary assignments , on condition that they not be renewed , condemns the least skilled to a demoralizing cycle of short-term jobs and repeated spells of unemployment . 
These marginal workers are predominantly immigrants and the children and grandchildren of former immigrants , whose social and economic integration is thus blocked , trapping them in increasingly violent suburban ghettoes . 
There is a simple , if radical , solution : abrogate the legal provisions that regulate the duration of employment contracts , and return the treatment of tenure and seniority to collective bargaining , as is the case elsewhere . 
The logical complement of such freedom would be to make employers pay for the social costs of plant closings , by levying a tax on layoffs , which would increase with seniority . 
The proceeds of the tax could be used in part to fund the much needed expansion of France &apos;s underdeveloped public job placement services . 
Unfortunately , Sarkozy &apos;s program in this critical area is vague . 
Job protection benefits the employed at the expense of the unemployed , and some unions , notably the most militant , are strongly opposed to greater flexibility , and have already threatened to block liberalizing measures in the streets . 
The pragmatic course , therefore , was to set general objectives during the campaign , and , after the elections , to encourage the unions to make the first proposals . 
Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon has called for tripartite negotiations on tenure and seniority this summer and fall . 
Will the government settle for marginal changes to the existing labor code , or will it seize its unique opportunity to break with a generation of stifling regulations ? 
The future of the French economy , the stability of French society , and the influence of France in the world hangs on the outcome .
