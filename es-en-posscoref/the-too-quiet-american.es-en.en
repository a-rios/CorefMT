The Too-Quiet American 
NEW YORK - It is now apparent that the United States is the main culprit in preventing the ten-year-old multilateral trade negotiations known as the Doha Round from being closed this year . 
The US has even spurned World Trade Organization Director General Pascal Lamy &apos;s desperate attempt to get member states to support a wholly emasculated agreement - described by critics as Doha Lite and Decaffeinated - which is mainly confined to some concessions to the least-developed countries . 
While there are bit players who could be cast as villains , America &apos;s ambassador to the WTO , Michael Punke , has assumed the role of global trade &apos;s Mr. No . 
America &apos;s rejectionist stance comes from the top of the US government , starting with President Barack Obama &apos;s lack of leadership . 
From the outset of his presidency , Obama &apos;s defense of a liberal trade regime has been inadequate . 
He has said repeatedly that exports are good for the US : they create jobs . 
He needs to remind Americans that imports are also good : he can surely ask his audience to think of jobs in the UPS cargo planes , freight trains , and trucks that carry imports into the American interior . 
The main problem , however , is that Obama has been unable to confront , and put to rest , US labor unions &quot; fear-driven hostility to trade . 
Nor has he been willing to confront the business lobbies that are willing to hold the Doha Round hostage in order to extract ever more concessions by other countries , even though they know that the trade talks are about to be sucked into the Bermuda Triangle of the 2012 US presidential election . 
Yet there is little in the opposition by fearful unions and greedy business lobbies that Obama could not beat back with compelling arguments . 
Besides , as the respected polling analyst Karlyn Bowman recently demonstrated , the US public is by no means strongly opposed to trade . 
Protectionism may , in fact , be an electoral dinosaur . 
In any event , history &apos;s great statesmen have always earned their spurs by bucking the political odds for a matter of principle . 
If Obama actually wrote less and read more , he would find at least two historical episodes of courageous leadership on trade that are worthy of his admiration and emulation . 
One is the repeal of England &apos;s Corn Laws by Prime Minister Robert Peel in 1848 . 
In the critical vote for repeal that brought his political career to an end , Peel won only 106 votes from his Conservative Party , while 222 Tory MPs opposed him . 
He carried the day , but he lost the support of his party . 
As Lord Ashley observed in his diary : &quot; &#91; Peel &#93; led the Tories and followed the Whigs . &quot; 
The other example is Winston Churchill , who was elected as a Conservative member of Parliament from the northern industrial town of Oldham . 
After converting to free trade in 1904 , he had to leave the party . 
He then joined the Liberal Party , accepting the invitation of the Liberal Association of Northwest Manchester . 
Churchill was also for free immigration , and firmly opposed the proposed Aliens Bill of 1904 ( partly because he saw traces of anti-Semitism in the fear , prompted by an influx of East European Jewish immigrants , of an &quot; alien invasion &quot; ) . 
Churchill was a politician of principle who , like Peel , fought against his own party and , unlike Peel , survived to go on to yet greater political triumph , in the epic battle against the Nazis . 
These &quot; profiles in courage , &quot; to borrow John F. Kennedy &apos;s famous phrase , ought to inspire Obama at a time when Presidential leadership is a crying need in Washington on critical economic issues . 
Obama campaigned on the slogan &quot; Yes , we can , &quot; not &quot; Yes , we can , but we won &apos;t . &quot; 
As he watches an American economy assailed by economic ignorance , I have a new and better catchphrase for him : Nec aspera terrent , or &quot; Difficulties be damned . &quot;
