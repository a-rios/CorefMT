A Nuclear South Korea ? 
SEOUL - South Korean officials have recently realized that the United States is likely to try to forbid them from enriching uranium and expanding their country &apos;s missile range , rather than leave these issues on the diplomatic back burner . 
Indeed , recent discreet talks , in which the US has disregarded South Korean efforts to supplement the controversial US-South Korea Nuclear Cooperation Agreement , which expires in March 2014 , suggest that there are reasons to be deeply worried about the alliance &apos;s future . 
American negotiators - the reluctant midwives of South Korea &apos;s increasing responsibility in the field of atomic energy - remain steadfast in their opposition to South Korea &apos;s drive for improved defensive capabilities and a more advanced energy policy , despite the potential strategic benefits . 
But American nonproliferation experts do not anticipate progress on South Korea &apos;s efforts to win support for its preferred policies until the US gains more leverage . 
Such a stalemate is not new . 
Nuclear talks between the two countries have often been characterized by poor communication and a lack of understanding . 
While South Korean officials rarely say in public what they really think , it is widely believed that US policymakers have little motivation to reconcile with South Korea &apos;s government right now - they would prefer to stifle South Korea &apos;s increasingly loud demands . 
In the US-South Korea relationship &apos;s heyday , American politicians considered the country an &quot; extended arm of America . &quot; 
Such condescension may have been defensible when South Korea &apos;s military dictatorship needed America &apos;s political protection and security guarantee , but now the country is a beacon of democracy in East Asia . 
So , while South Koreans understand the need for compromise and cooperation , they believe that the time is right for a more balanced partnership . 
This belief does not imply South Korean cynicism about nonproliferation . 
Rather , it reflects concern about a nuclear North Korea , compounded by anxiety over the recent US-Japan missile-defense accord . 
Given that the US and South Korea have the same assessment of the intelligence regarding North Korea &apos;s nuclear progress , not to mention South Korea &apos;s vulnerability , their failure to reach a practical agreement is troubling . 
Former Deputy Foreign Minister Chun Yung-woo warned an American official in 2010 that revising the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement could soon become a &quot; defining issue &quot; in South Korea-US relations , and that it was already attracting &quot; significant amounts of negative press attention . &quot; 
Given South Korea &apos;s status as one of the world &apos;s top five nuclear-power producers , Chun argued , the South Korean public would not tolerate the perception that Japan was receiving preferential treatment . 
Indeed , right-wing leaders like Representative Chung Mong-joon of the governing Saenuri Party have been vocal in expressing their doubts about South Korea &apos;s current denuclearization policy , suggesting that a nuclear weapons program could prevent a second war on the peninsula . 
The conservatives seem to believe that American nuclear protection for South Korea is a thing of the past . 
Despite their hawkish approach to North Korea &apos;s nuclear threats , South Korean officials know that uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing remains only a distant possibility . 
As a result , they are approaching negotiations skeptically , rather than emphasizing the sense of mutual obligation that should characterize the alliance . 
But their pessimism is hardly groundless , given that the United Arab Emirates has already signed a similar agreement with the US declaring that it would not produce nuclear fuel . 
Indeed , South Korean negotiators appear convinced that they will not be able to make any headway with the US on the issue . 
( To be sure , this failure may not matter much , given South Korean scientists &quot; past declaration that they will not contribute to any nuclear program that could be used for military purposes . ) 
The US-South Korea debate over nuclear weapons should show both sides that their 59-year-old alliance urgently needs to be updated . 
Together , the allies can improve global prospects for nuclear nonproliferation , but only if they hammer out a grand bargain that accounts for South Korea &apos;s current - and future - security concerns .
