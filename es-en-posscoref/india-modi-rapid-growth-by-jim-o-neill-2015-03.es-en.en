Realizing the Indian Dream 
NEW DELHI - It is not often that I get to wear two hats at once . 
But that is exactly what happened earlier this month , when I spent a few days in New Delhi . 
I was in India primarily as part of my current role as Chairman of a review for the British prime minister on anti-microbial resistance ( AMR ) . 
But my visit coincided with the presentation of India &apos;s 2015-2016 budget , the first under Prime Minister Narendra Modi . 
Given some of my other interests and experiences , I found what was presented to be very interesting . 
Following recent revisions to its GDP figures , India &apos;s economy has recently grown - in real terms - slightly faster than China &apos;s . 
A key feature of my research into the BRIC economies ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) more than ten years ago was that at some point during this decade , India would start to grow faster than China and continue to do so for dozens of years . 
The reasoning is straightforward . 
India &apos;s demographics are considerably better than China &apos;s , and the size and growth rate of a country &apos;s workforce is one of the two key factors that drive long-term economic performance - the other being productivity . 
Between now and 2030 , the growth rate of India &apos;s workforce will add as much to the existing stock of labor as continental Europe &apos;s four largest economies put together . 
India is less urbanized than China , and it is in the early stages of benefiting from the virtuous forces that normally accompany that process . 
But there is a catch . 
When it comes to productivity , India has been a laggard . 
Unless it finds a way to improve , the country &apos;s demographic profile could become a burden rather than a benefit . 
In this regard , Modi &apos;s first full budget did not include anything dramatic . 
But if a number of initiatives are successfully implemented , the economy should receive a real boost . 
Indeed , the budget &apos;s main feature is its commitment to investments in public-sector infrastructure , even at the expense of raising next year &apos;s deficit from 3.6 % to 3.9 % of GDP . 
I have argued for several years that India should emphasize investment spending , so I welcome this shift . 
The budget also includes a number of other helpful measures , such as the reduction of the corporate-tax rate and efforts to improve the business environment . 
My visits as chairman of the AMR review also allowed me to witness some encouraging signs . 
In my book The Growth Map , I describe my unforgettable first visit to Gurgaon , a municipality near Delhi that serves as a regional financial and industrial hub . 
Gurgaon is home to a lot of high-flying technology firms , and on this trip I visited one of India &apos;s leading diagnostics companies , SRL Diagnostic , which is developing tools that could improve the use of antibiotics . 
The last time I made the trip from the Oberoi hotel in New Delhi to Gurgaon , it took well over 2.5 hours to travel the 30 kilometers . 
Though a new freeway was under construction , the building site was full of cars and animals . 
As a result , traffic was in a state of chaos , and it was impossible for any roadwork to be done . 
I had always promised myself that the next time I took the trip , I would somehow repeat the exact journey . 
I am pleased to say that the drive now takes less than an hour and the experience was much less dramatic . 
Moreover , the hotel car that made the journey provided free Wi-Fi - the first time I have come across this anywhere in the world . 
It is probably too early to say with certainty that India will soon take its place as the world &apos;s third largest economy , behind China and the United States . 
But , given that India &apos;s investment climate seems to be improving , that moment might not be too far away . 
By 2017 , India could surpass Italy and Brazil to become the world &apos;s seventh largest economy ; by 2020 , there is a reasonable chance that it will overtake France and the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest . 
Overtaking Germany and Japan , however , will require bolder steps , especially regarding education , health , and economic policy . 
India will need to improve its education system dramatically , both at the secondary and tertiary level , and make similarly large advances in basic sanitation ( not to mention implementing my review &apos;s recommendations for combating AMR ) . 
These developments , along with a more stable framework for monetary and fiscal policy , could lead to the type of double-digit growth that China has enjoyed for the past three decades . 
It is up to India &apos;s policymakers to realize this ambition .
