Peace Process or Real Peace ? 
RAMALLAH - Direct talks between Palestinian and Israeli leaders are the most obvious way to achieve peace in the Middle East conflict . 
But history has shown time and again that a high-profile peace process alone is no recipe for success . 
The Arab League is set to meet later this month to advise the Palestinian leadership whether or not to engage in direct talks with Israel . 
Palestinian officials say that there is no use in holding direct talks that are nothing more than a photo opportunity intended to create the impression of a peace process while avoiding any substantive commitments . 
For Palestinians , the first step in real peace talks must include some accord on the basic issues of borders and security . 
The Palestinians have presented to their Israeli counterparts ( through the Americans ) a written offer that includes giving up lands occupied by Israel in 1967 and now populated by Israeli settlers . 
These lands would be swapped for other lands equal in size and importance . 
Israel has yet to produce a single written document outlining its position on the territory that will become a Palestinian state alongside Israel . 
Israel insists that any serious progress will happen only if both sides can sit at the negotiating table face to face . 
According to this view , Netanyahu &apos;s right-wing coalition might be persuaded to accept the continuation of the partial settlement freeze , but only if the Israeli public sees President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu publicly engaged in negotiations . 
But the history of such negotiations tells a much different story . 
All successful efforts in the Middle East conflict have not occurred in front of cameras and through publicly declared direct talks . 
The visit to Jerusalem of Egypt &apos;s then-President Anwar el-Sadat , and the ensuing Egypt-Israel breakthrough at Camp David , took place only after successful behind-the-scenes understandings . 
The public Madrid talks failed to bring about any breakthroughs , whereas the much more secretive Oslo channel brought about the PLO-Israel agreement . 
Even some of the most explosive situations on the ground between Israel and its northern neighbors have been defused as a result of understandings that often included neutral third parties . 
Former United States senator George Mitchell represents a relatively neutral third party supervising the current talks . 
These &quot; proximity talks &quot; allow Mitchell to ensure that each side is making serious offers . 
If the proximity talks are replaced with direct talks in which the US is not physically inside the negotiating room , there is no guarantee that the stronger partner will not try to bully the weaker one . 
Direct talks also have some well-known liabilities . 
Failed direct talks have often led to a spike in violence . 
Neither side , nor the rest of the world , wants that . 
When former US president Bill Clinton tried to set up the second Camp David summit , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hesitated . 
He felt that the situation was not right for direct talks . 
What worried Arafat was the possibility of failure and the potential of a blame game if the talks didn &apos;t produce the desired goal . 
Clinton , who was embroiled in domestic problems , badly needed an international success , and assured Arafat that fingers would not be pointed at either party if the talks failed . 
But no sooner had the parties left Washington after the talks broke down than Clinton joined Israel &apos;s then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak in blaming the Palestinians . 
That failure , and the emotional responses from both sides as to what was or was not offered in the talks , helped spark the violence which led to the second intifada in the winter of 2000 . 
To his credit , Clinton and his staff decided , despite the violence , to make one last attempt in Taba , Egypt late in his presidency . 
That effort is said to have been the closest the two parties have ever been to a breakthrough . 
It would be helpful if the Taba understanding or the more recent efforts by Abbas and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert could become the basis for direct talks . 
The Netanyahu government has refused to agree to any such clear reference point before talks begin . 
The Israelis want talks without conditions , even though Netanyahu has imposed his own condition on the Palestinians : recognition of Israel as a Jewish state , and acceptance of a demilitarized Palestinian state that does not include Jerusalem and the Jordan valley . 
Every expert on the Middle East agrees that the best avenue to a serious breakthrough in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations is quiet , behind-the-scenes negotiations . 
The biggest stumbling block for any successful conclusion is the public on both sides , so the more the public is kept out of the day-to-day talks , the better . 
Of course , the public can and should be included through a national referendum in assessing the results once the talks have reached fruition and a comprehensive settlement is reached that both leaders say they can live with . 
But , until that happy day arrives , or at least until the two sides have reached the contours of an agreement , direct talks and photo opportunities should be considered counter-productive . 
After all , Palestinians and Israelis are no longer interested in the peace process . 
They just want peace .
