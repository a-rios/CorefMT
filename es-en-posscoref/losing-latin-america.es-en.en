Losing Latin America 
When is the United States going to wake up to what is happening in Latin America ? 
The growing influence of Venezuela &apos;s leftist president , Hugo Chávez , is casting a dark shadow over the region . 
Some countries - Chile , Columbia , and Costa Rica , for example - remain committed to progressive growth-oriented and democratic regimes . 
But over the past year , allies of Chávez have come to power in countries like Ecuador and Bolivia , and just missed winning in a few others . 
In Mexico , Chávez &apos;s admirer Andrés Manuel López Obrador would have seized the presidency , possibly for life , had he convinced just a quarter percent more Mexicans voters to support him . 
With almost everyone else in the world successfully pursuing more flexible market-oriented economies , why is Latin America veering dangerously in another direction ? 
Is it because some voters do not realize that the region has been enjoying greater economic stability than it has in decades ? 
Is it because they don &apos;t appreciate having single-digit inflation , down from a regional average of more than 300 % 12 years ago ? 
Fortunately , at least half the voters in the region appreciate these improvements ; otherwise , the situation would be far worse . 
Nevertheless , a growing schism between left and right has led to a distressing level of policy paralysis . 
This is nowhere more apparent than in Mexico , the region &apos;s second largest economy after Brazil . 
Despite its enviable location next door to the rich and booming US , Mexico &apos;s growth has ranged from poor to tepid since its economic crisis a decade ago . 
Why hasn &apos;t Mexico benefited more from the 1992 North American Free Trade agreement ? 
Part of the problem is the emergence of China , whose ultra-low wages provide tough competition for Mexico , where wages are merely very low . 
But Mexico &apos;s real obstacle is a political system unable to achieve any consensus on essential economic reforms . 
The new president , Felipe Calderón , has spoken of the need to break up Mexico &apos;s monopolies . 
Where will he start , telephones or tortillas ? 
There is all too much choice . 
Peasants toil inefficiently on tiny plots of land , in a form of disguised unemployment similar to that seen in rural China . 
The state-owned oil company , which accounts for a major chunk of government revenue , is hugely inefficient , and invests far too little in new equipment and technology . 
Crime abounds . 
Worst of all , the election loser , López Obrador , seems willing to throw the country into turmoil rather than accept the constitutional legitimacy of his defeat . 
So how is the US planning to react ? 
By following through on plans to build a 2,000-mile wall across its southern border . 
Brazil , meanwhile , has exhibited commendable political and macroeconomic stability . 
Yet , if Brazil is to enjoy growth above the modest levels of the past few years , the country badly needs to reform its labor laws , open itself more to foreign trade , and improve the quality of its primary education system . 
With Latin America &apos;s two largest economies in a holding pattern on reform , it is that much more difficult for even the region &apos;s high flyers , such as Chile , to achieve escape velocity into a sustained high growth orbit . 
Mind you , even the weak growth of the last few years in Latin America marks the region &apos;s best performance since the 1970 &quot; s , and incomes are actually catching up slowly to those in the US , Europe , and Japan . 
Nevertheless , Latin America remains the slowest growing of any of the world &apos;s developing regions . 
It is not only China and India that are growing faster . 
Even Sub-Saharan Africa , with its wars and famines , has enjoyed more rapid growth in the past few years . 
Does the pied piper of Venezuela offer a fairer and better way to grow ? 
Unfortunately , no . 
Venezuela is merely being pulled along in China &apos;s tailwind thanks to high oil prices . 
When oil prices collapse , as they will at some point over the next few years , Venezuela &apos;s economy will collapse with them . 
Over the long run , commodity exporters need to innovate just as much as manufacturers do in order to maintain profitability . 
With Venezuelan oil production still running far below its level when Chávez took over , there is little doubt about how this story will end . 
In today &apos;s hyper-competitive global economy , there is no reliable &quot; third way &quot; for countries to avoid continued liberalization and market-oriented reforms . 
Instead , the current installment of Latin American socialism is all too likely to produce a re-run of tragic episodes from the past . 
In this context , the US &apos;s inexplicable indifference towards the region is both naïve and dangerous . 
The incoming Democratic US Congress has signaled that free trade deals with Peru and Columbia need to be &quot; renegotiated . &quot; 
What kind of message does that send to the US &apos;s few remaining allies in the region ? 
If Americans don &apos;t start embracing their friends in Latin America , it may take a generation to undo the damage .
