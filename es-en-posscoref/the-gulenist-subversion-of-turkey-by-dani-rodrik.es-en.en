Erdoğan Is Not Turkey &apos;s Only Problem 
PRINCETON - Türkan Saylan was a trailblazing physician , one of Turkey &apos;s first female dermatologists and a leading campaigner against leprosy . 
She was also a staunch secularist who established a foundation to provide scholarships to young girls so they could attend school . 
In 2009 , police raided her house and confiscated documents in an investigation that linked her to an alleged terrorist group , called &quot; Ergenekon , &quot; supposedly bent on destabilizing Turkey in order to precipitate a military coup . 
Saylan was terminally ill with cancer at the time and died shortly thereafter . 
But the case against her associates continued and became part of a vast wave of trials directed against opponents of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his allies in the powerful Gülen movement , made up of the followers of the Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen . 
The evidence in this case , as in so many others , consists of Microsoft Word documents found on a computer that belonged to Saylan &apos;s foundation . 
When American experts recently examined the forensic image of the hard drive , they made a startling - but for Turkey all too familiar - discovery . 
The incriminating files had been placed on the hard drive sometime after the computer &apos;s last use at the foundation . 
Because the computer had been seized by the police , the finding pointed rather directly to official malfeasance . 
Fabricated evidence , secret witnesses , and flights of investigative fancy are the foundation of the show trials that Turkish police and prosecutors have mounted since 2007 . 
In the infamous Sledgehammer case , a military-coup plot was found to contain glaring anachronisms , including the use of Microsoft Office 2007 in documents supposedly last saved in 2003 . 
( My father-in-law is among the more than 300 officers who were locked up , and my wife and I have been active in documenting the case &apos;s fabrications . ) 
The list of revelations and absurdities goes on and on . 
In one case , a document describing a plot directed against Christian minorities turned out to have been in police possession before the authorities claimed to have recovered it from a suspect . 
In another , police &quot; discovered &quot; the evidence that they were seeking , despite going to the wrong address and raiding the home of a naval officer whose name sounded similar to that of the target . 
Yet none of the trials has yet been derailed . 
Most have had the support and blessing of Erdoğan , who has exploited them to discredit the old secular guard and cement his rule . 
Even more important , the trials have had the strong backing of the Gülen movement . 
Gülen lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania , where he presides over a huge informal network of schools , think tanks , businesses , and media across five continents . 
His devotees have established roughly 100 charter schools in the United States alone , and the movement has gained traction in Europe since the first Gülen school was founded in Stuttgart , Germany , in 1995 . 
Back home , Gülen &apos;s followers have created what is effectively a state within the Turkish state , gaining a strong foothold in the police force , the judiciary , and the bureaucracy . 
Gülenists deny that they control the Turkish police , but , as a US ambassador to Turkey put it in 2009 , &quot; we have found no one who disputes it . &quot; 
The movement &apos;s influence within the judiciary ensures that its members &quot; transgressions remain unchallenged . 
In one well-documented case , a non-commissioned officer at a military base , acting on behalf of the Gülen movement , was caught planting documents in order to embarrass military officials . 
The military prosecutor investigating the case soon found himself in jail on trumped-up charges , while the perpetrator was reinstated . 
A senior police commissioner who had been close to the movement and wrote an exposé about its activities was accused of collaborating with the far-left groups that he had spent much of his career pursuing ; he , too , ended up in jail . 
The Gülen movement uses these trials to lock up critics and replace opponents in important state posts . 
The ultimate goal seems to be to reshape Turkish society in the movement &apos;s own conservative-religious image . 
Gülenist media have been particularly active in this cause , spewing a continuous stream of disinformation about defendants in Gülen-mounted trials while covering up police misdeeds . 
But relations between Erdoğan and the Gülenists have soured . 
Once their common enemy , the secularists , were out of the way , Erdoğan had less need for the movement . 
The breaking point came in February 2012 , when Gülenists tried to bring down his intelligence chief , a close confidant , reaching perilously close to Erdoğan himself . 
Erdoğan responded by removing many Gülenists from their positions in the police and judiciary . 
But Erdoğan &apos;s ability to take on the Gülen movement is limited . 
Bugging devices were recently found in Erdoğan &apos;s office , planted , his close associates said , by the police . 
Yet Erdoğan , known for his brash style , responded with remarkable equanimity . 
If he harbored any doubt that the movement sits on troves of embarrassing - and possibly far worse - intelligence , the bugging revelation must surely have removed it . 
The foreign media have focused mainly on Erdoğan &apos;s behavior in recent months . 
But if Turkey has turned into a Kafkaesque quagmire , a republic of dirty tricks and surreal conspiracies , it is Gülenists who must shoulder much of the blame . 
This is worth remembering in view of the movement &apos;s efforts to dress up its current opposition to Erdoğan in the garb of democracy and pluralism . 
Gülenist commentators preach about the rule of law and human rights , even as Gülenist media champion flagrant show trials . 
The movement showcases Fethullah Gülen as a beacon of moderation and tolerance , while his Turkish-language Web site peddles his anti-Semitic , anti-Western sermons . 
Such double talk seems to have become second nature to Gülenist leaders . 
The good news is that the rest of the world has started to see Erdoğan &apos;s republic for what it is : an increasingly authoritarian regime built around a popular but deeply flawed leader . 
Indeed , his government &apos;s crackdown on dissent may well have cost Istanbul the 2020 Olympics . 
What has yet to be recognized is the separate , and quite disturbing , role that the Gülen movement has played in bringing Turkey to its current impasse . 
As Americans and Europeans debate the Gülen movement &apos;s role in their own societies , they should examine Turkey &apos;s experience more closely .
