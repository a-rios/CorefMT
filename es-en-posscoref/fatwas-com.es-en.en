Beheadings online , fatwas online : the subterranean world of Islam &apos;s radical fringe can be found on countless Internet sites . 
These technologically sophisticated fanatics are able to reach a wide audience . 
But that audience exists because of the deep dissatisfaction and anger of so many young Muslims everywhere . 
The Internet has brought together a worldwide community of the alienated and the embittered . 
The West thinks that this anger is a sign of some clash of civilizations : &quot; us &quot; against &quot; them , &quot; which implies that only one side can win . 
But the anger of young Muslims results primarily from revulsion at their corrupt leaders , and the subservience of these rulers to the United States . 
It is a bitterness rooted , in other words , in material causes , not in some fanatical , irrational , and anti-democratic sentiment whose adherents must either be re-educated or crushed . 
The problem starts at the top of Muslim societies , not with the disaffected at the bottom . 
Muslim rulers have mostly failed to satisfy the needs of their populations . 
At the same time , in much of the Muslim world , authoritarian regimes typically attempt to control and propagate exclusionary forms of Islamic dogma . 
For many years , these regimes - whether the Shia of Iran or the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia - succeeded in suppressing pluralism and individuality . 
But , as their regimes increasingly came to be seen as politically illegitimate , their model of Islam was also discredited . 
So the disappointed and disaffected search for an Islam that meets their expectations . 
For the many Web sites that attract these disaffected people , it helps that no central authority exists today for the Muslim umma ( the world community of Islam ) . 
By humiliating , degrading , and outlawing any Islamic tendency that disagreed with the prevailing dogma , authoritarian regimes did not eliminate pluralism , but merely sent it underground . 
Today &apos;s technology allows that underground to speak and meet . 
In the face of repression , Internet Islam appears to speak with authentic authority . 
But Islam has traditionally always been pluralistic and tolerant of differences . 
The Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib said , &quot; Our strength lies in our differences . &quot; 
For over a thousand years , under Mecca &apos;s traditional rulers , the Hashemite descendants of the Prophet Muhammad , all sects debated and exchanged knowledge in the Great Mosque . 
Indeed , prior to Saudi / Wahhabi rule in 1932 , Mecca was cosmopolitan and open . 
Adherents of the four Sunni schools of thought , as well as the Shia , the Zaydis , the Ismaelis , etc . , and those of different origins and races - Indians , Central Asians , Persians , Moroccans , Africans , and Turks - all recognized their differences but could identify with the one source , the Koran . 
But the Wahhabis tried to appropriate Mecca for their own version of Islam , and to export their exclusionary doctrine . 
For a while they succeeded . 
Today , however , we are witnessing the failure of the Wahhabi project to monopolize Islam . 
Fatwas of the type issued by the highest Wahhabi cleric , Bin Baz , such as the notorious one before the first Gulf War declaring the Earth to be flat , have , unsurprisingly , lost their authority and credibility . 
Ignorance , combined with the wider corruption and hypocrisy of the regime , emptied these religious rulings of meaning . 
What has followed is the hijacking of Islam by radical angry men raised on Wahhabi dogma but disillusioned with the world they inherited . 
Fatwas promulgated after Bin Baz are almost always horrendous in their intolerance and virulence , and certainly appear backward and anti-modernist . 
They clash not only with the West , but with the golden age of Islam , when Muslim astronomers , mathematicians , physicians , philosophers , and poets flourished . 
Although the Internet appears to be renewing Islamic pluralism , today &apos;s online fatwas are non-negotiable orders , not a call for fresh creativity . 
Hundreds of websites now compete to be the new Mecca , the place where all devout Muslims turn for guidance . 
The most extreme preach the ideas of Al Qaeda and their ideological brethren . 
These include the haunting celebration of a young man &apos;s imminent martyrdom by suicide bombing , while other websites , although less violent , have widened the scope of sin to include learning English , studying science , and giving women access to the Internet without a male guardian present . 
Fatwas online harbor animosity not only towards the West , but also toward other Muslims . 
Wahhabi clerics , for example , call for jihad against the Shia &quot; heretics &quot; promising the rewards of heaven . 
Most of these fatwas have a violent streak that the Saudi establishment is quick to dismiss as belonging to the Middle Ages . 
The fact is , however , that these fanatics are a modern phenomenon , a creation of the Muslim world &apos;s failed political systems , and a stark reminder of the price of long years of repression . 
Far from disappearing , the repressed are returning from underground in grotesque forms to haunt the world they grew up in . 
No matter how much their countries &quot; rulers try to disown them , they cannot escape their creation . 
Globalization and technology have given the disaffected a new homeland to profess Islam as they see it . 
In that Internet world , no authority has the ability to silence or satisfy them .
