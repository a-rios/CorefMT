China &apos;s Balancing Act 
NEW YORK - China &apos;s slowdown is the biggest short-term threat to global growth . 
Industrial value added fell in August , credit growth has slowed dramatically , and housing prices are falling , with sales down 20 % year on year . 
Given stagnation in the eurozone and Japan &apos;s uncertain prospects , a Chinese hard landing would be a big hit to global demand . 
Much attention is focused on likely GDP growth this year relative to the government &apos;s 7.5 % target . 
But the bigger issue is whether China can rebalance its economy over the next 2-3 years without suffering a financial crisis and / or a dramatic economic slowdown . 
Some factors specific to China make this outcome more likely , but success is by no means certain . 
Faced with the 2008 financial crisis , China unleashed a credit boom to maintain output and employment growth . 
Credit soared from 150 % of GDP in 2008 to 250 % by mid-2014 . 
Multiple forms of shadow bank credit supplemented rapid growth in bank loans . 
The strategy worked , and China continued to create 12-13 million new urban jobs per year . 
But with investment rising from 40 % to 47 % of GDP , growth became dangerously unbalanced and heavily dependent on infrastructure construction and real-estate development . 
Narrowly defined , these activities account for 12 % of Chinese value added . 
In fact , recent research shows that 33 % of China &apos;s economic activity relies on the real-estate sector &apos;s continued health . 
China is now struggling with a dilemma common to all advanced credit booms . 
The longer the boom runs , the greater the danger of wasted investment , huge bad debts , and a major financial crisis . 
But simply constraining new credit supply and allowing bad loans to default can itself provoke crisis and recession . 
This year has been one of seesawing policy responses . 
The discipline of default has been much discussed , but never quite applied . 
Despite a significant slowdown , the People &apos;s Bank of China has resisted across-the-board cuts in interest rates or reserve requirements . 
But , in the second quarter of the year , Premier Li Keqiang reiterated the 7.5 % growth target , which was then underpinned by several &quot; targeted &quot; stimulus measures - mainly new lending focused on railways , smaller banks , agriculture , and small businesses . 
Constraints on the property market , such as limiting multiple purchases or highly leveraged investments , have been tightened and then relaxed . 
At least for now , the arguments for constraint and market discipline appear to have won the debate . 
That may partly reflect a subtle shift in emphasis about the most crucial objective . 
Recent speeches by both Li and policy experts have downplayed the importance of a specific growth target , focusing instead on job creation and low unemployment . 
Fortunately , demographic changes are about to make it easier to rebalance the economy and boost employment enough to avoid social tension . 
The Chinese working-age population is now slowly shrinking . 
More dramatically , the number of 15-30-year-olds will fall 25 % from 2015 to 2025 . 
The rural workforce is still above 300 million , implying that large numbers could still migrate to urban areas . 
But as the rural workforce ages , the pace of migration will slow . 
As a result , China &apos;s labor market will tighten more rapidly than many expect . 
Rising real wages will support the shift to a more consumption-driven economy , and declining worries about unemployment will reduce reliance on credit-fueled construction to soak up labor supply . 
But the huge debts created by the credit boom remain a major problem . 
No other economy has ever experienced such a boom and avoided a financial crisis or major growth setback . 
Optimists often stress two ways in which &quot; China is different . &quot; 
First , many debts involve different arms of the Chinese state - owed , say , by state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and local governments to state-owned banks . 
Second , China &apos;s central government has low debt - only 22 % of GDP at the end of 2013 - and thus significant fiscal firepower . 
With the financial sector facing a large volume of non-performing loans , the government could repeat what it did in the late 1990s , absorbing bad debt and recapitalizing banks , rather than allowing defaults and bank failures to shock the economy into recession . 
But , though China enjoys more room for maneuver than other countries facing similar credit booms , the risks remain serious . 
The bad-loan problem may be most severe among SOEs , but slightly more than half of new business loans since 2010 have been to the private sector , which plays a major role in the troubled property market . 
And when property booms head south , efforts by companies and households to deleverage can undermine growth - even if banks are not allowed to fail . 
A balance-sheet recession does not require a financial crisis . 
The more China achieves its stated objective of &quot; a decisive role for the market , &quot; the less the &quot; China is different &quot; argument applies . 
Interest-rate liberalization would increase borrowing costs for many over-indebted borrowers . 
A no-bailout rule for shadow banking entities would produce losses that hit confidence . 
The more the capital account is opened , the more China &apos;s huge debts will be held by banks and other institutional investors around the world . 
In an economy with inherited debts equal to 250 % of GDP , simply tightening credit supply and imposing market discipline could be a recipe for disaster . 
Instead , China should use direct fiscal stimulus to offset the deflationary effect of declining credit growth and deleveraging . 
And it should clean up its banks &quot; balance sheets through debt write-downs and recapitalization before undertaking full financial liberalization . 
China undoubtedly needs to rebalance its economy and introduce more market discipline in its financial system . 
Demography will give a helping hand with the former challenge . 
But without careful policy design and sequencing , there could be major setbacks along the way .
