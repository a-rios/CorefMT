Why the Greek Bailout Failed 
CAMBRIDGE - As the Greek crisis evolves , it is important to understand that a successful structural-adjustment program requires strong country ownership . 
Even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points , it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the Greek people remain unconvinced . 
And without structural reform , there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth - not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay . 
( This has been the case through most of the crisis , even if one would never know it from the world press coverage . ) 
Greece &apos;s membership in the European Union gives its creditors significant leverage , but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus . 
Greece remains very much a sovereign country , not a sub-sovereign state . 
The &quot; troika &quot; of creditors - the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission - simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over Greece that , say , the Municipal Assistance Corporation wielded over New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s . 
The best structural-adjustment programs are those in which the debtor country &apos;s government proposes the policy changes , and the IMF helps design a bespoke program and provides the political cover for its implementation . 
Imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option . 
So , for reforms to take hold , the Greek government and its electorate must believe in them . 
That a country must take ownership of its reform program is not a new lesson . 
The IMF &apos;s rocky relationship with Ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations . 
Back in 2013 , IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization &apos;s experience in the country . 
If a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments , the report argued , the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented , as is now being done in Greece . 
Unfortunately , that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there . 
Structural-reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions , for better or for worse . 
Left-wing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programs with deep suspicion , accusing international lenders like the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists . 
This critique has some truth in it , but is overblown . 
To be sure , structural reforms often favor policies like labor-market flexibility . 
But one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms . 
Breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers ( as they do in much of southern Europe , including Italy and , to some extent , France ) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers . 
Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier . 
Making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes . 
Recently , opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections - most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero . 
If structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices , it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand . 
But a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy : if it is poorly designed , it will be counter-productive . 
The truth is that the way forward in Europe requires achieving greater productivity . 
The lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailout programs are sobering . 
If a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country &apos;s economic , social , and political model , the best course of action might be to write off the private losses , rather than pour in public money to cover them . 
In cases like Greece , the creditors &quot; passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home - particularly toward improving financial regulation . 
The vast majority of Greeks want to stay in the EU . 
In an ideal world , offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state . 
But given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal , it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely . 
In place of a program providing the country with further loans , it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid - regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone .
