Europe &apos;s Racist Schools 
I am what many people call a &quot; Gypsy . &quot; 
There are more than 10 million of us across Europe . 
The vast majority of us live in Third World conditions - denied access to adequate housing , health care , and education . 
I was born in a provincial town in Bulgaria in the late 1960 &quot; s , when , like the rest of Eastern Europe , the country was under Communist rule . 
The Party recognized no ethnic minorities - we were all , formally , equal . 
Indeed , we were so equal that the government gave many of us new , Bulgarian names . 
One day , when I was a teenager named Husni , my name became Ivan . 
But we were not equal . 
Roma lived in segregated ghettos . 
We were second-class citizens . 
One of my clearest early childhood memories is of my father telling my younger sister and me , &quot; Education is the key to success . &quot; 
He said , &quot; If you want to be accepted as equals by Gadje &#91; non-Roma &#93; , you must be better educated than they are . 
But if you succeed , this will change not only your life but also the lives of many of your people . &quot; 
Education is the only way out of the ghetto for many Roma . 
But in societies like Bulgaria , where racism is rampant , Roma have to fight for equal schooling . 
Most of the children I grew up with received an inferior education that did not train them for university or skilled jobs . 
They are either unemployed or working as unskilled laborers in Bulgaria or in the black market abroad . 
By contrast , in large part because of my father , I managed to complete high school , then medical school , and become a general practitioner . 
By the early 1990 &quot; s , Bulgaria had changed . 
The transition to democracy promised freedom and prosperity to all who had suffered in communism &apos;s stranglehold . 
Yet the Roma found themselves losers of the democratic transformation . 
Their situation , always tenuous , dramatically worsened . 
Their poor schooling left them ill equipped for the new economy . 
The communist dogma was shattered , but so was the pretense that we were all equals in a homogenous society . 
The government allowed employment discrimination to go unchecked , leaving the majority of Roma without jobs , and communities were plunged deeper into poverty . 
I obtained a law degree to help advocate for members of my community . 
Today , I live and work in Brussels , where I lead an organization that advises the European Union and national governments on Roma-related policies . 
I support my family and have achieved fulfillment in my career . 
But I am an exception . 
It is because of the importance of education in making me an exception that I am so deeply troubled by a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights . 
The case was brought by 18 Roma children from the city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who had been assigned to special remedial schools for the &quot; mentally deficient . &quot; 
In Central and Eastern Europe , Roma are often unfairly placed in these special schools , which provide sub-par education that all but guarantees a life of poverty and manual labor . 
I served as one of the lawyers for the children . 
The evidence showed that more than half of the Roma children in Ostrava were placed in special schools , and that more than half of the population of special schools was Roma . 
All told , Roma children in Ostrava are more than 27 times more likely than non-Roma to be placed in such schools . 
This is not a unique situation . 
Far from it . 
The same disproportionate patterns of school assignment exist throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe . 
As a United Nations expert body has declared , this is racial segregation , plain and simple . 
But the Court was unmoved . 
Its judgment recognized that the claimants raised &quot; a number of serious arguments , &quot; and that the education system in Ostrava perpetuated racial segregation . 
But the Court ruled that , absent a showing of actual racial bias in the minds of testers and administrators - virtually impossible to prove - the pervasive reality of racial disadvantage was not unlawful . 
In what could have been a landmark victory that would open the doors of opportunity for Europe &apos;s Roma , the Strasbourg Court instead chose to keep Roma locked out of a decent education . 
Its decision reverberates across the Continent - not just for the Roma , but for all who have a stake in promoting the values of tolerance and equality in a democratic Europe . 
Anyone who believes in the rights of all children to quality education should be troubled by a decision so myopic . 
For decades , racial segregation in European schools has stigmatized generations of Roma children as stupid and disabled . 
The Court &apos;s decision allows this brutal and systematic violation of fundamental rights to continue . 
The Roma , and Europe , have suffered a great defeat .
