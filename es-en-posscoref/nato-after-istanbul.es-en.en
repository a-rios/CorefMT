NATO After Istanbul 
Last week , the heads of state and government of NATO &apos;s 26 member nations gathered in Istanbul for a major summit . 
The symbolism of a city that bridges two continents was especially appropriate . 
In Istanbul , we not only reinforced the alliance &apos;s vital transatlantic link , but also built bridges of cooperation to other regions . 
After the discord over Iraq , the summit demonstrated a new momentum in transatlantic security cooperation , and reinforced NATO &apos;s role as the major instrument for that cooperation . 
The key decisions that we took at the summit make this very clear . 
First , Afghanistan . 
NATO decided in Istanbul to expand its stabilising presence . 
We will increase the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams in order to support the expansion of the central government &apos;s authority and facilitate development and reconstruction . 
We will also provide enhanced support for the forthcoming elections , which are crucial to ensuring long-term peace and stability and making sure that the country will never again become a safe haven for terrorists . 
Second , Iraq . 
At the request of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi , NATO decided to offer to help train Iraqi security forces . 
In addition to our continued support for Poland in its leadership of the multinational division in Iraq , NATO will now play a distinct role in helping Iraq . 
That this decision was taken in conjunction with the transfer of authority to a new Iraqi Government only adds to its significance . 
The Allies affirmed unambiguously that a stable Iraq is in their common interest and that NATO is part of achieving this . 
Training is an area that is critical to Iraq &apos;s stability , and one in which NATO has valuable experience and expertise to share . 
Third , the Balkans . 
While our presence in Kosovo remains unchanged , the much improved security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina allows us to conclude our successful SFOR mission there by the end of this year . 
The European Union will then follow with a mission of its own , and we will support the EU in this endeavor . 
We want to welcome this country , as well as Serbia and Montenegro , into our Partnership for Peace program as soon as they meet the relevant criteria , which include full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . 
Fourth , military transformation . 
The allies decided to accelerate their efforts to equip NATO with the forces and technologies it needs to perform twenty-first century missions , from the Balkans to Afghanistan . 
The NATO Response Force will soon achieve its initial operational capability , and our new Multinational Defense Battalion to deal with chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear threats is already fully operational - all ideas proposed by the United States , and implemented rapidly by the alliance . 
In addition , we endorsed on several measures to strengthen the link between political agreement to commence operations and the provision of the necessary forces , including through usability targets and changes to NATO &apos;s planning processes . 
Fifth , NATO enlargement and partnership . 
Although the Istanbul summit was the first to include NATO &apos;s seven new member countries-Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , Slovakia , and Slovenia-we gave a strong signal that the door remains open , and encouraged those who want to join to continue pursuing the reforms needed to make themselves ready for membership . 
We also launched a new phase in our relations with partner countries : opportunities for more individualized cooperation , a greater emphasis on defense reform , and a stronger focus on the Caucasus and Central Asia . 
Furthermore , we welcomed the interest shown by Russia and Ukraine in contributing to &quot; Active Endeavor , &quot; our anti-terrorist naval operation in the Mediterranean , as another sign of the growing strategic value of our partnership with these countries . 
Finally , the Mediterranean and the broader Middle East . 
NATO decided in Istanbul to reach out to new regions of strategic importance , in particular the broader Middle East . 
No other region &apos;s development will affect our security more profoundly in coming years . 
We need a coherent transatlantic effort to engage this region , and NATO will be part of that effort . 
We agreed to strengthen our Mediterranean Dialogue with seven countries in North Africa and the Middle East and to transform it into a genuine partnership . 
We also launched the &quot; Istanbul Cooperation Initiative , &quot; to offer practical security-related cooperation to countries in the broader Middle East . 
Several members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have already expressed an interest in working together with NATO , so we are off to a good start . 
The NATO Istanbul summit was a strong demonstration of an Atlanticism that looks to the challenges of today and tomorrow and is prepared to tackle security challenges wherever they emerge . 
The summit gave NATO more political and military means to project stability where it matters . 
Most importantly , the summit reaffirmed the role of the transatlantic community of democratic nations and shared values as the most powerful force for shaping our future .
