The Lemmings of QE 
NEW HAVEN - Predictably , the European Central Bank has joined the world &apos;s other major monetary authorities in the greatest experiment in the history of central banking . 
By now , the pattern is all too familiar . 
First , central banks take the conventional policy rate down to the dreaded &quot; zero bound . &quot; 
Facing continued economic weakness , but having run out of conventional tools , they then embrace the unconventional approach of quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
The theory behind this strategy is simple : Unable to cut the price of credit further , central banks shift their focus to expanding its quantity . 
The implicit argument is that this move from price to quantity adjustments is the functional equivalent of additional monetary-policy easing . 
Thus , even at the zero bound of nominal interest rates , it is argued , central banks still have weapons in their arsenal . 
But are those weapons up to the task ? 
For the ECB and the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , both of which are facing formidable downside risks to their economies and aggregate price levels , this is hardly an idle question . 
For the United States , where the ultimate consequences of QE remain to be seen , the answer is just as consequential . 
QE &apos;s impact hinges on the &quot; three Ts &quot; of monetary policy : transmission ( the channels by which monetary policy affects the real economy ) ; traction ( the responsiveness of economies to policy actions ) ; and time consistency ( the unwavering credibility of the authorities &quot; promise to reach specified targets like full employment and price stability ) . 
Notwithstanding financial markets &quot; celebration of QE , not to mention the US Federal Reserve &apos;s hearty self-congratulation , an analysis based on the three Ts should give the ECB pause . 
In terms of transmission , the Fed has focused on the so-called wealth effect . 
First , the balance-sheet expansion of some $ 3.6 trillion since late 2008 - which far exceeded the $ 2.5 trillion in nominal GDP growth over the QE period - boosted asset markets . 
It was assumed that the improvement in investors &quot; portfolio performance - reflected in a more than threefold rise in the S P 500 from its crisis-induced low in March 2009 - would spur a burst of spending by increasingly wealthy consumers . 
The BOJ has used a similar justification for its own policy of quantitative and qualitative easing ( QQE ) . 
The ECB , however , will have a harder time making the case for wealth effects , largely because equity ownership by individuals ( either direct or through their pension accounts ) is far lower in Europe than in the US or Japan . 
For Europe , monetary policy seems more likely to be transmitted through banks , as well as through the currency channel , as a weaker euro - it has fallen some 15 % against the dollar over the last year - boosts exports . 
The real sticking point for QE relates to traction . 
The US , where consumption accounts for the bulk of the shortfall in the post-crisis recovery , is a case in point . 
In an environment of excess debt and inadequate savings , wealth effects have done very little to ameliorate the balance-sheet recession that clobbered US households when the property and credit bubbles burst . 
Indeed , annualized real consumption growth has averaged just 1.3 % since early 2008 . 
With the current recovery in real GDP on a trajectory of 2.3 % annual growth - two percentage points below the norm of past cycles - it is tough to justify the widespread praise of QE . 
Japan &apos;s massive QQE campaign has faced similar traction problems . 
After expanding its balance sheet to nearly 60 % of GDP - double the size of the Fed &apos;s - the BOJ is finding that its campaign to end deflation is increasingly ineffective . 
Japan has lapsed back into recession , and the BOJ has just cut the inflation target for this year from 1.7 % to 1 % . 
Finally , QE also disappoints in terms of time consistency . 
The Fed has long qualified its post-QE normalization strategy with a host of data-dependent conditions pertaining to the state of the economy and / or inflation risks . 
Moreover , it is now relying on ambiguous adjectives to provide guidance to financial markets , having recently shifted from stating that it would maintain low rates for a &quot; considerable &quot; time to pledging to be &quot; patient &quot; in determining when to raise rates . 
But it is the Swiss National Bank , which printed money to prevent excessive appreciation after pegging its currency to the euro in 2011 , that has thrust the sharpest dagger into QE &apos;s heart . 
By unexpectedly abandoning the euro peg on January 15 - just a month after reiterating a commitment to it - the once-disciplined SNB has run roughshod over the credibility requirements of time consistency . 
With the SNB &apos;s assets amounting to nearly 90 % of Switzerland &apos;s GDP , the reversal raises serious questions about both the limits and repercussions of open-ended QE . 
In the QE era , monetary policy has lost any semblance of discipline and coherence . 
As Draghi attempts to deliver on his nearly two-and-a-half-year-old commitment , the limits of his promise - like comparable assurances by the Fed and the BOJ - could become glaringly apparent . 
Like lemmings at the cliff &apos;s edge , central banks seem steeped in denial of the risks they face .
