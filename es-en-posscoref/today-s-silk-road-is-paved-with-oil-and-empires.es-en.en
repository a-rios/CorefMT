Today \ u0027s Silk Road is Paved with Oil and Empires 
MOSCOW : A perverse dialectic is at work in the Transcaucasus . 
The more Russia is accused of neo-imperial ambitions , the weaker Russia &apos;s actual sway becomes . 
All the while , Turkish and American influence grows stronger . 
It is a grave mistake to think of Russia , like the Ottoman Empire of a century ago , as a &quot; sick man of Europe , &quot; incapable of maintaining its strategic and commercial interests , and to regard its traditional allies in the region as available for anyone to poach . 
Indeed , the idea that Russia and the Transcaucasus can be disentangled is nonsense . 
The cat &apos;s cradle of connections between Russia and the Caucasus are centuries old and impossible to cut . 
Russia &apos;s presence runs deeper than the troops it maintains in the area . 
Mixed marriages abound ; 
Oil , unsurprisingly , is at the root of divisions over the Caucasus . 
Westerners seek to redraw the medieval &quot; Silk Road &quot; with air and land routes , railways , and multi-billion dollar pipelines but also with wishful thinking . 
America believes oil can grease the wheels of democracy , insuring independence . 
Turkey sees its growing influence in the region as a card to play in bargaining for EU membership . 
Uncertain governments in the region think oil as a magic bullet with which to buy prosperity and social peace without hard work and risky reforms . 
Georgia and its president Eduard Shevarnadze are perhaps the most guilty of this . 
President Shevardnadze dreamed of a new Silk Road back in the 1980s , when still the USSR &apos;s foreign minister . 
Like most policies of the perestroika era , this was another goal pursued by the Soviet leadership in a way unconnected to economic reality . 
Shevardnadze &apos;s homeland of Georgia was then seen as incomparably wealthy . 
Reality is quite different . 
The Baku-Supsa oil pipeline , for example , brings Georgia less money than mineral water exports to Russia . 
Yet , instead of recognizing this and addressing practical problems , Georgia &apos;s government trumpets supposed new ( and huge ) oil finds , or the proposed Baku-Jeikhan pipeline . 
Sometimes Georgian officials talk as if they are already members of OPEC ! 
Azerbaijan &apos;s illusions of grandeur are easier to understand but just as debilitating . 
Possessing undoubted oil resources , President Haider Aliyev &apos;s government prefers to play games about where to construct oil pipelines rather than commit to actually building one . 
One day it supports the Jeikhan pipeline ( bypassing Russia ) , the next it thinks about building one between Baku and Novorossisk in Russia . 
But any of these pipelines are economically risky , so even if Azerbaijan makes up its mind about whether to build one and where , there is no guarantee that it will make money . 
So , while Baku &apos;s hotels are crammed with oil men , the bankers who must fund construction are harder to find . 
Meanwhile , Aliyev &apos;s government neglects basic economic reforms like privatization and land sales . 
Of course , pipelines should be part of Transcaucasus development plans . 
But oil isn &apos;t everything . 
Oil sales will not help people in the region for many years ; meanwhile , for many people in the ruined economies of the Caucasus , life is no less harsh than in war-torn Chechnya . 
By inciting dreams of oil , America and Turkey may or may not be playing neo-imperial games . 
But whatever their purpose , by raising fanciful hopes they thwart the possibility for real reform - something , incidentally , that the West ceaselessly demands from the Kremlin . 
Too busy with its own problems , Russia has neither defended its interests in the Caucasus nor offered a vision for cooperative development . 
But although Russia &apos;s role in the region has decreased , cooperation with Russia is essential if the Transcaucasian states are to succeed . 
Despite its own high rates of unemployment , hundreds of thousands of people from the Caucasus have jobs in Russian cities . 
The value of money coming from Russia to the region outweighs all western aid and trade combined . 
Exports to Russia are the difference between life and death for regional industrial and agricultural producers . 
Russia &apos;s government knows that chaos and decay to its south carry grave economic , social , and security risks . 
The inroads made by Islamic fundamentalism in the region can be tied to the Caucasus &apos;s stunted economies . 
Breaking the old bullying habits - such as imposing visa restrictions on Georgians - won &apos;t be easy . 
But the war in Chechnya revealed how abominable the alternatives are . 
The Putin government must put aside wounded pride and worries about the West and embark on sustained efforts to improve infrastructure and promote trade in the region . 
Only by such a program can Russia hope to eventually play an effective - not merely obstructive - role in developing the oil wealth of the Caucasus .
