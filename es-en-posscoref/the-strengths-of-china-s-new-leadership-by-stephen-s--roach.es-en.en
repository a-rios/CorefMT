China &apos;s Dream Team 
In fact , nothing could be further from the truth . 
Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang - the top two officials in China &apos;s new governing council ( the Standing Committee of the Politburo ) - are both well educated , well traveled , and sophisticated thinkers who bring a wealth of experience to the many challenges that China faces . 
As so-called Fifth Generation leaders , they continue the steady progress in competence that has marked each of China &apos;s leadership transitions since the emergence of Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970 &quot; s . 
While it is entirely premature to judge the style and direction that China &apos;s new leaders will take , three early hints are worth noting . 
First , Xi &apos;s assumption of power is more complete than was the case in earlier transitions . 
By immediately taking the reins of both the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) and the Central Military Commission , he has a greater opportunity to put his personal stamp on policy than his predecessors had at the start of their administrations . 
Yes , China governs by a consensus of the Standing Committee . 
But Xi is well positioned to drive the thinking of a now-leaner decision-making body ( downsized from nine members to seven ) . 
Moreover , he has long favored a market-friendly , scientific approach to economic development , which will be vital to China &apos;s future . 
Second , Li Keqiang - the presumptive incoming premier - could be the big surprise in the new leadership team . 
Unlike the current premier , Wen Jiabao , who was third in the chain of command for the past ten years , Li has been elevated to number two , which suggests a greater potential for power-sharing between the CCP and the government at the top of China &apos;s new team . 
With a Ph.D. in economics , Li , who , as Executive Vice Premier , headed the all-important &quot; Central Committee Finance and Economy Leading Small Group , &quot; is especially well equipped to deal with the long-awaited structural transformation of China &apos;s economy . 
Indeed , having overseen China 2030 - an extraordinary joint report recently produced by the World Bank and China &apos;s own high-level think tank , the Development Research Center - he has a deep understanding of the roadmap that China must embrace . 
His promotion could be a major step up from Wen , who emphasized rhetoric and strategy more than implementation . 
Third , and contrary to prevailing wisdom in the West , Wang Qishan , one of China &apos;s savviest and most experienced senior officials , has not been relegated to obscurity in his new position overseeing &quot; discipline &quot; on the Standing Committee . 
Yes , Wang has invaluable experience in the financial sector , and it would have been logical for him to assume similar responsibilities on the new leadership team . 
But , as one of the top seven in the CCP hierarchy , he will still be able to weigh in on all important economic and financial matters , while assuming responsibility for tackling one of China &apos;s toughest problems - corruption . 
Having known Wang for more than 15 years , my sense is that he is very well suited to this vital task . 
The other members of the new Standing Committee bring a broad array of experience and skills . 
That is especially true of Yu Zhengsheng and the two Zhangs , Dejiang and Gaoli , who come from senior roles in three of China &apos;s most powerful and dynamic urban centers - Shanghai , Chongqing , and Tianjin . 
Their deep knowledge of the key role played by urbanization in driving economic development will be critical to broadening the structural transformation that China now faces . 
The West is not only overlooking the new Chinese leaders &quot; enhanced skill set , but is also misjudging the current state of the country &apos;s economy , which , while far from perfect , is not crisis-torn and in desperate need of a quick fix . 
In fact , China is emerging in reasonably good shape from yet another global slump . 
This gives its new leaders leeway between now and the National People &apos;s Congress in March 2013 to focus on the development of implementation tactics for their strategic agenda . 
None of this is to minimize China &apos;s enormous challenges . 
But strategy is not the problem ; the pro-consumption 12th Five-Year Plan lays that out with great clarity . 
The new leadership must now shift the focus to commitment and implementation of that strategy - namely , through enactment of a new set of bold reforms , especially those related to the services sector , the social safety net , and state-owned enterprises . 
Xi &apos;s emphasis on the &quot; top-level design &quot; of reforms lends itself particularly well to this agenda , as does Li &apos;s intimate familiarity with the detailed blueprint provided by China 2030 . 
Western observers , focusing on recent public statements by Xi and Li , highlight a dearth of comments in favor of economic or political reforms . 
But the same could have been said of the early utterances of Deng , modern China &apos;s greatest reformer . 
As Ezra Vogel notes in Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China , Deng &apos;s first public statement after his political rehabilitation in 1976 was , &quot; Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought constitute the guiding ideology of the party . &quot; 
Those were not exactly enlightened words - especially in view of what was shortly to come . 
Yet Deng seized the moment at a critical juncture that is strikingly reminiscent of the one now faced by Xi and Li . 
As is the case in any country &apos;s leadership transition , no one knows for certain whether China &apos;s incoming administration is up to the multiplicity of challenges that they face . 
Since the days of Deng , China has had an uncanny ability to rise to the occasion and meet its challenges head on . 
The new generation of leaders has the right skills and experience for the task . 
Western biases notwithstanding , we will know soon enough if they can translate strategy into action .
