Little Big Men 
CAMBRIDGE - History is often written in terms of military heroes , but the enormous potential of human leadership ranges from Attila the Hun to Mother Teresa . 
Most everyday leaders remain unheralded . 
The role of heroic leadership in war leads to overemphasis of command and control and hard military power . 
In America today , the presidential debate is between Senator John McCain , a war hero , and Senator Barack Obama , a former community organizer . 
The image of the warrior leader lingers in modern times . 
The writer Robert Kaplan points to the birth of a new &quot; warrior class as cruel as ever and better armed &quot; ranging from Russian Mafiosi and Latin American drug kingpins to terrorists who glorify violence just as ancient Greeks did in the sacking of Troy . 
Kaplan argues that modern leaders must respond in kind , and that modern leadership will demand a pagan ethos rooted in the past . 
Smart warriors , however , know how to lead with more than just the use of force . 
Soldiers sometimes joke that their job description is simple : &quot; kill people and break things . &quot; 
But , as the United States discovered in Iraq , hearts and minds also matter , and smart warriors need the soft power of attraction as well as the hard power of coercion . 
Indeed , an oversimplified image of warrior-style leadership in President George W. Bush &apos;s first term caused costly setbacks for America &apos;s role in the world . 
It is not a manly modern Achilles who makes the best warrior leader in today &apos;s communication age . 
Military leadership today requires political and managerial skills . 
Many autocratic rulers - in Zimbabwe , Myanmar , Belarus , and elsewhere - still lead the old-fashioned way . 
They combine fear with corruption to maintain kleptocracies dominated by &quot; the big man &quot; and his coterie . 
A good portion of the world is ruled this way . 
Some theorists try to explain this with an &quot; alpha male theory of leadership . &quot; 
The psychiatrist Arnold M. Ludwig , for example , argues that just as male monkeys , chimps , or apes automatically begin to assume more responsibility for their particular community once they attain the dominant status of alpha male , human rulers do so as well . 
But such socio-biological explanations of leadership are of only limited value . 
Thus far , no leadership gene has been identified , and studies of identical and fraternal male twins find that only a third of their difference in occupying formal leadership roles can be explained by genetic factors . 
While this suggests that inbred characteristics influence the extent to which people play particular roles , it leaves a lot of room for learned behavior to influence outcomes . 
Even so , one effect of the traditional heroic warrior approach to leadership has been to support the belief that leaders are born rather than made , and that nature is more important than nurture . 
The search for the essential traits of a leader dominated the field of leadership studies until the late 1940 &quot; s , and remains common in popular discourse today . 
A tall handsome person enters a room , draws attention , and &quot; looks like a leader . &quot; 
Various studies show that tall men are often favored , and that corporate CEOs are taller than average . 
But some of the most powerful leaders in history , such as Napoleon , Stalin , and Deng Xiaoping were little over five feet tall . 
The traits-centered approach has not vanished from studies of leadership , but it has been broadened and made more flexible . 
Traits have come to be seen as consistent patterns of personality rather than inherited characteristics . 
This definition mixes nature and nurture , and means that &quot; traits &quot; can to some extent be learned rather than merely inherited . 
We talk about leaders being more energetic , more risk-taking , more optimistic , more persuasive , and more empathetic than other people . 
These traits , however , are affected partly by a leader &apos;s genetic makeup and partly by the environments in which the traits were learned and developed . 
A persuasive experiment recently demonstrated the interaction between nature and nurture . 
A group of employers was asked to hire workers who had been ranked by their looks . 
If the employers saw only the resum√©s , beauty had no impact on hiring . 
Surprisingly , however , when telephone interviews were included in the process , beautiful people did better , even though they were unseen by the employers . 
A lifetime of social reinforcement based on their genetically given looks may have encoded into their voice patterns a tone of confidence that could be projected over the phone . 
Nature and nurture became thoroughly intertwined . 
Genetics and biology matter in human leadership , but they do not determine it in the way that the traditional heroic warrior approach to leadership suggests . 
The &quot; big man &quot; type of leader works in societies based on networks of tribal cultures that rely on personal and family honor and loyalty . 
But such social structures are not well adapted for coping with today &apos;s complex information-based world . 
In modern societies , institutional constraints such as constitutions and impersonal legal systems circumscribe such heroic figures . 
Societies that rely on heroic leaders are slow to develop the civil society and broad social capital that are necessary for leading in a modern networked world . 
Modern leadership turns out to be less about who you are or how you were born than about what you have learned and what you do as part of a group . 
Nature and nurture intertwine , but nurture is much more important in the modern world than the heroic paradigm acknowledges . 
Modern information societies require us to go beyond the &quot; big man &quot; approach to leadership . 
It will be interesting to see how these classical stereotypes play out in the American presidential competition this year .
