Two Cheers for Jiang Zemin \ u0027s Three Represents 
Mockery of retiring Chinse President Jiang Zemin &apos;s theory of the &quot; Three Represents &quot; is rife . 
Pundits scorn the theory , which says that the Communist party should not only represent workers and peasants but also society &apos;s &quot; advanced productive forces , culture and interests , &quot; and they deem it wholly inadequate to China &apos;s mounting problems of inequality , corruption , and lack of democracy . 
These critics are right to point out the theory &apos;s shortcomings , and the nauseating way that &quot; Jiang Zemin Thought &quot; is promulgated does remind us of Mao &apos;s Cultural Revolution . 
But they miss the point that the &quot; Three Represents &quot; marks a leap forward over the ideology it seeks to replace - the dictatorship of the proletariat . 
Under today &apos;s arrangements , China faces a choice between the &quot; Dictatorship of the Proletariat &quot; or the &quot; Three Represents . &quot; 
Which to choose seems very clear to me . 
The big contribution of the &quot; Three Represents &quot; is that , for the first time , a ruling communist party gives up - of its own volition - the idea of class warfare . 
The gist of the Three Represents is not that the ruling party should protect the interests of capitalists at the expense of others , but that capitalists should not be automatically excluded from China &apos;s political process . 
Of course , the status of capitalists will improve once the &quot; Three Represents &quot; is implemented . 
But those who argue that this will be achieved at the expense of China &apos;s working class need a reality check . 
Today , private firms employ more of China &apos;s working class than state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . 
With a fraction of the resources of the SOEs , private firms employ much of the proletariat , produce goods demanded by proletarian consumers , and , because of their superior performance , safeguard the interests of proletarian savers by actually paying back their bank loans . 
Why most pundits miss the fact that workers are protesting , not in the liberal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong , but in the socialist bastions of the northeast , is a mystery . 
Workers don &apos;t protest against menial jobs in capitalistic Wenzhou but against no jobs in socialist Shenyang . 
The government cannot pay unemployed workers their pensions because socialism has bankrupted its finance . 
Indeed , in contrast , in many Chinese regions , the tax contribution of a single private firm can exceed the combined tax revenue from all SOEs . 
Moreover , describing Chinese private entrepreneurs as a &quot; plutocracy &quot; is grotesque . 
The term plutocracy is commonly applied to Russia &apos;s oligarchs , who grew rich through political connections , corruption and shady business deals . 
Of course , some private entrepreneurs in China grew rich that way . 
Most , however , run mom-and-pop businesses in fiercely competitive sectors . 
They became rich by working hard and because of their innovation and efficiency . 
Some of China &apos;s biggest private entrepreneurs come from extremely humble backgrounds . 
Many hail from China &apos;s impoverished interior and rural areas . 
China &apos;s biggest private firm , the Hope Group , is located in Sichuan and started in the animal feed business . 
Why such origins ? 
In the 1980s and 1990s , the central government curtailed private sector activity in urban centers so as to minimize competition with SOEs . 
The countryside was left with more freedom because the central government never thought that entrepreneurs there could succeed . 
Those who think that entrepreneurs got rich because of their political connections commit a classic analytical error : they reason backward on the basis of outcomes rather than the processes that produced those outcomes . 
They fail to realize that cozy relations are often the result of , not the cause of , business success . 
Those who succeed command respect and leverage with the government because of their business acumen and the fact that they beat their competitors . 
Only a few entrepreneurs &quot; make it . &quot; 
Many , as everywhere else in the world , fail on the way . 
Detractors of the &quot; Three Represents &quot; also have their ideas about democracy backward . 
They think that the dictatorship of the proletariat means that the communist party represents the interests of the working class . 
But the dictatorship of the proletariat was as much a straightjacket on workers as on everybody else . 
Only a vibrant private propertied class can one day bring democracy to China . 
A market economy based on private property rights is an economic democracy , and it is only a matter of time before political democracy follows . 
This optimism is not based on the belief that capitalists favor democracy . 
Instead , it is based on the idea that democracy comes from forcing the state to share power with those it cannot directly control . 
Capitalists control wealth and wealth creation . 
Sooner or later capitalists will demand returns on their tax contributions in the form of greater accountability of government policies and practices . 
There is another virtue associated with a political change engineered by propertied members of society - a stable , gradual and peaceful transition . 
In the 20 th century , countries like Korea , Taiwan and Chile made the transition to democracy peacefully and successfully . 
All had a vibrant private sector and a prosperous market economy . 
In contrast , countries with a large and bankrupt state sector incurred tumultuous , incomplete and often violent lurches toward democracy . 
Romania &apos;s current nightmare would be of unimaginable scale if repeated in China . 
The &quot; Three Represents &quot; may offend the sense and sensibility of some . 
But it &apos;s a trivial price to pay in order to make China &apos;s future more secure and peaceful for millions of Chinese .
