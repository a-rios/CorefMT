Musharraf &apos;s Return ? 
LAHORE - Pakistan &apos;s former president , Pervez Musharraf , has decided to return to Pakistani politics , if not quite to Pakistan . 
He announced his decision at London &apos;s National Liberal Club , an institution founded in the nineteenth century by William Gladstone and other stalwarts of Britain &apos;s parliamentary tradition . 
The choice of venue was , of course , steeped in irony . 
Musharraf did not uphold the Gladstonian tradition while he was in office for almost nine years , from October 1999 to August 2008 . 
Indeed , he admitted as much in his speech at the launch of his political party , the All Pakistan Muslim League , from a safe distance of thousands of miles from an increasingly turbulent Pakistan . 
Although Musharraf did not elaborate on his &quot; mistakes , &quot; the reference was obvious : his impulsive decision in March 2007 to fire Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry from the Supreme Court . 
The judge had refused to be directed by the president and the military in deciding important constitutional matters , including Musharraf &apos;s own eligibility to contest the presidency while still in uniform . 
The second &quot; mistake &quot; came the following November , after Musharraf &apos;s government failed to contain the legal community &apos;s impressive civil-disobedience movement to pressure the government into reinstating Chaudhry . 
Musharraf , again acting impulsively , placed the country under emergency rule when Chaudhry was brought back by a decision of his own court . 
Chaudhry was fired again , a move accompanied this time by a wider shakeup of the already shaken-up judiciary . 
The government emptied the Supreme Court of relatively independent judges and installed a more &quot; trustworthy &quot; group . 
The strategy didn &apos;t work , and the lawyers returned to agitating . 
Musharraf withdrew the emergency and restored the constitution , but a few days later Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi after she addressed a large election rally . 
Musharraf postponed the elections scheduled for December 2007 until February 2008 . 
Many assumed that Musharraf would follow the lead of his military predecessors , who on several occasions announced elections and a return to democracy , only to postpone the vote when it drew near . 
But Musharraf surprised the Pakistani political establishment and held the election , in which the Pakistan Muslim League ( the Quaid Group ) , his political base , was trounced by Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party and the Pakistan Muslim Group ( the Nawaz Group ) . 
The second Muslim League was headed by Nawaz Sharif , twice Pakistan &apos;s prime minister . 
Following the coup , Bhutto and Nawaz fled into exile , and were allowed back into the country only after Musharraf , hoping that their return would help deflect public attention from the lawyers &quot; protest movement , announced that he would hold elections . 
Given the way Musharraf governed the country , it is hard to imagine that he will be able to stage a political comeback . 
Pakistan these days is a troubled country , politically as well as economically . 
But talk of regime change may have prompted Musharraf to re-enter politics . 
Only a politician who has the support of major constituencies can hope to restore political order and economic health , and Musharraf is presenting himself as a candidate whom the military might support . 
Thus , in a long interview with the BBC before launching his new party , Musharraf suggested that Pakistan &apos;s army was the only institution that could save the country from its current woes . 
&quot; There is a sense of despondency in Pakistan , and the place that the people go to is the military , &quot; he said . 
&quot; There &apos;s nobody else to whom they can go . 
In Pakistan , they come to the army headquarters , they come to the army chief , they run there , and they ask them to act . 
They don &apos;t trust the politicians . &quot; 
While there may be some element of truth in this , Musharraf appears not to have learned the lesson of his final year in office . 
Then , an energized legal community , supported by a hyperactive media , was able to defy a military government . 
It is unlikely that most Pakistanis , despite their distrust of Pakistan &apos;s politicians , will be inclined to turn to someone with Musharraf &apos;s history . 
The army , in fact , recognizes this . 
It also realizes that Pakistan can be effectively governed only if its leaders have the support of other important constituencies . 
The muhajir community - the refugees who migrated from India in 1947 - has its own political party , the Muhajir Qaumi Movement , which governs Sindh and its large cities with the help of the People &apos;s Party . 
The PPP remains popular in rural Sindh and among the country &apos;s poor and lower middle class . 
The Pashtuns have their own party , the National Awami Party , which governs the newly named province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , on the border with Afghanistan . 
Despite today &apos;s turbulence , it is unlikely that the military will intervene directly and taken over the reins of government , as it has on four occasions in Pakistan &apos;s history . 
If , however , it is to orchestrate a regime change - which it might attempt to do - it will not likely disregard these groups and their powerbases by imposing their former commander on the political system . 
The military , if it is to play a role , will try to find new leaders from among the political establishment . 
The political stage is too crowded for Musharraf to find a place to stand .
