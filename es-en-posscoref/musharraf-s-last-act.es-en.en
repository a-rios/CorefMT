Musharraf &apos;s Last Act ? 
Desperate to hold onto power , Pervez Musharraf has discarded Pakistan &apos;s constitutional framework and declared a state of emergency . 
His goal ? 
To stifle the independent judiciary and free media . 
Artfully , though shamelessly , he has tried to sell this action as an effort to bring about stability and help fight the war on terror more effectively . 
Nothing could be further from the truth . 
If Pakistan &apos;s history is any indicator , his decision to impose martial law may prove to be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel &apos;s back . 
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12 , 1999 , when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious &quot; nation-building &quot; project . 
Many Pakistanis , disillusioned with Pakistan &apos;s political class , remained mute , thinking that he might deliver . 
The September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on America brought Musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the Taliban and support the United States-led war on terror . 
Musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside Pakistan and also on those fighting Indian forces in Kashmir . 
As a result , Pakistan was rewarded with American financial assistance and arms . 
In furtherance of his re-alignment , Musharraf sent the Pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan for the first time since Pakistan &apos;s independence . 
Operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results . 
Although the US viewed Musharraf as an agent of change , he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy , and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions . 
For example , he made alliances with Islamist political forces ( who in 2004 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions ) . 
At the same time , he sidelined moderate , mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for &quot; enlightened moderation . &quot; 
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region . 
Last March , Musharraf took his boldest step , removing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , Iftikhar Chaudhry . 
To the surprise of many , the country &apos;s legal community organized a nation-wide movement to restore the Chief Justice to his post . 
Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution , emboldening the judiciary and changing the country &apos;s political dynamic . 
In a historic ruling that Musharraf had little choice but to accept , the Supreme Court itself reinstated the Chief Justice in July . 
Subsequently , the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions , embarrassing the government - especially its intelligence agencies . 
Government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law , ranging from brutal beatings of journalists , to illegal confinement for &quot; national security . &quot; 
Musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality , but their patience ran out when the Supreme Court took up petitions against Musharraf &apos;s decision to run for president . 
According to the constitution ( originally promulgated in 1973 by an elected parliament ) , a serving military official cannot run for an elected office . 
Musharraf was not ready to give up his military post , but also wanted to be a civilian president . 
While he announced that he would leave his military position &quot; if &quot; he was elected president , his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary . 
The proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made Musharraf jittery . 
The decision of the 11-member bench might easily have gone against him . 
Legally cornered , Musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality , removing the leading judges of the Supreme Court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media . 
Lawyers , human rights activists , and political leaders have since been arrested . 
There is widespread public resentment in response to these moves . 
Rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation ( as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks ) and the increasing Talibanization of the tribal areas , Musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media . 
To be sure , in some cases , judicial activism was obvious ( though within the realm of constitutional law ) , and the media also made mistakes ; but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy . 
It is unlikely that Musharraf &apos;s latest gambit will succeed , as his popular support is at its lowest ebb . 
Pakistan &apos;s armed forces - repeated targets of suicide bombers - have become demoralized . 
It is difficult to imagine them standing with Musharraf should civil conflict erupt . 
Nor can a weak , embattled , and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan . 
Opposition political parties are drawing closer together , and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , despite progress in her power-sharing negotiations with Musharraf , has strongly condemned his actions . 
Human rights bodies , media associations , and lawyers &quot; organizations are expected to defy the emergency , which will pit them against the security forces . 
Terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with Musharraf . 
In the event of sustained protests and potential violence , top military commanders may decide to send Musharraf home - a decision that would not be unprecedented in Pakistan &apos;s chronically turbulent history .
