Iraq &apos;s Jobs-for-Peace Mirage 
As the wisdom of President Bush &apos;s proposed &quot; surge &quot; of US troops is debated across the US and around the world , another question about the US President &apos;s new policy to avert all-out civil war there is coming to the fore . 
Can using US funding to reopen Iraqi state-owned enterprises get young men to abandon the insurgency and sectarian militias ? 
The idea sounds logical : a man with a good job that enables him to build a decent life won &apos;t want to fight Americans or his fellow Iraqis , right ? 
Unfortunately , that jobs strategy is unlikely to reduce the violence . 
Iraq &apos;s state-owned enterprises were the cornerstone of Saddam Hussein &apos;s economic policy . 
But , propped up by military contracts , those state companies were never well run or efficient ; greatly overstaffed , they produced little , similar to the failed state-owned enterprises of the old Soviet Union . 
Moreover , outside of the oil and electric power sectors , state-owned enterprises in Iraq have never been major employers . 
For example , the roughly 180 enterprises in the Ministry of Industry and Minerals , which controls all state-owned manufacturing companies , never employed much more than 100,000 workers in a nation of roughly 27 million people . 
The employees of the state-owned enterprises still receive paychecks , even though about a third of their workplaces have been destroyed . 
For example , the Sulaymaniyah Sugar Mill was bombed during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980 &quot; s , but its employees have been paid ever since , though only rats and pigeons now report for work there . 
Indeed , many employees of state-owned enterprises show little interest in returning to work . 
When the Coalition Provisional Authority asked the employees of the Mishraq Sulfur Company to go back on the job in 2004 , some of the workers lit $ 40 million worth of sulfur on fire and destroyed the facility . 
They preferred to be paid without working . 
There is little to resuscitate among the state-owned enterprises . 
A third are damaged beyond repair , another third are hopelessly unprofitable , and the rest are a mismanaged assortment of plants , a few of which could potentially produce something of value , but only with proper management and incentives . 
Trying to give these hopelessly inefficient enterprises a new lease on life would make Iraqis poorer without reducing the violence . 
Yet beneath Iraq &apos;s chaos and the rubble , a rough and tumble private sector has been expanding since the US invasion , benefiting from higher oil revenues and more liberal economic policies . 
As a result , government expenditures and household incomes are up substantially since Saddam Hussein &apos;s last years in power . 
Despite the violence , commercial activity has also risen , because Iraqis are now free to import the equipment and goods they need to build homes , run stores , and operate trucking companies . 
If the US wants to increase jobs , it should intensify efforts to work with these private Iraqi companies to bid on contracts . 
State-owned enterprises should also be free to bid , but they should receive no favors . 
The fundamental problem in Iraq is not jobs . 
In contrast to the Mexican , Chinese , or Russian revolutions , economic disenfranchisement is not driving the current conflict . 
This is a struggle for power , not for economic justice or a better life . 
The root causes are political , sectarian , and personal . 
Suicide bombers and death squads are not seeking shorter working hours , higher salaries , or better pension plans . 
All credible economic indicators show employment prospects in Iraq improving since the end of the invasion . 
Daily wages for laborers in Baghdad have doubled in the last three years - hardly a sign of rising unemployment . 
The only decent survey of employment in Iraq , the United Nations Development Program &apos;s Iraq Living Standards Survey of 2004 , measured unemployment at 10.5 % . 
Iraqi statistics , which define unemployment more expansively , show rates in percent declining from the mid-twenties to the teens in the past two years . 
Many young Iraqis join militias because that is where the money is . 
They can earn more hanging around with a gun in their hands than by working in construction or trade . 
Supporters of the insurgency are happy to plant a roadside bomb in exchange for extra cash . 
Instead of focusing on a large jobs program , the US could do more to bring peace to Iraq by reducing the money from Iraqi government coffers and smuggling activities that funds the payrolls of the insurgents and militias . 
How then should foreign assistance to Iraq be spent ? 
The US should increase spending on programs to improve the police . 
Currently , many police devote their energies to shaking down citizens for bribes , and some moonlight in death squads . 
As long as Iraqis face daily threats of larceny , kidnapping , and murder - particularly from those who are supposed to protect them - they will seek security from neighborhood gangs and militias . 
The key to improving police operations is to embed more US and allied police officers in the police force to mentor Iraqi officers . 
They also identify good officers and those who are corrupt or participating in death squads or sectarian militias . 
More funds for equipment , improved facilities , and training would also help . 
Funding and support to assist Iraqi courts and prisons to function more effectively and in accordance with international standards is also essential . 
Without progress in this area , improvements in the Iraqi police will have little effect . 
Throwing more money at Iraq won &apos;t buy peace . 
Iraq is already one of the largest recipients of US assistance ever .
