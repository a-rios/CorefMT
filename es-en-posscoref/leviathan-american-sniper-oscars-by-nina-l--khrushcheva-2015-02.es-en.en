Russia and America at the Oscars 
NEW YORK - Oscar has spoken . 
Neither Leviathan , the Russian film nominated for the best Foreign Language Film , nor American Sniper , nominated for Best Picture , won . 
Yet both , in a way , are the most representative films of the year , as each captures the essence of why Russia and the United States now seem doomed to wage a new Cold War . 
Following Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine , Leviathan faced an uphill public-relations battle . 
But Leviathan &apos;s bleak portrait of contemporary Russian life actually confirms many of the reasons why Americans have been largely dubious about Russia &apos;s ability to reform following communism &apos;s collapse . 
That doubt has been reflected in popular culture . 
Since 1991 , Hollywood has documented American mistrust of post-Soviet Russia in a series of films - for example , The Saint , Air Force One , The Golden Compass of 2006 , Salt , and The November Man . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s thuggish foreign policy has proved these Russophobes right , so nominating Leviathan , the superb biopsy of his regime , seemed only right . 
And , though Oscar did not anoint Leviathan , the film deserves all of the accolades it has received . 
Directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev in an eerie style that one might call the &quot; realism of despair , &quot; the film is both epic and deeply nuanced . 
The title harks back to the book of Job and recalls Herman Melville &apos;s Moby Dick . 
Set in a small town on the Barents Sea , Leviathan shows that there is no escape , not even in the Arctic , from the Moscow-centric state and its hypocritical doppelganger , the Orthodox Church . 
The giant skeleton of a whale - possibly Leviathan itself - is beached on the shoreline , along with the carcasses of old boats , beneath a severe gray sky that frames a human landscape of political abuse , adultery , lawlessness , and the cynicism of all-powerful priests . 
The story , akin to Alexander Solzhenitsyn &apos;s ambitious 1962 masterpiece One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , steadily indicts the corruption of state power - a power ever-willing to kill and to align itself with an even more corrupt power , the Orthodox Church . 
Like communism , which once promised absolution for the worst crimes in exchange for loyalty , Russia &apos;s current state religion allows , even encourages , misdeeds - including murder - so long as one is loyal to God . 
Nikolai , Leviathan &apos;s hotheaded main character , sees his life consumed by the fight to save his seashore property from the town &apos;s mayor . 
&quot; I &apos;ll kill him if he builds a palace here , &quot; shouts Nikolai , in a reference to current Russian leaders &apos; proclivity for erecting garish monuments to their personal splendor : Putin &apos;s Italianate palace on the Black sea , for example , allegedly cost more than $ 1 billion . 
At the end of his struggle , Nikolai &apos;s life is ruined . 
His wife is killed , and he stands accused of murdering her for an affair she briefly had with his friend . 
At the end , we learn that Nikolai was persecuted to make room not for the mayor &apos;s palace , but for a cathedral . 
Even the Russian clich√©s - tragedy stemming from overweening power , vodka , swearing , shooting , and shouting - only strengthen the film &apos;s extraordinary depiction of the local effects of distant and devastating forces . 
This is Russian politics at its most debased . 
In Stalin &apos;s time , the masterpieces of , say , Boris Pasternak or Dmitri Shostakovich were entrusted to give artistic voice to a silenced civil society . 
So it is ironic that Leviathan was partly financed by Russia &apos;s culture ministry - and telling that the Russian authorities had no interest in its winning at the Oscars . 
Indeed , Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky recently criticized the film for its darkness and pessimism . 
American Sniper , directed by Clint Eastwood , reflects US mores as much as Leviathan reflects the current Russian Zeitgeist . 
But , where Leviathan examines Putin &apos;s Russia with the unflinching eye of a surgeon , American Sniper merely trumpets supposed national values with no consideration of their application around the world . 
During four tours in Iraq as a soldier / missionary , a stand-up Texan , Chris Kyle ( played by Bradley Cooper ) becomes known as Legend , a killer with a savior complex . 
American Sniper , loosely based on Kyle &apos;s memoir , touts the frontier mentality - a neo-cowboy movie made by a former cowboy-movie star . 
Just as Leviathan shows a Russia caught in the throes of a political nightmare , American Sniper shows a country trapped by its heroic mythology - defined in countless Western movies - of rugged individualism at home and defense of freedom and order abroad . 
But the world has changed , and many no longer view America &apos;s global role as an expression of its unique innocence and goodness . 
Given everything we have learned about the Iraq War - false claims about weapons of mass destruction , nonexistent links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda , and so on - Eastwood &apos;s film comes across as a work of marketing , not reflection and contemplation . 
Eastwood has merely updated his earlier films - think The Outlaw Josey Wales or Pale Rider - with their unwavering conviction that America &apos;s god of righteousness must prevail . 
In short , American Sniper fails where Leviathan succeeds . 
George Orwell neatly summarized why : &quot; All propaganda is a lie even when it &apos;s telling the truth . &quot;
