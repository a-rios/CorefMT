New Alliances for a New Century 
In 1970 , I traveled to Egypt as part of a delegation representing the United States at the funeral of President Gamal Abdel Nasser . 
Back then , Egypt was closely aligned with the Soviet Union . 
When we arrived in Cairo , it seemed that everywhere one looked there was evidence of the Soviet presence - Soviet tanks , missiles , and troops . 
During the visit , we were scheduled to meet with Anwar Sadat . 
No one in our delegation was sure what to expect , given the uneasy relations between our two countries at the time . 
To our surprise , Sadat told us that he , in fact , had respect for the US . 
The reason ? 
As a young military officer , he had visited our country and had had an excellent experience . 
And , indeed , within two years of taking power , Sadat expelled the Soviets from Egypt and began to build a friendship with the US that , despite challenges and periodic differences , has proven important and valuable ever since . 
I mention the importance of these military-to-military relationships because the US in this new century is undergoing a significant transformation of its military arrangements and partnerships around the globe - necessary adjustments based on the new realities , and new threats , that have emerged since the end of the Cold War . 
It is important to note that since 2001 , the US has probably done more things , with more nations , in more constructive ways , and in more parts of the world , than at any other time in its history . 
In the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , President George W. Bush helped fashion and lead the largest coalition in history - 80-plus nations - to fight the global war on terror . 
Furthermore , roughly 60 nations are currently cooperating in the Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent dangerous weapons and materials from being transported to terrorists or outlaw regimes . 
There has been a rethinking of the structure and role of our traditional military alliances , including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , which is setting up a new NATO Response Force and has moved outside Europe for the first time with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . 
The focus of attention today is on Iraq and Afghanistan . 
But in future decades , priorities will change . 
And much of what we may be called on to do in the future will likely be determined by choices made by others . 
Consider Russia , a nation with vast natural resources , an educated population , and a rich heritage of scientific and cultural achievements . 
Like Americans and others around the world , they are threatened by violent extremism . 
Russia is a partner with the US on some security issues , and our overall relationship is the best it has been in decades . 
But in other ways Russia has been unhelpful - using energy resources as a political weapon , for example , and in their resistance to positive political changes in neighboring countries . 
The same holds true for China . 
The Chinese people are educated and talented , and their country has great potential , with high economic growth rates and an industrious work force . 
Nonetheless , some aspects of Chinese behavior remain unsettling and complicate our relationship . 
Last year , a US Department of Defense report noted that China &apos;s defense expenditures appear to be much higher than acknowledged by the Chinese government . 
Coupled with a notable lack of transparency , this understandably concerns China &apos;s neighbors . 
In addition to the choices that these and other countries make , America &apos;s own choices will be an important factor determining what kind of future it faces . 
From time to time , US public sentiment has opposed playing an active role in the world and fulfilling our commitments to allies - and , indeed , to the cause of freedom . 
In the early 1970 &quot; s , as US ambassador to NATO , I remember having to fly back from Europe to testify against legislation in our Congress that would have pulled US troops out of Western Europe and NATO , just as the Soviet Union was in the midst of a huge military buildup . 
Today , nations that were members of the Soviet Union &apos;s Warsaw Pact , as well as some of the former Soviet Republics - countries that we used to call &quot; captive nations &quot; - are valued members of NATO and represent some of our most stalwart allies in the War on Terror . 
This did not happen by accident or by chance . 
Looking forward , I am convinced that if we have the wisdom , courage , and strength to adjust long-standing strategic arrangements , embrace new partners , and , above all , persevere in the face of adversity and difficulty , we will see a similar victory in this &quot; long war &quot; against violence extremism and the other threats that may emerge in an uncertain new century .
