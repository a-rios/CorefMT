The Trade-and-Aid Myth 
Trade and aid have become international buzzwords . 
More aid ( including debt relief ) and greater access to rich countries &quot; markets for poor countries &quot; products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda . 
Indeed , the debate nowadays is not about what to do , but howmuch to do , and how fast . 
Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development . 
Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves . 
Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts . 
Aid and market access have rarely played a critical role . 
Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor , which also happens to be the world &apos;s most powerful economy . 
Suppose , in addition , that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border , receives a huge volume of inward investment , and is totally integrated into international production chains . 
Moreover , the country &apos;s banking system is supported by its rich neighbor &apos;s demonstrated willingness to act as a lender of last resort . 
Globalization does not get much better than this , right ? 
Now consider a second country . 
This one faces a trade embargo in the world &apos;s largest market , receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West , is excluded from international organizations like the WTO , and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank . 
If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough , this economy also maintains its own high barriers on international trade ( in the form of state trading , import tariffs , and quantitative restrictions ) . 
As the reader may have guessed , these are real countries : Mexico and Vietnam . 
Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States , which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor , but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury ( as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis ) . 
By contrast , America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994 , established diplomatic relations only in 1995 , and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that . 
Vietnam still remains outside the WTO . 
Now consider their economic performance . 
Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992 , Mexico &apos;s economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1 % in per capita terms . 
This is not only far below the rates of Asia &apos;s economic superstars ; it is also a fraction of Mexico &apos;s own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 ( 3.6 % per year between 1960 and 1981 ) . 
Vietnam , however , grew at an annual rate of 5.6 % per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995 , and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5 % pace since then . 
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty , while in Mexico real wages fell . 
Both countries experienced sharp increases in international trade and foreign investment , but the pictures are utterly different where it counts most : rising standards of living , particularly for the poor . 
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country &apos;s economic fortunes . 
All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home , especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso &apos;s exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy . 
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy . 
With none of Mexico &apos;s advantages , Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers . 
Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most . 
South Korea took off in the early 1960 &quot; s not when foreign aid was at its apex , but when it was being phased out . 
Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential market access . 
China and India , today &apos;s two economic superstars , have prospered largely through sui generis reform efforts . 
It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes - Botswana and Mauritius - to foreign demand for their exports ( diamonds and garments , respectively ) , but that story goes only so far . 
Obviously , both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets . 
But , as in other cases of successful development , what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess , but their ability to exploit these advantages . 
Witness the mess that other countries made of their natural-resource endowments . 
The word &quot; diamond &quot; hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone . 
Similarly , few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius . 
None of this absolves rich countries of their responsibility to help . 
They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators - for example , by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign . 
Similarly , increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries , and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US , would produce greater long-term development impact . 
It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North . 
Development should focus not on trade and aid , but on improving the policy environment in poor countries .
