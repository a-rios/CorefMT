Cancer &apos;s Dangerous Mythology 
GENEVA - This year , World Cancer Day will focus on dispelling damaging myths about the disease . 
The theme - illustrated in the tagline &quot; Cancer - Did you know ? &quot; - offers an opportunity to reflect on cancer &apos;s true consequences and enhance global prevention and treatment efforts . 
One prevailing myth is that cancer is primarily a developed-country problem . 
But , while it is true that cancer is pervasive in wealthy countries , people in the world &apos;s poorest countries lose more years of life to the disease . 
As medical advances and technological developments have helped cancer patients in high-income countries to live longer - to the extent that some forms of cancer have effectively become chronic conditions - those in low-income countries continue to die young . 
Besides being unjust , this is deeply tragic . 
Having eluded killers like malaria and AIDS , one should not then be killed prematurely by cancer - especially a form of cancer that could have been prevented with something as simple and as affordable as a vaccine . 
The often-overlooked link between vaccines and cancer highlights a second common misconception : fate alone ( and perhaps smoking ) determines who gets cancer . 
In fact , one in six cancer cases worldwide is caused by a known infectious agent , with the proportion rising to one-third in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa . 
The four main culprits are hepatitis B and C ( hepB and hepC ) , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , and Helicobacter pylori , which are collectively responsible for 1.9 million cases of liver , cervical , and gastric cancer annually . 
Cervical cancer now kills more women than childbirth , claiming a life every two minutes . 
Of the 275,000 women who die of cervical cancer annually , 85 % live in the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
If left unchecked , the number of cervical cancer deaths is set to rise to 430,000 annually by 2030 . 
Then there is hepB , which is over 50 times more infectious than HIV and often passed from mother to child before or shortly after birth , increasing the likelihood of liver cancer later in life . 
An estimated two billion people alive today have been infected with hepB , while 350 million people are chronically infected . 
Of these , roughly one-quarter will die from hepB-related liver cancer or cirrhosis ( a consequence of chronic liver disease ) . 
The good news is that powerful tools are available to avert many of these deaths . 
Existing HPV vaccines can prevent up to 70 % of cervical cancer cases , and new vaccines are in the pipeline that will improve this record further . 
Likewise , hepB vaccines are 95 % effective at preventing infection and its chronic consequences . 
Vaccines protecting against Helicobacter pylori and hepC are in development ( although the latter is proving particularly challenging ) . 
Even an Epstein-Barr virus vaccine , which would protect against some kinds of lymphoma , is achieving promising results . 
But paying for and delivering these vaccines to the most vulnerable citizens of low-income countries poses a significant challenge . 
Although the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has recommended including the hepB vaccine in routine immunization since 1992 , its high price initially hindered its uptake in some developing countries . 
But the GAVI Alliance intervened to ensure that this is no longer a concern with hepB , and it is unlikely to occur with HPV . 
Since its launch in 2000 , the GAVI Alliance has sought to increase access to life-saving vaccines for the world &apos;s poorest children . 
In partnership with the World Bank , the WHO , UNICEF , and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , it has used innovative financing tools to raise funds for global immunization programs , while working with industry to lower the prices of vaccines . 
By including the hepB vaccine as part of a pentavalent ( five in one ) vaccine , the Alliance has already facilitated its delivery to children in 70 countries as part of routine immunizations . 
The Alliance is now working to make the HPV vaccine available to more than 30 million of the world &apos;s poorest women and girls by 2020 ; as part of this effort , and coinciding with World Cancer Day , it has launched demonstration programs in eight developing countries . 
A growing body of evidence shows that vaccines &quot; benefits extend beyond preventing illness and death . 
In the fight against cancer , medical advances can shave precious percentage points off of mortality rates , which implies that improved access to vaccines can have a massive impact , slashing the number of future cases in developing countries for just a few dollars per dose . 
People in rich countries are undoubtedly familiar with the maxim that prevention is better than cure . 
Meanwhile , people in developing countries lack access to simple and effective tools for preventing several of the most common cancers . 
Improving access to vaccines is crucial to addressing this global inequity and reducing the widening gap between rich and poor . 
This requires , first and foremost , dispelling the myth that one cannot &quot; catch &quot; cancer .
