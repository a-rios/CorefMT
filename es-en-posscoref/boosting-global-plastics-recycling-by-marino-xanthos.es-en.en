The Dirt on Plastic Waste 
NEWARK , NJ - Plastics are everywhere . 
Whether used to store leftovers , keep hospital equipment sterile , or insulate a home , plastics are unmatched for their adaptability , durability , and low cost . 
Given their seemingly boundless benefits , it is unsurprising that plastics have replaced traditional materials in many sectors - for example , steel in cars , paper and glass in packaging , and wood in furniture . 
As a result , annual plastics consumption worldwide has increased from five million tons in the 1950 &quot; s to around 280 million tons today . 
Roughly half of plastic products , such as packaging , are intended for one-time , short-lifespan ( less than six months ) applications prior to disposal . 
Given that most of these items are not biodegradable , and are not recycled , plastics waste is building up - with serious environmental consequences . 
While governments have begun to implement new ( and often quite strict ) regulations aimed at managing plastics waste - for example , China banned lightweight plastic shopping bags in 2008 - they are inadequate to address the world &apos;s growing plastics-waste problem . 
Moreover , most plastic products are made from so-called &quot; petroleum-based commodity thermoplastics . &quot; 
Given that a non-renewable resource forms the basis of many plastic products - most of which will not last long - current plastics usage patterns are not sustainable . 
Closed-loop recycling , in which plastics waste is used to make another product , thus carries significant environmental benefits , such as reduced energy and oil consumption . 
But the process of separating the petroleum-based recyclable plastics from other kinds of plastics and solid waste is difficult , costly , and labor-intensive , so only a small proportion is recycled . 
In 1988 , the United States Society of Plastics Industry ( SPI ) developed a coding system in which each kind of resin is labeled with a number , 1-7 , to facilitate sorting . 
The system has also been used elsewhere , including in Canada and Switzerland , but has not been adopted worldwide and is still confusing to some consumers . 
If consumers knew to collect and separate household plastics based on their number , when available , the resulting boost to recycling efforts would demonstrate to government and industry the viability of a more sustainable approach , reduce exposure to rising oil prices , and support growing global demand for plastics . 
There are four categories of plastics recycling : primary recycling , in which the plastic is re-used in the same application ; secondary recycling , in which material ( mixed or contaminated ) is used in less demanding applications ; tertiary recycling , in which the plastic is converted into monomers or chemicals ; and quaternary recycling , in which only energy is recovered through incineration . 
Each of these methods recovers a different amount of the embodied energy of the plastic item . 
( All of the embodied energy is lost if the plastics are landfilled , a common disposal method worldwide . ) 
Given the difficulty and expense of separating plastics , the most economically viable option is often secondary recycling of a few commodity thermoplastics - mostly bottles , for which collection infrastructure is already in place . 
More economical separation methods are crucial to expanding the scope of plastics recycling , as is the identification of new potential markets for the recyclates . 
Such developments would encourage industry to re-use or recycle more parts . 
Although all 40 kinds of plastics used in a North American automobile can be recycled , the need to separate and clean them makes using them more expensive than using virgin plastic resins . 
This translates into a higher proportion of plastics in the remnants of shredded end-of-life automobiles - a contaminated mixture of plastics and non-plastics that is usually disposed of through some combination of landfilling , incineration , and secondary recycling . 
Increasing the proportion of re-used plastics is a crucial step toward more sustainable plastics consumption . 
To this end , some automobile manufacturers have adjusted their designs to allow for easy disassembly of parts made of compatible plastics , while governments have set recycling target proportions for end-of-life vehicles . 
Such efforts should be intensified . 
Furthermore , industry should seek new applications for recycled materials , while minimizing the amount of virgin material used . 
And , where possible , manufacturers should &quot; down-gauge &quot; materials ( make parts thinner ) . 
Government legislation can be enacted to support such measures , as well as to require plastics manufacturers to get involved in the disposal of plastic items - a responsibility long imposed on packaged-goods manufacturers in Europe . 
An example of successful waste management is the reprocessing of PET bottles ( made of polyethylene terephthalate ) into polyester fibers . 
In the last decade , Japan passed several laws obliging both businesses and individuals to separate plastics waste . 
This , combined with a lack of landfill space and the country &apos;s expanding population , has enhanced plastics recycling efforts . 
As a result , in 2010 , Japan recycled 72 % of PET bottles , compared to roughly 30 % in the US and 48 % in Europe . 
While incineration and landfilling are still practiced , such high recycling rates underscore the positive impact of targeted policies . 
Another promising development is bioplastics , which have begun to compete with petroleum-based products in certain short-lifespan applications - such as packaging and agriculture - over the last two decades . 
Given that bioplastics are produced from renewable or &quot; bio-based &quot; sources ( cellulose , starch , and glucose ) - and , in some cases , through microbial fermentation - they have a lower carbon footprint , contribute less to global warming , and biodegrade to small molecules . 
But bioplastics are not a silver bullet for managing plastics waste . 
In fact , they may threaten the secondary recycling of petroleum-based plastics , owing to possible contamination during sorting of mixed streams . 
And critics have expressed concern about the environmental impact of corn and other crops grown for industrial purposes , such as plastics and ethanol production , not to mention the potential effects on global food prices . 
In a world that is reliant on plastics , more sustainable production , consumption , and disposal of plastic products is crucial . 
Civil society , industry , and government must work together to increase the share of recycled plastics , thereby ensuring that plastics &quot; costs do not outweigh their benefits .
