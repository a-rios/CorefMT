AIPAC in Decline 
MADRID - The American Israel Public Affairs Committee &apos;s lobbying power in the United States is undeniable . 
But AIPAC &apos;s supposed ability to control US policy decisions is a Potemkin village myth , cultivated by friends and rivals alike . 
In fact , thanks to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , AIPAC &apos;s influence is under threat - though Netanyahu himself will be just fine . 
Claims about AIPAC &apos;s clout have long shaped analysis of US foreign policy . 
For example , Steve Walt and John Mearsheimer , in their notorious essay &quot; The Israel Lobby , &quot; asserted that AIPAC manufactured the Iraq War . 
But the reality is far less sinister : in that case , AIPAC merely surfed on the pro-invasion wave unleashed by President George W. Bush , with his Messianic urges , and Vice President Dick Cheney , a one-man war lobby . 
The truth about AIPAC - that it is influential , but far from invulnerable - has recently been revealed , both to the public and to the group itself . 
Having been pushed by Netanyahu into an unwinnable fight against US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration over its nuclear deal with Iran , AIPAC is now crumbling under the weight of its own hubris . 
In fact , AIPAC has never overcome resolute opposition from an American president , particularly in a matter of US national security . 
It failed to stop Jimmy Carter from selling F-15 Eagle fighters to Saudi Arabia in 1978 , or to prevent Ronald Reagan from supplying AWACS reconnaissance planes to the Saudis three years later . 
And its 1991 battle with President George H.W. Bush over the linkage of US loan guarantees for Israel with Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir &apos;s support of the 1991 Madrid peace conference - one of Bush &apos;s key legacies - ended in defeat . 
Against this background , AIPAC should have known that its attempt , in close cooperation with Obama &apos;s Republican opponents , to block the Iran nuclear deal ( one of Obama &apos;s most important achievements ) would fail . 
Indeed , Obama even used a tactic similar to that of George H.W. Bush to win the day . 
Just as Bush openly denounced the &quot; thousand lobbyists &quot; working the halls of the US Congress against a vital national interest , Obama said in a conference call that his critics &quot; would be opposed to any deal with Iran , &quot; and called out AIPAC &apos;s $ 20 million advertising campaign against the agreement . 
He also put AIPAC in the same category as the Republicans who &quot; were responsible &quot; for leading the US into the Iraq war . 
For AIPAC - which has traditionally relied on a broad coalition of social and political forces in the US that view Israel &apos;s security as both a moral cause and a vital national interest - this is not any old defeat . 
The Republican-backed crusade against a key agreement negotiated by a Democratic president , with his party &apos;s overwhelming support , has threatened the bipartisan foundations of Israel &apos;s cause in America . 
Of course , the nuclear deal involved more than just the US and Iran . 
AIPAC was opposing an international agreement that six major world powers - China , France , Germany , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the US - had already signed and that the United Nations had approved . 
Even some of Israel &apos;s staunchest supporters in Congress were unlikely to deal a potentially devastating blow to America &apos;s international credibility , and the idea that the negotiating countries would all agree to reopen the talks to produce a &quot; better deal &quot; was sheer fantasy . 
Yet that is the objective that Netanyahu set for AIPAC . 
The row over the Iran deal is bound to be a watershed moment for American Jews , among whom sharp divisions have formed . 
Indeed , the American Jewish Committee 2015 Survey of American Jewish Opinion reports the emergence of &quot; two diverging Jewish sub-communities , &quot; with a growing number of Jews feeling alienated by the organizations that claim to represent them . 
AIPAC represents a striking anomaly in the life of American Jews . 
It is increasingly identified with the Republican agenda and Israel &apos;s evangelical Christian supporters , even though polls have repeatedly shown that Jews are America &apos;s most liberal ethnic group . 
The truth is that American Jews largely opposed the Iraq war . 
They overwhelmingly vote for the Democratic Party . 
They define their religion as moderate and liberal , with many upholding gay rights and abortion , both anathema to evangelical Christians . 
The majority of American Jews even support the creation of a Palestinian state . 
And , although they are far from united on the Iran deal , the agreement &apos;s supporters outnumber its opponents . 
Much of the blame for the damage that has been done - to AIPAC , American Jewish communities , and even the US political process - falls on Netanyahu . 
But he is unlikely to face retribution for any of it . 
On the contrary , the Obama administration has already begun the discussions it promised on upgrading Israel &apos;s strategic capabilities . 
As Arab countries throughout the Middle East melt down - with increasingly significant spillover effects in the West - Israel continues to represent a stable regional partner for the US . 
More dangerous , Netanyahu could achieve his next goal : preventing a strategic d√©tente between the US and Iran that would enable cooperation in resolving major regional conflicts , from Yemen to Syria . 
After all , Obama &apos;s victory on the nuclear deal may have been inevitable , but it was far from easy . 
An odd coalition of Iranian radicals , AIPAC , the Saudi-led Sunni alliance , the Israeli government , and US politicians from both parties have already compelled Obama to promise additional sanctions on Iran for its sponsorship of terrorism . 
As a result , America &apos;s cold war with Iran is likely to persist .
