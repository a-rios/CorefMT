Economic Crisis and Regional Integration 
PRINCETON - Everyone now knows that we are in the worst economic crisis since the 1930 &quot; s . 
The protectionist responses are sadly familiar : protests against foreign workers , demands for trade protection , and a financial nationalism that seeks to limit the flow of money across national frontiers . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , however , economic nationalism was not the only show in town . 
Many people started to think of regional integration as the answer to depression . 
But the sort of integration that occurs in times of economic crisis is often destructive . 
The most unattractive versions of 1930 &quot; s regionalism came from Germany and Japan , and represented nothing less than a practical extension of their power over vulnerable neighbors , which were forced into trade and financial dependence on the basis of Germany &apos;s Grosswirtschaftsraum or its Japanese equivalent , the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . 
As a consequence of the horrors of the 1930 &quot; s , there remains substantial suspicion of concepts like &quot; Greater East Asia . &quot; 
In the second half of the twentieth century , Europe had the chance to build a much more benevolent form of regionalism . 
The EU is suffering from a number of problems that have been widely discussed for many years , but never seemed to be that urgent . 
Suddenly , in the face of the economic crisis , these problems have become major sources of political instability . 
There is a common monetary policy in the euro-zone countries , and an integrated capital market with financial institutions that are active across national frontiers . 
But this set-up makes little sense in the face of the economic logic of European integration . 
The second obvious problem is the smallness of the EU &apos;s budget relative to those of the member states . 
But different governments have different degrees of fiscal room for maneuver . 
France and Germany , by contrast , have an inherently strong fiscal position . 
Moreover , the whole idea of Keynesian demand stimulus was developed , again in the 1930 &quot; s , in the context of self-contained national economies . 
Keynesians filled up the warm water of fiscal stimulus in a national bathtub . 
When the national bathtub has holes , and other people benefit from the warmth , the exercise loses its attraction . 
In any case , it only ever worked for the larger states . 
The smaller states could not do Keynesianism in a hand basin . 
There are ways to fix both the banking and the fiscal problem . 
Control of banking is the simplest . 
The European Central Bank clearly has the technical and analytical capacity to take on general supervision of European banks , using the member central banks as information conduits . 
The fiscal problem could be dealt with by issuing generally guaranteed European bonds , which might be a temporary measure , restricted to the financial emergency . 
Both bank regulation and fiscal policy require a great deal more Europeanization . 
The most obvious way is to use existing mechanisms and institutions , in particular the ECB or the European Commission . 
The difficulty with such a suggestion is that it would imply a relative weakening of the national states , including the largest , Germany and France . 
They would most likely resist , and try to stay in their own bathtubs . 
Indeed , the crisis has turned France and Germany once more into the key players of the European process . 
From the perspective of Berlin or Paris , there should be no systematic Europeanization . 
Instead , the large states are now promoting informal groupings to look for worldwide solutions . 
Overtones of the 1930 &quot; s are amplified , clearly exposing the Union &apos;s predicament , because of an odd coincidence : the Czech Republic now holds the EU &apos;s rotating presidency . 
The Czechs , probably the people with the most vivid historical memory of the bad regionalism of the 1930 &quot; s , succeeded France , the European country that today is the least constrained in asserting its national interest . 
The clash of two visions of Europe is eroding the political stability of an area that once represented the best model and greatest hope for benign regionalism .
