Is Ukraine Next ? 
LONDON - The war in Georgia has clearly exposed the security vacuum in the surrounding region , as well as a lot of raw nerves . 
Russia &apos;s hasty decision to recognize the &quot; independence &quot; of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was a shot across the bow for every former Soviet country , and has intensified speculation about who might be &quot; next &quot; - and how to prevent Russia from multiplying the supposed Kosovo &quot; precedent &quot; in other ex-Soviet countries . 
Having established itself as the main broker in the conflict , the European Union has many urgent priorities in Georgia itself . 
But it should also be thinking ahead about how it can demonstrate a stronger commitment to security , democracy , and prosperity in the European &quot; neighborhood . &quot; 
The most effective way of dealing with a newly assertive Russia will be for Europe to issue a collective refusal to accept a bipolar Europe of distinct Russian and EU spheres of influence . 
The place to start is Ukraine . 
Fortunately , the EU-Ukraine summit on September 9 in Evian , France , provides the perfect opportunity . 
Many Ukrainians now hear domestic echoes of the lead-up to war in Georgia . 
Ukraine has its own potentially separatist region in Crimea , and the country &apos;s Russian minority numbers some 8.3 million ( the largest minority in Europe ) . 
Half of Ukraine &apos;s population is Russian-speaking in various degrees . 
Although the Ukrainian constitution bans dual citizenship , the government has had to launch an inquiry into alleged covert Russian passport-holding in the Crimean city of Sevastopol . 
Ukrainians note that Russia justified its invasion of Georgia , as the Nazis justified their dismemberment of Czechoslovakia , as being necessary to &quot; protect &quot; a minority to whom they had just given citizenship . 
Russia has begun a war of words over Ukraine &apos;s supply of arms to Georgia . 
And the conflict itself has shown that the Russian Black Sea Fleet , based in Sevastopol , can operate with impunity , whether Ukraine likes it or not . 
Based on its analysis of Ukraine &apos;s &quot; Orange Revolution &quot; as a foreign-backed &quot; NGO revolution , &quot; Russia has also been quietly building its own network of Russia-friendly NGOs in Ukraine since 2004 . 
Ukrainians also talk of an otkat ekonomiya ( &quot; kickback economy &quot; ) , in which Russian money percolates throughout the Ukrainian elite . 
The European Neighborhood Policy is worthy enough , but it does not address the pressing concerns about maintaining and securing Ukraine &apos;s independence . 
Many member states will worry about leaping straight to the contentious issue of ultimate membership for Ukraine , but the EU already recognizes Ukraine &apos;s theoretical right to join once it has met the Copenhagen criteria ; and it cannot be beyond EU leaders &quot; verbal dexterity to play up the prospect . 
What Ukraine would value most is a real sense that it is being treated distinctly in its own right . 
The key words are &quot; association &quot; and &quot; partnership , &quot; in whatever order or combination . 
The EU has more scope for short-term measures , and should develop a multi-dimensional solidarity strategy as a signal to both Ukraine and Russia . 
For example , the EU &apos;s foreign ministers should invite their Ukrainian counterpart to give a briefing on Ukraine-Russia relations at their next meeting . 
Ukraine should be offered a road map for visa-free travel . 
And the EU should back Ukraine if it insists that the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaves on schedule in 2017 . 
The EU should also launch a comprehensive study of all aspects of Europe &apos;s reliance on Russian energy supplies , including transit , energy security and conservation , supply diversification , and the impact of &quot; bypass &quot; pipelines like Nord Stream and South Stream . 
It should consider linking the opening of the Nord Stream pipeline , which would allow Russia to cut off gas to Poland and Ukraine while maintaining deliveries to Germany , to the opening of the proposed &quot; White Stream &quot; pipeline to bring gas from Azerbaijan directly to Ukraine via Georgia , bypassing Russia . 
The EU could even play a part in keeping the 2012 European Championship football finals on track . 
The decision to appoint Ukraine and Poland as co-hosts was a powerful symbol of European unity across the current EU border ( Poland is a member , Ukraine is not ) . 
UEFA is unhappy with Ukraine &apos;s progress in building the necessary infrastructure , but Ukraine should be given time to get its act together . 
Where appropriate , the EU should extend these measures to Moldova , which is now calling Ukraine a &quot; strategic shelter . &quot; 
Ukraine faces a crucial presidential election in 2009 or 2010 ( and Moldova will hold elections in March 2009 ) . 
After getting its fingers badly burned at the last election in 2004 , Russia is clearly tempted to intervene again . 
The &quot; Russian factor &quot; will strongly influence the campaign . 
Greater Western engagement is needed to ensure that the &quot; Europe factor &quot; is equally prominent .
