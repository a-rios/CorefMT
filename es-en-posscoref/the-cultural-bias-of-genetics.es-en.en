The Cultural Bias of Genetics 
All cultures impose on their members ideas about who they are , how they came to be , and where they fit in socially . 
For example , pre-modern Europe believed that a woman who had sex before marriage might carry the imprint of her lover within her , so that her child born in wedlock would resemble the earlier lover , rather than the husband . 
This served to justify the premium placed on female chastity . 
Folk ideas about heredity are a particularly powerful cultural tool , but they are not unique to pre-modern societies . 
Even contemporary science has its own cultural ideologies about heredity , which are often difficult to disentangle from the complex data and high technology that we believe produces objective , value-free glimpses of nature . 
In the field of human origins , it is well-known that a human DNA sequence is nearly 99 % identical to the corresponding part of a chimpanzee &apos;s DNA . 
From there , it is not uncommon to hear the conclusion that we are &quot; nothing but &quot; chimpanzees ( and fated to be aggressive , or to possess whatever attributes are being imputed to apes these days ) , or that apes merit human rights . 
Once again , social meanings are enmeshed within beliefs about heredity . 
Actually , that overwhelming similarity between human and chimpanzee DNA is a product of two cultural facts : our familiarity with the chimpanzee &apos;s body , and our unfamiliarity with DNA . 
After all , when the chimpanzee itself was new and interesting ( in the 1700 &quot; s ) , contemporary scholars commonly judged it to be overwhelmingly similar to the human form - so much so , that it was commonly classified as a variant of humans . 
After several centuries studying apes , we are familiar with every subtle difference in form between our species and theirs . 
But the emergence of molecular comparisons in the 1960 &quot; s , and DNA technologies in the 1980 &quot; s , presented a new way of comparing species . 
The comparison of linear polymers - proteins made up of chains of amino acids , or DNA made up of chains of nucleotides - held out the promise of a simple tabular approach to evolution . 
When we compare the genetic material of humans and chimpanzees , we do , indeed , find that it corresponds at nearly 99 of every 100 comparable sites . 
But this method omits much of what has been learned about genomic evolution in the last quarter-century . 
Mutational processes are far more complex than was thought a few decades ago ; with strand slippage , duplication , transposition , and illegitimate recombination producing qualitative differences between closely-related genomes . 
So , while measuring nucleotide similarity in homologous regions is indeed in the 98-99 % range , this number does not incorporate or acknowledge the measured difference in the size of the human and chimp genomes , or the widespread differences in chromosome or genome structure . 
Because a DNA sequence is a one-dimensional entity , it lends itself much better to single-number comparisons than a four-dimensional body does . 
The genes that lead to the production of the human and chimpanzee femur may be 98-99 % identical , but it is impossible to say whether the bones themselves are more or less similar than that . 
Perhaps the most seductive aspect of the DNA comparison is its lack of biological context . 
The value of 98-99 % similarity between human and ape DNA stands outside the rest of life . 
We can gain some zoological perspective on what that number really means by comparing another species to apes and humans . 
Compared to the body of an oyster , for example , chimpanzees and humans are at least 99 % identical - bone for bone , muscle for muscle , nerve for nerve , organ for organ . 
If anything , the DNA comparison underestimates the profound similarity of the human and ape bodies in the great tapestry of nature . 
Context reveals something at the low end of the scale as well . 
Two DNA sequences generated at random must be 25 % identical , by virtue of the fact that DNA is a sequence of only four bases . 
Therefore , all multicellular life , having presumably developed from a single common ancestral form , must be over 25 % identical in their DNA sequences . 
In other words , a human and a carrot have much in common genetically , despite their being little similarity between them physically . 
Here the DNA comparison grossly overestimates the actual relationships between species . 
Genetic comparisons simply do not afford an &quot; inner view &quot; of the relationships between species , or an encapsulation of those relationships . 
In other words , this apparent fact of nature - the overwhelming genetic similarity of human and ape - is a fact constructed from culture . 
That is not to say it is inaccurate or false ; just that its meaning is far less obvious than it may appear superficially . 
We make sense of the world , and of our place in it , culturally - and science provides more information for constructing that place . 
But like any other peoples , our own application of that information to the puzzle of our existence is strongly influenced by our non-scientific ideas , our pervasive folk ideologies of heredity .
