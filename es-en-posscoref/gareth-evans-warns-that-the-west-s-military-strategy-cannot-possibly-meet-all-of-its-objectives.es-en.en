The Limits to Fighting the Islamic State 
CANBERRA - There is a long history of misconceived and over-reaching foreign military intervention in the Middle East , and it is to be hoped that US President Barack Obama &apos;s decision to wage war against the Islamic State will not prove to be another . 
No terrorist group more richly deserves to be destroyed outright than these marauding , genocidal jihadists . 
But as the US-led mission is currently conceived and described , it is not clear whether its objectives are achievable at acceptable costs in terms of time , money , and lives . 
The basic problem is that the Islamic State &apos;s territorial gains are being approached from three completely different perspectives , demanding three different types of operational responses . 
There is the humanitarian mission to protect civilian populations in Iraq and Syria from mass-atrocity crimes . 
There is the need to protect other states &quot; citizens from Islamic State terrorism . 
And there is the desire to restore states &quot; integrity and stability in the region . 
Obama &apos;s rhetoric , and that of his most enthusiastic partner so far , Australia &apos;s Prime Minister Tony Abbott , has wobbled between the first two objectives and hinted at the third , creating hopes and expectations that all three will be effectively pursued . 
But only the humanitarian mission has any realistic chance of being delivered through the four-part strategy now on the table : air strikes against Islamic State forces ; training , intelligence , and equipment for Iraqi and Kurdish military forces and Syria &apos;s non-extremist opposition ; intensified international counterterrorism efforts ; and humanitarian assistance to displaced civilians . 
It is obvious that Western-led military operations cannot by themselves re-establish the territorial integrity of Iraq or Syria , or restore wider regional stability . 
Military intervention may help to hold the line against Iraq &apos;s further disintegration and the spread of the Islamic State cancer into countries like Jordan . 
But if 150,000 US troops could not stabilize Iraq in the absence of an inclusive and competent government , the limited measures on offer now simply will not suffice . 
And we should know by now that any Western military intervention with overtly political , rather than clearly humanitarian , objectives runs a real risk of inflaming sectarian sentiment . 
Things might be different if the US and other key players could simultaneously embark on a broad regional stabilization enterprise , but there are too many competing agendas to make this realistic for the foreseeable future . 
The Sunni-Shia rivalry means that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries will concede no meaningful role to Iran . 
Nor will the West acknowledge Iran &apos;s centrality to any multilateral process , for fear of losing negotiating leverage with respect to Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Few are willing to accept that Syria &apos;s President Bashar al-Assad , despite his abominable record , now almost certainly must be part of the solution . 
And the open sore of the Israel-Palestine conflict plays into every other rivalry . 
The counter-terrorism objective is more inherently plausible than that of political stabilization , and domestic politics in the US , Australia , and elsewhere probably require the prominence that it has received from Western leaders . 
To the extent that their breeding ground can be destroyed , as Al Qaeda &apos;s was in Afghanistan , there will be fewer newly minted terrorists to worry about . 
But it is difficult to believe that a military campaign of the kind now contemplated , even with substantial support from Arab countries , can achieve that objective any time soon , or at an acceptable cost , in both Iraq and in the Islamic State &apos;s Syrian havens . 
The real burden will have to be borne , as now , by effective international cooperation in intelligence and policing . 
The competence of Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces - crucial if territory is to be taken and held - will take time to build up , and may never be achievable with the so-called moderate forces within Syria . 
Airstrikes anywhere risk civilian casualties - and thus the possibility of inflaming the very sentiments one is trying to counter . 
Moreover , airstrikes in Syria without the government &apos;s consent or Security Council authorization will be manifestly in breach of the United Nations Charter . 
The prospect of Islamic State-inspired terrorist attacks in the US are not remotely real or imminent enough to justify reliance on the self-defense exception . 
Hearts and minds matter in counterterrorism , and they become harder to win whenever the US and its supporters embark upon military action clearly in breach of international law . 
The slow buy-in so far of Arab states to Obama &apos;s campaign attests to the nervousness that many of them feel on all of these grounds . 
By far the most defensible rationale for military action is - and has been from the outset - the humanitarian objective : the responsibility to protect populations at risk of genocide , ethnic cleansing , and other major crimes against humanity and war crimes . 
I have argued that all of the conditions necessary in this context have been satisfied , and this will continue to be the case so long as the Islamic State maintains its horrifying modus operandi . 
Operating within this framework , US and coalition forces would clearly be entitled to disrupt , degrade , and seek to destroy the Islamic State &apos;s capability in a way that would also serve the counter-terrorist objective . 
But the primary objective for intervention would remain unequivocally humanitarian , and as such would be much less susceptible to anti-Western blowback than any other mission . 
There may even be considerable international tolerance for some carefully defined and limited action in Syria in the event of an obvious imminent humanitarian threat . 
If the campaign against the Islamic State is defined and conducted with humanitarian protection as its primary and overwhelming objective , it should succeed not only in stopping further atrocities , but also in making large inroads into curbing the wider terrorist threat at its source . 
If the West strays from that primary goal , the enterprise is likely to end in tears , like so many others in the Middle East .
