Europe as a Task 
For me as Prime Minister of the Czech Republic , Europe has a meaning that goes far beyond geography . 
It is a synonym for a new beginning , new hope , the rule of the &quot; better me &quot; that exists in all of us . 
It &apos;s an expression of prosperity , progress , and justice . 
Perhaps these words sound exaggerated to cynical ears . 
But they clearly express the changes that Europe has witnessed over the past half-century , changes for the good that all Czechs now want to secure for themselves , having been denied the fruits of European peace and prosperity for so long . 
Throughout its history , Europe saw countless bloody conflicts ; peoples and states clashed , with the Czech lands often the bloody crossroads of these battles . 
The disasters of two world wars , and the half-century of Cold War , pushed Europe to embrace cooperation and integration in order to avoid another suicidal battle . 
Those far-sighted Europeans who set Europe on its road to peace through unification deserve our heartfelt appreciation . 
Simply put , the idea of European integration transformed our continent . 
The open economic space and the principle of solidarity helped ensure that economically less developed countries that joined the European Economic Community and , later , the European Union , progressed at an astonishing pace , enhancing the living standards of their peoples . 
Nowadays , indeed , instead of deepening disparities in standards of living in Europe , which was the historic norm , differences are actually blurring as the quality of life everywhere in Europe rises . 
Yet this prosperous and peaceful Europe is not idyllic ; sometimes Europe is not at all an easy place for its citizens to live , as the tumultuous Balkan Wars and painful postcommunist transitions of the past decade demonstrated . 
But even in hard times , every European knows deep down that European integration has delivered peace with clear prospects for broadening Europe &apos;s zone of peace and stability . 
On the other hand , to secure that promise of peace and stability , Europeans must recognize that the Union is not and cannot be perceived as a work set in stone . 
The half-century of peace that integration has delivered involved constant changes . 
Today , we must also continue forming and correcting the EU to maximize its ability to reflect the needs of its inhabitants in an ever-changing world . 
These changes , however , must always be undertaken in the light of core European virtues . 
Foremost among these , perhaps , is the Union &apos;s open character . 
The European Union is neither closed nor static ; it is a living organism . 
The European Union , as I grasp it , is primarily a process , leading from worse to better ; a process with only one end - the continuous development of European prosperity and peace . 
Indeed , it is vital to understand that Europe &apos;s integration process is not mechanical but organic . 
It is not a machine that goes on of its own accord , but is instead something that must be lived and worked for by Europeans . 
For no one should be mistaken : there are alternatives to European integration - all of them bad , unwanted , and dangerous . 
Unless all Europeans remain devoted to integration and the creation of an open Europe , the Continent &apos;s dark past may once again become its future . 
There are a number of qualities that must be understood if integration is to continue to build an ever more open Europe . 
Voluntary self-restraint , a voluntary sharing of our own rights and privileges with a wider collective , is paramount here . 
While states once enforced their rights at the expense of others , they now transfer their rights in favor of others . 
The heart of this miracle is that it benefits all - Europe &apos;s citizens , its states , the whole continent , and the world . 
For states to voluntarily limit themselves is unique in human history . 
Europe &apos;s states have been able to achieve this discipline primarily because they are democracies . 
Europe &apos;s peoples have sanctioned limiting their own governments powers so as to achieve peace across Europe . 
There would be no Union and no integration , were it not built on the principles of democracy . 
This is why , having regained their democratic regimes , Central and Eastern European countries unequivocally voted to join the continent &apos;s integration process . 
This is why these countries associate the future of their democracies with ever-closer and more integrated cooperation with other European states . 
Of course , democracy does not automatically mean integration . 
But without democracy , no genuine , fair , and universally beneficial integration would be possible . 
The people of the Czech Republic , like most Europeans , wish to jointly build an irreversible system of mutual relationships among states , regions , municipalities , and their inhabitants . 
Their desire is to eliminate violence and , at the same time , generate stable conditions for economic and social progress for everyone in Europe . 
The end of history may not be at hand in Europe , but the end of Europe &apos;s dark history is clearly in sight - so long as Europeans continue on the path of integration .
