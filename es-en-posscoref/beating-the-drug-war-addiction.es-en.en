Beating the Drug-War Addiction 
BUENOS AIRES - In January , US President Barack Obama nominated Marine Corps Lieutenant General John F. Kelly to head the United States Southern Command ( USSOUTHCOM ) . 
Based in Miami , Florida , USSOUTHCOM runs military operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean , and is the key US &quot; drug warrior &quot; in the region . 
Across the region , the key question , among civilian and military leaders alike , is whether the change in commanders will bring with it a change in focus . 
The top priority for USSOUTHCOM is to fight narcotics trafficking from the Andes to the Rio Grande . 
With the Cold War &apos;s end , fighting communism was no longer the US armed forces main objective ; 
But the change in commanders is an opportunity for the US to revise , at long last , its regional doctrine in order to address other pressing security needs . 
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 paradoxically reinforced the US military &apos;s focus on countering illicit drug traffickers . 
While other US forces became heavily involved in the &quot; war on terrorism , &quot; USSOUTHCOM scaled up its &quot; war on drugs , &quot; with its commanders targeting the industry &apos;s bosses in the Andes , Mexico , and Central America . 
That happened in part because , following 9 / 11 , Latin America was the only region of the world that did not witness an attack by transnational terrorists linked to al-Qaeda , so there seemed to be little need to pursue counter-terrorist activity there . 
And , with the US continuing to be the world &apos;s largest market for illegal drugs , its leaders &quot; focus on the drug war in Latin America does not appear misguided , at least not on the surface . 
That focus has not only made USSOUTHCOM a major recipient of federal funds , but has also turned it into something akin to an autonomous drug-fighting agency . 
From the region &apos;s perspective , USSOUTHCOM appears to be a vaguely &quot; independent &quot; military arm of US policymakers &quot; global anti-drug strategy , with scant accountability or congressional oversight , and with significant resources for aggressive anti-drug operations . 
Indeed , USSOUTHCOM has controlled 75 % of the more than $ 12 billion that the US government has allocated to anti-drug activities in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2000 . 
But , despite this expensive military campaign , all evidence shows that the &quot; war on drugs &quot; has been a fiasco . 
The failure has been dramatic . 
In Mexico , roughly 48,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Felipe Calder√≥n was elected President in 2006 . 
And Mexico is not alone . 
Drug-trafficking activities have grown significantly throughout Central America and the Caribbean , fueling an unprecedented increase in the murder rate - which has doubled in countries like Guatemala and Jamaica - over the last decade . 
Moreover , the cultivation , processing , and trafficking of cocaine and heroin continues throughout the Andean Ridge , despite tough eradication measures and extradition of traffickers by the US . 
Simultaneously , new transshipment routes ( via Ecuador in the Pacific and Venezuela in the Atlantic ) have developed , while drug barons , coca growers , and warlords have proliferated . 
South America &apos;s southern cone - especially Argentina and Chile - has not been immune to the vast expansion of organized crime , money laundering , and demand for narcotics elsewhere in the region . 
And , throughout Latin America , the situation has only worsened since the 1990 &quot; s . 
Indeed , Latin American countries &quot; US-backed fight against drugs has had universally destructive consequences in terms of civil-military relations , human-rights violations , and corruption . 
The US cannot deny this disaster . 
Its drug warriors must reevaluate their position and terminate what has become an increasingly senseless and futile struggle . 
Thus , the most critical question facing Kelly as he assumes his new command is whether he can redefine USSOUTHCOM &apos;s role in the fight against illegal drugs . 
The military and political challenges are significant , the risks are considerable , and the benefits are uncertain . 
But if USSOUTHCOM does not implement major changes in how it prosecutes the drug war , the US will find itself facing an increasingly volatile and dangerous set of neighbors to the south .
