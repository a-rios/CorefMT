The Autumn of the Commandante 
The death watch for Fidel Castro is something that only Gabriel Garcia Marquez could get right . 
His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor , political paralysis , and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator . 
Commandante Fidel &apos;s departure from power , of course , will be solely a matter of biology , and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he took ill last year clearly show biology at work . 
When the end comes , change in Cuba could be as vast as any that greeted the end of the last century &apos;s great dictators . 
Stalin , Franco , Tito , Mao : all were mostly alike in their means and methods . 
How they passed from the scene , however , was often very different , and these differences can shape societies for years and decades to come . 
Consider the Soviet Union . 
On March 9 , 1953 , from the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea , everything stood still ; likewise in Warsaw , Budapest , Prague , and East Berlin . 
In Beijing , Mao Zedong himself bowed low before an immense effigy of Joseph Stalin . 
Huge mourning crowds , crying , nearly hysterical , could be seen all over the vast empire Stalin had ruled . 
Yet , within days , the word Stalinism was being expunged from a new Soviet dictionary , and three years later my grandfather , Nikita Khrushchev , denounced Stalin &apos;s &quot; cult of personality &quot; in his famous &quot; Secret Speech &quot; to the Communist Party &apos;s XXth Congress . 
The Khrushchev thaw that followed may have been short-lived , but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened - a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized upon in 1985 . 
The death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito brought forth an outpouring of another sort . 
For decades , his personal rule imposed a false unity on Yugoslavia . 
Following his death in 1980 , that artificial state began to unravel , culminating in the genocidal wars in Bosnia , Croatia , and Kosovo of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Not all long-term dictatorships , however , end in disintegration and mayhem . 
Mao &apos;s death allowed for Deng Xiaoping &apos;s return from disgrace and internal exile . 
Deng quickly routed Mao &apos;s &quot; Gang of Four &quot; heirs , and in only a few years opened China &apos;s economy , fueling a capitalist revolution that has transformed China far more completely - and successfully - than Mao &apos;s socialist revolution ever did . 
The Communist Party , of course , remains in power , and Mao &apos;s portrait still looms over Tiananmen Square . 
But both are mere relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been consigned to the dustbin of history . 
Spain , too , escaped violent dissolution when Generalissimo Francisco Franco &apos;s fascist dictatorship collapsed at his death . 
Here the old dictator can take some credit , for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died , Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew . 
Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build , with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez , was the modern , democratic Spain of today . 
It was no accident that communist countries were ( and are ) usually run by geriatric leaders , and democracies by younger men and women . 
That difference matters . 
Old leaders can preside successfully over smoothly running countries that need no radical re-examination of their policies and purposes . 
There are exceptions to this rule , of course - Churchill , Adenauer , Deng , Reagan - but states cannot count on fortune bringing an exceptional ruler their way . 
Younger leaders are more likely to be able to cope with the chop and change of difficult times . 
Political competition makes it necessary for all politicians , whatever their age , to stay on their toes , anticipate new problems , and remain open to new ideas aimed at addressing them . 
No one can keep himself ensconced in high office subject only to death or his own boredom . 
One-party systems , one-man charismatic dictatorships , or a mixture of the two , as in Tito &apos;s Yugoslavia , are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and inert governments . 
So what will become of Cuba after Fidel departs ? 
Many observers portray Raúl Castro , Fidel &apos;s younger brother and designated heir , as a pragmatist - the &quot; practical Castro . &quot; 
When Cuba &apos;s lavish Soviet subsidies vanished in the early 1990 &quot; s , it was Raúl who recognized that the regime &apos;s survival required economic reforms , pressing to allow private agricultural markets to reopen in order to boost food production and stave off possible starvation . 
However , this is the same man who , as the head of Cuba &apos;s internal security apparatus , for many years represented the knuckles of an iron-fisted regime , directly responsible for imprisoning - and often torturing - thousands of dissidents . 
So perhaps the best that could be hoped for is a Russian-style experiment with liberalization that is quickly called off by the regime &apos;s nervous Old Guard . 
Moreover , with the support of oil-rich allies like Venezuela &apos;s President Hugo Chávez - and with the recent discovery of significant crude reserves off Cuba &apos;s own coast - introducing reforms could well become less urgent . 
In that case , Raúl may seek to cling grimly to the fossilized system that he helped build and maintain with such brutality . 
But Raúl Castro is an old man himself , so we can hope for the prospect that some Deng or , better yet , a Suarez will ultimately emerge from the wreckage of Fidelism . 
But for now , younger communist officials , like Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque , remain ideological hardliners whom many Cubans refer to as &quot; los Taliban . &quot; 
If they take control and stick to their guns , Cuba could face another long biology lesson .
