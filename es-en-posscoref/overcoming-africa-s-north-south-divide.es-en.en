Overcoming Africa &apos;s North-South Divide 
The late President Mobutu Sese Seko of former Zaire once declared that the North African countries , which pride themselves on their Arabic descent , should be excluded from the then Organization of African Unity . 
Mobutu &apos;s rule was , of course , deeply flawed , but he was not alone within the pan-African movement in such thinking . 
The antagonism between the blacks of sub-Saharan Africa and the inhabitants of the continent &apos;s north remains a reality that impedes the prospect of any union between them . 
Northern hostility , separatism , and racism toward the southerners are at the center of this split . 
However , in our current era of political correctness , outright separation between the north and the south remains unmentionable . 
In declaring that Egypt was an Arab republic , President Gamel Abdel Nasser was falsifying history , erasing 3000 years of a culture neatly intertwined with black Africa . 
Indeed , for nearly three centuries , from 950 to 663 BC , black pharaohs and queens such as Tii from the &quot; land of Kush &quot; - today &apos;s black Sudan - ruled Egypt . 
More grotesquely , when the Americans decided to finance a film on the life of Anwar Sadat , the Egyptians objected because the actor chosen to play Sadat was black . 
Similarly , when Morocco quit the OAU in 1984 , it dreamed of European Union membership . 
Sudan &apos;s ruling class - descendants of Arab slaves - have no qualms about bombing , killing , and displacing millions of their black citizens in the south and now in the Darfur region , with the backing of the Arab League . 
And when Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Khadafi , disappointed by the pan-Arabism he advocated , turned to championing pan-Africanism , his people continued to riot to chase out black immigrants . 
Mauritania &apos;s leaders quit ECOWAS , the West African regional grouping , to join the union formed by the North African countries . 
These countries &quot; attitude reflects that of the Arabs themselves . 
When al-Qaeda decided to take on the United States , it targeted the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , killing more than 260 people . 
With the exception of 12 US citizens , all were black civilians , while more than 4,000 Kenyans and Tanzanians were injured . 
Justifying the killings of black Africans , a leading Arab commentator invoked Stalin : &quot; One can &apos;t make an omelet without breaking eggs . &quot; 
In Saudi Arabia , the racism against black Muslims is so acute that one wonders if it is worth it for them to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca , one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith . 
As a Muslim and a world traveler , I have never experienced as much ostracism as I did in Saudi Arabia as a pilgrim . 
Why then , should sub-Saharan black Africans keep alive the mirage of a union with the North African countries ? 
The Egyptians , with a historical civilization second to none in terms of achievements in all walks of life , want desperately to associate with the Arabs , with whom they have no kinship other than colonization . 
Likewise , the other people of North African countries are Berbers who , less than half a century ago , were given cash incentives to learn Arabic . 
The African Union needs thorough rethinking . 
Diversity must be a source of richness , not antagonism , and countries that favor the latter must be excluded . 
This would entail the dismantling of the African Union in its current form , which in any case is built on shaky grounds , since its designers seemed to favor plagiarizing the European Union - hardly a bureaucratic model worth emulating . 
But African leaders have no interest in a real African Union . 
They derive their powers from the fragmentation of the continent , and one cannot expect them to renounce that stance for the sake of the well-being of the masses . 
Consequently , a United States of Africa would have to stem from the grassroots , through existing institutions of civil society like professional associations , trade unions , and other non-governmental organizations . 
It is worth remembering that the people who were instrumental in establishing the best and most enduring union of states in history , the United States of America , were political activists , not heads of states . 
In Latin America , the only breakthrough that dented post-independence domination by the descendants of European colonizers came from a black freedom fighter and unifier , Simon Bolivar , who united the region before being forced into exile in Jamaica . 
Now , Bolivar has an heir in Hugo Ch√°vez , and the Latin American political landscape is changing at breakneck speed under his inspiration and leadership . 
Inspired leadership is crucial to any process of nation building , and Africans should look to figures such as Bolivar , Martin Luther King , Jr . , Georges Padmore , W.E.B. Dubois , Kwame Nkrumah , and Cheikh Anta Diop to mount a resistance movement against their mostly corrupt and incompetent leaders ( a Herculean task , indeed ) . 
Only then could they fulfill the dream of a common African identity and the establishment of a United States of Africa .
