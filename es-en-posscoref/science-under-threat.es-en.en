Science Under Threat 
PARIS : A century ago , pondering what the future might bring , Anatole France said that &quot; my dream is to read the books of schoolboys as they shall be in the year 2000 . &quot; 
As the millennium passes into history , perhaps we should ask if our schoolchildren are being inspired in the way Anatole France once hoped . 
The 20th century saw great technical revolutions , such as television , air transport , and rocketry . 
At a deeper level , two conceptual revolutions also occurred . 
From atoms to stars , we now have a precise , operative picture of nearly all physical phenomena . 
The only major gap in our knowledge involves the origins of the universe . 
The second conceptual revolution was started by molecular biology . 
Here too we now have a precise , operative picture of all life processes , from bacteria to humanity . 
Again , the only major gap concerns origins : the notion of a &quot; primordial soup &quot; in the oceans in which nucleotides and peptides somehow organized themselves into living organisms is not fully convincing . 
Today &apos;s schoolbooks recount these achievements with pride . 
But something important for scientific advance is missing in our children &apos;s lives . 
A sense of wonder about future scientific progress is lacking ; a growing cultural disinterest in science is taking hold . 
Moreover , increasing legal roadblocks to scientific progress are stifling inventiveness everywhere . 
Anatole France lived in an age of great inventors like Gustave Eiffel and Thomas Edison . 
He could discern the looming industrial explosion of the 20th century , when a few major companies drove technical innovation and made electricity , chemistry , transport , communications , and computers key parts of everyday life . 
But these same companies , which shaped much of the 20th century , are now under myopic pressure from their shareholders to abandon long-term research in favor of short-term profits . 
Look at the oil companies : although the world faces growing uncertainty about new sources of energy , these companies , which have both the intellectual and material means to prepare for the next century , have more or less abandoned their role as providers of a new vision . 
While the spirit of waning interest in basic science , which characterizes today &apos;s large industrial groups , dominates in Europe , a brilliant American countermeasure has been the rise of small &quot; high tech &quot; companies that engage in basic research and long-term reflection . 
As a result , America offers better conditions for scientists than Europe , and the cost of this to Europe is high . 
In the last five years , France alone lost some of its best computer scientists to the United States . 
But not all is well in America either . 
Indifference - indeed , sometimes outright hostility - to scientific progress exists there as well . 
One institution that blunts the dynamism of Silicon Valley and the high tech companies is the legal system . 
We had a taste of the American courts at my small place at the Ecole de Physique et Chimie in Paris , when one of our teams invented a clever system to monitor the heartbeat of a new-born baby . 
A special bed sheet monitored the vital signs , without any instrument attached to the body . 
The device was of potentially great benefit to babies born in families with a history of sudden infant death . 
Manufacture in the US , however , was blocked because of the threat of liability . 
If just one child died on this sheet , no matter the cause , the company producing the sheet would likely be held liable . 
So the sheet was not produced , and thousands of families are forced to continue using old , painful monitoring systems . 
Legal roadblocks are spreading to other countries , but they are not alone in inhibiting science . 
Another American invention - one increasingly exported to Europe - is the advocacy of so- called &quot; political correctness &quot; which views much of science as &quot; a rape of Nature . &quot; 
Often reduced to anti-scientific propaganda , these ideas are diffused from non-scientific university departments to students , high school teachers , and ultimately to young children . 
Everywhere you look , the excitement about scientific advance that gripped Anatole France is being replaced by ignorant fear and incipient censorship of scientific thinking . 
The young are particularly vulnerable to this . 
In the popular mind , science is blamed for deadly weapons and environmental pollution , even if the decisions to produce weapons are political , not scientific in nature , and the main reason for pollution is the profit motive , not scientific progress . 
Indeed , politically correct critics forget that most progress in the fight against pollution comes from scientists , and that science created the means to monitor arms control agreements . 
It is no wonder , therefore , that locally trained young people in America , and to a large extent in Europe , tend to avoid university science departments , with new students largely recruited from among recent immigrants . 
In the face of legal impediments , contempt , and indifference , what will science do in the 21st century ? 
My hope is that the coming years will witness , among other things , an explosion in bio-engineering , with new forms of drug delivery , artificial organs , and so on . 
None of these advances will occur , however , without a change in attitude . 
In place of today &apos;s indifference and sometimes outright hostility , we must create conditions that will nurture scientific research and restore the central position of science in the culture of Western societies . 
Cutting down legal impediments and changing attitudes won &apos;t happen overnight . 
Primo Levi , the Italian chemist who escaped death in the Nazi camps to become a writer , wrote movingly about his life as a chemist and about &quot; the strong and bitter flavor of our trade , which is nothing more than one special case , a more bold version , of the trade of life . &quot; 
If the spirit of scientific exploration and creativity is to be renewed in our time , we must create educational systems and schoolbooks informed by the spirit of Primo Levi .
