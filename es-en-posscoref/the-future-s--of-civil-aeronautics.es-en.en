The Future ( s ) of Civil Aeronautics 
HAMPTON , VIRGINIA  -  Civil aeronautics is in the midst of becoming a &quot; mature &quot; industry , with all the drawbacks that this entails . 
For decades , technological advances have been essentially incremental , and the industry remains largely based on long-haul transport aircraft , with an emerging small jet component and a legacy of general aviation markets and products . 
But it has become increasingly clear that the industry cannot survive in this form . 
The problems bedeviling the industry include pollution from emissions , increasing competition ( particularly from communications technology , which has made business travel less necessary ) , air traffic control delays and inefficiencies , expanding noise restrictions , safety and security concerns , and an overall business environment highly dependent on fuel prices . 
Solutions for all of these problems will probably require a complete reinvention of airplane technology . 
The greatest hope is to be found in the ongoing information , Bio- , Nano- , Energetics , and Quantum technology revolutions . 
The IT revolution and associated &quot; swarm &quot; technologies enable the foremost solution : a &quot; digital airspace &quot; that is wholly automatic in terms of air traffic control , navigation , and vehicle operations . 
Automatic aircraft operation is already becoming commonplace - especially in the military - but further increases will require a similarly automatic airspace . 
A digital airspace would in turn enable a complete revolution in personal mobility . 
Together with new technologies enabling Super-Short Takeoff and Landing ( superSTOL ) a digital airspace would put safe , quiet , affordable , street-in-front-of-your-house personal air vehicles within sight . 
So-called flying HumVee &apos;s ( high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles ) would create a superb transportation system for areas lacking intercity roads , and eventually would supplement - or perhaps supplant - automobiles . 
The variety of machines currently under study is accessible at www.roadabletimes.com . 
The estimated worldwide market for such vehicles is in the range of $ 1 trillion , and their use would erode the scheduled domestic airline customer base by enabling 300 kilometer &quot; commutes &quot; and providing huge cost avoidance for roads and bridges . 
Nevertheless , even given eventual development of an affordable , safe , fly / drive , airport-independent personal transportation system , there would still be a need to re-invent long-haul transport , especially for transoceanic flights . 
The current machines of this genre are direct descendants of the Boeing 707 , and , after many decades of evolutionary improvement , this design approach simply lacks the scope to address the many problems that must be solved . 
There are several alternatives , such as the blended wing body and strut / truss braced wings , which offer major potential increases in lift-to-drag ratio and improvements in structural weight fraction . 
Such improvements in these parameters would provide design margins to address most of the current problems , with the exception of emissions . 
The issue of water emissions can be addressed by designs that enable long-haul aircraft to cruise below 9,000 meters . 
Such designs could be enabled by using circulation control for high lift and employed at cruising altitude for ride quality . 
The resulting STOL ( short takeoff and landing ) performance could also improve airport productivity . 
On the other hand , emissions of carbon dioxide can be reduced simply by using biofuels , made from plants whose carbon dioxide &quot; price &quot; was paid via uptake of the very same gas from the atmosphere during their growth . 
Reductions of other greenhouse gases , such as nitric oxide , are attainable through clever combustor design . 
Given the number and severity of problems currently plaguing civil aeronautics , the conventional approach of evolutionary changes to current paradigms is no longer sufficient . 
Instead , the industry must re-invent itself . 
With the advent of a digital airspace , and with appropriate research support , success would be both possible and likely .
