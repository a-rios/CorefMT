Rogozin for President 
I have good news and bad news , but since I don &apos;t know which is which , I will convey them in their logical order . 
First , the name of Russia &apos;s next president is now known . 
Second , his name is Dmitriy Rogozin , the Motherland Party &apos;s most famous politician . 
Naturally , everything can change in the future , including Russia &apos;s constitutional norms . 
There were many more candidates in 1997 , three years before the 2000 presidential election , a veritable parade of names representing different sections of the nomenklatura and political spectrum : Chernomyrdin , Yavlinskiy , Lebed , Luzhkov , Nemtsov , Zhirinovskiy . 
Not all of them had realistic chances , but every one of them had the backing of a specific political force . 
And now ? 
None of these former candidates remains a serious political contender , although some are still quite young . 
Nor is a presidential candidate likely to be found among the regional governors , or among the leaders of the &quot; old &quot; or &quot; new &quot; parties . 
Why ? 
Russian voters tend to vote according to three main sentiments : anti-liberal , anti-oligarchic , and anti-Western ( more precisely , anti-American ) . 
It is Rogozin who articulates all three in the most spectacular , persistent , and public manner . 
In addition , Rogozin is a pro-Putin politician , which is also very important to the bulk of voters , and he has managed to confirm this not only verbally , but also bureaucratically , by his work as the president &apos;s special representative for Kaliningrad Oblast affairs . 
Prior to Motherland &apos;s sensational victory in the 2003 general election , Rogozin wanted the post of minister of foreign affairs . 
He will most likely nominate himself during the 2008 presidential election campaign , even if the Kremlin nominates another successor , although naturally he will try to ensure that he is anointed . 
So far , things are going extremely well for Dmitriy Rogozin . 
He is young , vigorous , charismatic , and educated , a patriot advocating a strong state . 
His electoral platform will remain the most promising in the immediate future , particularly since United Russia lacks the courage and flexibility to embrace contemporary Russian conservatism . 
At this point Rogozin is the most freethinking and freedom-loving politician in Russia . 
For example , Russia &apos;s most urgent foreign policy problems are its relations with the United States and the conflict over South Ossetia with neighboring Georgia . 
Rogozin very clearly articulates his positions on these issues , which are in variance with official policy - at least the one presented to the public . 
He reacts to Russia &apos;s domestic problems - widespread poverty , the situation in Chechnya , the fight against oligarchs - just as clearly , promptly , and explicitly , while most other politicians either keep silent or mumble incoherently . 
The so-called liberals are entirely invisible , and nobody cares about their opinion anyway . 
The Communists attract attention only by their internal squabbles . 
The nationalist warhorse Zhirinovskiy looks old and lifeless compared to Rogozin . 
The United Russia leaders are maneuvering between the president &apos;s contradictory remarks . 
The problem for United Russia is that Rogozin is already a master at their game . 
He remains a firm Putin supporter , skillfully combining criticism of virtually all aspects of Russia &apos;s foreign and domestic policy with a loyal - but not glorifying - attitude toward the president himself . 
In essence , Dmitriy Rogozin is currently the only real political orator in Russia - a highly advantageous position , particularly in an era of mediocrity . 
People have recently compared him to Georgia &apos;s President Mikhail Saakashvili - whether as an insult or as a compliment . 
Either intuitively or rationally , people feel that Rogozin , like Saakashvili , wants to assume the main post , is prepared to do so , and would start solving the state &apos;s territorial problems immediately . 
Parallels between Rogozin and Saakashvili appear even more logical in view of the current situation in the Caucasus . 
It is increasingly likely that Saakashvili &apos;s policy is aimed at instigating bloodshed in South Ossetia or Abkhazia and putting all the blame on Russia - a strategy that appears designed to bring the Americans to the region eventually . 
Against the backdrop of Russia &apos;s completely ambiguous policy in the Caucasus , this will give Rogozin an opportunity to remain at the top of public-opinion polls . 
If the next presidential election in Russia were held this year , and if no decision were made to banish him from Russians &apos; TV screens , there can be little doubt that Dmitriy Rogozin would win . 
Details will change by 2008 , but not trends , and Rogozin has mastered these trends better than anyone else . 
In fact , he is the only person who has mastered them so far . 
It can be dangerous to start one &apos;s electoral campaign before other candidates , but sometimes , if one starts much earlier than everyone else , serious rivals never appear .
