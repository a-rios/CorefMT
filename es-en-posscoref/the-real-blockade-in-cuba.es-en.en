The Real Blockade in Cuba 
Raúl Rivero Castañeda , a leading Cuban poet and dissident , was sentenced to 20 years in prison this week for organizing a petition that called for free elections . 
Written some months before his arrests , this article details Rivero Castañeda &apos;s objections to the Castro regime . 
HAVANA : A man riding the Chinese-made Forever brand bicycle under the Caribbean sun after eating a single slice of bread , washed down with very bad coffee , finds it difficult to ponder America &apos;s trade embargo against Cuba . 
Such a man has lunch on his mind-his and his family &apos;s . 
For him , abstract thought is a luxury that requires time , information , and a reason to reflect on a subject that , at first sight , appears to be from another galaxy . 
The truth is that ordinary Cubans are more oppressed by a personal embargo , one that has transformed them into blindfolded and muzzled pawns . 
The debate over the American embargo pales in comparison - removed to a far corner of the mind - to the obstructive domestic situation that envelops them . 
In this country , the real blockade , the one that affects the daily life of the people , is the internal governing system . 
It is the noose that ensures that Cuba remains immobilized and poor . 
The old standoff between the two nations is beside the point to ordinary people ; they desire a closer relationship with the US , where many of their families and friends live . 
However , no political process has created a smooth path toward such an ending . 
Thus , the stalemate between the two nations really concerns only Cubans who have time to contemplate lofty political questions . 
These individuals read newspapers fabricated in the offices of the Communist Party ; view only two television channels , both cut from the same cloth ; and listen to radios that play the same worn-out speeches . 
Cuba provides no free flow of information and its citizens receive and read only pure propaganda . 
While the public is suspicious of government proclamations , it has no means to be heard . 
Hence , its silence appears to sanction the situation . 
In reality , Cubans want to remove the inequalities that exist between the people and their leaders before they deal with the problems between their country and the US . 
Ordinary citizens want to own a modest business , have access to a free press , organize political parties , re-make society , and liberate prisoners . 
The authorities like to paint themselves as the victims of a powerful giant set on smothering a nation and its united people , but such a victim &apos;s face cannot be found when you look closely . 
The nation is not a united citizenry , but rather a mediocre country created through the universal gagging of its people . 
One can systematically catalog the ways that the authorities mistreat many of its people as terribly as they claim that Cuba &apos;s enemies treat her . 
These officials should take the money spent trying to convince other nations about the generous nature of Cuba &apos;s public health and education systems and apply it to the needs of Cuba &apos;s people . 
In fact , medical services are becoming more and more precarious and the educational system has not advanced beyond a common system of political indoctrination . 
Indeed , parents cannot really influence how schools shape their children . 
Whenever the government does address basic public welfare issues , its efforts merely produce dependent individuals who submit to the will of a self-selected group of leaders who are &quot; elected &quot; from time-to-time by fake elections . 
The leaders &apos; commitment to the sovereignty of the masses thus rings false . 
Talk about the Cubans &apos; free will is in reality a capricious and criminal act against the people . In recent weeks , thirty-six human rights activists , members of the alternative press , and representatives of the emerging civil rights movement have been imprisoned and may be tried . 
We can all agree that human beings are not duty-bound to live according to one master or philosophy ; that individuals must live freely , enjoying the right to a bountiful and joyful existence among family and friends . 
But in Cuba one lives in the midst of a propaganda machine that infiltrates life on a daily basis ; that emphasizes a climate of popular cheerfulness ; that portrays the joy of a neutered horse , with its ability to befuddle the innocent , inspire the ignorant , and comfort the frustrated . 
Cubans are in the end consigned to hold fast to rigid and impossible schemes . 
As a result , hundreds of thousands of young adults are embarked on a future whose path is strewn with risky symbols and immense challenges . 
Sensing that the door has been slammed shut against their country &apos;s future , they work diligently merely for their individual good .
