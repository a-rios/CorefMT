Financing Renewable Energy 
NEW YORK - There is plenty of money in the private sector to build up the world &apos;s renewable infrastructure as long as the numbers add up , and profit-seeking private investors will figure out how to do it without any financing help from government . 
But the numbers do not add up without some sort of subsidy . Wind energy , for example , is about 1.5 to 2 times as expensive as electricity from coal-fired plants . Even though wind is free and coal must be paid for , the initial capital costs of a wind turbine and transmission cables are much higher than for conventional power plants . Investors require above-market rates for renewable power or similar compensation that reflects the social benefits of emissions free energy . 
The case of my own firm , Christofferson , Robb 
Company ( CRC ) , illustrates how private capital markets can finance renewable energy when the subsidy is right . 
In 2005-2006 , my firm acquired 330-megawatt onshore projects in Germany and France . Our fund contributed the equity , and a bank lent the money needed to finance construction . 
Once the portfolio was assembled , we sold the projects to a special-purpose vehicle called CRC Breeze Finance , which issued € 470,000,000 of asset-backed securities . 
The wind farms that we built convert the wind &apos;s kinetic energy into electricity . 
The revenues gained from selling the electricity is used to repay CRC Breeze Finance &apos;s long-term debt . 
CRC keeps the money that &apos;s left over . Even if the wind does not blow as hard as usual or operating and maintenance expenses turn out to be higher than we assumed , there is enough of a cushion that bondholders will be paid out on schedule . Three years later , it &apos;s proceeding on course . 
The CRC Breeze portfolio generates expected annual returns of about 8 % , which were boosted to 15 % with the help of leverage . 
None of this would have been possible without government subsidies . 
In Germany , the Renewable Energy Act guarantees a feed-in tariff for 20 years and mandates the grid operator to purchase all the electricity a wind farm can produce at the guaranteed price . Our feed-in tariff was about € 83.6 per megawatt hour ( MW / h ) , compared with free market prices that have mainly ranged from € 30 - € 70 per MW / h . 
In the United States , the subsidy regime prior to July 2009 was based on production tax credits : for every MW / h of wind energy produced , the owner can deduct about $ 2.5 from its tax bill . This had two big defects . 
First , investors who could not use the tax deductions had to go to considerable expense to &quot; monetize &quot; the credits . 
Second , tax credits were subject to on-again , off-again authorization from Congress . 
This lack of certainty undermined investment in plant and equipment or R D. 
The US Department of Energy now provides an upfront payment to wind developers equal to 30 % of costs . 
But a 30 % cost rebate is not enough to stimulate development of offshore wind capacity . 
The US has no offshore wind farms , and no prospect of having any for at least five years . 
To consider just one obstacle , no vessels suitable for installing offshore foundations comply with the Jones Act , which requires that work on such projects use US-flag ships , constructed in the US , and owned and wholly operated by US citizens . 
Such ships would take two years to build , at a cost $ 50,000,000 . 
No one , insofar as I know , is rushing to build one . 
The reasons for offshore wind &apos;s failure to fulfill its promise in the United Kingdom are equally straightforward and have nothing to do with a lack of money . 
The subsidies are too small and too complicated to inspire capital outlays for expensive specialized equipment , including jack-up barges , heavy-lift cranes , pneumatic hammers for pounding the foundations into the sea bed , and high-strength gearboxes that will not corrode in humid , salty air . 
This is a pity , because the UK is missing out on the opportunity to build offshore generating capacity along its long , windy coastline . 
The UK needs offshore wind to meet its renewable targets , and in a few years it will need electricity from any source it can find just to keep the lights turned on . 
Fifteen months ago , in a submission to the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of Lords , I predicted that all existing UK projects except Thanet Offshore Wind would be abandoned or postponed unless Parliament radically altered its Renewable Obligation Certificates ( ROC ) scheme . 
I argued that , otherwise , the UK would be on track to add fewer than 300 MW of new wind capacity per year . 
This would lead to approximately three gigawatts of capacity by 2020 , which equates to 1 GW of continuous production - less than 2 % of 2007 consumption . 
So far , this is precisely what has happened . 
At the time , I proposed that the UK switch from a ROC regime to a 20-year feed-in tariff . I still believe that this is the right way to proceed . 
At a similar social cost to ROCs , a feed-in tariff would give confidence to utilities and suppliers of components to undertake the required heavy investment . 
It is vitally important that existing projects , as well as new ones , benefit from any policy shift . 
If investors sense that new projects may obtain special treatment , everyone will decide to wait . 
The topic of how to finance renewable energy is the same topic as how to subsidize it . Governments should not concoct programs to lend directly , guarantee loans , or invest in renewable projects on the theory that the private sector somehow lacks this capability . 
Rather , policymakers should figure out how much renewable energy is worth to society ( possibly attributing a different value to solar , wind , geothermal and biomass ) and make utilities or governments pay extra for it . The most effective subsidies are simple and stable , as in the German model .
