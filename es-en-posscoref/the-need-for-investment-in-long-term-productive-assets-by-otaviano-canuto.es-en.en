Currency War and Peace 
WASHINGTON , DC - Much of the hype surrounding last month &apos;s meeting in Moscow of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers was dedicated to so-called &quot; currency wars , &quot; which some developing-country officials have accused advanced countries of waging by pursuing unconventional monetary policies . 
The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 drove up risk premia and triggered panic in financial markets , weakening assets in the United States and elsewhere , and threatening to provoke a credit crunch . 
In order to avoid asset fire-sales - which would have led to the disorderly unraveling of private-sector balance sheets , possibly triggering a new &quot; Great Depression &quot; or even bringing down the eurozone - advanced countries &quot; central banks began to purchase risky assets and increase lending to financial institutions , thus expanding the money supply . 
While fears of meltdown have dissipated , these policies have been maintained or extended , with policymakers citing the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery and the absence of other , equally strong policy levers - such as fiscal policy or structural reforms - that could replace monetary policy quickly enough . 
But several years of ultra-loose monetary policy in the advanced countries has led to significant liquidity spillover abroad , putting excessive upward pressure on higher-yielding developing countries &quot; currencies . 
With developing countries finding it difficult to deter massive capital inflows or mitigate the effects - owing to economic constraints , like high inflation , or to domestic politics - the &quot; currency wars &quot; metaphor , coined in 2010 by Brazil &apos;s finance minister , Guido Mantega , has resonated widely . 
Moreover , only a small portion of the liquidity created by unconventional monetary policy has been channeled toward households and the small and medium-size enterprises that generate most new jobs . 
Instead , crisis-affected global financial entities have used it to support their efforts to deleverage and to rebuild their capital , while large corporations have been building large cash reserves and refinancing their debt under favorable conditions . 
As a result , economic growth and job creation remain lackluster , with the availability of investment finance for long-term productive assets - essential to sustainable growth - severely limited . 
Some believe that the elimination of macro-financial tail risks , the gradual strengthening of global economic recovery , and the increase in existing asset prices will eventually convince cash hoarders to increase their exposure to new ventures in advanced economies . 
But such optimism may not be warranted . 
The report , based on analysis from various international organizations , highlights several areas of concern . 
For starters , banks &quot; current retrenchment of long-term investment financing is likely to persist . 
After all , many of the advanced-country banks , especially in Europe , that dominated such investment - for example , financing large-scale infrastructure projects - are undergoing deep deleveraging and rebuilding their capital buffers . 
So far , other banks have been unable to fill the gap . 
Furthermore , the effect of internationally agreed regulatory reforms - most of which have yet to be implemented - will be to increase banks &quot; capital requirements while shrinking the scale of maturity transformation risks that they can carry on their balance sheets . 
The &quot; new normal &quot; that results will likely include scarcer , more expensive long-term bank lending . 
The World Bank report also points out that , as a consequence of banking retrenchment , institutional investors with long-term liabilities - such as pension funds , insurers , and sovereign wealth funds - may be called upon to assume a greater role in funding long-term assets . 
These investors must focus on the small and medium-size enterprises that banks often neglect . 
Finally , local-currency bond markets - and , more generally , domestic capital markets - in emerging economies must be explored further , in order to lengthen the tenure of financial flows . 
Local-currency government-debt markets have performed fairly well during the crisis , while local-currency corporate-debt markets have played a more modest role as a vehicle for longer-term finance . 
Anxiety over unconventional monetary policies and &quot; currency wars &quot; must not continue to dominate global policy discussions , especially given last month &apos;s pledge by G-20 leaders not to engage in competitive currency devaluations . 
Instead , global leaders should work to maximize the liquidity that unconventional policy measures have generated , and to use it to support investment in long-term productive assets . 
Such an approach is the only way to place the global economy &apos;s recovery on a sustainable footing .
