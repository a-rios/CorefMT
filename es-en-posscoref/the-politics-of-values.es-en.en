The Politics of Values 
The debate about the American elections has still not abated . 
How did President George W. Bush manage to get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry , and , in addition , to have a Republican majority elected in both houses of Congress ? 
There is not much agreement on the answers , but two themes recur in many explanations . 
One is personality . 
At a time of uncertainty and threat , people had more confidence in the president they knew than in the candidate who seemed unproven . 
The second theme is values . 
People voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies . 
Indeed , some ( it is said ) agreed with Kerry &apos;s policies but nevertheless gave their vote to Bush , because they felt &quot; at ease &quot; with his general attitudes . 
Clearly , the United States is now deeply divided in electoral terms . 
An arch of blue ( Democratic ) states in the East , North , and West spans a huge red ( Republican ) area in the middle and the South . 
More than that , the divisions are reproduced at the local level . 
Gerrymandering - the drawing of electoral boundaries to benefit a particular political party - is no longer necessary . 
People actually tend to move to areas in which a majority of others share their values , whether Republican or Democratic . 
What exactly are these values ? 
They have to do , or so we hear , with &quot; god , guns , and gays . &quot; 
Religion plays a part in them , including the literal truth of the bible when it comes to the story of the creation . 
The possession of a gun is the ultimate test of individualism , and using guns in wars is not abhorrent . 
Gays and other &quot; modern &quot; practices are rejected as self-indulgent . 
As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it , &quot; the Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million people a chance to feel good about themselves . &quot; 
Is all this an American phenomenon , or are there similar trends elsewhere ? 
One answer is that as an American phenomenon , the politics of values may command a majority now , but it is by no means general . 
Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided . 
Personality undoubtedly matters , and beneath overt political differences there may also be issues of values that have not yet come to the fore . 
But traditional political differences based on disagreement over fundamental values play a diminishing part in elections . 
For example , Prime Minister Tony Blair , the next major leader to face an election , plays the personality card and talks about policies , but he represents above all a set of middle-class values . 
When he speaks of &quot; modernization , &quot; or of &quot; bringing things into the twenty-first century , &quot; he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability . 
This has left the Conservative opposition without an effective response . 
Even questions like tax cuts and stricter asylum rules do not quite hit the value chords that the Republican Party in the US has managed to touch . 
The picture is similar in Germany , where the overt influence of value politics is even smaller . 
The German debate is still largely a policy debate . 
When the opposition offers the government talks on health-care reform or , most recently , on combating unemployment , the underlying competition is about competence rather than values . 
Yet underneath the common battlegrounds of political debate in Britain and Germany and elsewhere in Europe , value clashes are lurking . 
Parties fight for those who can be made &quot; to feel good about themselves , &quot; but they may not fully realize that this is only partly a matter of policy . 
Religion is not likely to become a major factor in European politics ; opinion polls show that religious observance marks one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans . 
Guns also have a different place in the European mind ; it is their absence that most Europeans regard as important . 
A pacifist streak of values is also unmistakable in Europe . 
But the issue of political correctness ( &quot; gays &quot; ) plays a so-far underrated part in Europe as well . 
Most importantly , the Europe itself divides Europeans , as the &quot; national question &quot; arises in each European state . 
It is an issue of values , inspired by fear . 
People want to know where they belong , and in the process they turn against the US and toward Europe , or against Europe and toward their country . 
Either way , we leave the realms of policies , and even of politics , and enter the murky domain of symbols and myth . 
This , at any rate , is the main risk that democratic countries face , for the politics of values is a dangerous development . 
It reintroduces fundamental divisions in societies whose greatest democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics . 
Enlightened public debate must be a dispute about policies contained by a community of values . 
Insisting on this is therefore a primary objective of the politics of freedom .
