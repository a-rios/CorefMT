Europe &apos;s Two Futures 
PARIS - Once again , Europe seems to have reached a fork in the road . 
In one direction lies the future as described by pessimists , who argue that rising populist movements and the plunge of the euro are evidence of the continent &apos;s coming slide into geopolitical and economic oblivion . 
In the other direction lies a steep upward path to Europe &apos;s integration and reemergence as a global power - the course , optimists say , that the continent will take as it wakes up and recognizes that it must have the capacity to weather the harshest storms . 
There is no telling which future will be realized . 
Is Europe &quot; a grandmother , no longer fertile and vibrant , &quot; as Pope Francis put it when he addressed the European Parliament last November ? 
Or is it a phoenix , about to rise ( yet again ) from its ashes ? 
The outcome depends , of course , on how Europeans respond to their current travails . 
And as they contemplate their choices , they would be wise to consider how the continent is perceived from the outside . 
For starters , it is important to acknowledge that the outlook looks bleak . 
Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz , Jews are still being attacked and murdered in European cities . 
More than 50 years after the end of the Algerian War , European Muslims face more discrimination than ever . 
With Russian-backed separatists - and maybe even Russian troops - battling government forces in Ukraine , the specter of war is once again stalking the continent . 
And the election of a leftist government in Greece has raised the question of whether introducing the euro was a good idea . 
On the other hand , Europe has faced worse - much worse - and emerged stronger than ever . 
After the first half of the twentieth century - the bloodiest period of human history - the continent &apos;s leaders returned from the battlefield to lay the foundations of lasting European peace . 
Europe may never regain its standing as the center of the world , but it can continue to be both an important actor and an attractive model for others . 
Indeed , with the benefit of distance , a broader picture emerges . 
Seen from China , Europe is first and foremost an attractive investment opportunity ; and the euro &apos;s spectacular fall now makes it a particularly tempting one . 
The continent may not be the island of stability it once was - Russian President Vladimir Putin and a few thousand European jihadists have seen to that . 
But the risks it faces are mild when compared with the chronic instability and acute threats facing much of the rest of the world . 
Europe &apos;s bloodstained history also provides a useful warning for China and the rest of Asia , and can serve as an example for overcoming the region &apos;s long-standing animosities . 
Though tensions between China and its neighbors over territorial claims in the East and South China Seas have receded somewhat in recent months , the prospect of worsening Sino-Japanese relations , in particular , remains worrisome . 
Reconciliation along the Franco-German model may not yet be in the cards , but the two Asian powers would be well advised to learn from Europe &apos;s experience . 
The view from the United States is completely different . 
From the American perspective , Europe is less a model than a historical relic . 
The continent &apos;s national characteristics have returned to the fore : Germany with its economic power , France with its terrorists , Greece with its leftists , and so forth . 
From the perspective of the poorest parts of the world , Europe represents the weakest link in the coalition fighting radical Islam , a battle that is taking its highest toll - despite the impression created by Western media coverage - primarily in the Middle East , South Asia , and Africa . 
For many of those fleeing the conflicts in these regions , Europe is also the Promised Land - the object of the hopes and dreams of those risking their lives to reach the prosperous side of the Mediterranean Sea . 
In the end , how Europeans view themselves will determine their collective fate . 
If they do not seize this decisive moment to define themselves - by beginning to institute the difficult reforms their countries so desperately need , for example - they risk ending up on a path they never intended to take .
