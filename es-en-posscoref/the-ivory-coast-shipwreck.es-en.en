The Ivory Coast Shipwreck 
West Africa &apos;s jewel is fracturing . 
The Ivory Coast miracle is now the Ivory Coast hell , where natives and non-natives live in fear . 
Since the arrival of a small contingent of French troops in 2003 , the horror of this latest African civil war has occasionally intruded on the awareness of the global public , only to recede again . 
Last November , for example , seven French soldiers were killed in a regime-ordered air raid against the northern rebels . 
France retaliated by destroying the minute Ivoirian air force . 
With its peacekeeping mandate due to expire on April 4 , France may decide to leave . 
Many Ivorians fear that this will mean renewed civil war . 
But instead of international intervention , the Ivory Coast needs homegrown solutions for its problems . 
It must avoid the pernicious ethnic nationalism of recent years that led to one ethnic group being banned from running in the presidential election . 
Without solutions that claim broad support , the Ivory Coast will likely join the grim list of the world &apos;s failed states precisely because of its inability to develop into a cohesive nation based on equal political rights for all . 
The problem of inter-ethnic conflict is , sadly , all too typical of Africa . 
The Ivoirian example is neither unique nor the most extreme - at least not yet . 
Rwanda &apos;s horrors , and more recently Darfur , come quickly to mind . 
But the Ivory Coast &apos;s dilemma is notable both because the country &apos;s decline came from a relatively greater height , and for the lessons it holds concerning how states fail . 
At first sight , the Ivory Coast &apos;s post-colonial history looks like a variation on standard themes . 
Independence from France ( in 1960 ) spawned a dictatorship remarkable mainly for its longevity . 
Felix Houphouet-Boigny &apos;s rule lasted more than 30 years , until his death in 1993 , when power passed to his handpicked successor , Henri Konan Bedie . 
Houphouet &apos;s fondness for money and power was plain from the outset , and his regime offered no exception to the dismal African rule of corruption , fraud , cheating , cronyism , embezzlement , and weak law enforcement . 
These handicaps to the country &apos;s development grew worse over time . 
As early as the 1960 &quot; s , Houphouet was spending lavishly on his native jungle-bound village , Yamoussoukro , which in 1983 replaced the port city of Abidjan as the capital . 
Yamassoukro boasts grand eight-lane highways lined with over 10,000 lights and a full-scale replica of St Peter &apos;s in Rome . 
Alongside such Pharaonic waste , however , the infrastructure and economic development supported by continuing dependence on French finance and public-spirited expatriate French technocrats helped produce what became known as the &quot; Ivoirian miracle . &quot; 
Indeed , at independence , the Ivory Coast was the most prosperous state in French West Africa , with coffee and cocoa exports accounting for 40 % of the region &apos;s total exports . 
This relative prosperity lasted until the second oil shock of 1979 , when global stagflation depressed prices for the primary commodities that comprise the Ivory Coast &apos;s narrow export base , while rising interest rates increased the cost of servicing the debt contracted by the Houphouet regime . 
Economic crisis and corruption undermined Bedie &apos;s presidency , leading to a military coup in 1999 . 
But the new regime , facing continued unrest , eventually allowed multi-party democracy . 
The result has been disastrous , as ethnic rivalries sharpened . 
Whatever else is said about such French-backed authoritarian regimes , hindsight leaves no doubt about the benefits of the social stability seen in the Ivory Coast during the period until the 1980 &quot; s , when France remained paternalistically engaged with its former colony . 
The political upheavals of 1999-2000 resulted in a new &quot; democratic &quot; constitution that became an invitation to civil war . 
Regional and religious tensions had been growing since Houphouet &apos;s death and were aggravated by the new constitution , which enshrined ethnic discrimination . 
About four million northerners were denied political participation or land ownership on the grounds that they were descendants of migrants from neighboring countries . 
Yet the only real difference between most inhabitants of the Ivory Coast - which has the most immigrants of any West African country - is the timing of their forefathers &quot; arrival . 
The nationality issue first came to a head over the status of Alassane Ouattara , the Muslim opposition leader and talented technocrat whom Bedie barred from running in the 1995 presidential election on account of his &quot; foreign &quot; ancestry . 
Stripped of his Ivorian citizenship in 1999 , Ouattara is popular in the north of the country , which has been held by the &quot; New Forces &quot; rebels since 2002 . 
The rebellion led in January 2003 to a French-brokered deal in which all sides - including the New Forces - signed up to a government of national reconciliation . 
The parties also agreed to work together on modifying national identity , eligibility for citizenship , and land tenure laws . 
But the deal has not stuck , and the conflict has continued . 
The best hope for the Ivory Coast is probably a parliamentary-based system that will require inter-ethnic alliances to form governments . 
The division of the country into more ethnically homogeneous federal components might also promote stability . 
Above all , dominance by one group through a powerful presidency must be avoided . 
But that will require strong international supervision , resembling today &apos;s EU Protectorate in Bosnia . 
The alternative is a vicious circle of violence and poverty , exacerbated by rapid population growth .
