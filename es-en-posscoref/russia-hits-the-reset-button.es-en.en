Russia Hits the Reset Button 
MOSCOW - NATO soldiers marching in Red Square on V-E Day ; 
Moscow agreeing on a compromise resolution of the 40-year-old sea-boundary dispute with Norway ; the sight of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin kneeling at the memorial to the Polish officers murdered by Stalin at Katyn : these are a few glimpses of what a European newspaper described as a kinder , gentler Russia . 
Why the change ? 
And how to respond to Russia &apos;s new foreign policy ? 
In this case , what you see is what you get . 
Russia &apos;s tone , especially toward the United States , began to change last year , but the Kremlin &apos;s support for a fourth United Nations Security Council sanctions resolution on Iran demonstrates that , today , there is real substance . 
Moreover , surrendering territorial claims in the Arctic - the stakes in the dispute with Norway - is no small matter . 
Putin &apos;s joint visit to Katyn with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in April was , of course , symbolic . 
The kneeling act was also followed , just three days later , by Russian officials going out of their way to help investigate the air crash in Russia that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and scores of Polish dignitaries , and to pay respects to the victims . 
In May , an apparently genuine internal Foreign Ministry document made it clear that the Kremlin now prioritizes relations with America and Europe . 
All of this is a far cry from using the Red Square platform to compare George W. Bush &apos;s policies to those of the Third Reich , resuming air patrols along the Norwegian coast and into the North Atlantic and the Caribbean , or threatening Poland with deployment of Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad . 
Four factors have contributed most to this positive reversal : the Georgia war , the global economic crisis , the Obama factor , and China &apos;s relentless rise . 
The Georgia war demonstrated how quickly relations with the US could deteriorate , almost to the point of reviving the Cold War , leaving Russia isolated and in a generally weak position . 
The economic crisis destroyed illusions of sustained energy-fueled growth through at least 2020 , and the hubris that went with it . 
Moreover , the Obama administration , by having reset US foreign policy , removed the principal irritants in Russia-Western relations , such as the prospect of NATO enlargement to Ukraine and Georgia ; close relations with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , and plans for the deployment of US defensive missiles in Central Europe . 
Barack Obama also showed genuine respect and openness to Russia . 
Finally , as China has become more confident and assertive , its shadow over Russia has grown longer and thicker . 
Faced with this situation , the Russian leadership sees both new dangers and new opportunities , which are often intimately interlinked . 
The country &apos;s backwardness vis-Ã -vis not only the West , but also some of the emerging powers drives home the need to modernize Russia &apos;s technological base . 
But where is the money for that ? 
Obama &apos;s openness and pragmatism have turned the US into a partner , but it is uncertain how long he will stay in the White House and how strong will he will be in the future . 
China is both a market and a partner , but this partnership looks increasingly tilted in China &apos;s favor . 
So Russia needed to adjust its foreign policy . 
Passionate defense of a diminished status makes less sense than practical efforts to arrest decline and enhance Russia &apos;s real power . 
Multipolarity exists , but Russia is not much of a pole . 
Summits of the BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) leaders are still held , but the real focus of Russia &apos;s policy is the OECD countries , which have technology and money . 
Russian foreign policy &apos;s new central task is to channel those resources to Russia &apos;s modernization drive , for which improved relations with the US are essential . 
Still , there are important caveats . 
The Russian government &apos;s concept of modernization is too narrow to succeed . 
Unless the basic conditions for doing business in Russia improve substantially , and until the Russian state starts to modernize itself , technology transfers will have little effect . 
Putin himself has furnished proof of that . 
Speaking recently at the Russian Academy of Science , he said that the Soviet economy was structurally incapable of using most of the technological secrets procured through KGB industrial espionage . 
Without an independent judiciary , secure property rights , and a check on corruption , Putin &apos;s modernization will mimic Brezhnev &apos;s . 
The danger is not of the Kremlin losing interest in technology transfers from the West , but rather its inability to create the right legal , business , and political environment in Russia to capitalize on them . 
The West has broadly welcomed Russia &apos;s new line . 
Obama has sent a nuclear energy cooperation agreement with Russia to Congress , while the European Union has offered a &quot; partnership for modernization . &quot; 
Both want Russia to complete its accession to the World Trade Organization . 
This is crucial . 
There can be no better foundation for modernization than WTO membership . 
When this is achieved , the next steps are a permanent normal trade status for Russia in the US , and practical moves toward a pan-European free-trade area between the EU , Russia , Ukraine , and other countries . 
Europe &apos;s potentially most effective instrument to help Russian modernization is gradual abolition of the visa regime with Russia . 
The time to act is now . 
Within a few years , when it becomes clear to the Russian leadership that modernization conceived as technological innovation is too narrow to succeed , important choices will have to be made . 
Forward-looking elements in Russia will require compelling arguments if their case is to prevail .
