Taking Drug Safety Seriously 
Health hazards - nuclear reactors , guns , and contaminated foods - surround all of us , so governments take an active role in limiting these hazards through regulations , which , in many cases , are very successful . 
But the situation is far different concerning the safety of prescription drugs . 
Indeed , as far as protecting the public is concerned , drug safety is the regulator &apos;s neglected stepchild . 
The magnitude of the problem is huge . 
In the United States alone , it is estimated that every year up to 100,000 patients die due to serious adverse drug reactions ( ADR &apos;s ) . 
If true , drug-induced death would qualify as the fourth or fifth leading cause of death ( depending on which mortality estimates are used ) . 
Moreover , the direct annual hospital costs attributable to ADR &apos;s run into the billions of dollars , and this does not include all the suffering that ADR &apos;s cause that does not lead to hospitalization ( or death ) . 
The difficulties in determining cause and effect must be acknowledged . 
Whether a patient &apos;s death or hospitalization is due to a particular drug , the underlying illness , or a combination of the two can be hard to determine . 
But this makes drug safety all the more important . 
Inherent to drug safety is the fact that all drugs , in addition to their benefits , cause harm in certain patients . 
Drug approval and use requires a careful weighing of desirable and undesirable effects . 
These judgments vary , depending on whether they are made by a drug company , which stands to benefit from sales , or a patient at risk of suffering a serious adverse effect . 
Incomplete knowledge complicates this assessment . 
The rush to get new drugs to market often leads to inadequate safety documentation . 
More than half of all approved drugs produce a serious adverse reaction that is not known at the time of regulatory approval . 
For example , when the new class of painkillers called Cox-2 inhibitors was introduced , regulators , physicians , and patients were unaware that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes . 
Tens of thousands of innocent patients - perhaps more - suffered such ADR &apos;s before the first two drugs of this class were withdrawn . 
Proper and complete documentation of harmful drug effects is difficult . 
Spontaneous reporting rates to regulatory agencies are low - approximately 1 % - and ongoing monitoring is passive in many countries . 
There is also a general reluctance to report unfavorable drug effects . 
Physicians may feel guilty and fear litigation , drug companies worry about the threat to corporate profits and regulatory agencies must face the question : &quot; Why was the drug approved in the first place ? &quot; 
It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug if the medical event is common in the user &apos;s age group or in the condition being treated . 
Because the risk of heart attacks is high in older people , many of whom have arthritic pain requiring treatment with painkillers , it took six years to link Cox-2 inhibitors to a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of heart attacks . 
A recent Harris Survey in the US concluded that 60 % of adults are either not confident at all or not very confident that drug makers will publicly and in a timely manner disclose data on their products &quot; adverse effects . 
Their skepticism is hardly groundless : internal documents obtained in recent lawsuits reveal that drug companies often fail to submit critical safety information to regulatory agencies , as required by law , and fail to communicate such information to physicians and patients . 
One problem is that the consequences for neglecting drug safety are non-existing or minimal . 
The time has come to get serious : 
· Citizens and government must make drug safety a priority and commit adequate resources to fixing the problems ; 
· Penalties for drug companies &quot; failure to report and communicate safety information must be increased dramatically if they are to serve as effective deterrents ; 
· Regulatory agencies need enforcement authority so that stricter rules can be implemented ; 
· The drug-safety problem must be seen as a systemic failure . 
It is unfair to blame clinicians for serious ADR &apos;s , particularly in the absence of complete safety information . 
Fixing the problem requires full cooperation from clinicians , but this requires ending their fear of litigation . 
This approach works well in the airline industry : pilots reporting near misses are not penalized ; 
· Patients need to be better informed about the risks of prescription drugs and more involved in detection and reporting . 
Package inserts in fine print are useless ; 
· Monitoring of ADR &apos;s must be more pro-active . 
This requires more funding , which should come from the main beneficiary of drug sales - the pharmaceutical industry - just as oversight of aviation safety is funded by the airlines . 
Above all , the success of any comprehensive effort to improve drug safety hinges upon establishing an independent office of drug safety to advocate , coordinate , and provide direction to the regulatory agenda . 
Such an office exists in the United Kingdom . 
Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their neglected role as guardian of public health .
