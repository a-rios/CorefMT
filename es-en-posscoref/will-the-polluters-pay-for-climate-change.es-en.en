Will the Polluters Pay for Climate Change ? 
I am writing this in New York in early August , when the mayor declared a &quot; heat emergency &quot; to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners . 
City employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit ( 25.5 Celsius ) . 
Nevertheless , electricity usage has reached near-record levels . 
Meanwhile California has emerged from its own record-breaking heat wave . 
For the United States as a whole , the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century . 
Europe is experiencing an unusually hot summer , too . 
July set new records in England and the Netherlands , where weather data go back more than 300 years . 
The hot northern summer fits well with the release of An Inconvenient Truth , a documentary film featuring former US Vice-President Al Gore . 
Using some remarkable graphs , images , and other information , the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming , or , at the very least , contributing to it , and that we must urgently address the issue . 
Americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice . 
It is already having harmful consequences for others , and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change , while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs .

To see the inequity , I merely have to glance up at the air conditioner that is keeping my office bearable . 
While I &apos;ve done more than the mayor requested , setting it at 82F ( 27C ) , I &apos;m still part of a feedback loop . 
I deal with the heat by using more energy , which leads to burning more fossil fuel , putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more . 
It even happened when I watched An Inconvenient Truth : on a warm evening , the cinema was so chilly that I wished I had brought a jacket . 
Heat kills . 
A heat wave in France in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths , and a hot spell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths , according to official estimates . 
Although no particular heat wave can be directly attributed to global warming , it will make such events more frequent . 
Moreover , if global warming continues unchecked , the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more erratic , causing both prolonged droughts and severe floods , will dwarf the death toll from hot weather in Europe . 
More frequent intense hurricanes will kill many more . 
Melting polar ice will cause rising seas to inundate low-lying fertile delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food . 
Tropical diseases will spread , killing still more people . 
Overwhelmingly , the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt , to find alternative sources of food , and who do not have access to health care . 
Even in rich countries , it usually isn &apos;t the rich who die in natural disasters . 
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans , those who died were the poor in low-lying areas who lacked cars to escape . 
If this is true in a country like the US , with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis , it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries , because their governments lack the resources needed , and because , when it comes to foreign assistance , rich nations still do not count all human lives equally . 
According to United Nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India , 60 times higher than in Bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia , Mali , or Chad . 
Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia , Canada , and Luxembourg . 
Russia , Germany , Britain , Italy , France , and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US . 
This is still significantly above the world average , and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming . 
If a polluter harms others , those who are harmed normally have a legal remedy . 
For example , if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that I use to irrigate my farm , killing my crops , I can sue the factory owner . 
If the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns , or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level , shouldn &apos;t I also be able to sue ? 
Camilla Toulmin , who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development , a London-based NGO , was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June . 
She asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change , but who have done the least to cause it . 
The question , she reports on www.opendemocracy.net , seemed to take him by surprise , and he did not support the idea . 
Like Toulmin , I wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient , even for him .
