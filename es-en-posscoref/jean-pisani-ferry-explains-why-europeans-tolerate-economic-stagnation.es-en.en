Europe &apos;s Elusive Growth Consensus 
PARIS - In most European countries , GDP per capita is currently lower than it was six years ago . 
In some cases , like Greece , Italy , and Ireland , it is more than 10 % lower . 
Even in Germany , where it is higher , average growth over the last six years has been anemic . 
It is hard to overestimate the adverse consequences of this state of affairs . 
The European Union has lost six million jobs since 2008 . 
Many younger people who have entered the labor force in recent years have been unable to find a job corresponding to their skills and are bound to pay a price for it throughout their careers . 
Governments have been struggling with the impossible task of balancing their books despite dwindling revenues . 
And , worst of all , companies have begun discounting Europe in their investment plans , paving the way for a permanent loss of aggregate momentum . 
In such a situation , growth ought to be at the top of the policy agenda . 
But , while the EU and national governments pay lip service to it , they have not devised an effective economic-revitalization strategy . 
In the eurozone , the hope is that calmer sovereign-debt markets , slower fiscal adjustment , and supportive monetary policy by the European Central Bank will help trigger a sustained recovery . 
This may be the case , but the recovery that is now expected will not suffice to offset the adverse consequences of the last six years . 
The productivity gains that failed to materialize during this period are lost forever : many people who have experienced long-term unemployment or have left the labor force are unlikely to return to work , and Europe will be lucky if productivity growth accelerates somewhat and approaches pre-crisis trends - better than nothing , but hardly satisfactory . 
Things are completely different in the United States , where growth is on everyone &apos;s agenda : the Federal Reserve is targeting an employment rate below 6.5 % , and companies have used the recession as an opportunity to reorganize and become more efficient . 
The lasting adverse effects of the 2008 shock are likely to be much smaller there than in Europe . 
So , why is Europe not doing more to return to growth ? 
European leaders would probably say , first , that they have been forced to address more urgent matters since the Greek crisis erupted in 2010 . 
But , while it is true that much policy attention has been devoted to fighting financial fires , this is not a sufficient answer : since the summer of 2012 , when ECB President Mario Draghi convinced markets that the eurozone would not break up , Europe has had enough breathing space to address the growth imperative , but has barely done so . 
The second explanation is that there is agreement on the goal but not on the means . 
Again , there is some truth to this . 
Keynesians argue that Europe would grow if only policy were focused on generating aggregate demand ; they blame precipitous fiscal consolidation and insufficiently aggressive monetary easing for the loss of momentum . 
Their opponents , by contrast , see structural weaknesses and internal imbalances as the major impediment to growth ; for supply-siders , it is the slow pace of economic and social reforms that is to blame . 
This lack of consensus on the nature of the problem arguably hinders agreement on a solution . 
But , again , this is not an entirely convincing explanation . 
Disagreements such as this have arisen before - and not only in Europe . 
Given sufficient will , there could be ample room for compromise . 
As the Nobel laureate economist Paul Samuelson famously said , the reason we have two eyes is to keep one on supply and the other on demand . 
A deeper , more worrying explanation is that Europe does not have a strong desire for growth . 
In fact , some have become convinced that , given the environmental consequences , economic growth does more harm than good and that the crisis should be regarded as an opportunity to shift to a more frugal economy . 
The growth agenda , according to this view , is a Trojan horse for ecological neglect - for example , through more business-friendly environmental regulation or shale-gas exploration . 
Others perceive calls for growth as a pretext to weaken employment protection or accept greater income inequality . 
They fear that , rather than delivering the promised benefits , painful reforms would tilt the distribution of power and income in favor of employers . 
Environmentalists and labor advocates have a point when they insist that growth should not be the ultimate goal of economic policy . 
They are right to point out that its quality - in terms of preservation of the environment , work conditions , or income distribution - matters , too . 
They are even right to be suspicious that an overriding emphasis on growth could be used as an excuse for questionable social choices . 
But they are wrong to conclude that their own interests would be better served by neglecting growth . 
Stagnation is not a solution to any problem ; on the contrary , it entails serious risks . 
What steady-state advocates forget is that stagnating or declining incomes would heighten resistance to higher taxes on fossil fuels and delay investment in green technologies ( and thus the transition to new industries and the creation of better jobs ) . 
Moreover , lack of growth would almost certainly result in the end of the vaunted European social model . 
The welfare state is sustainable only if revenues grow in line with spending needs ; protracted stagnation would inevitably result in it being dismantled piece by piece . 
In the end , the economic outcome envisaged by the growth skeptics would undermine the very goals they are fighting for . 
To end the current stalemate and unlock its economic potential , Europe needs a new &quot; compact &quot; ( to use the current jargon ) that addresses simultaneously the demand shortfall , impediments to productivity gains , and the quality of growth . 
Designing and implementing such a package is far from impossible - several elements are already available . 
What is lacking is a political platform on which Europe &apos;s necessary growth conversation could take shape . 
It is urgently needed .
