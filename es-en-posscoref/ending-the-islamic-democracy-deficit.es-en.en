Ending the Islamic Democracy Deficit 
Despite encouraging signs , it is impossible to ignore a &quot; democracy deficit &quot; in the Muslim world , especially the Arab part of it . 
Only one of every four countries with Muslim majorities has a democratically elected government . 
Worse yet , the gap between Muslim countries and the rest of the world is widening . 
Democracy and freedom expanded over recent decades into Latin America , Africa , Europe , and Asia , but the Muslim world continues to struggle . 
By the reckoning of Freedom House , a think-tank devoted to monitoring democracy worldwide , the number of &quot; free &quot; countries around the world increased by nearly three dozen over the past 20 years . 
Not one has a Muslim majority . 
This phenomenon has been noted within the Muslim world as well . 
In the summer of 2002 , a team of Arab scholars produced the Arab Human Development Report , written on behalf of the UN Development Program and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development . 
It portrays an Arab world lagging behind other regions in key measures , including individual freedom and women &apos;s empowerment , as well as economic and social development . 
Disturbing trends , such as a demographic youth &quot; bulge &quot; combined with high youth unemployment rates - reaching almost 40 % in some places - highlight potentially explosive social conditions . 
The Arab world faces serious problems that can only be met by more flexible , democratic political systems . 
The second Arab Human Development Report , issued in 2003 , underscores the close relationship between the Arab world &apos;s educational shortcomings and its lack of democracy . 
Democracy requires an informed citizenry able to question its government . 
A well-educated citizenry is also essential if young men and women are to acquire the skills needed to perform the sort of jobs today &apos;s global and competitive world demands . 
Alas , instead of progress , what we see is a cycle of inadequate educational opportunity leading to a lack of economic opportunity . 
Neither freedom nor prosperity can develop in such conditions . 
Muslims cannot blame the United States for their lack of democracy . 
Still , America does play a large role on the world stage ; and in many parts of the Muslim world , particularly in the Arab world , successive US administrations - Republican and Democratic alike - have not made democratization a priority . 
At various times , the US avoided scrutinizing the internal workings of friendly countries in the interest of ensuring a steady flow of oil ; containing Soviet , Iraqi , and Iranian expansionism ; addressing issues related to the Arab-Israeli conflict ; resisting communism in East Asia ; or securing military bases . 
By failing to foster gradual democratization - and yielding to a &quot; democratic exception &quot; in parts of the Muslim world - America missed an opportunity to help these countries adapt to the stresses of a globalizing world . 
Continuing this policy is not in America &apos;s interest . 
According to the Bush administration &apos;s 2002 National Security Strategy , US policy will be more actively engaged in supporting democratic trends globally , with no exception for the Muslim world . 
This commitment was made with the full knowledge that democracies are imperfect and terribly complicated . 
Leaders in some Muslim states contrast democratic systems with their more orderly arrangements and point with satisfaction to the seeming stability that alternatives to democracy provide . 
But stability based on authority alone is illusory and ultimately impossible to sustain . 
Iran , Romania , and Liberia illustrate that rigid authoritarian systems cannot withstand the shocks of social , political , or economic change , especially at the pace that characterizes today &apos;s world . 
Any doubt that promoting democracy now receives greater emphasis in US foreign policy was removed by President Bush &apos;s speech of last November , in which he made clear that the Muslim world &apos;s democratic deficit is not tied to religion , but to &quot; failures of political and economic doctrines . &quot; 
President Bush also made clear that Americans had learned from the past . 
&quot; Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle East did nothing to make us safe - because , in the long run , stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty . 
As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish , it will remain a place of stagnation , resentment , and violence ready for export . &quot; 
So the US now actively supports the extension of democracy throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds , not simply for humanitarian reasons , or for theoretical reasons , but from self-interest . 
History shows that societies where opportunity is safeguarded tend to be societies that are good international citizens . 
But , like medical doctors &apos; Hippocratic oath , America and others must pledge to do no harm in promoting democracy . 
Unrestrained zeal to make the world better could make it worse . 
Promoting democracy must be undertaken with humility , care , and wisdom . 
Many models of democracy exist ; and some models cannot be exported . 
Moreover , mere elections should never be confused with democracy . 
Rather , what distinguishes democracy from other systems is a distribution of power both within government and within society . 
Until such a balance exists , elections can threaten freedom by concentrating too much authority in one person or body without providing adequate checks and balances , including independent media . 
Not surprisingly , this takes time , resources , and effort . 
Finally , political reform must go hand in hand with economic and educational reform for all the citizens in a society , including the 50 % who happen to be women . 
No country can succeed if it denies itself the talents of half of its people . 
True , democracy can only be built and maintained from within , by a country &apos;s people and leaders . 
Outsiders , however , can and should help . 
Indeed , it is difficult to imagine a more important task for established democracies than helping other countries join their ranks .
