From Pain to Gain on the EU Frontier 
BRUSSELS - The first act of the eurozone debt drama was about whether any European Union member country could ever become insolvent . 
It ended when the highest EU authority , the European Council , officially recognized in late July that Greece does need a reduction in its debt obligations . 
But that acknowledgement of reality does not end the drama . 
The second act will be about restoring growth prospects for the EU periphery , which will pose an even more difficult challenge . 
The key problem is simple : until 2008 , these countries enjoyed a long boom based on cheap and plentiful credit , which allowed them to finance large current-account deficits . 
But any import boom creates a misleading impression of the local economy &apos;s productive capacity . 
Imagine a country that increases its imports of , say , cars and other consumer goods by 10 % of its starting GDP . 
These goods are sold to local consumers via car dealers and a whole chain of traders and retailers . 
All of these intermediaries have costs that have to be paid by the local consumer , which flatters the national GDP statistics , because , technically speaking , all of these costs constitute value added in intermediation services . 
An import boom thus also leads to higher measured GDP growth . 
How large is the induced growth in GDP from higher imports ? 
The retail price is often more than twice the wholesale price paid by the importer . 
The local value added to imports could thus easily equal their value . 
This implies that an increase in imports of consumer goods equivalent to 10 % of GDP could generate an increase in measured GDP of about 10 % as well . 
But the opposite is also true : when an import boom ends , measured GDP must drop considerably , because much less intermediation is needed . 
This fall in GDP , though a natural consequence of lower imports of consumption goods , is often mistakenly perceived as something to be avoided , because it seems to imply that output is below its &quot; potential . &quot; 
In a completely flexible economy , this drop in measured GDP ( and the concomitant increase in unemployment ) could be avoided if the resources formerly employed in selling imported consumer goods could quickly be used to generate exports . 
But retail shop clerks and car dealers cannot be easily transformed into the specialized and highly skilled workers needed in modern manufacturing . 
In the case of Greece and Portugal , for example , the tourism industry might absorb some unemployed retailers . 
But shops and showrooms cannot be transformed into tourist attractions , whose capacity will remain limited until enough time has passed to build new hotels , recreational facilities , etc . 
Given that Greece had a current-account deficit close to 10 % of GDP in 2010 , a drop in imported consumption goods of that magnitude seems to be needed before the country &apos;s external debt can be stabilized . 
But this would imply a further drop of measured GDP by about the same percentage ( and a further substantial increase in unemployment ) . 
Even the most flexible economy in the world would take years to switch one-tenth of all of its factors of production from distributing imports to export-oriented activities . 
The import boom in the United States was much smaller than that on the EU periphery , but the recent downward revision of US GDP can be seen through the same lens . 
An import boom creates only the illusion of economic strength . 
How long will the adjustment take ? 
Post-unification Germany experienced an import and construction boom that was similar to that of the EU periphery . 
For a few years , imports surged , and by 1995 a sizeable current-account deficit had developed . 
It took Germany ten years ( until about 2005 ) of slow growth to reduce capacity in the construction sector and gain market share for its export industry . 
But Germany had no debt overhang to confront . 
Financial markets might not give the eurozone periphery that much time . 
The three small Baltic EU members provide an alternative model : they had developed current-account deficits of over 20 % of GDP during the credit boom , and over the last three years have experienced double-digit GDP contractions . 
But , because they now run current-account surpluses , they have fully adjusted and can resume growth , albeit naturally at a much slower pace than during the boom . 
Could anything be done to accelerate adjustment in the eurozone &apos;s periphery ? 
The official recipe is &quot; structural reform . &quot; 
But , during a period of weak domestic demand , structural reforms might actually exacerbate short-term problems . 
Labor-market liberalization would allow firms in the domestic sector to fire workers more rapidly , but would do little to encourage export-oriented firms to invest more and create more jobs , especially when the domestic banking system is under stress and cannot provide new credit . 
Moreover , the additional unemployment would lead to more social-welfare spending , thus increasing the need to cut elsewhere or increase taxes . 
Governments in the eurozone &apos;s periphery , including Spain and Italy , now face a dilemma : they must undertake structural reforms to increase their long-term potential growth , but at the cost of even greater short-term pain . 
The debt crisis will end only when they have shown that they have understood this and accepted the inevitable sacrifices .
