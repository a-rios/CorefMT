Ukrainian Democracy and Its Cynics 
MOSCOW - &quot; A pox on both your houses &quot; may be an appropriate individual response to frustration with the political candidates on offer in an election . 
But it is a dangerous sentiment for governments to hold . 
Choice is the essence of governance , and to abstain from it - for whatever reason - is to shirk responsibility . 
But that seems to be the stance of the entire West regarding the upcoming second round of Ukraine &apos;s presidential election . 
Because the Orange Revolution in 2004 turned out to be a seeming unending series of disappointments , most Western leaders are acting as if it makes no difference whether Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko or her rival , Viktor Yanukovych , wins on February 7 . 
They are wrong , not only about what the election will mean for Ukraine &apos;s people , who have stoically endured so much , but also about what it will mean for security and stability across Eurasia . 
For , if the Orange Revolution demonstrated one thing , it is that Ukraine &apos;s politics are not those of the pendulum , swinging predictably between opposing forces that agree on the fundamental rules of democracy . 
Indeed , it is patently clear from his own words that Yanukovych does not accept the legitimacy of the Orange Revolution , which means that he does not accept the bedrock principle of democracy that you cannot cheat your way to power . 
Yanukovych &apos;s anti-democratic position should come as no surprise . 
His criminal record is often noted , but the particular crimes that sent him to prison are never spelled out . 
Let me do it . 
On December 15 , 1967 , Yanukovych ( then 17 years old ) was sentenced to three years in prison for robbery and sexual assault . 
He was back in prison three years later , convicted of manslaughter . 
But , for reasons that remain unexplained , the Soviet courts expunged his criminal record in 1978 , shortly before he joined the Communist Party . 
But in 2006 Yanukovych was charged with falsifying the very documents used to expunge his earlier convictions . 
Two key documents used to overturn his conviction for rape and robbery had been forged . 
Moreover , the signature of the judge in his case was also forged . 
It is mind-boggling that an unrepentant , twice-convicted violent felon , a man who had sought to steal a presidential election - and who advocated a violent crackdown on the men and women peacefully protesting against his electoral fraud - should be a candidate for any office , let alone the presidency of a country of nearly 50 million people . 
Yanukovych &apos;s candidacy thus reveals much about the nature of the people who back him , and also about the fragility of Ukraine &apos;s democracy . 
Of course , Tymoshenko is no saint . 
She carved out a successful business career in the rough and tumble of the post-Soviet gas industry . 
And her opponents have consistently tried to tar her business career with a taint of criminality . 
But not even when they controlled the entire apparatus of Ukraine &apos;s justice system were they able to make any criminal charges stick . 
What is more important about Tymoshenko is her record in government . 
Last September , the world stood on the edge of a global financial meltdown . 
In the year since , Tymoshenko &apos;s government has consistently acted to preserve international stability , even if that meant taking political hits at home . 
Within days of the crisis , her government was in talks with the International Monetary Fund to secure a loan to backstop Ukraine &apos;s economy against the worst , and reached agreement with near-record speed , despite domestic political objections to the rigor of its terms . 
Although the whole world has suffered severely from the crisis , Ukraine was hit worse than most countries , as international demand for steel , which accounted for 42 % of exports in the first half of 2008 , collapsed . 
As the crisis gathered pace , Ukraine was completely cut off from international financial markets , despite sound public finances and low foreign debt . 
One year later , Ukraine &apos;s economy is turning around . 
After a horrendous fall in late 2008 and early 2009 , industrial production grew by 5 % month on month in July . 
Next year , Ukraine looks likely to return to solid economic growth . 
Under tremendous strain , Tymoshenko &apos;s government succeeded in keeping the budget deficit under control . 
Inflation was halved from 31 % in May 2008 to around 10 % today . 
The current-account deficit has been almost eliminated , and the banking crisis contained . 
Ukraine &apos;s international reserves are a reassuring $ 26 billion , roughly one-quarter of the country &apos;s GDP . 
The exchange rate has been adjusted , and , given international conditions , is relatively stable , underpinning Ukraine &apos;s international competitiveness . 
Tymoshenko &apos;s government also made a clean break with the ancien r√©gime in the gas business , increasing Europe &apos;s energy security in the process . 
At considerable domestic political risk , Tymoshenko concluded a long-term gas transit and purchase agreement with Russia that is transparent and market-oriented , as well as a far-reaching agreement with the European Union , the World Bank , the EBRD , and the European Investment Bank on reform of Ukraine &apos;s gas sector and gas-transit system . 
Yanukovych , whose campaign relies on financing from the main beneficiaries of the old , corrupt energy system , seems certain to undo these reforms , thus reintroducing grave risks into European energy markets . 
Moreover , Tymoshenko managed Ukraine &apos;s crisis despite the tremendous and often irresponsible resistance of her political opponents , who frequently paralyzed the parliament when the government refused to accept populist proposals that would undermine efforts at financial stabilization . 
Amazingly , President Viktor Yushchenko regularly vetoed decisions necessary for that stabilization , including every effort at privatization . 
For keeping Ukraine afloat over the past 15 months , Tymoshenko deserves the West &apos;s thanks , not the cynicism that we are currently seeing . 
Yanukovych &apos;s record of violence and disdain for democratic norms is too entrenched to think that , should he win , he will ever allow his position to be challenged again . 
A victory for Yanukovych now may be the last free vote Ukraine sees for a long time .
