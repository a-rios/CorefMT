China \ u0027s Dot.Communist Economy 
BEIJING : New Economy euphoria is gripping China . 
Cell phones seem as ubiquitous in Shanghai as in Helsinki , with dot com firms as common as in San Francisco . 
Although the term &quot; irrational exuberance , &quot; once applied by America &apos;s central banker Alan Greenspan to the US stock market , does not apply here , the rush into New Economy investments , with even the prospect of a Chinese NASDAQ in the offing , has rejuvenated China &apos;s economy . 
As China embraces the new , however , its old industries are coming under enormous pressure . 
Coming just a few years after Asia &apos;s financial panic , China &apos;s euphoria is surprising . 
The government seems to be embracing the New Economy as a means to immunize China against future crisis . 
This is wishful thinking . 
No one should expect that a single crisis can burn away all of a country &apos;s economic weeds , nor that the New Economy is a magic bullet for risk-free growth . 
Over the past two centuries the developed world experienced periodic booms and busts on its way to prosperity . 
Those crises purged economies and societies of inefficiencies and helped improve their core institutions . 
The miracle of East-Asia ( including China ) over the past 30-40 years was not high growth alone but the fact that robust long term growth came about without inciting any major crisis . 
Asia &apos;s financial panic of 1997-1999 was a first for the region - which is why it stunned everyone - but it won &apos;t be the last . 
Despite all the hype , the New Economy cannot vaccinate a country from tumult . 
So , in the wake of New Economy euphoria , are China &apos;s technological ambitions and current growth rates sustainable ? 
Like some other Asian economies , China saw strong growth in the first half of 2000 . 
GDP grew by 8.2 % , higher than last year &apos;s 7.4 % for the same period . 
Moreover , three years of price deflation - which began during the financial crisis of 1997 - may be at an end . 
As in America at the beginning of its boom , however , the key to continuing growth is sustained investment and improved productivity . 
Investment in China has been growing steadily since the beginning of this year . 
Even more hopeful is the fact that private ( non-governmental ) investment has recovered from last years &quot; decline to a moderate 6.7 % growth in real term . 
This growth is the first improvement in the investment climate for 3 years . 
Although the New Economy is sometimes credited with these improvements , the real causes are more prosaic , which is why today &apos;s momentum can be maintained . 
Real structural adjustment occurred over the past 3-4 years : 16 millions state workers and 11 million others were laid off in urban and rural industries . 
Many enterprises were closed , not only small State owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , but also countless private and semi-private companies that were even more vulnerable than the SOEs to an economic slow-down . 
Manufacturing capacity has been slashed in some industries , making room for new investment . 
If private investment continues at its present pace , the government may be able to shelve its plans to stimulate investment through large-scale debt-financing , which will help sustain growth over the long run . 
Increased domestic consumption is also pushing China &apos;s economy ahead . 
Although the retail price index remains negative , retail sales increased 13.8 % in the second quarter . 
The most notable trend is an escalating demand for housing . 
Reform of housing laws , the opening of a secondary housing market , and in particular , the rapid expansion in the use of home mortgages are the main forces behind this growth . 
This trend will likely continue to play a big role over the next decade as China &apos;s 200million strong middle class sets out to become real property owners . 
Beyond housing , exports and imports grew powerfully , by 38.3 % and 36.2 % respectively so far this year , thanks to expansion in the world economy and Asia &apos;s recovery . 
Not too much weight should be given to this , however , as exports only contributed 0.3 % to GDP growth . 
Entry by China into the WTO may temporarily boost exports , but the dismantling of China &apos;s own trade barriers will increase imports quickly . 
This means that China &apos;s domestic market must become the focus of policymaking for growth . 
As a developing country with a per capita GDP of $ 800 , sharing similarities with other South-East Asian economies and ( at the same time ! ) a &quot; transition economy &quot; bearing the burden of central planning , China &apos;s domestic economy is a place riddled with economic , institutional , structural , and political problems . 
Because China is saddled with both transition and developing country difficulties , finding solutions for these problems is more demanding here than in societies that are either purely transitional or developing . 
This is another reason why Chinese policymakers must not jump on the New Economy bandwagon as an attempt to leap magically out of their problems into some utopian future . 
China has seen enough experimentation over the last half-century to know that when you attempt a great leap forward you land flat on your face . 
For China , today &apos;s increasing growth rates are sustainable if China continues to open its economy to competition with the world while ruthlessly excising the legacy of socialist industrialization . 
If such policies are pursued , Chinese growth may remain in the range of 7.5- 8 % , with low inflation continuing for the foreseeable future . 
It is only by keeping its eyes on its untrendy old economy that China &apos;s New Economy ambitions make any sense .
