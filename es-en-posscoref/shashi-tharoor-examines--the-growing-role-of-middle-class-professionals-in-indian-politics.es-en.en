India &apos;s Bourgeois Revolution 
NEW DELHI - In 2009 , when I competed in India &apos;s last parliamentary election , I was something of a rarity . 
I was not a professional politician . 
I was not born into a political family ; 
I had not even lived in India for decades , having spent my adult life working abroad for the United Nations . 
Nonetheless , I managed to wrest a seat from the opposition Communist Party of India , which had won the two previous elections in my constituency , with a substantial margin of 100,000 votes . 
This victory represented a slight crack in the well-guarded fortress of Indian politics , which had long been reserved for a small and largely hereditary circle . 
The only exceptions had been movie stars , whose popular appeal was based on fame , not political pedigree . 
Professionals who had built careers and reputations in other fields simply could not get their foot in the door . 
But this may finally be changing . 
In the current general election , there are more non-politician candidacies than in any previous poll . 
For example , Nandan Nilekani , co-founder of the technology giant Infosys , is running on behalf of the Congress Party in Bangalore , India &apos;s information-technology capital , against a five-term incumbent from the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . 
In Mumbai , the newly established Aam Aadmi ( Common Man &apos;s ) Party has nominated Meera Sanyal , a former head of the Royal Bank of Scotland &apos;s operations in India . 
And , in Chennai , the Congress has put forward the electronics engineer S.V. Ramani . 
This amounts to a fundamental shift from previous generations , when politicians tended to come from either the top or the bottom of Indian society - unless , of course , they were the nationalist leaders who won India &apos;s independence and comprised its original political class ( and whose heirs have continued their legacy ) . 
They could be maharajahs or zamindars ( landlords ) , with a feudal hold on their districts &quot; voters and the time and money to devote to politics . 
They could also be semi-literate members of the underclass , who viewed politics as their only means of advancement and could appeal to others like them . 
For everyone else , the route to success was to study hard , pass their exams , and build careers based on merit . 
Such an approach might be understandable in a highly competitive society where the salaried middle class could not take the kind of risks implied by a political career ; but it undermined the quality of Indian politics . 
Indeed , it excluded the educated professionals who tend to be a mainstay of democratic governments elsewhere , bringing middle-class values and convictions to politics . 
In Europe , for example , middle-class professionals comprise the bulk of the activists , voters , and candidates for political office . 
In India , by contrast , their counterparts are too busy working to make ends meet to have time for activism . 
They lack the money found at the top of India &apos;s stratified society , and they have little access to the votes that lie at the bottom . 
As a result , middle-class professionals have largely abstained from the political process . 
That pattern has allowed Indian politics to become increasingly populist , with candidates appealing to the lowest common denominator to win votes . 
Given this , growing disenchantment with Indian democracy among the middle class is not surprising . 
Some have even spoken of the &quot; secession of the elites &quot; from Indian politics . 
That is why the participation of middle-class candidates in the current election is so significant . 
If the old pattern is being reversed , the change is almost certainly a result of India &apos;s economic transformation , which has enabled millions of people to join the middle class , bringing with them a new energy and dynamism . 
Hard-working professionals are no longer willing to sit on the sidelines while the political class makes critical policy decisions . 
Equally important , India &apos;s educated middle class will , in the not-too-distant future , become large enough to matter in elections . 
To be sure , India &apos;s parliament already includes several educated young professionals who previously would not have participated in politics - people with good degrees , a clear vision for the country , international experience , bright ideas , and the capacity to articulate them . 
But they are all children of politicians . 
Though the dynastic trend in Indian politics may be bending , it is far from being broken : This year , the BJP has nominated technocrat Jayant Sinha for the seat being vacated by his father , former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha . 
And yet , despite their hereditary advantage , this new generation of educated , articulate , and forward-thinking politicians is raising the standard of Indian politics - a shift that the growing involvement of well-educated professionals will advance further . 
If the current trend continues , India &apos;s middle-class voters will have more representatives with whom they can identify , rather than having to pay allegiance to politicians for whom they constantly need to make excuses . 
That will be Indian democracy &apos;s salvation .
