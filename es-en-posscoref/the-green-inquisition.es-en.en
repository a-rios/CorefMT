The Green Inquisition 
COPENHAGEN - When it comes to global warming , extreme scare stories abound . 
Al Gore , for example , famously claimed that a whopping six meters ( 20 feet ) of sea-level rise would flood major cities around the world . 
Gore &apos;s scientific advisor , Jim Hansen from NASA , has even topped his protégé . 
Hansen suggests that there will eventually be sea-level rises of 24 meters ( 80 feet ) , with a six-meter rise happening just this century . 
Little wonder that fellow environmentalist Bill McKibben states that &quot; we are engaging in a reckless drive-by drowning of much of the rest of the planet and much of the rest of creation . &quot; 
Given all the warnings , here is a slightly inconvenient truth : over the past two years , the global sea level hasn &apos;t increased . 
It has slightly decreased . 
Since 1992 , satellites orbiting the planet have measured the global sea level every 10 days with an amazing degree of accuracy - 3-4 millimeters ( 0.2 inches ) . 
For two years , sea levels have declined . 
This doesn &apos;t mean that global warming is not true . 
As we emit more CO2 , over time the temperature will moderately increase , causing the sea to warm and expand somewhat . 
Thus , the sea-level rise is expected to pick up again . 
This is not terrifying or even particularly scary - 30 centimeters is how much the sea rose over the last 150 years . 
Simply put , we &apos;re being force-fed vastly over-hyped scare stories . 
Proclaiming six meters of sea-level rise over this century contradicts thousands of UN scientists , and requires the sea-level rise to accelerate roughly 40-fold from today . 
Imagine how climate alarmists would play up the story if we actually saw an increase in the sea-level rise . 
Increasingly , alarmists claim that we should not be allowed to hear such facts . 
In June , Hansen proclaimed that people who spread &quot; disinformation &quot; about global warming - CEOs , politicians , in fact anyone who doesn &apos;t follow Hansen &apos;s narrow definition of the &quot; truth &quot; - should literally be tried for crimes against humanity . 
It is depressing to see a scientist - even a highly politicized one - calling for a latter-day Inquisition . 
Such a blatant attempt to curtail scientific inquiry and stifle free speech seems inexcusable . 
But it is perhaps also a symptom of a broader problem . 
It is hard to keep up the climate panic as reality diverges from the alarmist predictions more than ever before : the global temperature has not risen over the past ten years , it has declined precipitously in the last year and a half , and studies show that it might not rise again before the middle of the next decade . 
With a global recession looming and high oil and food prices undermining the living standards of the Western middle class , it is becoming ever harder to sell the high-cost , inefficient Kyoto-style solution of drastic carbon cuts . 
A much sounder approach than Kyoto and its successor would be to invest more in research and development of zero-carbon energy technologies - a cheaper , more effective way to truly solve the climate problem . 
Hansen is not alone in trying to blame others for his message &apos;s becoming harder to sell . 
Canada &apos;s top environmentalist , David Suzuki , stated earlier this year that politicians &quot; complicit in climate change &quot; should be thrown in jail . 
Campaigner Mark Lynas envisions Nuremberg-style &quot; international criminal tribunals &quot; against those who dare to challenge the climate dogma . 
Clearly , this column places me at risk of incarceration by Hansen 
But the globe &apos;s real problem is not a series of inconvenient facts . 
Consider one of the most significant steps taken to respond to climate change . 
Adopted because of the climate panic , bio-fuels were supposed to reduce CO2 emissions . 
Hansen described them as part of a &quot; brighter future for the planet . &quot; 
But using bio-fuels to combat climate change must rate as one of the poorest global &quot; solutions &quot; to any great challenge in recent times . 
Bio-fuels essentially take food from mouths and puts it into cars . 
The grain required to fill the tank of an SUV with ethanol is enough to feed one African for a year . 
Thirty percent of this year &apos;s corn production in the United States will be burned up on America &apos;s highways . 
This has been possible only through subsidies that globally will total $ 15 billion this year alone . 
Because increased demand for bio-fuels leads to cutting down carbon-rich forests , a 2008 Science study showed that the net effect of using them is not to cut CO2 emissions , but to double them . 
The rush towards bio-fuels has also strongly contributed to rising food prices , which have tipped another roughly 30 million people into starvation . 
Because of climate panic , our attempts to mitigate climate change have provoked an unmitigated disaster . 
We will waste hundreds of billions of dollars , worsen global warming , and dramatically increase starvation . 
We have to stop being scared silly , stop pursuing stupid policies , and start investing in smart long-term R D. Accusations of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; must cease . 
Indeed , the real offense is the alarmism that closes minds to the best ways to respond to climate change .
