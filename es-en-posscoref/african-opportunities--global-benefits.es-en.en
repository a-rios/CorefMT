African Opportunities , Global Benefits 
NEW YORK - The global economic recession has translated into a development crisis for Africa , which is revealing the continent &apos;s vulnerability not only to economic contraction but also to climate change . 
Changing weather patterns are already affecting the lives of millions of Africans by reducing food security , facilitating the spread of diseases like malaria , and prompting mass migration . 
The livelihoods and lives of millions of people are at risk . 
Paradoxically , this crisis also presents a unique opportunity for Africa . 
The urgency of efforts to address climate change is revealing interesting prospects on the mitigation side , particularly in the areas of renewable energy and low-carbon growth . 
There is a real possibility to steer countries toward a new development model that will benefit not only Africa , but also the world . 
In the meantime , adaptation to climate change is critical . 
For Africa this means &quot; weather proofing &quot; development by increasing food yields , investing in climate-resilient crops and infrastructure , promoting rainwater harvesting , and expanding medical control measures in anticipation of an increase in vector-borne diseases . 
Africa needs additional resources , over and above existing aid commitments , to adapt to climate change . 
Financing adaptation to climate will be a formidable challenge , particularly as it involves additional costs above traditional development assistance - at a time when foreign-aid budgets are under pressure . 
Estimates of the amounts needed by developing countries to help them adapt to these challenges vary between $ 50 and $ 100 billion per year . 
This is why British Prime Minister Gordon Brown &apos;s proposal to create a fund for climate change is so welcome . 
Failing to act now will increase costs in the future - both financial and humanitarian . 
We all stand to lose from a reversal of the economic and social progress made across Africa in the past decade . 
Burgeoning markets might disappear and investment opportunities evaporate , while the risk of political instability will increase . 
Every percentage-point fall in growth has direct social consequences , whether on nutrition levels , infant mortality , or school attendance . 
Every person pushed back into poverty is another step away from achieving the Millennium Development Goals . 
For all of these reasons , the continued engagement and support of all of Africa &apos;s partners , including the G-8 countries , is vital . 
As this year &apos;s DATA Report from the Africa advocacy group ONE underscores , many donors are honoring their aid commitments , despite the economic downturn . 
These countries recognize the practical value of investing in Africa &apos;s development , as well as the moral and political imperative of keeping their promises . 
They acknowledge that Africa is bearing the brunt of the economic and climate crises , even though it was least responsible for creating them . 
Regrettably , this is not the case for all G-8 countries . 
Italy , this year &apos;s G-8 host , has fallen behind its peers at a time when it is supposed to lead by example . 
We need solutions that will prevent environmental catastrophe and that are equitable for every human being . 
This will require bold political leadership and unprecedented solidarity between rich and poor countries . 
At this year &apos;s G-8 summit , a breakthrough on supporting agriculture , investing in green technology , and strengthening health systems is possible . 
We hope that the G-8 leaders demonstrate foresight and include Africa in their deliberations . 
Africa &apos;s international partners must not look the other way at this crucial moment .
