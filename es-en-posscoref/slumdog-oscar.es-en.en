Slumdog Oscar 
NEW DELHI - Indians haven &apos;t often had much to root for at the Oscars , Hollywood &apos;s annual celebration of cinematic success . 
Only two Indian movies have been nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category in the last 50 years , and neither won . 
So Indians take vicarious pleasure in the triumphs of &quot; mainstream &quot; pictures with an Indian connection - the seven Oscars won by Richard Attenborough &apos;s Gandhi in 1983 , for instance , or the success of The Sixth Sense , written and directed by a Philadelphian of Indian descent , Manoj Night Shyamalan . 
This year , the country &apos;s attention has been riveted by the surprise Oscar winning best picture , Slumdog Millionaire - set in India , with Indian characters , Indian actors and Indian themes - which was nominated in ten categories . 
Indeed , for the first time , Indian citizens won for best song and for A. R. Rahman &apos;s musical score . 
Movies made by Westerners about India have rarely been worth writing home about , ranging as they &apos;ve done from the ignorant racism of Steven Spielberg &apos;s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom to David Lean &apos;s well-intentioned but cringe-inducing Passage to India , with Alec Guinness warbling away in brown-face . 
But most Indians regard Slumdog Millionaire as an exception . 
Directed by Scotland &apos;s Danny Boyle ( Trainspotting ) , and based on the page-turning novel Q and A by Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup , the film has captured the hearts of audiences and critics around the world with its tale of a child from the slums , a tea-boy in a call-center , who wins a TV quiz show modeled on Who Wants to be a Millionaire . 
Exuberant , exciting , gaudy , and gritty in a way that can only be called Dickensian , Slumdog Millionaire brings contemporary Mumbai to life from the seamy side up , and it does so with brio , compassion , and all-round cinematic excellence . 
This being India , the film - which is just beginning its cinematic release in the country , months after it hit Western screens - has also provoked dissent . 
Protests have been mounted by slum-dwellers against the movie &apos;s title : the term &quot; slumdog , &quot; coined by the screenwriter , has given great offense , with demonstrators holding up postcards declaiming , &quot; We are not dogs . &quot; 
( To the dismay of Indian liberals , a judge has admitted a petition against the filmmakers , but it is difficult to believe the case will go far . ) 
Others have , more predictably , decried the film &apos;s searingly authentic depiction of India &apos;s poverty and slum life . 
Slumdog Millionaire was filmed in large part with small hand-held digital cameras on location in Dharavi , Mumbai &apos;s ( and Asia &apos;s ) biggest slum , and does not skip the mounds of garbage , cesspits , and overflowing drains . 
There is even a scene involving human excrement that is both revolting and hilarious . 
But this is not an exercise in the pornography of poverty . 
Slum life is depicted with integrity and dignity , and with a joie de vivre that transcends its setting . 
It is easy to see why this movie would appeal to international filmgoers in a way that a bleaker film like City of Joy , which was set in the slums of Calcutta , could not . 
Others have protested that the film shows Indians as conniving , unprincipled , and ruthless , and that the only compassionate people in the film are a pair of white tourists who give the protagonist some money . 
This may reveal something of Boyle &apos;s view of human nature , but most Indian viewers know they live in a land largely devoid of larger-than-life heroes . 
We Indians have learned to take human beings as they are , which is to say , as grossly imperfect . 
And the film &apos;s hero , played by the teenage British-Indian actor Dev Patel with a look that combines intensity and expressiveness , and yet seems utterly genuine , is as sincere a protagonist as you could hope to find . 
So , Slumdog Millionaire following its four Golden Globes and Screen Actors &quot; Guild awards , seven BAFTA awards ( the British Oscars ) , and eight Academy Awards , is a cause to celebrate in India . 
And , if some of the film &apos;s larger-than-expected profits are directed toward the slums where the movie was made , the protestors are quite likely to fade away . 
Slumdog Millionaire is the work of an artist at the peak of his powers . 
India is Boyle &apos;s palette , and Mumbai - that teeming &quot; maximum city , &quot; with 19 million strivers on the make , jostling , scheming , struggling , and killing for success - is his brush . 
The portrait that emerges has been executed with bold strokes , vivid colors , and striking images . 
It would have stayed in the mind &apos;s eye a long time , whether or not it swept the Oscars .
