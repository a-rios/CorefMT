The Coming Global Credit Glut 
HONG KONG - With world leaders meeting at the end of this week at the G-20 summit in Cannes , France , the next economic minefield that they will face is already coming into view . 
It is likely to take the form of an opaque global credit glut , turbocharged by the fragile mixture of too-big-to-fail global banking with a huge and largely unwatched and unregulated shadow banking sector . 
To be sure , that is not what many see . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke and others have blamed the financial crisis of 2008 on a global savings glut , which fuelled flows of money from high-savings emerging-market economies - especially in Asia - that run chronic balance-of-payments surpluses . 
According to this school of thought , excessive savings pushed long-term interest rates down to rock-bottom levels , leading to asset bubbles in the United States and elsewhere . 
But Claudio Borio and Piti Disayat , economists at the Bank for International Settlements , have argued convincingly that the savings-glut theory fails to explain the unsustainable credit creation in the run-up to the 2008 crisis . 
They have shown that the major capital inflows were not from emerging markets , but from Europe , where there was no net balance-of-payments surplus . 
The alternative theory - of a global credit glut - gained more ground with the release last week of the Financial Stability Board &apos;s report on shadow banking . 
The FSB report contains startling revelations about the scale of global shadow banking , which it defines as &quot; credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system . &quot; 
The report , which was requested by G-20 leaders at their summit in Seoul last November , found that between 2002 and 2007 , the shadow banking system increased by $ 33 trillion , more than doubling in asset size from $ 27 trillion to $ 60 trillion . 
This is 8.5 times higher than the total US current-account deficit of $ 3.9 trillion during the same period . 
The shadow banking system is estimated at roughly 25-30 % of the global financial system ( $ 250 trillion , excluding derivatives ) and at half of total global banking assets . 
This represents a huge regulatory &quot; black hole &quot; at the center of the global financial system , hitherto not closely monitored for monetary and financial stability purposes . 
Its importance was exposed only by analysis of the key roles played by structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) and money-market funds ( MMFs ) in the 2008 meltdown . 
The shadow banking system is complex , because it comprises a mix of institutions and vehicles . Investment funds other than MMFs account for 29 % of total , and SIVs make up 9 % , but the shadow system also includes public financial institutions ( such as the government-backed mortgage lender Fannie Mae in the US ) . 
They are some of the largest counterparties with the regular banking system , and their combined credit creation and proprietary trading and hedging may account for much of the global liquidity flows that make monetary and financial stability so difficult to ensure . 
The trouble is that , by 2010 , the shadow banking system was about the same size as it was just before the 2007 market crash , whereas the regulated global banking system was 18 % larger than in 2007 . 
That is why the FSB report pinpoints the shadow banking system , together with the large global banks , as sources of systemic risk . 
But the global problem is likely to be much larger than the sum of its parts . 
Specifically , global credit creation by the regular and shadow banking systems is likely to be significantly larger than the sum of the credit creation currently measured by national statistics . 
There are several reasons for this . 
First , credit that can be , and is , created offshore and through off-balance-sheet SIVs is not captured by national balance-of-payments statistics . In other words , while a &quot; savings &quot; glut may contribute to low interest rates and fuel excess credit creation , it is not the main cause . 
Second , the volatile &quot; carry trade &quot; is notoriously difficult to measure , because most of it is conducted through derivatives in options , forwards , and swaps , which are treated as off-balance sheet - that is , as net numbers that are below the line in accounting terms . 
Thus , in gross terms , the leverage effects are larger than currently reported . 
Third , the interaction between the shadow banking system and the global banks is highly concentrated , because the global banks act as prime brokers , particularly for derivative trades . 
Data from the US Comptroller of Currency suggest that the top five US banks account for 96 % of the total over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivative trades in the US . 
Indeed , the nightmare scenario haunting the world is the collapse of another shadow banking entity , causing global trade to freeze , as happened in 2008 . 
The Basel III agreement on capital adequacy and other recent reforms still have not ring-fenced trade financing from these potential shocks . 
We urgently need to monitor and understand the role of shadow banking and the too-big-to-fail banks in creating the global credit glut . 
Obtaining a full picture of global monetary and credit numbers and their determinants is a vital first step . 
So far , the G-20 &quot; s call to &quot; think globally &quot; has turned into &quot; act locally . &quot; 
We hope that the G-20 leaders will think systemically at Cannes , and act nationally and cooperatively to defuse the global credit glut minefield .
