Rebalancing the State &apos;s Balance Sheet 
MILAN - Until recently , relatively little attention was paid to states &quot; balance sheets . 
Measurement and reporting were neglected . 
Even today , states &quot; liabilities receive considerable attention , while their asset sides receive significantly less . 
In an earlier era , states owned substantial industrial assets . 
This &quot; commanding heights of the economy &quot; model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed , especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition ( as was the norm ) . 
Efficiency declined . 
But , more important , the absence of entry and exit by firms , a key ingredient of innovation , caused dynamism to suffer and losses to grow over time . 
The model &apos;s shortcomings led to privatization in many developed and developing countries . 
In Europe , privatization was viewed as a key step in the integration process . 
The theory , in Europe and elsewhere , was that states could not be impartial owners of industrial assets . 
Through regulation , public procurement , and hidden subsidies , they would favor their own assets . 
Of course , state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism . 
Regulations in a range of countries , from Japan to Italy , create sectors that are sheltered from competition , with detrimental effects on productivity . 
This pattern is particularly pronounced in the non-tradable sectors ( which account for two-thirds of the economy ) , where the discipline of foreign competition is absent by definition . 
Even here , foreign-based domestic competitors could improve performance . 
It is important that more attention is now paid to public liabilities - not only growing sovereign debt , but also larger , non-debt liabilities embedded in social-insurance programs . 
A combination of defective growth models , rising longevity , and unanticipated increases in costs ( such as health care in America ) have caused these longer-term liabilities to explode . 
Reining in debt and other liabilities has substantially reduced governments &quot; scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative shocks , thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adjustment in the private sector . 
For now , investment in a shift to a sustainable growth and employment pattern has been crowded out . 
Shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible , but too problematic politically , with the burden-sharing issue usually leading to impasse and inaction . 
Meanwhile , the asset side of states &quot; balance sheets remains largely invisible . 
States own land , mineral rights , and infrastructure . 
Some have sovereign wealth funds . 
Many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude , consisting of diversified portfolios of assets . 
These assets are , in a sense , spoken for - there are claims on them in the form of liabilities , which have grown as expected risk-adjusted returns on assets decline ; but they do represent a partial funding of public liabilities and are an element of resilience . 
By contrast , in China , the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large : land , foreign-currency reserves of $ 3.5 trillion , and around an 85 % stake in state-owned enterprises that account for about 40 % of output . 
This balance-sheet configuration has helped China to respond to shocks and sustain high levels of public-sector investment . 
The liability side will expand as social insurance grows - but slowly , owing to a fear of underestimating the liabilities being created . 
In the best case - without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic downturn , a sudden collapse of a defective growth model , or even rapid increases in liabilities associated with demographic shifts or health-care technology - it might make sense to focus only on controlling liabilities . 
But a best-case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our imperfect world . 
In fact , states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations : unsustainable growth patterns and regulatory myopia ; distributional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization ; accelerating concentration of national income ; and major structural transitions associated with shocks and secular trends in technology and the global economy . 
Here is the dilemma : Governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act , but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism . 
In China , where the asset side of the balance sheet is large , the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected , at least for now . 
The loss of resilience would be too great . 
That leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets - management that promotes rather than impedes market efficiency and innovation . 
Here , what might be called the pension / sovereign-wealth-fund model - in which a public entity holds and manages a diversified portfolio of assets as a financial investor with appropriately specified duties and governance - seems to be the right way to go . 
The asset side of the balance sheet is maintained in the aggregate , but the management of the assets , particularly the diversification of holdings , can be thought of as prudent and de facto privatized . 
For developed countries , increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority . 
Periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finances , not only financial markets , and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change . 
In practice , this means two things . 
First , once a collective choice is made about the desired levels of social insurance , the implied liabilities should be fully funded over time . 
The alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice . 
Second , governments , like individuals , households , and businesses , need to save for a rainy day . 
That is all the more important in periods - like the current one - of rapid change , high volatility , and only partly predictable systemic instability .
