Europe &apos;s Trapped Politics 
PARIS - When the last European Parliament election was held , in 2009 , it seemed that Europe &apos;s citizens were all facing the same dangers . 
Across the continent , governments were busy coping with the consequences of the global crisis that had erupted the year before . 
Five years later , on the eve of another European Parliament election , the situation could not be more different . 
Back in 2009 , Europe faced a widely shared imperative to rescue distressed banks , fight recession , and contain a sharp rise in unemployment . 
There was also unity on a policy strategy : emergency stimulus , followed by fiscal consolidation . 
True , there were differences among countries , but most observers regarded them as less important relative to the common challenges . 
After all , unemployment in the southern eurozone was only marginally higher than in the north , and public debt / GDP ratios seemed to be on a convergence path . 
Of course , everybody suspected that Greek public finances were in worse conditions than reported , but no one imagined that Greece &apos;s official data were as detached from reality as they turned out to be . 
There was apparently less divergence within the eurozone than within many of its constituent countries . 
Today , unemployment in the eurozone &apos;s south is three times higher than in the north ; the debt / GDP ratio is almost 50 percentage points higher ; and borrowing costs for southern European companies are 250 basis points higher than for northern companies . 
True , financial fragmentation has diminished somewhat . 
Its emergence and the reactions to it have been the dominant theme of policy discussions since 2009 . 
If Europe were politically unified , the issue would dominate the run-up to next month &apos;s European Parliament election as well . 
One camp would call for massive north-to-south fiscal transfers . 
Another would emphasize the need for structural adjustment as a precondition for investment and job creation . 
A third would propose that governments , rather than hoping that jobs move to people , should accept that people will have to move to jobs . 
There would be enough sound and fury to interest the voters and lure them into voting . 
Instead , such ideas - reminiscent of the debate in the United States in the 1930 &quot; s about how to respond to the Great Depression - are barely discussed in Europe . 
Rather , mainstream European parties have cautiously avoided proposals that could prove divisive . 
Their manifestos and campaign materials do not convey the sense of urgency that the current situation demands . 
This caution benefits fringe parties that advocate radical solutions . 
They hope to profit from the voters &quot; anger against whomever can be held responsible for the current situation . 
But the fringe parties are not united . 
In the north , they object to the risks entailed by financial assistance provided to the south . 
In the south , they protest against the austerity imposed by the north . 
This hardly forms the basis for a common message , let alone a unified policy . 
Is there a better way ? 
European federalists call for a politically integrated Europe , where policy options are presented to citizens , debated openly , and decided upon in elections . 
To this end , federalists backed an idea first proposed by former European Commission President Jacques Delors and included in the European Union &apos;s Lisbon Treaty , adopted in 2007 : Political parties should nominate candidates for President of the Commission , and the election to the European Parliament should decide who gets the job . 
This formula will be implemented in the upcoming election ( the first since the Lisbon Treaty entered into force in December 2009 ) , and there is much to say in its favor from a democratic standpoint . 
The Commission cannot , for example , propose to the parliament that it raise taxes and finance transfers , because any decision regarding taxation requires the unanimous agreement of all 28 member states . 
It cannot reform labor markets , because this is a national competence . 
It cannot decide what the European Investment Bank should do , because the EIB has its own governance . 
And , while it can exhort governments to lift limitations on labor mobility , it cannot compel them to do so . 
More fundamentally , the degree of solidarity among European citizens is not something that can be decided in a parliamentary election . 
In each EU country , redistribution is a prerogative of the central government . 
National parliaments can decide to levy taxes to finance transfers . Though they may be compelled to take into account political limitations - like in Belgium , Italy , or Spain - they rarely face legal limitations . 
But the political limitations are very strong : the most prosperous countries &quot; citizens may accept contributing to solidarity with the less prosperous ones , but they would not accept being outvoted and forced to subsidize their neighbors . 
As long as this situation prevails , the politics of rich and poor will remain outside the scope of the European Parliament , and voters &quot; interest in participating in its election will remain intrinsically bounded . 
Anyone tempted to judge this election by the same standard as national elections should bear that in mind .
