Is Russia &apos;s Economic Crisis Over ? 
MOSCOW - Has Russia &apos;s economic crisis ended ? 
That depends on who you ask . 
Ask Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , or any official of his United Russia party , and you will be told , &quot; Of course it is over . &quot; 
They will even produce proof in the form of an unemployment rate that does not rise , unprecedented increases in pensions , and strong growth in construction and metal-working . 
Of course , all these comparisons are made with how things stood last month rather than with the country &apos;s pre-crisis economic performance . 
Then there is another &quot; miracle &quot; that the government is starting to trumpet , one discovered in August 2009 : an increase in Russia &apos;s population . 
Unfortunately , in no month before or since have births outpaced deaths . 
Ask a member of the opposition whether the crisis has ended , and you will be told that it is only just beginning . 
Gazprom &apos;s production is falling at a dizzying pace ; the country &apos;s single-industry &quot; mono-towns &quot; are dying . 
There is truth in both views about the state of Russia &apos;s economy , but because the government controls all the major television channels , it is succeeding in enforcing its view of the situation . 
Indeed , the opposition has access only to a few newspapers and radio stations , leaving the Internet the sole remaining space of freedom in Russia . 
But there you can read very pessimistic estimates of the country &apos;s economic future . 
So the Kremlin blinds its citizens with rosy scenarios , while the Internet over-dramatizes reality . 
The truth , it is clear , is somewhere in the middle . 
What is beyond dispute is that Russia &apos;s economic health depends on external factors . 
But , outside Russia , no responsible economists can even begin to say whether the crisis is truly over . 
They know that relatively calm markets do not mean that strong economic growth is around the corner . 
Russia &quot; s economy is now hostage to potential global growth . 
It is clear why : the state budget depends almost totally on energy prices . 
Now that oil price has reached $ 80 per barrel , Russia &apos;s central bank can start buying foreign currency again . 
Gold and foreign currency reserves are increasing , implying appreciation of the ruble . 
But Russia &apos;s budget for 2010 is still headed for a serious deficit , owing to high spending . 
The rapid income growth of the early Putin years is a thing of the past . 
While it persisted , expenditures swelled but were manageable - until , suddenly , energy prices collapsed . 
The Kremlin , devoted to its key fetish -Putin &apos;s approval ratings - proved completely unprepared to curtail public spending in the wake of falling state revenues . 
The budget deficit , unsurprisingly , ballooned . 
The late Yegor Gaidar , Russia &apos;s first pro-reform prime minister , warned the government about the consequences of inflated oil prices , repeatedly arguing that excessive spending growth would undermine the political will for retrenchment when it became necessary . 
Gaidar died last year , his unheeded warnings having come true , proving once again that no man is ever a successful prophet in his own country . 
In recent months , Russia &apos;s government finally brought inflation down to 8 % . 
Sometimes this is presented as another milestone demonstrating that the crisis is near its end . 
But that is wrong . 
Inflation fell as a result of the crisis , which reversed the direction of capital flows . 
Whereas inward investment reached $ 20 billion in 2008 , capital outflows totaled $ 20 billion in 2009 . 
The central bank buys less foreign currency , and thus issues fewer rubles , reducing inflation . 
A far more inertial indicator is unemployment , which experts predict will grow in 2010 . 
The problem is that Russian labor is less mobile than in the Europe and the United States . 
Russians prefer lower wages - or simply waiting with no wages at all - to moving in search of a new job . 
The situation at carmaker AUTOVaz is a striking example . 
Last year , output fell to 300,000 cars , from 800,000 in 2008 . 
Such a dramatic fall in sales would normally require massive layoffs or lower wages . 
Yet , of the company &apos;s 102,000 employees , only 27 favored layoffs . 
As a result , wages were cut by half . 
The state , which is seeking to rescue the domestic automobile industry , allocated to the firm more credits through state-owned banks . 
But how long can such a situation last ? 
One day , it will no longer be possible to disguise unemployment through shorter working weeks , forced leaves of absence , and decreases in wages . 
When that happens - and there is a strong probability that it will happen next year - the crisis will only just be beginning for Russia . 
All over the world - in the US , Europe , and China - stimulus programs have paid off , as expected . 
But it is not yet certain whether the engine of the global economy will be able to run without additional liquidity , possibly undermining fiscal stability worldwide . 
Elsewhere , that will become clear in the first half of 2010 ; in Russia , signs of recovery , if they appear at all , will lag well behind the rest of the world .
