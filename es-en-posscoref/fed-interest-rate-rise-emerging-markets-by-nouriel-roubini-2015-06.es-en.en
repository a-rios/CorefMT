Emerging Markets After the Fed Hikes Rates 
NEW YORK - The prospect that the US Federal Reserve will start exiting zero policy rates later this year has fueled growing fear of renewed volatility in emerging economies &quot; currency , bond , and stock markets . 
The concern is understandable : When the Fed signaled in 2013 that the end of its quantitative-easing ( QE ) policy was forthcoming , the resulting &quot; taper tantrum &quot; sent shock waves through many emerging countries &quot; financial markets and economies . 
Indeed , rising interest rates in the United States and the ensuing likely rise in the value of the dollar could , it is feared , wreak havoc among emerging markets &quot; governments , financial institutions , corporations , and even households . 
Because all have borrowed trillions of dollars in the last few years , they will now face an increase in the real local-currency value of these debts , while rising US rates will push emerging markets &quot; domestic interest rates higher , thus increasing debt-service costs further . 
But , although the prospect of the Fed raising interest rates is likely to create significant turbulence in emerging countries &quot; financial markets , the risk of outright crises and distress is more limited . 
For starters , whereas the 2013 taper tantrum caught markets by surprise , the Fed &apos;s intention to hike rates this year , clearly stated over many months , will not . 
Moreover , the Fed is likely to start raising rates later and more slowly than in previous cycles , responding gradually to signs that US economic growth is robust enough to sustain higher borrowing costs . 
This stronger growth will benefit emerging markets that export goods and services to the US . 
Another reason not to panic is that , compared to 2013 , when policy rates were low in many fragile emerging economies , central banks already have tightened their monetary policy significantly . 
With policy rates at or close to double-digit levels in many of those economies , the authorities are not behind the curve the way they were in 2013 . 
Loose fiscal and credit policies have been tightened as well , reducing large current-account and fiscal deficits . 
Above all , most emerging markets are financially more sound today than they were a decade or two ago , when financial fragilities led to currency , banking , and sovereign-debt crises . 
Most now have flexible exchange rates , which leave them less vulnerable to a disruptive collapse of currency pegs , as well as ample reserves to shield them against a run on their currencies , government debt , and bank deposits . 
Most also have a relatively smaller share of dollar debt relative to local-currency debt than they did a decade ago , which will limit the increase in their debt burden when the currency depreciates . 
Their financial systems are typically more sound as well , with more capital and liquidity than when they experienced banking crises . 
In fact , serious financial problems in several emerging economies - particularly oil and commodity producers exposed to the slowdown in China - are unrelated to what the Fed does . 
Brazil , which will experience recession and high inflation this year , complained when the Fed launched QE and then when it stopped QE . 
Its problems are mostly self-inflicted - the result of loose monetary , fiscal , and credit policies , all of which must now be tightened , during President Dilma Roussef &apos;s first administration . 
Russia &apos;s troubles , too , do not reflect the impact of Fed policies . 
Its economy is suffering as a result of the fall in oil prices and international sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine - a war that will now force Ukraine to restructure its foreign debt , which the war , severe recession , and currency depreciation have rendered unsustainable . 
Likewise , Venezuela was running large fiscal deficits and tolerating high inflation even when oil prices were above $ 100 a barrel ; at current prices , it may have to default on its public debt , unless China decides to bail out the country . 
Similarly , some of the economic and financial stresses faced by South Africa , Argentina , and Turkey are the result of poor policies and domestic political uncertainties , not Fed action . 
In short , the Fed &apos;s exit from zero policy rates will cause serious problems for those emerging market economies that have large internal and external borrowing needs , large stocks of dollar-denominated debt , and macroeconomic and policy fragilities . 
China &apos;s economic slowdown , together with the end of the commodity super-cycle , will create additional headwinds for emerging economies , most of which have not implemented the structural reforms needed to boost their potential growth . 
But , again , these problems are self-inflicted , and many emerging economies do have stronger macro and structural fundamentals , which will give them greater resilience when the Fed starts hiking rates . 
When it does , some will suffer more than others ; but , with a few exceptions lacking systemic importance , widespread distress and crises need not occur .
