Corruption : The Enemy Within 
TBILISI : Corruption is a malignant tumor , removable only with pain . 
So widespread is it in my country that almost every state initiative seems tainted by corruption , with the result that the implementation of some governmental programs is now highly suspect in the minds of many ordinary people . 
Towering levels of corruption damage not only the authority of government at home , but the very standing of Georgia as an independent state abroad . 
To maintain that independence , to fulfill our domestic and foreign policy priorities , the suppression of corruption must be my country &apos;s most urgent priority . 
For eight years I have governed , as president , an independent Georgia . 
Ending the civil war that erupted almost simultaneously with Georgian independence , and putting a stop to the bloody conflicts and attempts at secession that followed , required me , at times , to compromise on some issues in order to rescue even more important values - such as the very life of the country . 
The eight years of my presidency , indeed , have been devoted to transforming the sick Georgian state of its early years of independence into a healthy one . 
Hard choices were made concerning those problems to be solved first and those to be addressed later . 
Now , with domestic peace restored , I must declare that nothing is more important for Georgia than combating corruption . 
This decision is made more necessary because Georgia &apos;s economy is , at last , growing again . 
In the first part of this year , GDP increased 5 % and industrial output by 11 % . 
Exports are rising as are after-tax incomes . 
With financial panic in retreat , unpaid salaries , pensions , and other basic state obligations are being met . 
But this success , and the stability it brings , will be temporary if corruption continues , like corrosive acid , to eat away at the economy and the state . 
Up to now we have not been completely inactive in seeking to narrow the &quot; corruption space &quot; within our economy and politics . 
A proper , functioning elected legislature has been created , which is very important because democratic oversight is the most reliable anti-corruption watchdog . 
Criminal , civil and administrative codes that reflect Georgia &apos;s contemporary democratic and market-based reality have replaced the old Leninist norms that were an open invitation to corrupt practices . 
The common courts and Supreme Court now have their own independent institutional basis in law . 
Many laws on licensing , monopolies , competition , and state purchasing that target the sources of ( and opportunities for ) corruption are now on the books . 
Public disclosure of the wealth of state officials will also help in curbing corruption &apos;s intrusions into state activity . 
The penal system has been re-organized under the Ministry of Justice . 
Indeed , two thousand people have been arrested over the last three years for such crimes as abuse of power and misappropriation of state property . 
Six hundred have been imprisoned . 
Despite these laws and institutional reforms our anti-corruption drives have , up to now , produced none of the desired results . 
Discrete , limited programs failed to create properly functioning state mechanisms . 
So pervasive is corruption , indeed , that the fight against it seems impossible when undertaken in terms of separate laws and actions . 
Moreover , populist , demagogic campaigns against corruption may gain headlines but in the end they accomplish nothing . 
They may even entrench corruption by masking its true causes and culprits . 
I could , for example , have increased my popularity during my recent re-election campaign had I ordered the arrest of one or another of our domestic oligarchs . 
But such a contrived &quot; show trials &quot; would have delivered no lasting benefits for Georgia . 
To fight corruption on the scale that confronts Georgia , the attack must be coordinated and multi-faceted . 
My long experience at the wheel of my country convinces me that unprepared actions , uncoordinated campaigns , are superficial and yield only temporary results . 
To coordinate this anti-corruption drive I recently signed a presidential decree authorizing a &quot; National Anti-corruption Program &quot; to be headed by Lado Chanturia , Chairman of the Supreme Court of Georgia . 
Its uncompromising task is to make certain that no single agency avoids its responsibility in this fight . 
Armed with the power to demand from every state office the information it needs , the Commission will systematically root out corruption by reforming the state . 
Key elements of the Commission &apos;s work include seeking ways to : 
• curtail bureaucratic discretion so that opportunities for corruption begin to disappear ; 
• increase privatization because privatization strengthens constituencies that support legality ; 
• increase openness , for competition reduces corruption ; 
• limit regulation to what the administrative and judicial systems can handle , because simplicity , uniformity , and elimination of special exemptions are necessary if abuse of discretionary powers for corrupt purposes is to be eradicated ; 
• reform the civil service and introduce competitive pressures within government by creating overlapping jurisdictions and enforcement duties . 
In this fight , Georgia &apos;s independent media must play its role . 
The media is Georgian democracy &apos;s most notable achievement up to now . 
Unfettered , it can assist in the fight against entrenched corruption . 
Georgia &apos;s renewed independence was born almost a decade ago in a violence Georgians did not seek . 
Now that peace has returned and is accepted as a daily aspect of life , let no one doubt Georgia &apos;s will to establish the conditions and institutions of an enduring civility and prosperity .
