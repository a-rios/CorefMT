Why Turkey \ u0027s Army Will Stay Home 
Just when the smoke from Turkey &apos;s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear , another deadly attack by Kurdish separatists on Turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern Iraq . 
That prospect raises risks for Turkey , Iraq , and the United States . 
Turkey accuses Iraqi Kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of Turkey &apos;s most active Kurdish militants - the PKK separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 Turkish soldiers so far this year . 
The trouble reached the boiling point on October 7 , when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey &apos;s border with Iraq . 
The Turkish public has demanded action , and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s government has responded . 
On October 17 , despite pleas for patience and restraint from Iraq and the US , Turkish lawmakers voted 507-19 to authorize Erdogan to order cross-border military strikes into Iraq at any time over the next year . 
Erdogan has sent Iraqi Kurds a forceful message . 
First , the Turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in Iraq &apos;s sectarian strife . 
A full-scale invasion might well provoke Iraq &apos;s own Kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with Turkish forces that can only undermine support for Erdogan &apos;s government at home and abroad . 
Second , Turkey &apos;s government hopes to keep the country &apos;s bid to join the European Union moving forward . 
An invasion of Iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt . 
EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana has made plain that Europe strongly opposes any large-scale Turkish military operation in Iraq . 
Third , Turkey is well aware that an all-out attack inside Iraq is exactly what Turkey &apos;s Kurdish separatists want . 
What better way to damage Turkey than to pull its military into conflict with Iraq , the US , and the EU ? 
Erdogan has no intention of being drawn into that trap . 
With all that in mind , this latest move by Turkey &apos;s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to Iraq &apos;s Kurdish Regional Government to expel the Turkish Kurds and an attempt to persuade the US to use its considerable influence there . 
That &apos;s hardball politics , not a declaration of war . 
The parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline Turkey &apos;s limited aims . 
It stresses that Turkey &apos;s military has no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or threatening Iraqi Kurds or their oil infrastructure . 
An attack would certainly make Iraq &apos;s Kurdish provinces less appealing for foreign investors . 
Iraq &apos;s central government is aware of the risks , as well , and is likely to exercise maximum restraint . 
A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty . 
Threats to Iraq &apos;s oil infrastructure around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and other territory under the Kurdish Regional Government &apos;s control are minimal . 
Turkey &apos;s government knows that any move to shut down the 600-mile pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey &apos;s Mediterranean port at Ceyhan would have little near-term impact , since most of Iraq &apos;s oil exports flow from the south , hundreds of miles from the country &apos;s border with Turkey . 
Furthermore , the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kurds with far less drastic measures . 
It can close the two countries &quot; principal border crossing , an important route for food , fuel , and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds . 
It could also cut exports of electricity to northern Iraq . 
Still , even small-scale military operations would generate risk . 
If the PKK is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside Turkey , the public outcry might leave Erdogan with little choice but to up the ante . 
The issue is complicated further by Turkey &apos;s refusal to negotiate directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq . 
Such talks , Turkey fears , would offer tacit acknowledgement that Iraqi Kurds have won a degree of autonomy from Baghdad . 
That &apos;s a bridge too far for Turkey &apos;s nationalists and its military . 
There are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as well , because Turkish military strikes on Iraq &apos;s northern provinces could undermine the Kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends . 
Both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki &apos;s mild reaction to Iran &apos;s recent shelling of Iraqi territory - an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq . 
There are also risks for the US . 
With the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago , this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq . 
But , worst-case scenarios aside , a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish separatists . 
That &apos;s why cooler heads are likely to prevail . 
Limited cross-border operations are increasingly likely .
