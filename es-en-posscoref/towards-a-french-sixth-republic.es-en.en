Towards a French Sixth Republic ? 
PARIS - Nearly 50 years after the creation of the Fifth Republic by General Charles de Gaulle , Nicolas Sarkozy wants to change France &apos;s fundamental institutions . 
An expert council will send him its proposals by November 1 . 
Whereas British democracy is deeply rooted despite its supposedly &quot; unwritten &quot; constitution , and the US constitution has been amended only 26 times since 1787 , France has redrafted its constitution 15 times since 1789 . 
Only the Third Republic ( 1875-1940 ) lasted longer than the current Fifth Republic . 
Established quickly in 1958 by de Gaulle in the midst of the Algerian crisis , tthe institutions of the Fifth Republic came under fire from the very first day . 
The antagonism that much of the left felt toward the Fifth Republic , which was tailored to fit de Gaulle &apos;s outsized figure , faded only in 1981 , when Fran√ßois Mitterrand , one of de Gaulle &apos;s most vocal opponents , benefited from the power vested in the presidency . 
Since then , a consensus has emerged in favor of the 1958 constitutional structure , because it has provided France with the strong executive it had always lacked . 
De Gaulle &apos;s constitution has also proved flexible enough to allow France to overcome several crises - Algeria , May 1968 , de Gaulle &apos;s resignation , changes of government from right to left , and antagonism between left-wing presidents and right-wing prime ministers or vice-versa ( &quot; la cohabitation &quot; ) , as occurred in 1986 , 1993 , and 1997 . 
But , despite a half-century of political stability , there is growing criticism of the Fifth Republic &apos;s institutional arrangements . 
Some blame the hybrid nature of de Gaulle &apos;s system for France &apos;s seeming political paralysis . 
Neither presidential ( the prime minister is accountable to the National Assembly , whereas there is no accountability in a presidential regime ) nor parliamentary ( the president is elected by direct suffrage and has significant power ) , the system has seen increasing periods of &quot; cohabitation , &quot; which has generally proven inefficient . 
Others believe that France &apos;s current institutions are the main , if not the only , cause of an emerging democratic crisis . 
Distrust of politicians is mounting , manifested in weak electoral turnout ( except for the last presidential election ) , protest votes for extremist parties , and the state &apos;s inability to reform itself . 
All of these negative trends were symbolized by Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos;s success in reaching the second round of the 2002 presidential election . 
Since the Fifth Republic was established , both French society and the world have undergone huge changes , with important consequences for the way the country is ruled . 
Globalization has reduced the state &apos;s freedom of action , and the European Union has gained in prominence . 
Does this mean that a Sixth Republic is inevitable ? 
As the president is already elected directly , some critics recommend a pure presidential regime , as in the United States . 
Others support moving toward a pure parliamentary regime in the manner of the United Kingdom . 
But a presidential regime runs the risk of a stalemate between the executive and the legislature , and a pure parliamentary regime , such as existed in the Third Republic , has a track of failure in France . 
Nor does France seem ready to endorse a first-past-the-post electoral system , which gives governments strong parliamentary majorities , as in the UK . 
Sarkozy seems to favor renovating the Fifth Republic . 
He likes the current system &apos;s strong presidential orientation , particularly since the presidential term was reduced from seven years to five , and is now closely timed to the legislative election cycle . 
But Sarkozy also favors closer institutional links between the presidency and the parliament . 
For example , he would like to address the National Assembly once a year , which he is currently barred from doing , given that only the prime minister is accountable to parliament . 
Similarly , he would like to impose a two-term limit on the president , and to require parliamentary approval of the president &apos;s appointment of certain senior officials . 
Changes to correct the imbalance between presidential and parliamentary power are , indeed , needed . 
The legislature should have a greater say in setting the nation &apos;s agenda . 
To strengthen this new institutional balance , Sarkozy is considering providing the opposition with a formal status , thus turning it into a real alternative power , and he wants to review the constitution &apos;s Article 16 , which gives excessive power to the president in times of crisis . 
He is also weighing whether to change the current Constitutional Court into a Supreme Court to which citizens could appeal under some conditions , and whether to waive the president &apos;s authority to preside over the High Council of the Judiciary . 
Nobody can forecast what will emerge from the expert council Sarkozy has appointed to consider these constitutional changes . 
The council &apos;s members represent both the majority and the opposition , and thus have very different views on these issues . 
But , given that most of the public supports the main principles of the Fifth Republic - such as direct election of the president and a strong executive - any rebalancing of France &apos;s political institutions is unlikely to substantially alter the 1958 constitutional structure . 
Besides , any constitutional change would need to be endorsed by 60 % of the ballots in both the National Assembly and the Senate , which makes the search for consensus all the more necessary .
