America &apos;s Exceptional Fiscal Conservatism 
WASHINGTON , DC - In most countries , to be &quot; fiscally conservative &quot; means to worry a great deal about the budget deficit and debt levels - and to push these issues to the top of the policy agenda . 
In many eurozone countries today , &quot; fiscal conservatives &quot; are a powerful group , insisting on the need to boost government revenue while bringing spending under control . 
In Great Britain , too , leading Conservatives have recently proved willing to raise taxes and attempted to limit future spending . 
The United States is very different in this respect . 
There , leading politicians who choose to call themselves &quot; fiscal conservatives &quot; - such as Paul Ryan , now the Republican Party &apos;s presumptive vice-presidential nominee to run alongside presidential candidate Mitt Romney in November &apos;s election - care more about cutting taxes , regardless of the effect on the federal deficit and total outstanding debt . 
Why do US fiscal conservatives care so little about government debt , relative to their counterparts in other countries ? 
It has not always been this way . 
For example , in 1960 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower &apos;s advisers suggested that he should cut taxes in order to pave the way for his vice president , Richard Nixon , to be elected to the presidency . 
Eisenhower declined , partly because he did not particularly like or trust Nixon , but mostly because he thought it was important to hand over a more nearly balanced budget to his successor . 
The framework for US macroeconomic policy changed dramatically when the international monetary system broke down in 1971 . 
The US could no longer maintain a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold - the cornerstone of the postwar Bretton Woods system . 
The arrangement collapsed because the US did not want to tighten monetary policy and run more restrictive fiscal policy : keeping US voters happy was understandably more important to President Nixon than maintaining a global system of fixed exchange rates . 
Ironically , however , rather than undermining the predominant international role of the US dollar , the end of Bretton Woods actually boosted its use around the world . 
Much has been written , and many hands wrung , about the dollar &apos;s decline over the last four decades , but the fact remains that holdings of US dollar assets by foreigners today are vastly greater than they were in 1971 . 
This turns out to be a mixed blessing , because it has allowed the US to become less careful about its fiscal accounts . 
Foreigners now hold roughly half of all US federal government debt , and they are willing to hold it when it yields a very low return in dollars ( and even when the dollar depreciates ) . 
In fact , whenever the world looks unstable , investors want to hold more dollar assets - even when the US is the cause of the instability . 
When big US banks are in trouble or Americans are having another debilitating political fight over their public finances , global investors scramble into US Treasuries . 
Poor &apos;s , but the federal government &apos;s borrowing costs are actually lower now than they were then . 
What has America done with this opportunity - arguably the lowest-cost funding in the history of humankind ? 
Not much , in terms of productive investment , strengthening education , or maintaining essential infrastructure . 
This is the lasting legacy of the &quot; temporary &quot; tax cuts adopted by George W. Bush &apos;s administration in the early 2000 &quot; s . 
And Americans have shifted greatly toward political philosophies - on the right and on the left - that regard public debt merely as a distraction . 
Ryan and members of the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party undoubtedly want to cut the size of the federal government , and they have articulated plans to do this over several decades . 
The calculation is that this will prove politically popular ( probably true ) while making it easier to implement spending cuts down the road ( less obvious ) . 
The vulnerability caused by higher public debt over the next few decades is simply ignored . 
For example , Ryan supported George W. Bush &apos;s spending spree . 
He also supports maintaining defense spending at or near its current level - resisting the cuts that were put in place under the Budget Control Act of 2011 . 
The assumption here - unstated and highly questionable - is that the US will be able to sell an unlimited amount of government debt at low interest rates for the foreseeable future . 
There is no other country in the world where fiscal conservatives would want to be associated with such a high-stakes gamble .
