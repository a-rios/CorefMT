The G-8 &quot; s Broken Aid Promises 
The Millennium Development Goals are the world &apos;s agreed goals to cut poverty , hunger , and disease . 
Established in 2000 , their targets were to be met by 2015 . 
We are now at the halfway point . 
So far , despite endless words about increasing aid to poor countries , the rich G-8 countries are reneging on their part of the bargain . 
Cynicism abounds here . 
At the G-8 Gleneagles Summit in 2005 , member countries pledged to double aid to Africa by 2010 . 
Soon after the summit , I was invited to a small , high-level meeting to discuss the summit &apos;s follow-up . 
I asked for a spreadsheet showing the year-by-year planned increases , and the allocation of those planned increases across donor and recipient countries . 
The response I received was chilling . 
&quot; There will be no spreadsheets . 
The US has insisted on no spreadsheets . &quot; 
The point was clear . 
Though the G-8 had made a clear promise , there was no plan on how to fulfill it ; indeed , there were clear instructions that there would be no such plan . 
The G-8 is now reaping the consequences of its inaction . 
For the first year after the Gleneagles meeting , aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations . 
With those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth : development aid to Africa and to poor countries more generally is stagnant , contrary to all the promises that were made . 
Specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to Africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , increased by a meager 2 % . 
In fact , total official development assistance to all recipient countries , net of debt cancellation , actually declined by 2 % between 2005 and 2006 . 
Even the World Bank , which usually takes the donors &quot; point of view , recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation , &quot; promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered . &quot; 
Private reactions among senior government officials in the G-8 are surprising . 
One senior G-8 official told me that the aid promises are all lies anyway . 
I don &apos;t agree with that , but the cynicism that such a view reflects is alarming . 
It shows the nature of discussions at the highest reaches of the G-8 . 
All this would seem to be insurmountable if the basic economics were not clear . 
We are not talking about unachievable financial goals . 
Indeed , the sum of money is minuscule . 
The G-8 , representing nearly one billion people , has promised to increase aid to Africa from $ 25 billion in 2004 to $ 50 billion in 2010 - a difference that represents less than one-tenth of one 1 % of the income of the rich donor world ! 
To put it in perspective , the Christmas bonuses paid this year on Wall Street - just the bonuses - amounted to $ 24 billion . 
Spending on the Iraq war , which achieves nothing but violence , is more than $ 100 billion per year . 
So the G-8 &quot; s commitment could be honored , if rich countries cared to honor it . 
To salvage its credibility , the G-8 needs to make crystal clear Â­ - once again - that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to Africa by $ 25 billion per year by 2010 . 
That way , cynics within the G-8 governments can understand their assignments . 
Moreover , unlike in 2005 , the G-8 needs to present a plan of action . 
The lack of specific commitments by specific countries is a shocking display of governance at its poorest . 
Finally , recipient countries need to be informed about the year-to-year increases in aid that they can expect , so that they can plan ahead . 
The increased aid should be directed at building roads , power grids , schools , and clinics , and at training teachers , doctors , and community health workers . 
All of that investment requires plans and years of implementation . 
Aid cannot be a guessing game . 
It must be committed in clear terms over a period of several years , so that recipients can use it in a sensible and accountable manner . 
Admittedly , part of the problem with the G-8 is not simply lack of good faith or political will , but basic competence . 
The US government doesn &apos;t really know what it is doing in Africa , because over the years America &apos;s aid agency has been largely emptied of its leading thinkers and strategists . 
Moreover , the Bush administration politicized the delivery of aid by channeling it through private religious groups that are part of the administration &apos;s political coalition . 
That &apos;s the reason that much of the US funding on AIDS follows religious strictures rather than science . 
Fortunately , what needs to be done is not complicated . 
African countries have already identified their high-priority investments in health , education , agriculture , and infrastructure ( including roads , power , and internet connectivity ) . 
These investments could be increased systematically during the period from now until 2015 , in order to enable these countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals . 
The plans are already on the table , or at least on the shelf , waiting for the G-8 funding to arrive . 
It &apos;s time for the rich countries to stop giving lectures to the poor , and instead to follow through on their own words . 
And G-8 citizens must hold their governments accountable for what they have pledged but not delivered .
