The Fall of the Hyper Power 
Listen carefully these days to Israelis and South Koreans . 
What they are hinting at is no less than a tectonic shift in the international system : the shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world . 
Israelis are rediscovering Europe . 
They intuitively sense that they can no longer rely only on the absolute security guarantee represented by the United States &quot; combination of active and passive support . 
The war in Lebanon , so frustrating for Israel , accelerated that subtle change . 
Now Europe and its various contingents are playing a leading role in picking up the pieces there . 
America , of course , remains Israel &apos;s life insurance policy , but enlargement and diversification of diplomatic alliances is starting to be seen as crucial by Israeli diplomats , if not by Israeli society . 
The Quartet ( the US , Russia , the European Union , and the United Nations ) used to be regarded as &quot; One plus Three , &quot; but that is no longer the case . 
Europe and Russia no longer see themselves as secondary players , because the US , not to mention Israel , needs them . 
As for the South Koreans , they are counting on China to deal with the North Korean nuclear crisis . 
They , too , see the world through a prism that makes America continue to appear essential , but no longer preeminent . 
Recently , a high South Korean official listed in hierarchical order the countries that mattered most in the North Korean nuclear crisis . 
China came first , followed by the US , Russia , Japan , and South Korea , whereas Europe was absent . 
These are only a few signs among many others . 
One could also mention the recent Sino-African summit in Beijing , or the intensification of Venezuelan-Iranian relations . 
All these developments subtly indicate a deep trend that can be formalized in one sentence : America &apos;s unipolar moment , which began in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Empire , is over . 
Of course , one should not &quot; bury &quot; the US too soon . 
It has a unique capacity to rebound , and it controls unparalleled military , intellectual , economic , and even political resources . 
The Republicans &quot; defeat in this month &apos;s mid-term Congressional elections is a sign that Americans want to sanction their leaders for their strategic and ethical shortcomings , and they did so with gusto . 
But this resilience should not hide a deeper evolution . 
America no longer qualifies , if it ever did , as a &quot; hyper power , &quot; to use former French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine &apos;s term , though it is still far from being a &quot; normal &quot; power . 
America &apos;s inadvertent &quot; passivity &quot; in the Clinton years and the wrong directions of the Bush years coincided with the rise of China and India , as well as Russia &apos;s renewed international clout as a result of high oil prices . 
These developments ushered in the slow , imperfect return of an unbalanced multi-polar system . 
The world in which we live may be moving toward the multi-polarity wished for by French President Jacques Chirac , but not necessarily in a successful and stable way . 
If , contrary to the traditional &quot; Gaullist &quot; vision , multi-polarity is not bringing stability , but instead generating chaos , there are two reasons for this outcome . 
First , key emerging actors - China , Russia , and India - are not ready , willing , or even capable of performing a stabilizing international role . 
They are either too cynical or timid in their vision of the world , or they have others priorities , or both . 
They probably contemplate with barely disguised pleasure the difficulties currently encountered by the US in Iraq and elsewhere , but they do not feel any sense of a &quot; compensating responsibility &quot; for global stability . 
The common good is not their cup of tea . 
They have too much to catch up with , in terms of national ego and national interest , to care for others . 
Second , the EU is the only natural American ally in terms of values . 
It is the EU that can make multi-polarity work if it plays its role positively . 
If the EU appears more concerned with the best ways to avoid the responsibilities that may befall it as a result of America &apos;s new and enforced modesty , then multi-polarity will result - by default , not by design - in a more chaotic world , rather than leading to greater stability . 
Europe has a unique chance to demonstrate that it can make a difference in America &apos;s post-unipolar moment . 
The world that Europe has called for is coming closer , and it can fail abysmally without the EU or improve at the margin thanks to it . 
In some ways , the end of a unipolar world could truly be the &quot; Hour of Europe . &quot; 
But that can happen only if the EU regains its confidence and steps into a positive role - one that it must play with , not against , the US .
