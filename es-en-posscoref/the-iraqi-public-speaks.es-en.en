The Iraqi Public Speaks 
Most of what we think about Iraq is shaped by the daily violence that plagues the country . 
Intelligence and military analysts debate how much of the violence is due to the presence of foreigners , though it is widely conceded that most of the attacks can be attributed to what American officials call &quot; former regime elements , &quot; with the Iraqi Sunni community the main pillar of the resistance . 
Having dominated Iraq under Saddam Hussein , and despite numbering less than a quarter of the overall population , Sunnis , it is said , are fighting to prevent their communal interests from being overwhelmed by the majority Shi &apos;ites and the Kurds , a distinct ethnic group concentrated in the north . 
Late last year , I was an organizer of a major national survey of Iraqi public opinion that demonstrated the complexity of the country &apos;s communal relations . 
To be sure , Iraqis of different ethnic or religious backgrounds are divided over many issues , but they also embrace a common national identity , as well as a desire for democracy . 
To begin , we asked Iraqis to reflect on the fall of Saddam : Was Iraq better off without him ? 
Among Sunnis , only 23 % thought so . 
Among Shi &apos;ites , however , 87 % saw a better Iraq without Saddam . 
Kurds exceeded this number , with 95 % claiming an improvement . 
At the same time , overwhelming majorities of Kurds , Sunnis , and Shi &apos;ites - more than eight out of ten - preferred to be seen as Iraqis first , believing that &quot; Iraq will be a better society if people treat one another as Iraqis . &quot; 
Strong majorities also endorsed the idea of a democratic system for Iraq . 
Important divergences re-emerge on social questions . 
Kurds have a much more egalitarian view of gender relations than either Sunnis or Shi &apos;ites . 
Asked if university education was more important for boys than girls , 78 % of Kurds disagreed . 
Among Shi &apos;ites , the number disagreeing was 50 % . 
Among Sunnis , the number fell below a majority : only 44 % believed in the equal importance of higher education for girls and boys . 
Similarly , 78 % of Kurds rejected polygamy , compared to just 49 % of both Shi &apos;ites and Sunnis . 
While these findings demonstrate the shadings of opinion across Iraq &apos;s dominant communities , they do not explain attitudes that may be behind the continuing violence that disfigures Iraqi life . 
The most radical differences in opinion can be found in communal perceptions of control of the future - the possibility of building a better life in post-Saddam Iraq - and security . 
We asked respondents to indicate how much control they had over their lives and how optimistic they were about the future , using a scale on which ten indicated a highly optimistic sense of control and one a deep level of powerlessness and pessimism . 
Kurds had the highest perception of control and optimism , with 19 % indicating the highest level of control over their lives and 17 % the greatest degree of hope in the future . 
The comparable figures for Shi &apos;ites were 10 and 14 % , respectively , but were just 4 % and 5 % , respectively , for Sunnis . 
The results for extreme pessimism were skewed in the opposite direction : 14 % of Sunnis thought things were as bad as could be , while only 2 % of Kurds and 3 % of Shi &apos;ites shared this opinion . 
The effects of localized violence were also made clear in the survey : 17 % of Kurds , 41 % of Shi &apos;ites , and 77 % of Sunnis felt that life in Iraq is unpredictable and dangerous , a clear demonstration of the effects of the ongoing resistance that is centered in the Sunni Triangle . 
This disparity in attitudes toward the future could determine what eventually happens in Iraq . 
Widespread political violence in both Iran and Latin America in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s demonstrated a connection between popular feelings of powerlessness and the growth of urban guerilla movements . 
Leaders of these groups often defended terrorism by insisting that violence was the only means of bringing hope to demoralized people . 
This argument , long discredited , resonates in the actions of the Iraqi insurgents and their fanatical allies . 
This is not to say that an insecure and demoralized community supports violence . 
If Iraqi Shi &apos;ite leader Muqtada al-Sadr and his followers chose to stop their own violence , it was not simply because of the superior firepower of the coalition forces . 
It was because Shi &apos;ite religious leadership felt empowered , optimistic , and secure enough to press the Sadrists to end their revolt . 
If the Sunni leadership were to feel that it has a stake in the outcome of political events now unfolding , it would also be able to stop the insurgency . 
That &apos;s why the political talks - open and clandestine - now reported to be underway are vital . 
They offer the possibility for the Sunni community to participate in the new system . 
The American-led coalition can help by taking more steps that would reinforce a message of hope and optimism for the exhausted and demoralized Sunnis of Iraq . 
Military action by itself may simply make matters worse .
