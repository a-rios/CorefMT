A Private Affair ? 
Can a public figure have a private life ? 
Recent events in three countries have highlighted the importance of this question . 
In the French presidential election , both candidates tried to keep their domestic life separate from their campaign . 
Ségolène Royal is not married to François Hollande , the father of her four children . 
When asked whether they were a couple , Royal replied , &quot; Our lives belong to us . &quot; 
Similarly , in response to rumors that President-elect Nicholas Sarkozy &apos;s wife had left him , a spokesman for Sarkozy said , &quot; That &apos;s a private matter . &quot; 
The French have a long tradition of respecting the privacy of their politicians &quot; personal lives , and French public opinion is more broad-minded than in the United States , where an unwed mother of four would have no chance of being nominated for the presidency by a major party . 
Indeed , last month , Randall Tobias , the top foreign aid adviser in the US State Department , resigned after acknowledging that he had used an escort service described as providing &quot; high-end erotic fantasy &quot; - although Tobias said he only had a massage . 
In Britain , Lord John Browne , the chief executive who transformed BP from a second-tier European oil company into a global giant , resigned after admitting he had lied in court about the circumstances in which he had met a gay companion ( apparently , he met him through a male escort agency ) . 
In resigning , he said that he had always regarded his sexuality as a personal matter , and he was disappointed that a newspaper - The Mail on Sunday - had made it public . 
Candidates for public office , and those holding high administrative or corporate positions , should be judged on their policies and performance , not on private acts that are irrelevant to how well they carry out , or will carry out , their public duties . 
Sometimes , of course , the two overlap . 
The Mail on Sunday and its sister paper , The Daily Mail , justified their publication of revelations by Browne &apos;s former companion on the grounds that they include allegations that Browne had allowed him to use corporate resources for the benefit of his own private business . 
The company denied that there was any substance to these allegations . 
As the administrator of the US Agency for International Development , Tobias implemented the Bush administration &apos;s policy that requires organizations working against HIV / AIDS to condemn prostitution if they are to be eligible for US assistance . 
That policy has been criticized for making it more difficult to assist sex workers who are at high risk of contracting and spreading HIV / AIDS . 
Arguably , the public has an interest in knowing if those who implement such policies are themselves paying for sexual services . 
Where there is no suggestion that a matter of personal morality has had an impact on the performance of a business executive or government official , we should respect that person &apos;s privacy . 
But what about candidates for political leadership ? 
Since politicians ask us to entrust them with sweeping powers , it can be argued that we should know as much as possible about their morality . 
For example , we might reasonably ask whether they pay their fair share of taxes , or inquire about their charitable donations . 
Such things tell us something about their concern for the public good . 
Similarly , the revelation three years ago that the then-Australian opposition leader and aspiring prime minister , Mark Latham , had assaulted a taxi driver and broken his arm in a dispute about a fare was relevant for those who believe that a nation &apos;s leader should be slow to anger . 
But does the legitimate interest in knowing more about a politician extend to details about personal relations ? 
It is hard to draw a line of principle around any area and determine if knowledge of it will provide relevant information about a politician &apos;s moral character . 
The problem is that the media have an interest in publishing information that increases their audience , and personal information , especially of a sexual nature , will often do just that . 
Even so , whether people choose to marry or not , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , even whether they pay to fulfill their erotic fantasies or have fantasies they can fulfill at no cost , tells us little about whether they are good people who can be trusted with high office - unless , of course , they say one thing while doing another . 
If we can cultivate a wider tolerance of human diversity , politicians , business leaders , and administrators would be less fearful of &quot; exposure , &quot; because they would realize that they have done nothing that they must hide . 
Prostitution is illegal in most of the US , including Washington DC , and this could be one reason why Tobias had to resign . 
But when New Jersey Governor John Corzine was involved in a serious road accident last month , it became known that he violated his own state &apos;s law by not wearing his seat belt . 
By any sensible measure , Corzine &apos;s violation of the law was more serious than that of Tobias . 
Laws requiring the wearing of seatbelts save many lives . 
Laws prohibiting prostitution do no evident good at all , and may well do harm . 
Yet no one suggested that Corzine should resign because of his foolish and illegal act . 
In the US , at least , breaching sexual norms still brings with it a moral opprobrium that is unrelated to any real harm it may do .
