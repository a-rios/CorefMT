Israel &apos;s Nuclear Option in Iran 
LOS ANGELES - Revelations in former President George W. Bush &apos;s recently published memoirs show that he declined an Israeli request to destroy Syria &apos;s secret nuclear reactor in the spring of 2007 . 
While the revelation may appear merely to be a historical footnote , more profoundly it raises new uncertainty about whether Israel now thinks that it can rely on the United States to apply military force to stop Iran &apos;s nuclear program should diplomacy fail . 
The Syrian episode suggests that it cannot , which means that Israel may decide to go it alone once again , this time to eliminate Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities . 
If Israel did so , however , it would confront a conundrum . 
Unlike the attack on Syria &apos;s nuclear plant , Israel &apos;s conventional forces do not have the capacity to destroy Iran &apos;s suspect installations . 
Portions of Iran &apos;s nuclear program may be too heavily bunkered , dispersed , or concealed . 
Israel &apos;s nuclear history provides no clear answer , but the future may force the issue . 
Israel has never acknowledged having nuclear weapons , let alone the size and scope of its arsenal . 
Israeli policymakers refuse to talk about the subject . 
Israel &apos;s parliament , the Knesset , never discusses the program or appropriates money for it . 
Military censors quash public discourse about it . 
Yet American and other intelligence services and strategic-research institutes around the world all agree that Israel possesses nuclear weapons . 
They disagree about how many , with estimates ranging broadly , from 40 to more than 400 warheads . 
Israel &apos;s reluctance to rattle its nuclear saber , even in dire circumstances , adds to the mystery . 
In the Yom Kippur War , as Syrian forces threatened to break the country &apos;s defensive lines , Israeli decision-makers recoiled even from threatening to use nuclear weapons . 
While Israel keeps its bomb in the basement , it has a long history of stopping its adversaries . 
As Iraq moved to complete the Osirak reactor by the early 1980 &quot; s , Israel applied diplomatic pressure and actions against foreign nuclear vendors , sabotaged atomic exports , and assassinated Iraqi scientists , before finally settling on the June 1981 air strike on the plant . 
In the Syrian case , with one caveat , Israel decided to dispense with the preliminaries and simply destroy the reactor . 
The caveat consists in a plea that Israel made to the US . 
According to Bush &apos;s memoir , in the spring of 2007 , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made a blunt request of the US president regarding Syria &apos;s reactor : &quot; George , I am asking you to bomb the facility . &quot; 
After consultation with his staff , Bush responded that , absent a plutonium extraction facility , US intelligence could not confirm that the plant comprised a nuclear weapons program . 
&quot; I told him &#91; Olmert &#93; I had decided on a diplomatic option backed by force &quot; to stop Syria , Bush writes . 
An apprehensive Olmert responded , &quot; I must be honest with you . 
Your strategy was very disturbing to me . &quot; 
Within months , Israel struck . 
One year later , it followed up by assassinating Mohammed Suleiman , the Syrian general in charge of resurrecting the nuclear enterprise . 
Given its efforts to fend off an attack , Iran represents a far more difficult target for Israel than Iraq and Syria did . 
As a result , Israel ceded to the US and others responsibility to move the Iranian regime from its current path . 
Since 2002 , the US has applied a multi-pronged approach . 
It pressed the International Atomic Energy Agency for greater scrutiny . 
It got the United Nations Security Council to agree to impose increasingly onerous economic sanctions - and roped allies into even stronger sanctions . 
It may have inserted computer worms into Iran &apos;s atomic infrastructure . 
The result of all these efforts has been to slow , but not halt , Iran &apos;s nuclear progress . 
And , even as the US and its allies attempt to restrain Iran , its regime continues to goad Israel , calling for its extinction and exporting military wares to its Lebanese and Gazan adversaries . 
In May 2010 , Israel responded with a new wrinkle . 
It leaked to the London Sunday Times that it had placed nuclear-armed submarines off Iran &apos;s coast . 
In the months before and after , it continued to hold war games and practice air strikes on Iran . 
Iran remains unmoved . 
Concerned that President Barack Obama will be less likely than Bush to use force to stop Iran , Israel must now contemplate its next steps should diplomacy continue to stall . 
One option would be to pursue a policy of &quot; opacity plus &quot; : a further lifting of the veil over its nuclear arsenal in order to caution Iran &apos;s rulers about the potential consequences of their actions . 
Another option would be to bring the country &apos;s nuclear arsenal out of the basement altogether . 
Israel could then mimic other nuclear-armed states by flexing its capacity through announcement and transparent nuclear deployment on land and sea , thereby promoting deterrence . 
But , for a country that has had little faith in deterrence when it comes to existential nuclear threats , relying on it now would mark a new , uncomfortable bet . 
That leaves nuclear use as the final option . 
But nuclear attack carries its own heavy burden . 
The only worse stain on Israel would be if survivors of an Iranian nuclear strike were to lament that , had their country acted proactively , &quot; the third destruction of the Temple &quot; - the end of the Jewish state - could have been avoided . 
These sobering prospects should prompt all involved to seek a peaceful resolution . 
Time is growing short .
