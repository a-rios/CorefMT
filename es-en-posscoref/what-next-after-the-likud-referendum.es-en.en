What Next After the Likud Referendum ? 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s proposal for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank has been overwhelmingly defeated by a referendum within his own party , Likud , in what seems to be a humiliating defeat . 
Yet this is likely to have little or no effect on Sharon &apos;s intention to carry through with the plan . 
At first , this seems surprising , since he said before the referendum that he would abide by its outcome . 
He is determined that his plan becomes his political legacy . 
Since there is no precedent for a party referendum , he can argue that the vote does not bind him . 
Moreover , Sharon made sure that his main political rivals - notably former Prime Minister Benjamin ( Bibi ) Netanyahu - supported his plan . 
They are now in no position to challenge him as the champions of the opposition within Likud . 
So while some members may walk out , Sharon can easily hold on to control of the party . 
In addition , many Sharon supporters , torn by what they saw as the plan &apos;s combination of costs and benefits , stayed home or even voted against it , but still want Sharon as their leader . 
But Sharon is prepared to go even further in taking political risks to push through the withdrawal . 
Small right-wing parties in his coalition have already announced that his determination to do so will make them walk out of the government . 
Sharon will then turn to the leader of the opposition , 80-year-old former prime minister Shimon Peres , to form a national unity government . 
And Peres is ready to do so . 
The passionate debate stirred up by Sharon &apos;s plan shows how truly revolutionary his proposal is . 
Having the army uproot Jewish settlements - with inevitable scenes of settlers resisting and being dragged off - will be a traumatic event for the country . 
The plan also entails considerable strategic risks , which , probably more than the prospect of uprooted settlements , account for the large &quot; no &quot; by Likud members . 
A key concern is the precedent of withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 . 
Today , most Israelis believe that this step , though justified on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the Lebanese group Hizbollah , convinced Palestinians that violence worked . 
In the same manner , a withdrawal from Gaza , many people worry , will bring increased anarchy there and a rise in overall terrorist attacks . 
But convinced - as are most Israelis - that there is no Palestinian partner ready to negotiate seriously and implement its promises , the prime minister wants to prepare for an extended interim period . 
Assuming that terrorist attacks against Israel are going to continue under any circumstances , he seeks to improve the country &apos;s strategic position to handle this war . 
Combined with the long-completed security fence around the Gaza Strip and one being built near Israel &apos;s border with the West Bank , pulling out of the most exposed positions is intended to reduce casualties and the number of clashes with the Palestinians . 
A secondary intention is to show the world that Israel is ready to withdraw from most of the remaining territories it captured in 1967 in exchange for real peace . 
The United States and Britain have supported the withdrawal plan , while most other European countries have been critical . 
While demanding an Israeli withdrawal for years , the Palestinian leadership opposes Sharon &apos;s plan , arguing it is intended to create permanent borders . 
Nevertheless , if implemented , Sharon &apos;s proposal would leave them in control of about 99 percent of the Gaza Strip and roughly 50 percent of the West Bank . 
If it appears that the withdrawal will proceed and Sharon can assemble a government to implement it , the Palestinian side will then face a major challenge . 
Will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip , or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids ? 
A key issue in this mix is the division of power between the nationalist Fatah group and the Islamist Hamas organization . 
Local Fatah officials want support from their leader , Yassir Arafat , to take firm control of the territory . 
Yet Arafat himself will be 75 in a few months and is clearly reaching the end of his career . 
He has been the only leader his movement has ever known , having led Fatah for 40 years and the Palestinians as a whole for 35 years . 
With no apparent successor , his departure from the scene will bring a massive and unpredictable shake-up in Palestinian politics . 
The Israeli government &apos;s projection has been that both the withdrawal and the security fence will be completed by the end of 2005 . 
Sharon &apos;s retirement is likely to come within another twelve months , with a new opposition leader having to be chosen as well . 
Thus , while the Likud referendum seems to have left the Israeli-Palestinian dispute at yet another impasse , both sides are on the verge of enormous changes .
