Xi &apos;s Recipe 
WASHINGTON , DC - China &apos;s government is cracking down hard on Western journalists , threatening not to renew visas for reporters from the New York Times and Bloomberg in retaliation for their reporting on the corruption of senior Chinese officials . 
Times columnist Thomas Friedman recently penned an open letter to the Chinese government telling them that , because the top &quot; cause of death of Chinese regimes in history is greed and corruption , &quot; a free press is more likely to help than hurt . 
Anyone who holds freedom of the press and freedom of expression to be universal human rights will agree with Friedman &apos;s position . 
Last month , President Xi Jinping announced a set of sweeping economic reforms at the Central Committee &apos;s Third Plenum , setting forth his vision of &quot; the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation . &quot; 
His 60-point plan included reforms of fiscal policy and the financial sector that would set market interest rates on loans and deposits , permit some private-investor participation in state-owned enterprises , increase the role of small and medium-size enterprises , loosen labor restrictions , and introduce property taxes to boost revenue for local authorities . 
This renewed embrace of the market , reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s original turn to capitalism in 1979 , will be hard medicine for China &apos;s entrenched business and government elites to swallow . 
If Xi &apos;s administration is successful - a big if - its reforms may enable China to negotiate the necessary transition from an economy driven by exports and government investment to a more sustainable growth model based on domestic consumption . 
The stakes are high . 
A country that has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last two decades must now find a way to safeguard and gradually increase those gains while engineering the same miracle for the hundreds of millions still left behind . 
The world has a significant economic , political , and moral interest in the success of China &apos;s reform agenda . 
In this context , it is important to understand that Xi &apos;s economic reforms are only one ingredient of a carefully crafted cocktail . 
The rest of the recipe includes two parts popular social reforms - an end to the one-child policy for many Chinese parents and the abolition of &quot; reeducation through labor &quot; - and one part political crackdown . 
Increased censorship and intimidation of foreign journalists , together with the imprisonment of dissidents and tighter restrictions on dissent , are an effort to ensure that economic disruption does not give rise to political rebellion . 
To implement his ambitious reform agenda , Xi has taken several steps to consolidate his personal and bureaucratic power . 
He has reduced the membership of the Politburo from nine to seven , making it easier to obtain agreement in a system designed to institutionalize collective leadership . 
He has increased the power of the Central Committee , which he chairs . 
To understand how the State Security Council could serve Xi &apos;s interest in centralizing power , consider the United States . 
Without the National Security Council and the Domestic Policy Council , the US president would have no routine way to control and coordinate different bureaucracies . 
White House staff working for the National Security Council call meetings at which officials from the State Department , Defense Department , Treasury , Justice Department , and other key agencies hash out their views on a given policy . 
Xi &apos;s moves to strengthen his hand have helped to convince observers that he means business with the reform agenda . 
Since the Third Plenum ended and the scope of Xi &apos;s reforms has become clear , many China watchers have hailed him as the most transformative leader since Deng . 
Time will tell , but a key difference between 2014 and 1979 is that today the Chinese cocktail is spiked with fear . 
Evan Osnos , writing in The New Yorker , reports that two years ago , in the midst of the Arab uprisings , a senior official told a meeting in Beijing that if the Chinese government &quot; waver &#91; ed &#93; &quot; in the midst of social-media-fueled global dissidence , &quot; the state could sink into the abyss . &quot; 
Recently , Osnos writes , a high-level Chinese diplomat explained the threatened expulsion of New York Times and Bloomberg journalists on the grounds that &quot; the Times and Bloomberg were seeking nothing short of removing the Communist Party from power , and that they must not be allowed to continue . &quot; 
That fear is one of the principal forces driving Xi &apos;s reform agenda . 
The Communist Party must keep the Chinese economy growing ( even if more slowly ) , while fighting rampant corruption and responding to citizens &quot; demands . 
Chinese citizens cannot vote , but they can - and do - make their displeasure known , which places a premium on what Chinese bureaucrats call &quot; stability maintenance . &quot; 
Will Dobson , author of The Dictator &apos;s Learning Curve , describes the Chinese government as a technocracy whose legitimacy is founded on efficient problem-solving . 
&quot; When a regime &apos;s legitimacy is derived from its performance , &quot; he argues , &quot; any crisis - and how the party responds to it - can raise existential questions about the regime &apos;s right to rule . &quot; 
China &apos;s leaders apparently worry that Western-style investigative journalism inside China could trigger just such a crisis . 
In any case , they are taking no chances . 
They are placing their faith in their ability to wash their own dirty laundry and drive economic , social , and political change from the top down .
