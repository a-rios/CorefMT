Europe &apos;s Barbarians Inside the Gate 
BERLIN - I am on a two-week European tour at a time that could make one either very pessimistic or constructively optimistic about Europe &apos;s prospects . 
First the bad news : Paris is somber , if not depressed , after the appalling terrorist attacks earlier this month . 
France &apos;s economic growth remains anemic , the unemployed and many Muslims are disaffected , and Marine Le Pen &apos;s far-right National Front is likely to do well in the upcoming regional elections . 
In Brussels , which was semi-deserted and in lockdown , owing to the risk of terrorist attacks , the European Union institutions have yet to devise a unified strategy to manage the influx of migrants and refugees , much less address the instability and violence in the EU &apos;s immediate neighborhood . 
Outside the eurozone , in London , there is concern about negative financial and economic spillover effects from the monetary union . 
And the migration crisis and recent terrorist attacks mean that a referendum on continued EU membership - likely to be held next year - could lead the United Kingdom to withdraw . 
This would probably be followed by the breakup of the UK itself , as &quot; Brexit &quot; would lead the Scots to declare independence . 
In Berlin , meanwhile , German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s leadership is coming under growing pressure . 
Her decision to keep Greece in the eurozone , her courageous but unpopular choice to allow in a million refugees , the Volkswagen scandal , and flagging economic growth ( owing to the slowdown of China and emerging markets ) have exposed her to criticism even from her own party . 
Frankfurt is a divided city , policy-wise : the Bundesbank opposes quantitative easing and negative policy rates , while the European Central Bank is ready to do more . 
But Germany &apos;s thrifty savers - households , banks , and insurance companies - are furious about ECB policies that tax them ( and others in the eurozone core ) to subsidize the eurozone periphery &apos;s alleged reckless spenders and debtors . 
In this environment , the full economic , banking , fiscal , and political union that a stable monetary union eventually requires is not viable : The eurozone core opposes more risk sharing , solidarity , and faster integration . 
And populist parties of the right and left - anti-EU , anti-euro , anti-migrant , anti-trade , and anti-market - are becoming stronger throughout Europe . 
But of all the problems Europe faces , it is the migration crisis that could become existential . 
In the Middle East , North Africa , and the region stretching from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa , there are about 20 million displaced people ; civil wars , widespread violence , and failed states are becoming the norm . 
If Europe has trouble absorbing a million refugees , how will it eventually handle 20 million ? 
Unless Europe can defend its external borders , the Schengen agreement will collapse and internal borders will return , ending freedom of movement - a key principle of European integration - within most of the EU . 
But the solution proposed by some - close the gates to refugees - would merely worsen the problem , by destabilizing countries like Turkey , Lebanon , and Jordan , which have already absorbed millions . 
And paying off Turkey and others to keep the refugees would be both costly and unsustainable . 
And the problems of the greater Middle East ( including Afghanistan and Pakistan ) and Africa cannot be resolved by military and diplomatic means alone . 
The economic factors driving these ( and other ) conflicts will worsen : global climate change is accelerating desertification and depleting water resources , with disastrous effects on agriculture and other economic activity that then trigger violence across ethnic , religious , social , and other cleavages . 
Nothing short of a massive , Marshall Plan-style outlay of financial resources , especially to rebuild the Middle East , will ensure long-term stability . 
Will Europe be able and willing to pay its share of it ? 
If economic solutions aren &apos;t found , eventually these regions &quot; conflicts will destabilize Europe , as millions more desperate , hopeless people eventually become radicalized and blame the West for their misery . 
Even with an unlikely wall around Europe , many would find a way in - and some would terrorize Europe for decades to come . 
That &apos;s why some commentators , inflaming the tensions , speak of barbarians at the gates and compare Europe &apos;s situation to the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire . 
But Europe is not doomed to collapse . 
The crises that it now confronts could lead to greater solidarity , more risk sharing , and further institutional integration . 
Germany could absorb more refugees ( though not at the rate of a million per year ) . 
France and Germany could provide and pay for military intervention against the Islamic State . 
All of Europe and the rest of the world - the US , the rich Gulf States - could provide massive amounts of money for refugee support and eventually funds to rebuild failed states and provide economic opportunity to hundreds of millions of Muslims and Africans . 
This would be expensive fiscally for Europe and the world - and current fiscal targets would have to be bent appropriately in the eurozone and globally . 
But the alternative is global chaos , if not , as Pope Francis has warned , the beginning of World War III . 
And there is light at the end of the tunnel for the eurozone . 
A cyclical recovery is underway , supported by monetary easing for years to come and increasingly flexible fiscal rules . 
More risk sharing will start in the banking sector ( with EU-wide deposit insurance up next ) , and eventually more ambitious proposals for a fiscal union will be adopted . 
Structural reforms - however slowly - will continue and gradually increase potential and actual growth . 
The pattern in Europe has been that crises lead - however slowly - to more integration and risk sharing . 
Today , with risks to the survival of both the eurozone ( starting with Greece ) and the EU itself ( starting with Brexit ) , it will take enlightened European leaders to sustain the trend toward deeper unification . 
In a world of existing and rising great powers ( the US , China , and India ) and weaker revisionist powers ( such as Russia and Iran ) , a divided Europe is a geopolitical dwarf . 
Fortunately , enlightened leaders in Berlin - and there are more than a few of them , despite perceptions to the contrary - know that Germany &apos;s future depends on a strong and more integrated Europe . 
They , together with wiser European leaders elsewhere , understand that this will require the appropriate forms of solidarity , including a unified foreign policy that can address the problems in Europe &apos;s neighborhood . 
But solidarity begins at home . 
And that means beating back the populists and nationalist barbarians within by supporting aggregate demand and pro-growth reforms that ensure a more resilient recovery of jobs and incomes .
