Privatizing Africa &apos;s Development 
Lagos - There has been considerable progress on achieving the Millennium Development Goals since their inception in 2000 . 
Many of us in Africa &apos;s private sector are keen to make a difference in meeting these goals . 
At the Africa Finance Corporation ( AFC ) , reducing poverty on the African continent through private-sector initiative is our mission . 
Africa &apos;s development challenges are well known . 
More than 40 % of its population lives on less than a dollar a day . 
Over half a billion people live without modern forms of energy , and the continent &apos;s share of global trade remains a paltry 3 % . 
Lack of basic infrastructure and industrial capacity remains one of Africa &apos;s biggest problems , for it sustains poverty and undermines the continent &apos;s ability to compete with the rest of the world . 
Transport costs for sub-regional trade are double that of other developing regions , and high energy costs contribute significantly to the prohibitive cost of doing business . 
Africa needs substantial investments to correct these shortfalls : $ 75 billion to close its 135-gigawatt power deficit by 2015 , and $ 37 billion to improve transport infrastructure . 
As a result , most of the value chain for the fossil fuel and mining sectors continues to be outside the continent . 
But these challenges have not dampened optimism about Africa &apos;s growth prospects . 
The continent &apos;s economy , after all , has been experiencing its strongest growth in three decades , with annual GDP up by 6 % in the past three years . 
The rebirth of Africa &apos;s private sector - a critical missing ingredient in past development efforts - has played a significant role in driving this performance , and it can fill the investment gap while generating returns in the process . 
The AFC is promoting such investment , based on a new development-oriented banking style in Africa that involves the proactive creation and management of infrastructure , industrial , and financial assets , including the six leading industrial sectors : power , transport infrastructure , telecoms , oil and gas , mining , and heavy industries . 
These areas offer the greatest development impact and the most attractive returns to investors . 
An AFC-led consortium is financing a project that will develop Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s first deep-sea container port on the Atlantic coastline area of Olokola , Nigeria . 
The completion of this $ 1 billion landmark project is expected to transform Africa &apos;s shipping and port capacity dramatically . 
Guinea-Bissau is also taking advantage of this new private sector-led development approach . 
As a member country of the AFC , it will benefit from a private sector-driven initiative to accelerate economic development and reduce poverty . 
The AFC , with its project development subsidiary , Africa Infrastructure , and Chinese equity and technical partners , WEMPCO , is launching a power generation initiative in Bissau . 
The investment will lead to a rapid deployment of emergency power using heavy fuel power generation , and will involve the rehabilitation and management of transmission and distribution . 
There is a huge window of opportunity for private sector-led development in Africa .
