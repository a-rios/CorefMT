Argentina &apos;s Two-for-One Presidency 
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner &apos;s victory in Argentina &apos;s presidential election ushers in a political experiment that goes beyond national boundaries : that of &quot; ruling couples . &quot; It &apos;s not that the Kirchners have much global influence . 
But they precede by a year the power duo that the Clintons may form in the United States , which gives them an aura of importance that extends far beyond Latin America . 
Néstor Kirchner , Cristina &apos;s husband and Argentina &apos;s current president , did not want to run for office again , despite being legally permitted to do so and voters &quot; preference for him over her . 
According to Kirchner &apos;s inner circle , he wanted to avoid becoming a &quot; lame duck &quot; and losing power at the end of a second term in office . 
Here lies a possible inspiration for the early handover to his wife . 
In Argentina , unlike in the US , re-election is unlimited , as long as the president does not exceed two consecutive periods in office . 
So , in four years , Cristina , may feel the same way , and pass the baton back to Néstor , who in turn will retire in four years to avoid becoming a &quot; lame duck , &quot; and so on . 
&quot; Buy two for the price of one , &quot; Bill Clinton joked about ruling couples when he first ran for president in 1992 . 
Néstor Kirchner doesn &apos;t joke . 
Instead , he busies himself with organizing a political movement that will structure his project . 
No one believes that such an edifice can be detached from the government , or that he will abstain from taking part in his wife &apos;s decisions as president . 
So Argentineans have , indeed , bought &quot; two for the price of one . &quot; 
They have voted for continuity - the core of Cristina &apos;s campaign - because their situation is much improved since 2001 , when the country was in the midst of economic and political crisis . 
Maybe the most important point - and a key difference with the Clintons - is that this experiment begins in an Argentina that suffers from great institutional vulnerability . 
Néstor and Cristina will be dealing with a parliament that is much weakened : laws passed by legislators close to the government allow the president to &quot; correct &quot; the budget and issue &quot; necessary and urgent &quot; decrees that substitute for laws . 
The Kirchners will practice a form of hyper-presidentialism . 
Since 2001 , the Kirchners have ruled with a siege mentality . 
They have built up an image of authority and moral inflexibility , and have helped themselves by picking enemies who are damned by all and lacking any kind of power to move against them ( the weakened military , for example , or civilian members of the 1976-1983 dictatorship ) . 
This has been accompanied by cascades of populist rhetoric : loud voices and defiant words , and promises to fight to the death against ill-defined but malignant economic special interests . 
Meanwhile , the types of structural changes that Argentina needs have not been made . 
Corruption remains . 
The economic boom brought on by soaring global demand for commodities - Argentina is a leading exporter of soy beans , corn , wheat , honey , and limes , for example - resulted from a shift in Argentine farming that pre-dates the Kirchners : the old landholders have given way to operators with managerial skills . 
What the Kirchners have done well is to use the wealth gained from exports to strengthen the economy and improve conditions for the middle and lower classes . 
It is a significant achievement . 
But Argentina remains overly dependent on commodities , and has failed to encourage economic activity based on its peoples &quot; culture and ingenuity . 
Moreover , manipulation of official statistics highlights the problems of an economic model based on peso depreciation and the accumulation of reserves . 
Some officials claim that Cristina will bring in a new era of higher institutional quality . 
But the problem with &quot; ruling couples &quot; - in Argentina and , perhaps , throughout the world - is that no law or democratic constitution could envisage them . 
This is why the Kirchners will rely on secrecy . 
Néstor will not publicly express any attitude that hints at shared government , but nobody believes that he will be far from the scene . 
Institutional quality and lack of transparency are not compatible . 
Usually , decision-making is confined to ever smaller circles , with ever greater secrecy . 
And , as with humans who mix only with their close relatives , the political gene pool weakens . 
Yet this seems to be the distinctive operating style of Kirchnerism , torn between an elite born and raised in Patagonia , a few close allies , and everybody else . 
Their relationship with the press is similar . 
They talk only to state-controlled media and never hold press conferences . 
Hyper-presidentialism , inbred politics , and a plan to keep power indefinitely through a legal technicality : all this could put the Kirchners on the same level with the &quot; caudillos for life &quot; that Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has brought back to the Latin American scene . 
If Cristina wants to improve institutional quality and the problems that the economy is already showing , she will need more than strength . 
Above all , she will need fresh sources of ideas .
