History &apos;s Crimes and Punishments 
BUENOS AIRES : What price justice ? 
How countries deal with historical violations of human rights is the material of daily politics across Latin America , Eastern Europe , and Africa . 
Look at Rwanda . 
Look at Chile , where General Pinochet may at last face trial . 
Look at Poland where President Kwasniewski and former President Walesa were almost banned from October &apos;s presidential election because of alleged ties to the communist era &apos;s secret police . 
People everywhere are perplexed by the fact that horrific , systematic violations of human rights are treated differently in different countries . 
Although differences undoubtedly exist , the ethical principles by which historical human rights violations should be treated in reconstructing democracy are the same . 
Chile and Poland are not unique in confronting the burden of history . 
Building democracy out of political cultures and civic habits riddled by state violence is no easy task . 
The difficulties are multiplied when attempted in times of economic crisis . 
I come from a country where violations of human rights were punished harshly . 
Nonetheless , I understand the impulse to limit punishment in order that society heal and rebuild . 
For punishment of systematic , historical human rights crimes as a matter of government policy is only morally justified if it is designed to protect society from greater evils in the future . 
Human rights crimes , though fostered by states , are committed by individuals acting according to their own wills . 
There are real social consequences in seeking punishment for such people . 
It is not rational to impose such punishment when the consequences , far from preventing future crimes , may incite or cause greater or new social damage . 
Punishment is ultimately an instrument - not the only one , nor the most important - for restoring a collective moral conscience to societies ravaged by dictatorship . 
More important than punishment , I believe , is the revelation of truth by credible means , such as through an impartial judicial process . 
Through such revelations what I call a &quot; moral sentence &quot; may be imposed on the guilty , and it is the existence of such a &quot; sentence &quot; which will arouse the type of deep public reflection necessary for the restoration of democracy . 
No more secure guarantee for the protection of human rights exists than a heightened , collective moral awareness within society to defend every person &apos;s dignity . 
National laws and international studies are valuable instruments to protect such rights insofar as they serve to promote such awareness , but they cannot replace it as the ultimate guarantee . 
In democratic systems , this moral awareness can only be cultivated if the citizenry trusts the independence of its judges . 
In the transition from dictatorship to democracy , members of the judiciary lack legitimacy . 
So reestablishing social trust in the judiciary is one of the weightiest tasks democratically elected officials face during a transition . 
In the appointment of independent judges , great care must be given to insure that the judiciary helps revitalize social trust in the capacity for transformation to democracy . 
Based on my own experience as Argentina &apos;s first democratically elected president after the collapse of its military junta , I know that this is a long , complex , and painful process . 
But if a social consensus arises that the judiciary is insufficient to guarantee or safeguard individual rights as well as the division of power between the legislative , executive , and judicial branches of government , that lack of trust could lead to social dismemberment . 
Comprehending the process by which a society begins to fail to protect itself , by which it &apos;s moral compass deteriorates , is almost impossible . 
Perhaps ethical absolutism and its opponent relativism influenced that deterioration by undermining the sense of collective truth that is forged in social dialogue and wide civic participation . 
But a society &apos;s decision to waive punishment for human rights violators is not necessarily a sign that its moral awareness remains stunted . 
Retribution is not the only sign of restored moral vigor . 
A moral sense is essential to a democracy of true solidarity . 
To secure the moral sense that only social solidarity may provide , a clear set of social rights must also exist . 
A decent home and health care , education and an adequate income to develop and enrich personal lives , is sometimes considered as a particular goal for a group - class , union , corporation - without effect on other groups . 
But the contrary is true . 
Developing the economic and social aspects of the rights of man helps root all human rights as undeniable truth . 
In short , democracy can only be built by men and women who are democratic in all their aspects . 
Monarchy can exist with people who are anti-monarchists . 
Fascism and Soviet communism were constructed on the backs off unwilling people . 
Democracies built on unwilling foundations , however , cannot stand . 
For democrats , loving freedom is not enough . 
The great failure of our democratic conscience is in not recognizing this . 
The habit of limiting universal human rights to a series of political and moral rights and consigning the economic aspects of humanity to a second , lower tier of our concern is dangerous . 
It undermines the ethics of solidarity through which all human rights exist . 
Democracy today must urgently address this insufficiency of solidarity . 
If human rights are truly to be protected , the second , economic tier of human rights must be elevated to equality with the first tier in our consciences . 
Only then will history &apos;s crimes receive the response they demand , which first and foremost is not punishment , but the certainty that such crimes will not reoccur . 
Never again : for history &apos;s victims , that is our truest debt of honor .
