India &apos;s Martian Chronicles 
NEW DELHI - The news that the Mars orbiter spacecraft Mangalyaan , launched by India on November 5 , has left the Earth &apos;s orbit , traversed the moon , and is on course for its ultimate destination , 400 million kilometers ( 249 million miles ) away , brought early holiday cheer to Indians . 
Space missions have become a matter of pride for India , which is already one of the top countries in terms of rocket and satellite technology . 
Mangalyaan , India &apos;s first inter-planetary satellite , was purpose-built for the Mars mission - and it was made entirely indigenously . 
Indian-educated scientists designed and fabricated it in barely 15 months - astonishingly fast for a country of chronic delays , where &quot; Indian Standard Time &quot; is a common joke . 
They also did so at a remarkably low cost , with the total bill coming in at under $ 73 million , or about a fifth of what the few other countries that have sought to explore Mars have spent . 
Indeed , while Indians often lament their country &apos;s dysfunction , inadequate infrastructure , antiquated industrial processes , and uneven manufacturing record , it rose to the challenge and delivered . 
But it is too early to celebrate . 
Five years ago , India &apos;s lunar mission , called Chandrayaan , was the occasion for another national celebration . 
Though it was intended to explore the moon for two years , the spacecraft was declared lost after 312 days . 
While scientists at the Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ) believe that they gained valuable lessons from the experience , the partial failure of the Chandrayaan mission still haunts them . 
Moreover , the challenge is even greater when it comes to Mars . 
It is a sobering fact that of a total of 51 Mars missions sent out by five countries , 30 ended badly . 
Among India &apos;s Asian rivals , neither Japan , which launched a Mars orbiter in 2003 , nor China , which followed suit in 2011 , was able to complete its mission successfully . 
India hopes to join the three space programs that have succeeded - those of the Soviet Union , the United States , and the European Union . 
Mangalyaan &apos;s objective is to reach Mars &apos;s orbit by September 2014 and to look for the presence of methane gas , a sign of possible life . Success would mark a scientific advance for humanity ; failure , Indian scientists aver , would still provide a learning experience . 
The ISRO &apos;s chief scientist , K. Radhakrishnan , is not interested in comparisons with other countries : &quot; We are in competition with ourselves , &quot; he declared , &quot; in the areas we have charted for ourselves . &quot; 
India is increasingly regarded around the world as the leading developing country in the field , with the human-resource capacity and technological skills needed to work on the cutting edge of outer-space challenges . 
India &apos;s adventures in space exploration are not merely about its scientists &quot; ambitions . 
At United Nations forums , India has consistently been a voice for international cooperation in outer space . 
It speaks of being able to offer other countries , particularly from the developing world , an opportunity to participate in space exploration . 
Its moon mission in 2008 , which carried a payload for some 20 countries , won the International Lunar Exploration Working Group &apos;s International Cooperation Award . 
Yet , unavoidably , some triumphalism has crept into the narrative . 
One of India &apos;s more astute young commentators , Sreeram Chaulia , captures this heady exuberance well : &quot; Every milestone in advanced rocket science , &quot; he writes , &quot; is a shot in the arm for national self-confidence , showing that India is headed for global leadership . 
When the chips are down , or if there is a national calamity , memories of the Mars orbiter blazing a trail in the sky will sustain the faith that the future belongs to India . &quot; 
This is precisely the attitude that raises the hackles of domestic critics , especially on the left , who argue that a country facing India &apos;s crippling social and economic problems cannot afford the luxury of indulging in space exploration . 
Critics have portrayed the Mars mission as an irresponsible ego trip by pampered scientists disconnected from the harsh realities of Indian poverty and suffering . 
This may not be entirely fair , however . 
India embarked on its quest for rocket and satellite technology and space exploration when it was far poorer , impelled by its own ancient scientific tradition and the conviction of its first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , that such aspirations could co-exist with a determined effort to end poverty . 
Indeed , India &apos;s space scientists have produced tangible benefits for ordinary citizens , launching meteorological satellites that have predicted cyclones and helped save thousands of lives , as well as telecommunications satellites that have knit a vast country together through shared networks . 
Mitigating natural disasters and enabling nationwide broadcasting can hardly be considered to be disconnected from India &apos;s real priorities . 
With a general election looming in the months ahead , the air is already thick with political recrimination . 
The Mars mission - if it succeeds - is one thing that can literally rise above it all .
