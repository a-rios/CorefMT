Whose Central Bank ? 
BERKELEY - Broadly speaking , for at least 115 years ( and possibly longer ) - that is , at least since the publication of the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell &apos;s Geldzins und GÃ¼terpreis ( Interest and Prices ) in 1898 - economists have split into two camps with respect to what a central bank is and the purposes it should serve . 
One camp , call it the Banking Camp , regards a central bank as a bank for bankers . 
Its clients are the banks ; it is a place where banks can go to borrow money when they really need to ; and its functions are to support the banking sector so that banks can make their proper profits as they go about their proper business . 
Above all , the central bank must ensure that the money supply is large enough that mere illiquidity , rather than insolvency , does not force banks into bankruptcy and liquidation . 
The other camp , call it the Macroeconomic Camp , views central banks as stewards of the economy as a whole . 
A central bank &apos;s job is to uphold in practice Say &apos;s Law - the principle that output is balanced by demand , with neither too little demand to purchase what is produced ( which would cause unemployment ) nor too much ( which would cause inflation ) - because Say &apos;s Law certainly does not hold in theory . 
In other words , a central bank &apos;s primary responsibility is not to preserve the health of the firms that make up the banking sector , but rather to maintain the robust functioning of the economy as a whole . 
In the United States , from September 15 , 2008 - the day that the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy - until then-US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner announced in May 2009 that in his judgment the major US banks either had or could quickly raise adequate capital cushions , the two camps &quot; interests and conclusions were identical . 
For both , reducing the imbalance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand required , first and foremost , preserving the banking system ; and preserving the banking system required boosting aggregate demand to bring it closer to aggregate supply . 
There was a lot of bank rescue in economic stimulus ; and there was a lot of economic stimulus in rescuing banks . 
Thereafter , the two camps &quot; interests and conclusions diverged sharply . 
A prolonged and sustained central-bank policy of keeping short-term Treasury nominal interest rates low is essential to keeping the many interest rate-sensitive components of aggregate demand from falling even further below potential aggregate supply . 
But , for investment banks , shadow banks , and especially commercial banks ( with their expensive networks of branches and ATMs ) , such a policy makes it very difficult to report regular and healthy operating profits on their quarterly income statements and regular and healthy gains in their clients &quot; portfolios . 
A prolonged and sustained central bank policy of purchasing ever-increasing quantities of long-term assets is essential to encourage a wary financial sector to use some of its risk-bearing capacity for its proper purpose : reducing the risk burden on entrepreneurship and enterprise . 
But such a policy diminishes , and may even eliminate , financiers &quot; ability to take the easy route by riding the duration yield curve for profits . 
From the standpoint of balancing aggregate demand and potential aggregate supply , the central bank should start by simply issuing a straightforward statement that , five years after the crisis began , a 0-2 % target for annual inflation clearly runs unwarranted downside employment risks , and a 2-4 % target is called for . 
But , while such an announcement is an obvious no-brainer for those in the Macroeconomic Camp , it would make all bankers who hold nominal assets or who think in nominal terms physically ill . 
In terms of the US public interest - and that of the world - it is very important that whoever President Barack Obama nominates to succeed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term expires at the beginning of 2014 is from the Macroeconomic Camp . 
The world does not need a bankers &quot; central banker any more today than it did five years ago .
