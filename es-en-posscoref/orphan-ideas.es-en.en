Orphan Ideas 
CHICAGO - Since the United States Supreme Court &apos;s &quot; Citizens United &quot; decision , which prohibited the government from restricting independent political expenditures by corporations and unions , concern about business interests &quot; influence over US elections has been growing . 
But political contributions are only one reason why business interests have so much power . 
When it comes to lobbying , money is not everything : ideas play a big role , too . 
Unfortunately , rather than leveling the playing field , the battle of ideas may skew US politics even further in favor of big business . 
The importance of ideas can be seen from the simplest things . 
Congressional bills aimed at benefiting powerful constituencies are generally given appealing ( and misleading ) names . 
For example , a tax holiday to repatriate foreign earnings was called the &quot; American Job Creation Act . &quot; 
It is easier to sell a bill that ( allegedly ) benefits everyone in society , not just a small group of its most privileged members . 
More importantly , the lobbying of the quasi-governmental mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not have been so successful without the idea of the &quot; ownership society . &quot; 
How could anyone oppose turning every American into an owner ? 
It is precisely the appeal of such ideas that can make them so dangerous politically . 
If ideas are like weapons in lobbying , it is important to appreciate the possible distortions in the market for their creation and diffusion . 
New ideas are like new drugs . 
While some pharmacologists dedicate their lives to searching for the cure for cancer , regardless of any monetary incentives , many are driven by the hope of securing a lucrative patent . 
Even if researchers themselves are motivated by only the noblest of goals , their need for funding forces them to take into account profitability . 
That is why we have so-called &quot; orphan drugs , &quot; from which not enough money can be made because they cure rare diseases or diseases ( like malaria ) that affect people who cannot afford to pay for them . 
The process of creating new economic ideas ( or new evidence about old ideas ) is not that different . 
Researchers do not get patents , but they get citations , recognition , and promotions . 
While some researchers dedicate their lives to the search for truth , regardless of any personal gain , many are driven by the hope of academic stardom and the money that comes with it . 
Even if researchers themselves are motivated by only the noblest of goals , their need for funding forces them to take into account the demand for ideas . 
And , if funding is not a major issue , the mechanism of amplification of an idea ( and thus its ultimate diffusion ) nonetheless depends upon how appealing it is to some lobbying effort . 
Consider a great researcher in my field , Michael Jensen . 
In 1990 , he co-wrote a paper about executive pay , arguing that it was not sufficiently linked to performance . 
Although the authors used an untenable benchmark to determine that the sensitivity of pay to performance was too low , the article was published in a top economic journal , prominently discussed in the Harvard Business Review , and is one of the most cited papers in economics . 
Fifteen years later , Jensen wrote a paper about the costs of excessive sensitivity of pay to performance . 
The paper was published in a minor journal and is not very well cited . 
Why ? 
Business loved the first paper , because it shifted the conversation from how much executives were paid ( a very controversial topic ) to how they should be paid ( a more technical and less contentious issue ) . 
And , since companies cannot make executives pay out of their pockets for bad performance , the shift in focus ended up justifying an increase in pay . 
There was no similar love for the second paper , which languishes almost unknown , despite its important insights . 
Jensen , a researcher of the highest integrity and fame , is free to write on both sides of this issue . 
But the two papers &quot; asymmetric citation payoff is a warning for young scholars : if they want to get ahead professionally , the position that they should take is clear . 
From venture capital to telecommunications , from the construction industry to teachers &quot; unions , there is plenty of demand for evidence that celebrates the benefits of these industries and justifies ( implicitly or explicitly ) government subsidies to them . 
There is no equally organized and active demand for evidence that all of these subsidies are distortionary , waste money , and make companies less rather than more competitive . 
Here is perhaps the biggest orphan idea : pro-market does not necessarily mean pro-business . 
A pro-business agenda aims at maximizing the profits of existing firms ; a pro-market agenda , by contrast , seeks to encourage the best business conditions for everyone . 
Who benefits from evidence that an industry is too concentrated , its profit margins are too high , and consumers are being ripped off ? 
As with malaria drugs , millions of people would benefit from such an idea , but their ability to pay is limited . 
And , sure enough , in most of what we economists write - and , more important , in what we teach in business schools - it is hard to tell the difference between being pro-market and being pro-business . 
The battle against crony capitalism starts in the classroom , and we professors are inevitably implicated . 
If we are not part of the solution , we are part of the problem .
