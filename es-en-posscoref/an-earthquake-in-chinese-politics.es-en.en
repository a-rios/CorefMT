An Earthquake in Chinese Politics ? 
BEIJING - Now that the aftershocks from the great Sichuan earthquake appear to have dissipated , it is time to ask what shocks , if any , the earthquake delivered to China &apos;s political system . 
Has the quake given birth to some new , positive political force that will accelerate reform ? 
It has happened before . 
After all , dramatic political changes - the fall of the &quot; Gang of Four &quot; and Deng Xiaoping &apos;s consolidation as China &apos;s supreme leader - did follow shortly after the devastating Tangshan earthquake in 1976 . 
Given the sharp contrast between Premier Wen Jiabao &apos;s caring attitude during the earthquake and President Hu Jintao &apos;s mediocre political performance , some people could not help but imagine that the earthquake may have tipped the balance at the Communist Party &apos;s highest levels , pushing the liberal forces represented by Wen to the center of power . 
But this is naive . 
Unlike 30 years ago , no strong force for political reform now exists in China &apos;s vast bureaucratic system . 
Back then , Mao &apos;s Cultural Revolution had forced large numbers of his revolutionary comrades onto a reformist path . 
In today &apos;s China , the overwhelming majority of bureaucrats like the status quo and have enough resources to protect themselves . 
Although Wen has won popular support through his tireless efforts for earthquake victims , he remains isolated in official circles . 
And , although Hu can barely hide his mediocrity , the bureaucrats are unconcerned . 
After all , they don &apos;t want someone controlling them who is both able and serious . 
But the Sichuan earthquake was not completely irrelevant to China &apos;s political progress . 
Wen , who had been bogged down by the bureaucracy , had been seeking to counter it by expanding the media &apos;s openness and transparency . 
He had sought to take advantage of the Beijing Olympics to give the foreign media unprecedented freedom , but the bureaucrats succeeded in reversing his decision . 
The earthquake gave Wen an unexpected second opportunity . 
He used television and his outstanding performance to prove that modern media and information tools can curb China &apos;s bureaucracy . 
This precedent will not be easy to roll back , and will have a far-reaching positive influence on China &apos;s political progress . 
The earthquake , together with the media transparency that accompanied it , has made the bureaucrats more accountable . 
Thousands of people , including nearly 10,000 school children , whose parents will not be easily placated , lost their lives . 
Millions of dispossessed people must be re-housed in a process that will last for several years . 
Bureaucrats must not be allowed to spend the huge donations collected and state relief funds allotted in an arbitrary manner . 
As a result , a new political culture conducive to accountability may have a realistic opportunity to grow . 
But this does not mean that someone will emerge from the Party with the courage and ability to assume bold political leadership . 
In fact , I believe that China &apos;s future leaders , are more likely to come from China &apos;s burgeoning , but still limited , civil society than from the bureaucracy . 
One source of China &apos;s future political leadership could well be its growing NGO sector . 
Although the Party uses various means to suppress their development , the Sichuan earthquake demonstrated that it has failed to eliminate NGOs as a social force . 
The quake gave them an opportunity to be seen , and an unprecedented number of people had a chance to perceive this nascent civil society as a positive force that serves their own interests . 
There is an even greater silent force which may produce a new generation of political leaders : the rapidly growing army of Christian believers , now estimated at 20 million . 
With a population of 1.3 billion , China has no lack of people with leadership potential , and I believe that more and more of this talent is situated outside the Party bureaucracy in NGOs , startup enterprises , philanthropy , and even missionary work . 
In today &apos;s mostly closed environment , they mostly lack awareness of their political skills and vision . 
A more open and transparent public environment will help awaken their sense of political mission . 
Yet we are left to ask : when will the time for major political change come ? 
Wen Jiabao wrote recently in Sichuan that &quot; more hardship will arouse the country , &quot; evidently believing that the Chinese may still need to suffer further in order to realize political progress . 
That may be true , but I also believe that a new generation of political leaders can grow up in a more open information environment . 
And , in any coming showdown , we must hope that all leaders will refuse to use innocent people &apos;s lives as bargaining chips .
