Central Asia &apos;s Perfect Storm 
FLORENCE - Dean Acheson , US President Harry Truman &apos;s Secretary of State , liked to quote a friend who said that being in government made him scared , but that being out of it made him worried . 
To those of us not privy to the hidden complexities of NATO &apos;s military intervention in Afghanistan , the situation there - and across Central Asia  -  is extremely worrisome . 
As Afghan President Hamid Karzai is said by his critics to be on the verge of casting his lot with Pakistan and the Taliban , the Pentagon has signaled its fear that the war may spread beyond the Pashtun heartland to the largely Tajik and Uzbek areas in the north of the country . 
The US is reportedly constructing a $ 100 million &quot; Special Operations Complex &quot; near Mazar-i-Sharif across the border from Uzbekistan . 
It also planned to build a similar &quot; counter-terrorism training compound &quot; nearby in Osh , Kyrgyzstan , the site last June of the worst outbreak of fighting between ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Central Asia &apos;s Ferghana valley since the break-up of the Soviet Union . 
Several hundred people were killed , entire neighborhoods were destroyed , and an estimated 400,000 people were made into refugees . 
There is little agreement about who lit the fuse . 
Possible culprits include various Russians , the family of deposed Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev , and criminal gangs in Kyrgyzstan and neighboring countries . 
A favorite candidate for blame is the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) , a group that has been allied with the Taliban in the past and has been active across Central Asia , including in Afghanistan . 
The IMU is also reportedly having success in recruitment drives in northern Afghanistan . 
But no matter where they go or what they do , the IMU &apos;s number-one target is Uzbekistan &apos;s ruler , Islam Karimov . 
Karimov , for his part , acted with unusual statesmanship during the recent violence in Kyrgyzstan . 
Unlike his neighbors , he opened the border to desperate refugees , mostly women , children , and the elderly . 
This is par for the course in the Ferghana valley . 
As in much of Central Asia , including Afghanistan , national boundaries , enclaves , and exclaves separate various groups that , historically , intermingled within a single region . 
Political boundaries have a powerful effect on the region &apos;s economy and culture . 
Differences , real or manufactured , are easy to magnify and exploit . 
The precariousness of the situation throughout the Ferghana valley has attracted the attention of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which has much experience in defusing difficult border conflicts in the Balkans and elsewhere . 
But the OSCE was almost completely powerless during the Kyrgyzstan crisis , and only recently was it finally able to secure agreement to send a small police advisory group there . 
Of course , the OSCE had very few resources in the region to begin with , but some members , notably Russia , have been unwilling to give the OSCE a larger role . 
Uzbekistan , which ought to welcome all the help it can get and probably doesn &apos;t object to greater OSCE involvement in principle , is nonetheless dragging its feet , supposedly because of jealousy over all the attention Kazakhstan is gaining from its chairmanship . 
( Karimov and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev are perennial rivals . ) 
The keenest proponent of a revitalized OSCE now is the US State Department . 
Not only does it want to use the opportunity to test the &quot; reset &quot; policy with Russia , but it also sees the OSCE as an important component of a longer-term strategy to bring stability and good governance to Eurasia , as the OSCE was in Central Europe . 
For this reason , US diplomats are lobbying hard for the OSCE , and Kazakhstan in particular , to be given a fair chance . 
This is a worthy aim , but it is not clear that the main actors in Central Asia - including China , which reportedly is quietly but firmly backing Karimov - are playing on the same team . 
Uzbekistan , especially , has presented an extremely cautious , even ambivalent , face in public . 
Even if serious dialogue with Uzbekistan is taking place behind closed doors - and the Pentagon &apos;s new initiatives suggest that it is - its low , almost undetectable , profile sends mixed signals that fly in the face of the open , transparent , and collective ethos of America &apos;s big OSCE push . 
Another explosion in the Ferghana valley could be hard to contain if the pieces of declared and actual policy are not brought together , and if the most important regional leaders aren &apos;t brought on board . 
Among its first victims would be the noble aspirations of the OSCE , and NATO &apos;s investment in Afghanistan . 
That is something big to worry about , regardless of whether one is in government .
