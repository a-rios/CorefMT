The Next Bretton Woods 
NEW YORK - The world is sinking into a major global slowdown , likely to be the worst in a quarter-century , perhaps since the Great Depression . 
This crisis was &quot; made in America , &quot; in more than one sense . 
America exported its toxic mortgages around the world , in the form of asset-backed securities . 
America exported its deregulatory free market philosophy , which even its high priest , Alan Greenspan , now admits was a mistake . 
America exported its culture of corporate irresponsibility - non-transparent stock options , which encourage the bad accounting that has played a role in this debacle , just as it did in the Enron and Worldcom scandals a few years ago . 
And , finally , America has exported its economic downturn . 
The Bush administration has finally come around to doing what every economist urged it to do : put more equity into the banks . 
But , as always , the devil is in the details , and United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson may have succeeded in subverting even this good idea ; he seems to have figured out how to recapitalize the banks in such a way that it may not result in resumption of lending , which would bode poorly for the economy . 
Most importantly , the terms that Paulson got for the capital provided to America &apos;s banks were far worse than those obtained by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown ( not to mention those that Warren Buffett got for putting far less into America &apos;s soundest investment bank , Goldman Sachs ) . 
Share prices show that investors believe that they got a really good deal . 
One reason to be concerned about the bad deal that American taxpayers are getting is the looming national debt . 
Even before this financial crisis , America &apos;s national debt was scheduled to increase from $ 5.7 trillion in 2001 to more than $ 9 trillion this year . 
This year &apos;s deficit will approach a half-trillion dollars ; next year &apos;s will be even larger , as the US downturn steepens . 
America needs a big stimulus package . 
But Wall Street &apos;s fiscal conservatives ( yes , the same people who brought us this downturn ) will now be calling for deficit moderation ( reminiscent of Andrew Mellon in the Great Depression . ) 
Now the crisis has spread , predictably , to emerging markets and less developed countries . 
Remarkable as it may seem , America , for all its problems , is still seen as the safest place to put one &apos;s money . 
No surprise , I suppose , because , despite everything , a US government guarantee has more credibility than a guarantee from a third-world country . 
As America sops up the world &apos;s savings to address its problems , as risk premiums soar , as global income , trade , and commodity prices fall , developing countries will face hard times . 
Some - those with large trade deficits before the crisis hit , those with large national debts that must be rolled over , and those with close trade links to the US - are likely to suffer more than others . 
Those countries that did not fully liberalize their capital and financial markets , such as China , will be thankful that they did not follow the urging of Paulson and the US Treasury to do so . 
Many are already turning to the International Monetary Fund for help . 
The worry is that , at least in some cases , the IMF will go back to its old failed recipes : fiscal and monetary contraction , which would only increase global inequities . 
While developed countries engage in stabilizing countercyclical policies , developing countries would be forced into destabilizing policies , driving away capital when they need it most . 
Ten years ago , at the time of Asia &apos;s financial crisis , there was much discussion of the need to reform the global financial architecture . 
Little - too little , it is now evident - was done . 
At the time , many thought that such lofty appeals were a deliberate attempt to forestall real reform : those who had done well under the old system knew that the crisis would pass , and with it , so too would the demand for reform . 
We cannot let that happen again . 
We may be at a new &quot; Bretton Woods &quot; moment . 
The old institutions have recognized the need for reform , but they have been moving at glacial speed . 
They did nothing to prevent the current crisis ; and there is concern about their effectiveness in responding to it now that it has hit . 
It took the world 15 years and a world war to come together to address the weaknesses in the global financial system that contributed to the Great Depression . 
It is to be hoped that it will not take us that long this time : given the level of global interdependence , the costs would simply be too high . 
But , whereas the US and Great Britain dominated the old Bretton Woods , today &apos;s global landscape is markedly different . 
Likewise , the old Bretton Woods institutions came to be defined by a set of economic doctrines that has now been shown to fail not only in developing countries , but even in capitalism &apos;s heartland . 
The forthcoming global summit must face these new realities if it is to work effectively toward creating a more stable and a more equitable global financial system .
