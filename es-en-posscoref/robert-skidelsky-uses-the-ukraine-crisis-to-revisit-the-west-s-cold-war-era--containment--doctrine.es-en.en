Kennan &apos;s Revenge 
LONDON - Earlier this month , Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that gas giant Gazprom would start demanding payment a month in advance for the supplies that it sells to Ukraine . 
The British newspaper The Observer published , in response , a striking cartoon showing Putin sitting on a throne of outward-pointing daggers , turning off the Ukraine gas tap while saying , &quot; Winter is coming . &quot; 
The background was bright red , and a hammer and sickle and a skull were planted on Putin &apos;s breast . 
For some , at least , the Cold War is back . 
But , before we drift into Cold War II , we would do well to recall why we had the first one . 
The end of Communism removed one important reason : the Soviet Union &apos;s expansionist thrust and the Western democracies &quot; determination to resist it . 
But other reasons remain . 
American diplomat George F. Kennan identified them as neurotic insecurity and Oriental secretiveness on the Russian side , and legalism and moralism on the Western side . 
The middle ground of cool calculation of interests , possibilities , and risks remains elusive to this day . 
Kennan is reckoned to have laid the Cold War &apos;s intellectual foundation - at least in the West - with his &quot; long telegram &quot; from Moscow in February 1946 , which he followed with his famous Foreign Affairs article , signed &quot; X , &quot; in July 1947 . 
Kennan argued that long-term peace between the capitalist West and communist Russia was impossible , owing to the mixture of traditional Russian insecurity , Stalin &apos;s need for an external enemy , and communist messianism . 
Russia , Kennan argued , would seek to bring about the collapse of capitalism not by an armed attack , but by a mixture of bullying and subversion . 
The correct response , said Kennan , should be &quot; containment &quot; of Soviet aggression through the &quot; adroit and vigilant application of counterforce . &quot; 
During President Harry Truman &apos;s administration , United States officials interpreted Kennan &apos;s view as requiring a military build-up against a potential Communist invasion of Western Europe . 
This gave rise to the Truman Doctrine , from which sprang the logic of military confrontation , NATO , and the arms race . 
These developments dismayed Kennan , who claimed that containment was meant to be economic and political , not military . 
After Stalin &apos;s death , Kennan looked forward to fruitful negotiations with a &quot; mellowing &quot; Soviet system under Nikita Khrushchev . 
He came to regret the uses to which the ambiguous language of the &quot; long telegram &quot; and his &quot; X &quot; article had been put , lamenting that democracies could pursue a foreign policy only on the &quot; primitive level of slogans and jingoistic ideological inspiration . &quot; 
In retrospect , one might ask whether it was NATO or US economic and political support that prevented Western Europe from embracing communism . 
At any rate , both sides convinced themselves that the other represented an existential threat , and they both built up colossal arsenals to guarantee their security . 
Until the Soviet Union collapsed , each brief period of &quot; d√©tente &quot; was followed by a new arms build-up . 
There was something insane about the whole business , and one is left with the disquieting thought that NATO prolonged the Soviet Union &apos;s life by handing it a ready-made enemy to replace Nazi Germany . 
To understand how Russians regard Ukraine today , one needs to view events there through this lens . 
Following its &quot; victory &quot; in the Cold War , the West made a serious mistake by refusing to concede any form of regional hegemony to Russia , even in countries like Ukraine and Georgia that had once formed part of the historic Russian state . 
Rather , under the banner of democracy and human rights , the West actively sought to pry the ex-Soviet countries from Russia &apos;s orbit . 
Many of them were eager to escape the Kremlin &apos;s gravity , and NATO expanded eastward into the former Soviet bloc in Central Europe , and even into the former Soviet Union , with the admission of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania . 
In 1996 , the 92-year-old Kennan warned that NATO &apos;s expansion into former Soviet territory was a &quot; strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions . &quot; 
These Western thrusts undoubtedly inspired Russian paranoia , reflected today in Kremlin-fueled conspiracy theories about Ukraine . 
And , just as Kennan warned against a foreign policy that was &quot; utopian in its expectation , legalistic in its concept &amp; hellip ; moralistic &amp; hellip ; and self-righteous , &quot; the goal of Western policy today should be to find the means to work with Russia to stop Ukraine from being torn apart . 
This means talking and listening to the Russians . 
The Russians have presented their ideas for resolving the crisis . 
Broadly , they propose a &quot; neutral &quot; Ukraine on the model of Finland and a federal state on the model of Switzerland . 
The first would exclude NATO membership , but not admission to the European Union . 
The second would aim to secure semi-autonomous regions . 
Such proposals may be cynical ; they may also be unworkable . 
But the West should be urgently testing , exploring , and seeking to refine them instead of recoiling in moralistic horror at Russia &apos;s actions . 
Suspended between paranoia and moralism , sensible diplomacy has a hard job . 
But it should not need the upcoming hundredth anniversary of the second bloodiest war in history to remind our statesmen that low-level events may spin irretrievably out of control .
