Argentina &apos;s Energy Dilemma 
BUENOS AIRES - The expropriation of nearly all of the Spanish company Repsol &apos;s stake in Argentina &apos;s energy producer YPF , announced in a vehement speech by President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner , has raised legal alarms worldwide . 
Repsol acquired complete control of YPF in 1999 ; in February 2008 , it transferred part of its shares to the Petersen Group , which today holds 25 % . 
Repsol currently holds 57 % , with the rest owned by stock-market investors . 
The Argentine government intends to expropriate 51 % , leaving Repsol with a 6 % stake . 
In the 2008 sale of shares , the two majority stockholders agreed to distribute at least 90 % of future profits in cash . 
That decision was intended to allow the Petersen Group to service the debts to banks , and to Repsol itself , that it incurred with its share purchase , for which it made no initial payment . 
This is an extraordinarily high dividend in the world oil industry . 
In the past decade , YPF &apos;s reserves diminished significantly , along with those of most oil companies operating in Argentina , because investment in exploration was greatly reduced . 
At the same time , natural gas accounts for 51 % of energy consumption , compared to 32 % for oil and barely 17 % for coal , renewables , and hydroelectric and nuclear power . 
Worldwide , gas accounts for barely a quarter of total energy consumption - for example , 27 % in the United States and just 9 % in neighboring Brazil . 
Argentina has the world &apos;s largest fleet of vehicles running on compressed natural gas ; families use gas intensively ; most electricity is generated with gas ; and the petrochemical industry is based on it . 
Of course , in a few other countries ( Qatar , Algeria , the United Arab Emirates , Iran , and Russia ) , gas also accounts for more than half - or even more than 60 % - of energy consumption . 
Argentina , by contrast , is a highly gas-dependent country with diminishing reserves - equivalent to less than eight years of production . 
Covering this drop in reserves - more than half of gas reserves and a fifth of oil reserves have been consumed - with imports implies an annual cost of more than $ 300 billion . 
Indeed , after two decades of cheap , abundant energy and exports of surplus output , a new cycle of expensive , scarce , and imported energy has begun , as oil production has fallen by one-third since 1998 , and gas production by 15 % since 2004 . 
Argentina &apos;s greatest challenge today is to try to regain energy self-sufficiency through significant investment in exploration on land , as well as in the Atlantic Ocean . 
At the same time , the country must modify its consumption model through greater reliance on hydroelectric , nuclear , and wind energy . 
While there is great potential for new non-conventional resources , all of this is expensive , requiring annual investment of about 3 % of GDP over the next five years . 
It is very likely that , in the short term , growing imports of expensive liquid natural gas and other fuels will continue to exert pressure for change . 
Last year , the external energy deficit was more than $ 3 billion , and this year it is expected to double . 
The important question is whether the Argentine government &apos;s decision to nationalize 51 % of YPF &apos;s shares is the best way to recover self-sufficiency in oil and gas production , and to attract the capital needed for exploration and development of conventional reserves . 
Argentina has particularly high potential for production of non-conventional gas resources as well , given that it holds the world &apos;s third-highest level of such reserves , after China and the United States .
