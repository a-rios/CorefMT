The Fountain of Youth Revealed 
Since the dawn of human consciousness , we have contemplated our own mortality and dreamed of ways of overcoming it . 
Until recently , achieving control over our own longevity was the stuff of fairy tales , disconnected from actual scientific progress . 
But new research suggests that the molecular basis of aging may soon be understood in detail . 
Applying this knowledge could be close behind . 
Recent scientific breakthroughs have come from research not on humans , or even on rats and mice , but on simple laboratory organisms like yeast and roundworms . 
These primitive life forms have yielded important , generally valid clues that have forced a comprehensive re-evaluation of the nature of the aging process . 
Traditional evolutionary thought views aging as a process that occurs by default in the post-reproductive phase of life . 
After all , Darwinian natural selection cannot prevent the wholesale decline of an individual whose genes have already been passed on to the next generation . 
According to this view , many cellular and organic processes thus degrade concurrently , and aging has many causes . 
As a result , the post-reproductive shortcomings of a great many genes would have to be remedied to slow the aging process . 
Recent research on yeast and roundworms suggests otherwise . 
It turns out that mutations even in single genes can lead to a substantial lengthening of life span and an accompanying slowdown in the aging process . 
But how can this be possible if aging has many concurrent causes , as evolutionary theory maintains ? 
The answer can be found by examining the molecules that make up the genes in which mutations extend life span . 
For example , a universal gene called SIR2 determines the life span of both yeast cells and roundworms . 
In both organisms , if an extra copy of SIR2 is added by genetic intervention , the life span is extended . 
Conversely , if the SIR2 gene is deleted , the life span is shortened . 
In both yeast and worms , SIR2 appears to sense the availability of food and stall the aging process in times of deprivation by stimulating the formation of specialized body types - spores in yeast and dauers in worms - that can survive for extraordinarily long periods without nutrition . 
When conditions improve , the dormant life forms revive and reproduce . 
The survival function that SIR2 exists to serve - forestalling aging and reproduction during famine - is adaptive and therefore pervasive in nature . 
So the classical evolutionary theory of aging must be modified . 
In times of plenty , the aging process plays out as evolutionary biologists say , with reproduction followed by the failure of many genes and a wholesale decline of individual organisms . 
But in times of scarcity , the survival program kicks in to slow the aging process . 
Even more intriguingly , a single gene can promote this survival mechanism across a wide swath of nature &apos;s creatures . 
Does SIR2 also promote survival in mammals ? 
Interestingly , in cultured mouse or human cells , the mammalian SIR2 gene determines a cell &apos;s response to DNA damage . 
When faced with damaging agents , cells have the ability to commit suicide . 
The mammalian SIR2 gene modulates this process , and higher levels of it dampen the cell death response . 
Just like in yeast and worms , mammalian SIR2 promotes survival , in this case of cultured cells . 
Does this mean that mammalian aging is at least partly caused by the gradual loss of cells and the accompanying failure of organs ? 
Possibly , but we must bear in mind that the cell death response is a way to cull genetically damaged cells before they progress into tumors . 
So increasing SIR2 activity in mammals may actually cause cancer by keeping bad cells alive too long . 
Yet this seems unlikely for two reasons . 
First , as an evolutionary matter , it makes little sense that a gene anointed by nature to promote survival would also cause cancer . 
Second , recent experiments in genetically altered mice show that the cell death response may be slowed without causing cancer . 
This suggests that there is a window of slowing cell death that does not cause cancer and may promote longevity . 
Obviously , the practical implications of these findings could prove extraordinary . 
If single genes can determine the life span of mammals , it should be possible to develop drugs that bind to these genes &apos; proteins and alter their activities . 
Thus , drugs that slow the aging process could be around the corner . 
But will such drugs prolong youth and vitality , or simply extend our stay in nursing homes ? 
To answer this question , consider the effects of calorie restriction , which has been found to increase life span in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals . 
In yeast , where the process has been studied in molecular detail , the longevity triggered by calorie restriction is mediated by SIR2 . 
In mammals , we have not yet discovered the molecular basis of the longevity . 
But we do know that restricted animals are vigorous and healthy for the duration of their longer lives .
