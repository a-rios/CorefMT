The Draghi Put on Trial 
CAMBRIDGE - In the summer of 2012 , European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro , including purchasing &quot; unlimited &quot; amounts of struggling governments &quot; bonds . 
The move , which has come to be known as the &quot; Draghi put , &quot; almost immediately reduced borrowing costs for Spain and Italy , and is widely touted as having pulled the eurozone back from the brink of disaster - without ever using the so-called &quot; outright monetary transactions . &quot; 
That may sound like a resounding success : the mere announcement of the OMT scheme was enough to end the monetary union &apos;s existential crisis . 
But , according to the German Constitutional Court , the policy violates European Union treaties - a ruling that the European Court of Justice is now reviewing . 
The ECJ &apos;s decision will have important implications for the eurozone &apos;s future , for it will define what authority , if any , the ECB has to intervene in a debt crisis . 
And yet , in a fundamental way , the current debate about OMT misses the point . 
Rather than asking whether the ECB &apos;s mandate allows it to intervene in a debt crisis , EU leaders should be asking whether it should . 
The Bundesbank &apos;s position on this question is well known ; a leaked submission to the Constitutional Court last year declared unequivocally that , &quot; It is not the duty of the ECB to rescue states in crisis . &quot; 
But there is a strong case for allowing the ECB to act as lender of last resort . 
One key argument for forcing central banks to adhere to strict inflation targets is that it eliminates the temptation to use &quot; monetary financing &quot; ( purchases of government bonds ) unexpectedly , either to stimulate the economy or to inflate away its debt . 
After all , such action rarely works : markets anticipate it and raise interest rates to compensate lenders for expected inflation . 
The result is typically both high inflation and high borrowing costs . 
What is worse , the argument goes , the expectation of monetary financing would drive governments to borrow excessively . 
This could trigger a vicious circle of mounting debt and uncontrollable inflation , with devastating consequences . 
These are convincing arguments . 
But they fail to account for one critical factor : historical context . 
If a debt crisis results from government profligacy and mismanagement , rather than from a market failure , it is true that the central bank should not intervene . 
If , however , the crisis results from a coordination failure among investors - when each investor refuses to roll over the government &apos;s debt for fear that others will do the same , leading to a default - monetary policy can play an important role . 
Indeed , by putting a floor on the price of sovereign debt and any accompanying inflation , central-bank intervention would reduce the real value of the debt and facilitate repayment . 
Moreover , as the OMT announcement demonstrated , a credible promise to use monetary financing in the event of such a crisis can prevent it from arising in the first place - with no inflationary action required . 
Without central-bank involvement , investors &quot; panicky prophecy would be self-fulfilling , with the resulting spike in borrowing costs making it impossible for the government to repay its creditors . 
In other words , prohibiting the central bank from acting as lender of last resort can push solvent economies into a needless debt crisis , undermining output and employment . 
By most accounts , this is precisely what happened to Spain and Italy in 2012 . 
In this context , the Draghi put was a highly defensible action . 
Refusing to consider any amount of monetary financing , and continuing to adhere to a strict inflation target , would have been much more difficult to justify . 
To be sure , central-bank intervention is not the only way to quell self-fulfilling crises in the eurozone . 
Fiscal transfers , whereby eurozone countries commit to provide funds to their distressed counterparts , could also work . 
But this approach is far less practicable , and thus less credible . 
Opponents of central-bank intervention are right about one thing : monetary financing carries serious risks . 
In order to ensure that it is as safe and effective as possible , it must be used primarily in the event of self-fulfilling debt crises . 
In terms of institutional design , it is thus optimal for the central bank to maintain a strong commitment to keeping inflation low in normal times and to be willing to intervene in a crisis . 
The ECB &apos;s use of OMT satisfies both criteria .
