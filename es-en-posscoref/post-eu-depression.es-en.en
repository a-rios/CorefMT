Post-EU Depression 
The government of Poland collapsed first , followed by the Czech government . 
Then the Hungarian prime minister resigned . 
The government of Slovakia lost its majority and is unstable . 
Within months , if not weeks , of realizing the long-sought goal of European Union membership , a wave of political instability surged through Central Europe . 
Why should this historic event cause such political upheaval ? 
Some argue that these countries are inherently unstable . 
Their political cultures are underdeveloped . 
They were admitted to the EU only fifteen years after the fall of communism , and not all of them had previous experience with democracy . 
Unlike EU members admitted during earlier rounds of enlargement , the Central Europeans suffer from widespread corruption , political nepotism , fragile political parties with unclear identities , and weak civil societies . 
All of these problems were to some extent hidden due to the external pressure of EU accession , and have now erupted into full view . 
But there are more obvious causes for Central Europe &apos;s current problems . 
Above all , every government that successfully led its country into the EU had to adopt-often under pressure and hastily-a range of unpopular steps . 
Although most citizens in these countries supported EU membership , many thought that their governments paid too high a price . 
This was partly because the EU was not as generous toward its newest members as it had been toward new members in the past . 
Moreover , only fifteen years ago , eight of the ten new members had state-controlled economies , which meant that a period of painful transition toward a market economy was followed by , or overlapped with , sometimes painful reforms necessary for EU membership . 
Even before attaining EU membership , all candidate countries &apos; governments had to start adopting measures aimed at meeting the Maastricht criteria within several years , because the new members had committed themselves in their accession treaties to adopting the euro . 
The most important measures required cutting budget deficits , often at the cost of lowering public expenditures . 
In the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Poland , the task of completing such difficult reforms just before crossing the &quot; finish line &quot; fell to socialist parties , forcing them to betray their socialist identity in the eyes of leftist voters . 
As a result , their historic mission doomed them . 
In Poland , the Democratic Left Alliance fell apart shortly before accession , while the Czech Social Democrats came close to a similar split . 
Ruling coalitions were at the same time in disadvantageous positions vis-Ã -vis opposition parties , which attacked the incumbents for failing to negotiate good membership terms , without themselves having to pass the test of negotiating better conditions . 
Government parties were also hurt by the nationalistic rhetoric of center-right parties , which repeatedly warned against a betrayal of national interests . 
The overlap between the end of the accession process and heated discussions about the new European Constitution played into the hands of the opposition . 
The political right in Hungary , Poland , and the Czech Republic warned against a possible loss of sovereignty should the Constitution be adopted . 
Such rhetoric resonates powerfully in former Soviet satellites that have only recently regained their sovereignty . 
Despite all this pressure , the ruling coalitions in the Poland , the Czech Republic , and Hungary held together , as the historical mission of attaining EU membership worked like a lid on a pressure cooker . 
Addressing conflicts among government coalition parties , as well as within individual government parties , was postponed until after official EU entry . 
Not surprisingly , accession untied politicians &apos; hands , and conflicts came to the fore . 
Polish Prime Minister Lezsek Miller resigned one day after his country &apos;s official admission to the EU . 
Czech Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla was forced to resign by his own party several weeks later . 
Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy was pushed out in late August . 
Even the center-right Slovak government was not spared . 
It took it upon itself not only to meet EU membership criteria , but also push forward with other painful reforms . 
The comfortable role of criticizing the government fell into the hands of leftist populists , for a change . 
The Slovak government is still in power , but it has lost its majority and could fall soon . 
In Poland , Hungary , and the Czech Republic , we will now witness a period of unabashed populism . 
The ruling coalitions were reconstructed , with new faces at the helm . 
The main objective of the new prime ministers and cabinet members is to regain popularity for their parties . 
The ruling coalitions can finally afford , at least temporarily , &quot; the luxury &quot; of populism that opposition parties used as their main weapon in the last few years . 
Those who hope for further progress on economic reforms in Central Europe will have to wait .
