The Trumping of American Politics WASHINGTON , DC - As Republicans and Democrats go through the long process of selecting a nominee for next year &apos;s presidential election , both parties face the same question . 
Will the anti-establishment - even anti-political - mood now dominating the contest last ? 
For once , Labor Day ( the first Monday in September ) was not the presidential race &apos;s demarcation point : the overall themes had already been set . 
Revulsion at government and traditional politicians hit the presidential contest like a tornado in the summer , flattening the campaigns of some who were once seen as serious contenders . 
Among Republicans this sentiment is , of course , no surprise , given their party &apos;s steady rightward drift and consistent antipathy toward President Barack Obama . 
But it suited a wealthy , noisy braggart who barreled into the race attacking conventional politicians as &quot; stupid &quot; and insisting that he alone could get things done . 
Those who wrote off Donald Trump as a &quot; buffoon &quot; failed to see that he has shrewdly read the Republican zeitgeist , and that he knows precisely where to stick the knife into competitors . 
His depiction of former Florida governor Jeb Bush as a man of &quot; low energy &quot; has done real damage to a candidate whom many had assumed - even before he formally entered the race - would be the favorite . 
&quot; The Donald &quot; ( no one has better name recognition than the former TV personality ) has pitched his appeal both to American patriotism and the country &apos;s dark side . 
His slogan , &quot; Make America Great Again , &quot; is aimed at those who are frustrated that the US can no longer impose its will on an increasingly confusing world . 
For them , and for Trump , Obama is to blame : he doesn &apos;t stand up to foreign leaders ( Binyamin Netanyahu might disagree ) ; he withdrew from Iraq too soon ( though the timetable was set by his Republican predecessor ) ; he even &quot; apologizes &quot; for America . 
Trump plays to America &apos;s persistent veins of racism and nativism : he vows somehow to round up and deport some 11 million undocumented aliens and fortify America &apos;s border with Mexico by building a wall - paid for by Mexico . 
His striking narcissism ( everything he does is &quot; outstanding , great , terrific , the best &quot; ) is both his trademark and his policy . 
Around mid-August , as Trump &apos;s poll numbers rose even after public statements that would have brought down mere mortal candidates , it dawned on the pundits that he was no summer infatuation . 
It became evident that he might win the first nominating contest , the Iowa caucuses , and that he was leading in the second , New Hampshire , and other states . 
It was no longer laughable to say that he could be the Republican nominee . 
But the &quot; anti-system &quot; mood of this election campaign is not confined to the Republicans . 
Bernie Sanders the socialist and Donald Trump the plutocrat are addressing much the same impulse . 
Speaking in clear , declarative sentences , Sanders sets forth an idealistic conception of government policy that appeals to a great many people on the growing left of the Democratic Party . 
By contrast , Jeb Bush and the Democrats &quot; presumed nominee , Hillary Clinton , embody traditional politics . 
Both come across as focus-grouped , packaged , and cautious , whereas Trump and Sanders are seen by their followers as &quot; telling it like it is . &quot; 
Sanders appeals to the popular frustration with the compromises made by America &apos;s leaders , including the centrist Bill Clinton . 
Hillary Clinton , trying to straddle the divide between the two wings of the Democratic Party , is increasingly leaning to the left as Sanders draws enormous crowds , something she has yet to accomplish . 
Moreover , her campaign is struggling to escape the quagmire produced by revelations that she conducted official business on a private email server during her tenure as Obama &apos;s Secretary of State . 
Meanwhile , Trump &apos;s appeal among Republicans is across the board : moderates and conservatives , college-educated , Evangelicals , men and women . 
It also includes white supremacists : in June Trump was endorsed by The Daily Stormer , America &apos;s largest neo-Nazi &quot; news &quot; website . 
When two far-right activists in Boston beat a homeless Latino man , with one saying that they had acted in Trump &apos;s name , the candidate commented that some of his followers are &quot; passionate . &quot; 
A poll of Trump supporters found that 66 % believe that Obama is a Muslim , and 61 % that he was not born in the US ( a claim that Trump continued to trumpet long after it had been disproved ) . 
Trump &apos;s closest Republican rival , Ben Carson , a renowned neurosurgeon , also has no political experience and says outlandish things . 
But Carson says them quietly , which may be why his favorability rating in Iowa is higher than that of his Republican competitors ( pulling even with Trump in one poll ) . 
Carson has said , for example , that people enter prison as heterosexuals and come out gay ; that America is like Nazi Germany in suppressing ideas and opponents ; and that the president need not enforce the Supreme Court &apos;s recent landmark decision legalizing gay marriage . 
Trump and Carson , along with two other candidates running as political outsiders - Ted Cruz , a senator from Texas , and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina - currently account for around 60 % of support among Iowa Republicans . 
Bush and the rest of the field , including Rand Paul , Scott Walker , and Marco Rubio - all one-time darlings of the political press - are floundering . 
To recover ground , some , especially Walker , have fallen into the trap of trying to out-Trump Trump . 
But there &apos;s only one Trump , and his candidacy is causing conniptions on the part of Republican Party officials , particularly given his campaign &apos;s open hostility toward Latinos . 
Following Obama &apos;s re-election , in 2012 , Republican leaders commissioned a study that showed that the party &apos;s nominee will have to win more Latino votes than ever to win the White House . 
There is scant chance of that if Trump is the party &apos;s standard-bearer . 
So far , Trump has defied the laws of political gravity . 
But it remains possible that his candidacy will crash as some of his rivals drop out and leave their supporters ( and wealthy backers ) to crystallize around someone they see as a more viable alternative . 
That would be a relief to Republican Party leaders , who recently obtained Trump &apos;s vow ( easily undone ) not to mount an independent presidential campaign should he fail to win the party &apos;s nomination . 
In the meantime , both party establishments have reason to be nervous . 
With Sanders now polling well ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire , serious commentators have begun speculating that Americans will ultimately be asked to choose between Sanders and Trump .
