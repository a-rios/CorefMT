Saving the World \ u0027s Fish 
It is difficult not to be a pessimist about the future of the world &apos;s fish population . 
Global marine catches , which had increased rapidly since WWII , stalled in the late 1980 &apos;s and have been declining ever since . 
That decline will be difficult to halt . 
The rapid depletion of fish stocks is the inevitable outcome of sophisticated industrial technology being thrown at dwindling marine populations as demand rises , fueled by growth in human population and incomes . 
The decline has so far been masked in the developed world by seafood products that were not previously available , such as farmed salmon , and by massive fish imports from developing countries . 
But over-fishing has become a severe problem in the developing world as well . 
So fisheries worldwide are due for wrenching changes in the near future . 
A clear indication of the problem is &quot; fishing down the marine food web &quot;  -  the increasing tendency to land fish and shellfish from the bottom of marine food chains , often the prey of the larger fish that were previously targeted . 
This trend provides low-quality substitutes for the high-quality fish that we were once accustomed to , and will inexorably lead us toward catching plankton , especially jellyfish . 
Yes , jellyfish , which were once a specialty consumed around East Asia , are now a product caught in the Atlantic as well , and exported across continents . 
The fishing industry is , on its own , incapable of reversing the &quot; fishing down &quot; trend , notwithstanding arguments by commentators who should know better . 
In his recent book The Skeptical Environmentalist , for example , the Danish public-policy analyst Bj√∏rn Lomborg cited data reported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) that showed increasing figures for global fish catches . 
Lomborg used the figures to argue that if catches are up , then the underlying ecosystems must be in good shape , despite all the warnings from experts . 
But Lomborg is wrong , and the experts are right . 
We now know that the apparent increases in global fish catches in the 1990 &apos;s were due to massive over-reporting to the FAO by China . 
We also know that fish catches can remain high ( and in fact usually do ) even as stocks collapse , as illustrated by cod off Eastern Canada , which yielded good catches until the fishery had to be closed because there were literally no fish left . 
But excessive catches are not even the whole story . 
Many fishing techniques now in use - bottom trawls foremost among them - literally tear up the habitat upon which fish depend . 
As a result , some fish stocks exploited in this manner do not seem to recover , regardless of quotas or other regulations on catches . 
Aquaculture , the farming of fish and other aquatic organisms , could in principle ameliorate the coming shortfall . 
However , aquaculture refers to two fundamentally different kinds of operations . 
One type of aquaculture is devoted to the farming of bivalves such as oysters and mussels , or to freshwater fish such as carp and tilapia . 
It relies on plants ( plankton sometimes supplemented by agricultural by-products in the case of freshwater fish ) to generate a net addition to the fish food supply available to consumers . 
Moreover , because this type of aquaculture is based predominantly in developing countries ( mainly in China , but also in countries such as the Philippines and Bangladesh ) , it supplies cheap animal protein right where it is needed . 
The second type of aquaculture entails the farming of carnivorous fish such as salmon or seabass , and increasingly , the fattening of wild tuna in captivity . 
Salmon , seabass , or tuna eat flesh ; in ecological terms , they are the wolves and lions of the sea . 
When fed only vegetable matter , such as soy meal , salmon do not grow well , and end up looking and tasting like tofu . 
There is no point even trying to feed tuna anything but fish . 
The more of this aquaculture there is , the less cheap fish , such as sardines , herring , mackerel , and anchovies , there will be for humans to buy and eat . 
Farming carnivorous fish increases rather than reduces pressure on wild stocks . 
It has led to massive imports by developed countries - where this type of aquaculture predominates - of fishmeal from fish caught and ground up in developing countries . 
One reason why acquaculture &apos;s practitioners can get away with this is that the public assumes that all of these operations are similar , and that they all add to the global fish supply . 
This is simply not the case . 
There is still time to save our fisheries , but only if they are reinvented not as the source of an endlessly growing supply of fish for an endlessly growing human population , but as a provider of a healthy complement to grain-based diets . 
Moreover , such reinvented fisheries will be smaller , and they will rely on fish that move out of marine reserves , the protected ocean areas that we must establish to enable marine ecosystems and the species within them to rebuild some of their past abundance , and to share it with us again .
