What McCain and Obama Ignore 
PRINCETON - Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago &apos;s blighted South Side , so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America . 
He knows that in one of the world &apos;s richest nations , 37 million people live in poverty , a far higher proportion than in Europe &apos;s wealthy nations . 
Yet Obama &apos;s campaigning has focused on &quot; Main Street &quot; and tax cuts for the middle class , bypassing the issue of what to do about poverty . 
It &apos;s not as if Obama has no policies for helping the poor . 
Go to his Web site , click on &quot; The Issues &quot; and then on &quot; Poverty . &quot; 
There you will find a set of thoughtful proposals ranging from raising the minimum wage to establishing model &quot; Promise Neighborhoods &quot; that will attempt to turn around areas with high levels of poverty and low levels of educational achievement by providing services such as early childhood education and crime prevention . 
( Go to John McCain &apos;s Web site , and you won &apos;t even find &quot; poverty &quot; among the list of issues to click on - although &quot; Space Program &quot; is there . ) 
So why isn &apos;t Obama speaking up about an issue on which he has so much more first-hand experience than his opponent , and better policies , too ? 
Perhaps not enough of the poor vote , or they will vote Democratic anyway . 
Moreover , his researchers presumably have told him that independent middle-class voters are more likely to be won over by appeals to their wallets than to concern for America &apos;s poor . 
If America &apos;s poor don &apos;t rank high among voters &quot; concerns , it is no surprise that the poor abroad are virtually invisible . 
Again , Obama has both the background - with his family ties to Kenya - and a promising policy , to increase America &apos;s foreign assistance to $ 50 billion by 2012 , using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to Africa . 
( Currently , of all the OECD donor nations , only Greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the United States does . ) 
But when Obama &apos;s running mate , Joe Biden , was asked , in his debate with his Republican counterpart , Sarah Palin , what proposals an Obama-Biden administration might have to scale back as a result of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout , the only specific proposal he mentioned was the increase in foreign assistance . 
McCain has never gotten down to specifics about how much foreign aid he would like the US to give . 
Both candidates refer to deaths of American military personnel in Iraq , but there has been less attention to the war &apos;s civilian causalities . 
In her debate with Biden , Palin actually attacked Obama for saying that , in her words , &quot; All we &apos;re doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians . &quot; 
She called that comment &quot; reckless &quot; and &quot; untrue , &quot; because , &quot; That &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing there . 
We &apos;re fighting terrorists , and we &apos;re securing democracy . &quot; 
Of course , killing civilians is not all that the US and its NATO allies are doing in Afghanistan , and if Obama implied that it was , his rhetoric was careless . 
But what is extraordinary about Palin &apos;s comment is that , despite being a strong proponent of the sanctity of human life , in criticizing Obama she did not pause to deplore the serious loss of innocent human life that American air strikes in Afghanistan have caused . 
Afghanistan &apos;s president , Hamid Karzai , has repeatedly expressed outrage at American air strikes that have killed civilians - most recently in August , when he said that 95 Afghans , including 50 children , were killed in the bombing of a village . 
The global ethical challenge that has been most prominent in the campaign is climate change . 
Here , the candidates &quot; goals are virtually identical : they both support a cap-and-trade system to make deep cuts in US greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 . 
Obama wants the goal to be an 80 % reduction and McCain says 66 % , but , since the next president will leave office no later than 2016 , that difference is irrelevant . 
Interestingly , one ethical issue on which neither candidate has campaigned has been shown to have the potential to move voters . 
A group called Defenders of Wildlife has been running an ad graphically highlighting Palin &apos;s support for shooting wolves from aircraft . 
A study of Republicans , Democrats , and independents showed that viewing the ad led to greater support for Obama . 
According to Glenn Kessler , the head of HCD research , which conducted the study with the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion , whereas recent ads from both parties have had little impact among voters , &quot; This is the first ad in over a month that seems to have broken through . &quot; 
Consistent with that finding , an historic ballot initiative in California to ban cruel forms of animal confinement on factory farms , including the battery cage system of keeping hens , is also showing strong support .
