The False Promise of Private Pensions 
One of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world &apos;s richest countries is the that government-funded defined-benefit pension programs ( such as America &apos;s Social Security system ) are outmoded . 
These programs were fine , the argument goes , for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation , but they have become obsolete in today &apos;s high-tech , networked , post-industrial economy . 
Advocates of this argument propose a different model . 
Just as corporations today are much happier supporting workers &quot; pensions by contributing to employees &quot; private accounts , so governments today should offer ( or require ) contributions to privately owned accounts . 
The value of these accounts would fluctuate with the market rather than resting on a defined-benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement . 
This argument is strange because it gets the economics of the situation backward . 
When there are lots of companies offering workers long-term defined-benefit retirement pensions , there are fewer advantages to the government in setting up a parallel defined-benefit scheme and requiring workers to participate in it . 
After all , in such a world , workers who set great value on a defined-benefit pension can go to work for firms that offer such pensions . 
The major benefits that arise from the government &apos;s requiring that workers also participate in a national Social Security system accrue to those workers who really ought to value a defined-benefit pension highly but have not been able to figure out what their true preferences are . 
They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want - and need . 
But there aren &apos;t a lot of companies today that are willing to offer long-term defined-benefit pension schemes . 
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-run fragility than they were in the post-World War II decades . 
Not even America &apos;s IBM - which prides itself on stability - wants to take the risk of offering defined-benefit schemes . 
The risk from defined-benefit pensions used to be offset by two benefits for companies that offered them . 
First , the fact that leaving the company usually meant cashing in one &apos;s pension at a discount increased worker loyalty . 
Second , complaisant accountants &quot; optimistic assumptions about returns on pension reserves , together with large firms &quot; greater risk-bearing capacity , brightened the financial picture that companies could report to investors . 
Today , the risks are seen to be much greater , and the benefits are seen to be less . 
As a result , an ever-smaller slice of employers are offering anything like defined-benefit pensions . 
This fall-off in private defined-benefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing , because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middle-aged workers value defined-benefit pensions extremely highly . 
Historically , the gap between expected returns on low-risk assets like government or investment-grade bonds and high-risk assets like stocks and real estate has been very high . 
To some degree , as economists like Harvard &apos;s Robert Barro and mathematicians like Benoit Mandelbrot argue , this may be because high-risk investments are in reality much more risky than the theories and math of standard finance techniques suggest . 
In my opinion , at least , this is partly because the memory of years like 1930 and 2000 , when stocks performed very badly , occupies too large a place in investors &quot; minds . 
Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety , security , and predictability , so a defined-benefit pension plan is extremely valuable . 
But in today &apos;s world , only national governments are large enough to be able to do so with any assurance that the pension assets will actually be there when workers retire . 
I am enough of a social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens value extremely highly and that only the government can provide , then the government should provide it . 
We economists know that there are many drawbacks to expanding government beyond its basic role of providing true public goods like defense , public safety , and justice , as well as providing citizens with incentives to counterbalance the effects of true market failures . 
If the private market has the flexibility of two hands , government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs . 
But the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is the kind of routine , semi-automatic task that government can do well . 
With private companies backing away from defined-benefit programs , it is even more important and valuable that government do it in our post-industrial network-age society than it was in the past .
