Is Chinese Mercantilism Good or Bad for Poor Countries ? 
CAMBRIDGE - China &apos;s trade balance is on course for another bumper surplus this year . 
Meanwhile , concern about the health of the US recovery continues to mount . 
Both developments suggest that China will be under renewed pressure to nudge its currency sharply upward . 
The conflict with the US may well come to a head during Congressional hearings on the renminbi to be held in September , where many voices will urge the Obama administration to threaten punitive measures if China does not act . 
Discussion of China &apos;s currency focuses around the need to shrink the country &apos;s trade surplus and correct global macroeconomic imbalances . 
With a less competitive currency , many analysts hope , China will export less and import more , making a positive contribution to the recovery of the US and other economies . 
In all this discussion , the renminbi is viewed largely as a US-China issue , and the interests of poor countries get scarcely a hearing , even in multilateral fora . 
Yet a noticeable rise in the renminbi &apos;s value may have significant implications for developing countries . 
Whether they stand to gain or lose from a renminbi revaluation , however , is hotly contested . 
On one side stands Arvind Subramanian , from the Peterson Institute and the Center for Global Development . 
He argues that developing countries have suffered greatly from China &apos;s policy of undervaluing its currency , which has made it more difficult for them to compete with Chinese goods in world markets , retarded their industrialization , and set back their growth . 
If the renminbi were to gain in value , poor countries &quot; exports would become more competitive , and their economies would become better positioned to reap the benefits of globalization . 
Hence , Subramanian argues , poor countries must make common cause with the US and other advanced economies in pressuring China to alter its currency policies . 
On the other side stand Helmut Reisen and his colleagues at the OECD &apos;s Development Centre , who conclude that developing countries , and especially the poorest among them , would be hurt if the renminbi were to rise sharply . 
Their reasoning is that currency appreciation would almost certainly slow China &apos;s growth , and that anything does that must be bad news for other poor countries as well . 
They buttress their argument with empirical work that suggests that growth in developing countries has become progressively more dependent on China &apos;s economic performance . 
They estimate that a slowdown of one percentage point in China &apos;s annual growth rate would reduce low-income countries growth rates by 0.3 percentage points - almost a third as much . 
To make sense of these two contrasting perspectives , we need to step back and consider the fundamental drivers of growth . 
Strip away the technicalities , and the debate boils down to one fundamental question : what is the best , most sustainable growth model for low-income countries ? 
Historically , poor regions of the world have often relied on what is called a &quot; vent-for-surplus &quot; model . 
This model entails exporting to other parts of the world primary products and natural resources such as agricultural produce or minerals . 
This is how Argentina grew rich in the nineteenth century , and how oil states have become wealthy during the last 40 years . 
The rapid growth that many developing countries experienced prior to the crisis was largely the result of the same model . 
Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa , in particular , were propelled forward by the growing demand for their natural resources from other countries - China chief among them . 
But this model suffers from two fatal weaknesses . 
First , it depends heavily on rapid growth in foreign demand . 
When such demand falters , developing countries find themselves with collapsing export prices , and , too often , a protracted domestic crisis . 
Second , it does not stimulate economic diversification . 
Economies hooked on this model find themselves excessively specialized in primary products that promise little productivity growth . 
Indeed , the central challenge of economic development is not foreign demand , but domestic structural change . 
The problem for poor countries is that they are not producing the right kinds of goods . 
They need to restructure away from traditional primary products to higher-productivity activities , mainly manufactures and modern services . 
The real exchange rate is of paramount importance here , as it determines the competitiveness and profitability of modern tradable activities . 
When developing nations are forced into overvalued currencies , entrepreneurship and investment in those activities are depressed . 
From this perspective , China &apos;s currency policies not only undercut the competitiveness of African and other poor regions &quot; industries ; they also undermine those regions &quot; fundamental growth engines . 
What poor nations get out of Chinese mercantilism is , at best , temporary growth of the wrong kind . 
Lest we blame China too much , though , we should remember that there is little that prevents developing countries from replicating the essentials of the Chinese model . 
They , too , could have used their exchange rates more actively in order to stimulate industrialization and growth . 
True , all countries in the world cannot simultaneously undervalue their currencies . 
Instead , too many developing countries have allowed their currencies to become overvalued , relying on booming commodity demand or financial inflows . 
And they have made little systematic use of explicit industrial policies that could act as a substitute for undervaluation . 
Given this , perhaps we should not hold China responsible for taking care of its own economic interests , even if it has aggravated in the process the costs of other countries &quot; misguided currency policies .
