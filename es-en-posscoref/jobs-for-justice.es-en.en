Jobs for Justice 
SANTIAGO - &quot; Do you feel it trickle down ? &quot; ask the protesters occupying Wall Street and parts of financial districts from London to San Francisco . 
They are not alone in their anxiety . 
Income inequality is a top concern not only in tent cities across the United States , but also among street protesters in Taipei , Tel Aviv , Cairo , Athens , Madrid , Santiago , and elsewhere . 
Inequality almost everywhere , including China , has become so extreme that it must be reduced . 
Protesters , experts , and center-left politicians agree on this - and on little else . 
The debate about inequality &apos;s causes is complex and often messy ; the debate about how to address it is messier still . 
In the rich countries of the global north , the widening gap between rich and poor results from technological change , globalization , and the misdeeds of investment bankers . 
In the not-so-rich countries of the south , much inequality is the consequence of a more old-fashioned problem : lack of employment opportunities for the poor . 
In a forthcoming book , University of Chile economist Crist√≥bal Huneeus and I examine the roots of inequality in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America and come away with three policy prescriptions : jobs , jobs , jobs . 
In the last quarter-century , Chile managed to consolidate democracy , triple per capita income , and achieve the highest living standards in Latin America , with near-universal coverage in health care , education , and old-age pensions . 
Yet the gap in the labor incomes of rich and poor has barely budged . 
In Chile and elsewhere , discussions of inequality tend to focus on how much people earn . 
According to national household surveys , a Chilean worker earning the minimum wage takes home $ 300 a month , while a professional in the top 10 % of the income scale typically makes about $ 2,400 dollars a month . 
But that eight-fold gap is only the tip of the inequality iceberg . 
It also turns out that the poor worker lives in a household where only 0.5 people on average have a job , so that two families are needed for one steady source of income . 
By contrast , in the upscale professional &apos;s household , nearly two people on average hold down a job . 
Add to this several other differences - above all , poorer families &quot; higher fertility rates - and the sums reveal that the top 10 % of households actually make 78 times more ( on a per capita basis ) than those at the bottom . 
That is the kind of figure that keeps Chile ranked high globally in terms of inequality , despite the country &apos;s other achievements . 
Put differently : not only take-home pay , but also employment opportunities can be unequally distributed . 
Compound the two problems and you have world-class income disparities . 
Chile is hardly alone in this category . 
South Africa , another country that is proud of its exemplary transition to democracy , suffers from the same problem in an even more extreme version . 
And , within Latin America , Colombia and Brazil , among others , face a similar combination of low employment and high inequality . 
The main victims of this state of affairs are women and the young , for whom employment ratios are much lower than for the population as a whole . 
A typical poor household in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America is headed by a woman with only primary-school education . 
She has small children , limited access to day care , and few job opportunities . 
That is the bad news - and it is very bad news indeed . 
The good news is that reducing inequality by creating jobs for the poor may prove to be faster than altering the entire structure of wages . 
Over the medium term , wages depend on productivity , which in turn depends crucially on higher-quality education and training for the poor , which Latin American countries certainly need . 
Indeed , a heated national debate about how to improve education has seized Chile for much of the past year . 
But educational reforms , however urgent and important , take a long time to bear fruit , whereas changes in employment can reduce inequality more quickly - and the effects can be large . 
In our book , we estimate that if poor households in Chile had the same access to jobs as the middle classes enjoy , the gap between rich and poor would narrow by half . 
So , what is the best way to create job opportunities for the poor ? 
A growing economy with low inflation and financial stability is a necessary but insufficient condition . 
Labor rules that favor job creation - what Scandinavian countries call active labor-market policies - are needed : a combination of information , training , and subsidies that help overcome what are typically serious failures in the market for young workers with limited skills and experience . 
The problem is more political than economic . 
In most Latin American countries , big business and labor have a long history of mutual distrust , and getting them to agree on changes to labor-market rules is hardly an easy task . 
Moreover , many unemployed young people are not registered to vote , so providing jobs for them is hardly a top priority for the political establishment . 
Equality through employment - not the snazziest of slogans , but one well worth painting on banners and flying over occupied squares and parks , on Wall Street and much farther afield .
