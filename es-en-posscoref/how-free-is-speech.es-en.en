How Free is Speech ? 
NEW YORK - Bishop Richard Williamson has some very peculiar , and frankly odious , views : that no Jews were murdered in gas chambers during World War II ; that the Twin Towers were brought down by American explosives , not by airplanes , on September 11 , 2001 ; and that Jews are fighting to dominate the world &quot; to prepare the anti-Christ &apos;s throne in Jerusalem . &quot; 
And these are just some of his opinions on secular matters . 
On questions of Roman Catholic doctrine , his views were considered so out of line with the modern Church that the Vatican excommunicated him in 1988 , along with other members of the ultra-conservative Society of St. Pius X , founded by the fascist sympathizer Marcel Lefebvre . 
Supporters of Williamson include the British historian David Irving , who was recently jailed in Austria for glorifying the Nazis . 
The bishop , then , does not strike one as an attractive man . 
But does he deserve everything now hanging over his head ? 
As a consequence of the views he expressed on Swedish television , he was denied re-entry into the Church , as was promised earlier by Pope Benedict , which is probably just as well . 
But he was also kicked out of Argentina , where he lived , and is threatened with extradition to Germany , where preparations are made to prosecute him for Holocaust denial . 
Meanwhile , consider the case of another unappealing man , the Dutch politician Geert Wilders , who was banned last month from entering the United Kingdom , where he had planned to show his short film , entitled Fitna , which describes Islam as a terrorist faith . 
Back in Holland , a case is being made against him in an Amsterdam court for &quot; spreading hatred &quot; against Muslims . 
He has compared the Koran to Hitler &apos;s Mein Kampf , and wishes to stop immigration of Muslims to the Netherlands . 
The British ban , as well as the impending court case , has actually made Wilders more popular in the Netherlands , where one poll indicated that his populist anti-Muslim party , the PVV , would get 27 seats in parliament if elections were held today . 
The reason for Wilders &quot; surging popularity , apart from widespread distrust of Muslims , is that he has successfully cultivated an image as a fighter for free speech . 
The principle of free speech , one of the fundamental rights in liberal democracies , means that we must live with views that we find reprehensible , up to a point . 
The question is , up to what point ? 
Laws on free speech differ somewhat from country to country . 
It is a criminal offense in various European democracies , including France , Germany , and Austria , to express the view that the Holocaust never happened . 
Many democratic countries also have laws against inciting violence or hatred . 
Some countries , including the Netherlands , even have laws against deliberately insulting people on the grounds of their race or religion . 
Bishop Williamson &apos;s ideas may be loathsome , but criminal prosecution against a man for his views about history is probably a bad idea . 
He should be criticized , even ridiculed , but not jailed . 
Similarly , it would have been much better to let Wilders show his wretched film in Britain than to ban him . 
Whatever one thinks of laws against spreading hatred or insulting people , the law remains a blunt instrument when it came to matters of speech . 
Nevertheless , free speech is not absolute . 
Even Wilders , with his absurd call to ban the Koran , clearly believes that there are limits - for his opponents , of course , not for himself . 
But it is not so easy to define precisely what those limits should be , for they depend on who says what to whom , and even where . 
Williamson &apos;s opinions suddenly mattered , because this obscure , excommunicated priest was about to be reinstated by the Pope . 
In the case of Wilders , it makes a difference that he is a politician , not just a private individual , pandering to dangerous prejudices against a vulnerable minority . 
In civilized life , people refrain from saying many things , regardless of questions of legality . 
Words used by young black men among themselves in American cities would have a very different resonance if young white men used them . 
Mocking the ways and beliefs of minorities is not quite the same thing as taking on the cherished habits and views of majorities . 
If this smacks of political correctness , then so be it . 
The problem is where to draw the line . 
Legally , this should probably be the point where words are designed to result in violence . 
Socially , there are too many variables to establish an absolute , universal principle . 
The proper limits must be constantly tested , contested , and renegotiated . 
People like Bishop Williamson and Geert Wilders are useful to the extent that they allow us to do just that . 
Let them speak , so that they can be judged , not in court , but by contrary opinions . 
Banning them only allows them to pose as martyrs to free speech . 
And that not only makes it harder to attack their views , but also gives free speech a bad name .
