The Ethics of Ebola 
LONDON - As the Ebola virus grips an unprecedentedly wide swath of Africa , many are asking whether it is time to begin administering untested drugs and vaccines . 
Given that the disease can kill up to 90 % of its victims - higher than the mortality rate from the bubonic plague - there seems to be little to lose from relaxing clinical norms . 
But the suggestion raises difficult ethical questions - and the urgency of the situation does not leave much time for deliberation . 
One reason that there is no proven cure or vaccine for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is the wiliness of crossover diseases . 
These viruses are transmitted from animal populations , which can act as reservoirs where the pathogens can develop and mutate , making it difficult for researchers to keep pace with the diseases &quot; variations . 
But another reason is pharmaceutical companies &quot; declining interest in manufacturing vaccines . 
Indeed , only four companies today make vaccines , compared to 26 companies 50 years ago . 
These firms know that the return on their investment will be relatively low , owing to the long lead-in time that results from slow manufacturing processes ( though new , faster methods offer some hope ) . 
Public distrust of vaccines has also played a major role in this decline . 
In the late 1990s , anti-vaccine sentiment manifested itself in a backlash against the measles , mumps , and rubella vaccine . 
Similarly , a 2004 New York Academy of Medicine survey indicated that twice as many people were worried about the side effects of the well-established smallpox vaccine as were concerned about the disease itself . 
The comparative docility of infectious diseases like smallpox has contributed to a degree of complacency about the magnitude of the risks of refusing vaccination . 
When an epidemic actually begins , people quickly change their minds , and demand the rapid production and distribution of vaccines . 
That is probably a good thing , but it is also unrealistic . 
The British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline recently announced that , together with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , it is developing an experimental vaccine for Ebola . 
But it is just entering phase I clinical trials to test toxicity . 
With two more trial stages to go , the vaccine would not be ready for deployment before 2015 . 
The duration of the trial process has provoked complaints of excessive red tape . 
But such criticism is unfounded , given the potential of proposed drugs to cause serious illness or even death . 
Indeed , phase I trials - also called &quot; first-in-man studies &quot; - are extremely risky and ethically knotty , meaning that they must be handled with the utmost care . 
In 2006 , phase I trials of the drug TGN1412 had to be suspended when previously healthy volunteers developed multiple organ failure , with some barely escaping death . 
University College London pharmacologist Trevor Smart believes that they may never fully recover . 
But what about when a population is already ill ? 
In 1996 , during a major meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria , the drug company Pfizer supplied doctors with the oral antibiotic Trovan , which was being tested against another drug , ceftriaxone . 
Eleven children died during the Trovan trial , and others were left permanently disabled . 
Still , the death rate in the Trovan trial was much lower than the rate from untreated meningitis , bolstering the case for administering untested Ebola drugs today . 
In fact , the World Health Organization has already pronounced the use of the experimental serum ZMapp - a mixture of genetically engineered antibodies intended to help patients fight the disease - ethical . 
ZMapp never made it to human trials and is not yet licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration . 
As it stands , only a few doses of ZMapp exist , and it will take months to produce even a modest supply . 
This raises another ethical dilemma : Who should receive such a scarce resource ? 
The first three doses of ZMapp were administered to the American medical missionaries Kent Brantly and Nancy Whitebol , who have recovered , and the Spanish priest Miguel Pajares , who has since died . 
Some offered a practical justification for the widely criticized selection of Brantly and Whitebol : It makes sense to treat health workers first , so that they can continue to help others . 
But this argument largely fell apart with the selection of the 75-year-old Pajares . 
The credibility of claims that practicality drove the selection was , to some extent , revived by the decision to provide doses to three African doctors . 
In any case , the available supply of ZMapp has been exhausted . 
It is important to note that even pragmatic arguments about rationing scarce medical resources can be highly controversial . 
During World War II , when army doctors were forced to ration doses of penicillin , they decided to give first priority to men with sexually transmitted diseases , who would be ready to return to the battlefield more quickly . 
But many contended that men who had been wounded in battle were more deserving . 
Putting such a moral spin on the allocation of Ebola treatments , it could be argued that Africans should be selected over Westerners , because Africa &apos;s health-care systems are less able to combat the disease . 
But one might also contend that Western medical workers deserve higher priority because they volunteered to expose themselves to the disease , in order to help those who had no choice . 
Such arguments make reaching agreement virtually impossible . 
Worse , using social , rather than medical , criteria for rationing treatments is a slippery slope . 
One need only recall Seattle &apos;s notorious &quot; God &quot; committee , which in the early 1960s allocated then-scarce kidney dialysis on the basis of criteria like earnings , church involvement , and even Scout membership . 
The use of social criteria for treatment allocation has had a bad name ever since - and rightly so .
