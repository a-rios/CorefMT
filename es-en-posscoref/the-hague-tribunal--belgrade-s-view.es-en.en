The Hague Tribunal : Belgrade \ u0027s View 
BELGRADE : Opinion polls in Serbia show that large majorities believe the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to be a political instrument to bash Serbs . 
So they oppose extradition of the indicted - including ex-president Milosevic - to the Hague Tribunal . 
When the Tribunal &apos;s chief prosecutor , Carla del Ponte , comes to Belgrade this Tuesday her welcome will not be warm . 
Democratic politicians everywhere vie for the support of ethnic lobbies . 
To gain the Cuban vote in Florida , American politicians are tough on Fidel Castro ; to secure Jewish votes in New York , they are soft on Israel . 
At the same time as they play this game , US policymakers ( both Democrats and Republicans ) demand that Vojislav Kostunica , President of Yugoslavia , cooperate with the Hague Tribunal unconditionally . 
Kostunica , however , is a sensible politician . 
He knows that , although the Serbian lobby is weak in the US , it is all � powerful in Serbia . 
Taking the mood of his voters seriously , Kostunica criticizes the Tribunal and expresses reservations about receiving Mrs. del Ponte . 
Long before the civil war in former Yugoslavia , I concluded that the world needed an international court to try governments and army commanders for war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide . 
But ever since the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was established in 1993 by the UN Security Council , I have been disappointed . 
I feel like some communist true believer who , in the 1930s , suddenly realized that terror existed in the Soviet Union . 
Why this change of heart ? 
Biljana Plavsic , professor of biology and a leader of Bosnia &apos;s Serbs , recently appeared before the Hague Tribunal to face charges of genocide . 
But the prosecutor merely repeated accusations about crimes committed by the Bosnian Serbs that have been known for years . 
Not a shred of new or recent evidence was presented . 
When Mrs. Plavsic was the pro � Western president of the Serbian part of Bosnia - between 1996 and 1998 - and in conflict with her more nationalist colleagues , she was hailed in the West as a democrat and champion of tolerance . 
I remember seeing President Jacques Chirac kiss her hand at the entrance to the Elysee Palace . 
I am reminded of Stalin &apos;s purges . 
One day you are a Hero of the Soviet Union , and the next you are shot as an enemy of the people . 
On May 27 , 1999 , at the height of the NATO bombing campaign , Judge Louise Arbour of Canada , Mrs. del Ponte &apos;s predecessor as the Hague Tribunal &apos;s chief prosecutor , issued a warrant for the arrest of President Slobodan Milosevic . 
The indictment was based on evidence gathered by American and British intelligence services about the expulsions and killings of Albanians in Kosovo . 
Milosevic could have been charged by the Tribunal years before because of his responsibility for the war in Bosnia . 
But America &apos;s State Department needed his support to conclude the Dayton peace agreement of 1995 , so Milosevic &apos;s crimes of the time were conveniently forgotten . 
Soon after the warrant for Milosevic was issued , I heard in Belgrade that Vuk Draskovic , an opposition leader , was being threatened with indictment by US officials for the activities of his short � lived paramilitary organization during the 1991 war in Croatia . 
It seems as if the Americans were saying : stop creating conflicts with other opposition leaders , or we will indict you . 
Is it really so easy to dismiss out of hand as unreconstructed nationalists those Serbs who ask : why was Franjo Tudjman ( the former president of Croatia ) never indicted ? 
Under his rule almost half a million Serbs were expelled from Croatia ; he , too , sent troops into Bosnia to partition Bosnian territory . 
What of Alija Izetbegovic , the Muslim former president of Bosnia , who never wanted a multi � ethnic ( Muslim � Serb � Croat ) Bosnia , but rather the first Muslim state in Europe ? 
Under his rule , Sarajevo was &quot; cleansed &quot; of most of its Serbs and Croats . 
And what of Hashim Thaci , the young leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army ? 
When , in June 1999 , Serbian troops moved out of Kosovo and NATO moved in , it was the KLA that really took over . 
Since then it has destroyed dozens of Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries , killed hundreds of civilians , and expelled almost all Serbs and other non � Albanians . 
Last but definitely not least can we avoid asking questions about NATO &apos;s responsibility ? 
Perhaps several thousand Serbian civilians were killed during the NATO bombing . 
It may turn that the depleted uranium bullets used during the Kosovo war cause lethal radiation and that some commanders and politicians knew about this . 
By bombing Serbia &apos;s infrastructure , NATO also violated Article 14 of the 1977 Protocol of the Geneva Convention of 1949 , which prohibits attacks on &quot; objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population . &quot; 
America will never accept the jurisdiction of an independent international court over its political leaders and military forces . 
Nor will any other great power . 
The spokesman for the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has stated this bluntly : &quot; You &apos;re more likely to see the UN building dismantled brick � by � brick and thrown into the Atlantic than see NATO pilots go before a UN tribunal . &quot; 
Instead of being fair and delivering justice , the Hague Tribunal has surrendered to political pressures and manipulation . 
Rather than helping Serbs achieve a moral catharsis by punishing their guilty leaders for their misdeeds , the Hague Tribunal is only reinforcing anti � Western prejudices and the sense of victimization already pervasive in Serbia .
