Europe and African Defense 
WASHINGTON , DC - The European Union already faces considerable risks concerning its structure , uncertain economic recovery , north-south imbalances , and British ambivalence about membership . 
Exposure to bad outcomes in Africa , with its myriad security problems , increases those risks . 
Much of Africa north of the equator continues to be violent and potentially explosive . 
The showers of the Arab Spring have not produced an attractive crop of leaders , let alone a harvest of democracy . 
Anarchy , banditry , and terrorism by Al Qaeda affiliates and wannabes , exhibited in Algerian gas fields and Mali , may develop into more than a lethal nuisance . 
With the United States an increasingly reluctant world policeman as it reconsiders , reduces , and realigns its strategic commitments , European countries - especially the United Kingdom and France , given Germany &apos;s retreat from military participation - will have to bear principal responsibility for dealing with African security issues . 
Fortunately , European powers have clearly shown some willingness to do so , demonstrated by their intervention in Libya and Mali . 
This is appropriate , because , even as the US retains a strong interest in and responsibility for Northeast Africa ( owing to the region &apos;s relationship to the Middle East ) , Europe is more directly affected by events in the rest of Africa than is the US . 
Europe depends on energy imports from the Maghreb , and its geographic proximity and past colonial relationships make it a destination , not always welcoming , of African immigration . 
The same factors also make Europe more vulnerable to terrorist activities originating in Africa . 
Britain and France ( with Italian and other assistance ) needed US combat support in Libya ; 
But the US is allocating more of its resources to the Asia-Pacific region , which means that European powers , acting under an appropriate umbrella , need to take the lead and provide the primary forces for military combat operations in Africa . 
The US should play a supporting role , but which organization should take the lead ? 
One possibility might be the EU Common Security and Defense Policy . 
The proposed 60,000-member EU Rapid Reaction Force , which could have a real peacemaking ( combat ) role , remains an idea on paper only . 
In practice , even the Battlegroups would probably require NATO ( in effect , US ) support . 
Indeed , whatever the role of bilateral cooperation , the only supranational organization capable of sustained combat operations is NATO . 
That umbrella can provide a basis for US support behind European leadership , as it did in Libya . 
US support in Africa likely would take the form of airlift , logistics , in-air refueling , intelligence , command and control communications , and surveillance ( including use of satellites and drones ) . 
These assets are much thinner in European militaries . 
That said , these high-use but low-availability US assets remain under severe strain , especially in Afghanistan , the Middle East , and the Persian Gulf . 
The US is reducing defense spending and drawing down its ground forces in Afghanistan , and will likely avoid substantial commitments of military forces in Africa . 
The subsidiary nature of the US combat-support role in Africa dictates that the US forego predominance in political and military decision-making concerning alliance operations , relinquishing out-front leadership in Africa ( apart from the northeastern part of the continent ) . 
Yet , because US support capabilities would be vital to the nature and scale of some operations , in practice the US would have a major voice when it did participate . 
The allied military operation in Libya was a reasonably good example of this model . 
A successful partnership within Europe , as well as between Europe and the US , to overcome extremism and terrorism in North and North Central Africa could provide allies with a sense of common purpose and a model of unified effort . 
Europe needs to take the lead , as it did in Mali and Libya .
