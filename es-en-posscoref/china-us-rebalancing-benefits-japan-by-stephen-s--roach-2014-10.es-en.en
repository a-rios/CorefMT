Last Chance for Japan ? 
NEW HAVEN - Japan is the petri dish for the struggle against the secular stagnation that is now gripping most major developed economies . 
And , notwithstanding all of the fanfare surrounding &quot; Abenomics , &quot; Japan &apos;s economy remains moribund . 
In the six quarters of Shinzo Abe &apos;s latest stint as prime minister , annualized real GDP growth has averaged just 1.4 % - up only slightly from the anemic post-1992 average of 1 % . 
Abenomics , with its potentially powerful combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus , coupled with a wide array of structural reforms , was supposed to end Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decades . &quot; 
All three &quot; arrows &quot; of the strategy were to be aimed at freeing the economy from a 15-year deflationary quagmire . 
Unfortunately , not all of the arrows have been soaring in flight . 
The Bank of Japan seems well on its way to delivering on the first one - embracing what it calls quantitative and qualitative easing ( QQE ) . 
Relative to GDP , the BOJ &apos;s monetary-policy gambit could actually far outstrip the efforts of America &apos;s Federal Reserve . 
But the flight of the other two arrows is shaky , at best . 
In recent days , Abe has raised serious questions about proceeding with the second phase of a previously legislated consumer-tax hike that has long been viewed as the linchpin of Japan &apos;s debt-consolidation strategy . 
Abe has flinched because the economy remains weak , posing renewed risks of a deflationary relapse . 
Meanwhile , the third arrow of structural reforms - especially tax , education , and immigration reforms - is nowhere near its target . 
Abenomics , one might conclude , is basically a Japanese version of the failed policy combination deployed in the United States and Europe : massive unconventional liquidity injections by central banks ( with the European Central Bank apparently now poised to follow the Fed ) , but little in the way of fundamental fiscal and structural reforms . 
The political expedience of the short-term monetary fix has triumphed once again . 
Such a gamble is especially problematic for Japan . 
With an aging - and now declining - working-age population , it has limited scope for reviving growth . 
Japan must either squeeze more out of its existing workforce by boosting productivity , or uncover new sources of demand at home or abroad . 
At home , that could mean adding workers , either by boosting female participation in the work force , which , at 63 % , is among the lowest in the developed world , or relaxing immigration restrictions . 
Unfortunately , there has been little progress on either front . 
Moreover , even if the political will to launch third-arrow structural reforms were suddenly to strengthen - a dubious proposition - any productivity payback would most likely take a long time to materialize . 
That leaves external demand , which underscores what is perhaps Abenomics &quot; most serious strategic flaw : It does not take into consideration some of the biggest changes that are likely to occur in the global economy . 
That is a great pity , because Japan is well positioned to take advantage of one of the most powerful global trends - the coming rebalancing of the Chinese and US economies . 
China appears to be more committed to restructuring than the US - at least for the foreseeable future . 
Its Third Plenum reforms provide a cohesive framework for a pro-consumption transformation . 
Though America currently remains intent on resurrecting a tired growth model , there is good reason to hope that it , too , will eventually rebalance . 
Japan cannot afford to squander these opportunities . 
As the main driver of Chinese growth shifts from external to domestic demand , who could benefit more than Japanese exporters ? 
China is already Japan &apos;s largest export market , leaving it ideally situated to capture additional market share in the coming surge of Chinese demand for consumer products and services . 
Likewise , Japan stands to benefit from its technological prowess in environmental remediation - an urgent priority for China in the years ahead . 
Japan already has great expertise in many of the solutions to some of China &apos;s toughest problems . 
Japan is also likely to gain from a long-overdue rebalancing of the US economy . 
A shift in the US - from excessive consumption of goods largely sourced in low-wage developing countries to the capital equipment that an increasingly investment-led economy will require - would play to Japan &apos;s greatest strengths . 
As a global leader in sophisticated machinery and the earth-moving equipment needed for infrastructure investment , Japan should be able to to seize these opportunities . 
In looking to external demand , Japan should not lose sight of its earlier achievements . 
In the 1970s and 1980s , Japan was the envy of the world , owing to an all-powerful export machine that tapped the demand of a rapidly growing global economy . 
&quot; Japan , Inc . &quot; still has a good institutional memory of what it takes to draw support from external demand . 
It is time to recapture that memory . 
Failure to do so would leave Japan , the world &apos;s third largest economy , at risk of being further marginalized by transformations in the world &apos;s two largest , the US and China . 
There is one obvious and important caveat : Poor Sino-Japanese relations , owing to unresolved historical grievances , could prevent Japan from realizing the economic benefits implied by China &apos;s economic rebalancing . 
The interplay between economics and politics lies at the heart of the rise and fall of great powers . 
In a rapidly changing world , underscored by likely shifts in the economic structure of China and the US , Japan cannot afford to lose sight of that fact . 
Just as the US and China have much to gain by transforming their economies , Japan is running out of time . 
In the grip of two lost decades and counting , this could be Japan &apos;s last chance .
