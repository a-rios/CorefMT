Georgia Splits the Kremlin 
MOSCOW - Dmitry Medvedev inherited the post of President of the Russian Federation from Vladimir Putin , and while Putin moved down the pecking order to become Prime Minister , speculation has abounded from the start of Medvedev &apos;s presidency about an eventual split between Russia &apos;s two highest leaders . 
The first days of the conflict in Georgia crushed this hypothesis . 
Indeed , Putin and Medvedev have worked in perfect tandem with respect to Georgia , cooperating and skillfully performing their different roles , with Putin cast in the lead role of the menacing god of a Russian reckoning , and Medvedev in the supporting role of a possible humanitarian peacemaker . 
But the Georgia crisis revealed a new strategic force in the Kremlin that opposes both Putin and Medvedev . 
We still cannot name its players , but we are aware of its interests and impact on events in the same way that astronomers discern a new but invisible planet by recording its impact on known and visible objects in space . 
One indication that something new is affecting Russian policy is provided by those loyal Kremlin pundits who are known for their gift of unmistakably guessing their masters &quot; changing moods . 
One after another , they have appeared on television and radio to denounce &quot; provokers , &quot; whom they dare not name , for &quot; planning the incursion of Russian troops all the way to Tbilisi and the establishment there of a pro-Russian government . &quot; 
Another indirect indication of an ongoing struggle is the uncertain behavior of the Russian military in Georgia , which apparently is the result of contradictory orders from the Kremlin . 
While the Russian army seems not to have engaged in any active measures since reaching its current positions , it pointedly remains within a half-hour of Tbilisi . 
The line in the sand that President George W. Bush drew on the night of August 11 , warning against Russian air strikes on Tbilisi &apos;s airport and shortly thereafter sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to visit Tbilisi , provoked a split in the Kremlin . 
The split divides those who are and are not concerned about the fate of Russian elites &quot; vast personal holdings in the West . 
I call these camps , respectively , Russia &apos;s global and national kleptocrats . 
Both sides firmly agree that there is nothing that the &quot; weakened and cowardly West &quot; can do to restrain Russia , a nuclear and petroleum superpower , beyond financial retribution against those Russian rulers with vast assets abroad . 
But the national kleptocrats seem to believe that they can live without overseas assets , or without educating their children and maintaining residences in the West . 
Instead , they are content to own properties in elite residential areas around Moscow and in Russia , such as Rublyovka , Valday , and Krasnaya Polyana . 
Both Putin and Medvedev ( and their television propagandists ) currently reflect the views and goals of the global kleptocrats . 
Neither leader wants to capture Tbilisi . 
Putin , of course , would have been glad to see Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , his sworn enemy , put in a cage . 
But other , more down to-earth considerations are more important to him . 
That said , Putin is keeping his options open to join the national plutocrats , in case their position dramatically strengthens . 
If he crosses over to their side , he could even become their leader and triumphantly return to the throne that he formally abandoned only recently . 
While no one yet knows the national plutocrats &quot; names , I believe that they are new , influential players in or associated with the Kremlin , and that they have now become bold enough to challenge both Putin and Medvedev . 
Russia &apos;s military chiefs , for whom it is psychologically difficult to be ordered by politicians to abruptly end a large-scale and successful military operation , are their natural allies . 
I cannot predict who will win this growing confrontation . 
But even if the global kleptocrats sustain their more &quot; moderate &quot; position on Georgia , theirs could be a Pyrrhic victory . 
Every day and every hour , by means of their own propaganda , these globally minded kleptocrats , are setting the path to power for the nationalists . 
In order to justify their authoritarian rule and camouflage from the Russian public their massive theft of the country &apos;s resources , the global kleptocrats have already convinced ordinary Russians that they are surrounded by ruthless enemies who are trying to dismember and destroy Russia . 
Now it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to explain why their wives and children are buying palaces in the capitals of countries that are supposedly Russia &apos;s sworn enemies . 
By contrast , the national kleptocrats &quot; position is more consistent . 
They are not constrained by huge assets in the hated West . 
It would not be difficult for them to convince ordinary Russians , who have already been primed by today &apos;s xenophobic propaganda , that Tbilisi , Sevastopol , Astana , and Tallinn belong to Russia and should be taken by force . 
Putin once said that &quot; the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century was the fall of the Soviet Union . &quot; 
The national kleptocrats may soon start calling for its reversal , and they are in an increasingly strong position to do so .
