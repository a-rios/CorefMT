History , Used and Abused 
LONDON - In her brilliant book , &quot; The Uses and Abuses of History &quot; the historian Margaret Macmillan tells a story about two Americans discussing the atrocities of September 11 , 2001 . 
One draws an analogy with Pearl Harbor , Japan &apos;s attack on the US in 1941 . 
His friend has no idea as to what this means . &quot; You know , &quot; the first man replies , &quot; It was when the Vietnamese bombed the American fleet and started the Vietnam War . &quot; 
Historical memory is not always quite as bad as this . But international politics and diplomacy are riddled with examples of bad and ill-considered precedents being used to justify foreign policy decisions , invariably leading to catastrophe . 
Munich - the 1938 meeting between Adolf Hitler , Ã‰douard Daladier , Neville Chamberlain , and Benito Mussolini - is a frequent witness summoned to court by politicians trying to argue the case for foreign adventures . 
Britain &apos;s disastrous 1956 invasion of Egypt was talked about as though Gamal Nasser was a throw-back to the fascist dictators of the 1930 &quot; s . 
If he were to be appeased as they had been , the results would be catastrophic in the Middle East . 
Munich was also produced as a justification for the Vietnam War and President Bush &apos;s war of choice in Iraq . 
1930 &quot; s appeasement - a word that elides diplomatic engagement and the rejection of military options - was said to remind us of what would happen if South Vietnam was not defended and Iraq not invaded . We know what happened in both countries . 
But analogies are not always wrong , and those that were wrong in the past could prove correct today . One of the arguments for the Vietnam War was the so-called domino theory . If South Vietnam was to fall to the Communists , other countries in South-East Asia would tumble before Communist insurgency . 
Things turned out very different . 
Vietnam proved to be the end not the beginning of the line . 
Pol Pot &apos;s wicked regime murdered millions in Cambodia until Vietnam intervened . 
Elsewhere in the region capitalism , promoted by the opening of markets , triggered growth and promoted stability . 
Globalisation produced its own domino effect . The dominoes toppled ; 
GDP rose ; millions were lifted out of poverty ; literacy rates soared ; child mortality figures fell . 
Maybe , if not there and if not then , dominoes are more relevant to foreign and security policy today . 
In America and Europe at the moment , many people are calling for the withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan . 
We are told that NATO and the West cannot build a nation there and that the goals that have been set for establishing democracy and prosperity are unattainable . 
NATO soldiers die in vain . 
Sooner or later the Taliban will sweep to power again , at liberty as happened before to throw acid in women &apos;s faces . 
It is vanity to think that anything can be done to prevent this . 
Better to cut and run than stay and die , and who is to say that the result will embolden Taliban terrorists ? 
They do not necessarily share the same aims as Al Qaeda . 
There have certainly been mistakes in Afghanistan . 
After the overthrow of the Taliban regime , the West did not commit enough troops to extend the national government in Kabul &apos;s authority over the whole country . 
The Bush administration had turned its attention to the preparations for the Iraq war . 
Development has been slow . 
The build-up of the Afghan army and police has lagged . The poppy crop has grown . 
Sometimes the military response to insurgency has been too tough ; sometimes too light . 
The West has courted trouble in appearing to isolate the Pashtun . 
So the West can do better . 
There is no doubt about that . 
But the case for quitting is bad and touches on Pakistan &apos;s future as well as Afghanistan &apos;s . 
Leave Afghanistan to the Taliban , hoping against hope that they will become better-behaved global citizens , and what is the effect likely to be on Pakistan ? 
Here come the dominoes - wrong in Vietnam but not necessarily in the South Asian sub-continent . 
Afghanistan is NATO &apos;s great test . 
The Alliance has promised to see the job through . So if it abandons the job now , leaving the country to poverty , prejudice , and poppies , what then will happen ? 
Why should anyone in Pakistan believe that the West is serious in wanting to sustain that country as a Muslim democratic state ? 
Would such a decision help turn the tide against the Taliban ? 
Would it encourage the middle-class professional and urban workers in Pakistan , disgusted by the excesses of the extremists , to dig in and see off fundamentalism ? 
Would it strengthen the more moderate elements in politics and the military ? 
You can count on us , the West would be saying , but don &apos;t look next door to Afghanistan , where you will see that you can &apos;t rely on us . 
If Pakistan , nuclear weapons and all , was to fall to the extremists , the consequences in terms of encouraging the export of terrorism would be dire . 
Think about Kashmir . Think about India . 
How would India &apos;s government view the future if Pakistan falls into the hands of fundamentalists ? 
So the West should see the job through in Afghanistan - do it better but do it . Sometimes the dominoes do topple over , one by one . 
That is not a prospect that anyone should welcome in South Asia .
