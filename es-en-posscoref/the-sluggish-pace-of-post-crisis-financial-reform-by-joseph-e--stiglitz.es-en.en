Five Years in Limbo 
NEW YORK - When the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 , triggering the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression , a broad consensus about what caused the crisis seemed to emerge . 
A bloated and dysfunctional financial system had misallocated capital and , rather than managing risk , had actually created it . 
Financial deregulation - together with easy money - had contributed to excessive risk-taking . 
Monetary policy would be relatively ineffective in reviving the economy , even if still-easier money might prevent the financial system &apos;s total collapse . 
Thus , greater reliance on fiscal policy - increased government spending - would be necessary . 
Five years later , while some are congratulating themselves on avoiding another depression , no one in Europe or the United States can claim that prosperity has returned . 
The European Union is just emerging from a double-dip ( and in some countries a triple-dip ) recession , and some member states are in depression . 
In many EU countries , GDP remains lower , or insignificantly above , pre-recession levels . 
Almost 27 million Europeans are unemployed . 
Similarly , 22 million Americans who would like a full-time job cannot find one . 
Labor-force participation in the US has fallen to levels not seen since women began entering the labor market in large numbers . 
Most Americans &quot; income and wealth are below their levels long before the crisis . 
Indeed , a typical full-time male worker &apos;s income is lower than it has been in more than four decades . 
Yes , we have done some things to improve financial markets . 
There have been some increases in capital requirements - but far short of what is needed . 
Some of the risky derivatives - the financial weapons of mass destruction - have been put on exchanges , increasing their transparency and reducing systemic risk ; but large volumes continue to be traded in murky over-the-counter markets , which means that we have little knowledge about some of our largest financial institutions &quot; risk exposure . 
Likewise , some of the predatory and discriminatory lending and abusive credit-card practices have been curbed ; but equally exploitive practices continue . 
The working poor still are too often exploited by usurious payday loans . 
Market-dominant banks still extract hefty fees on debit- and credit-card transactions from merchants , who are forced to pay a multiple of what a truly competitive market would bear . 
These are , quite simply , taxes , with the revenues enriching private coffers rather than serving public purposes . 
Other problems have gone unaddressed - and some have worsened . 
America &apos;s mortgage market remains on life-support : the government now underwrites more than 90 % of all mortgages , and President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has not even proposed a new system that would ensure responsible lending at competitive terms . 
The financial system has become even more concentrated , exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big , too interconnected , and too correlated to fail , but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable . 
Despite scandal after scandal , from money laundering and market manipulation to racial discrimination in lending and illegal foreclosures , no senior official has been held accountable ; when financial penalties have been imposed , they have been far smaller than they should be , lest systemically important institutions be jeopardized . 
The credit ratings agencies have been held accountable in two private suits . 
But here , too , what they have paid is but a fraction of the losses that their actions caused . 
More important , the underlying problem - a perverse incentive system whereby they are paid by the firms that they rate - has yet to change . 
Bankers boast of having paid back in full the government bailout funds that they received when the crisis erupted . 
But they never seem to mention that anyone who got huge government loans with near-zero interest rates could have made billions simply by lending that money back to the government . 
Nor do they mention the costs imposed on the rest of the economy - a cumulative output loss in Europe and the US that is well in excess of $ 5 trillion . 
Meanwhile , those who argued that monetary policy would not suffice turned out to have been right . 
Yes , we were all Keynesians - but all too briefly . 
Fiscal stimulus was replaced by austerity , with predictable - and predicted - adverse effects on economic performance . 
Some in Europe are pleased that the economy may have bottomed out . 
With a return to output growth , the recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction - is officially over . 
But , in any meaningful sense , an economy in which most people &apos;s incomes are below their pre-2008 levels is still in recession . 
And an economy in which 25 % of workers ( and 50 % of young people ) are unemployed - as is the case in Greece and Spain - is still in depression . 
Austerity has failed , and there is no prospect of a return to full employment any time soon ( not surprisingly , prospects for America , with its milder version of austerity , are better ) . 
The financial system may be more stable than it was five years ago , but that is a low bar - back then , it was teetering on the edge of a precipice . 
Those in government and the financial sector who congratulate themselves on banks &quot; return to profitability and mild - though hard-won - regulatory improvements should focus on what still needs to be done . 
The glass is , at most , only one-quarter full ; for most people , it is three-quarters empty .
