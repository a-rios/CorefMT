America &apos;s Flawed Election 
PRINCETON - No doubt many people around the world , if not most , breathed a sigh of relief over the re-election of US President Barack Obama . 
A BBC World service poll of 21 countries found a strong preference for Obama everywhere except Pakistan . 
Joy over the election &apos;s outcome , however , should not blind us to its failure to meet a series of ethical benchmarks for democratic choice . 
According to the US-based Center for Responsive Politics , spending on the election - for President and Congress , and including spending by outside groups as well as by the candidates and their political parties - is estimated to have exceeded $ 6 billion . 
That makes the 2012 US election the most expensive ever held . 
The bulk of this spending is just the two opposing parties canceling each other out . 
This benefits advertising agencies and the media , but no one else , and surely not the parties themselves , or the viewers who are bombarded with ads , especially if they happen to live in hotly contested swing states . 
It is difficult to believe that , say , $ 200 million would not have been enough to inform the electorate adequately of the candidates &quot; policies . 
In this scenario , spending limits would have saved about $ 5.8 billion . 
And , if such limits were combined with public financing of election campaigns , they would also help the election to meet an important ethical standard by denying the rich a disproportionate influence on outcomes , and hence on the subsequent actions of the president and Congress . 
No one really expects political advertising to provide citizens with the information they need to assess the candidates &quot; merits properly . 
For the presidential election , however , the practice of holding three televised debates between the two major parties &quot; candidates should be an opportunity for a thorough airing of those issues . 
Unfortunately , the most recent debates failed to achieve that goal . 
Consider , for example , the final debate in October , which was supposed to focus on foreign policy . 
The US may no longer be the world &apos;s undisputed leader , as it was in the decade following the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , but it nonetheless has a vital role to play in international affairs . 
Obama referred to the US as &quot; the indispensable nation , &quot; and that description still holds true , in part because US military spending exceeds that of the next nine countries combined - five times more than China , the world &apos;s second-largest military spender . 
There was , however , no serious discussion of the conditions under which it would be right to use that military might . 
Both candidates indicated that they did not favor military intervention to prevent the Syrian government from killing more of its citizens ; but , neither was prepared to say when they would be prepared to accept the responsibility to protect citizens who come under attack from their own government , or from forces that their government is unwilling or unable to restrain . 
Both candidates said that they would support Israel and not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons , but there was no discussion of solutions to the Israel-Palestine conflict , or of the grounds on which countries that possess nuclear weapons might be justified to use force to prevent others from developing them . 
Indeed , what was not discussed in the candidates &quot; debate on foreign policy was more significant than what was . 
All of the discussion focused on the region that stretches from Libya to Iran . 
China was mentioned only in terms of its supposed &quot; cheating &quot; on trade and currency matters . 
Issues like the eurozone &apos;s troubles and relations with Russia received no attention at all . 
Needless to say , neither candidate thought it worthwhile to put forward a proposal to assist the more than one billion people living in extreme poverty . 
The gravest omission was climate change . 
The closest Obama got to it during a debate was to talk about &quot; energy independence , &quot; which implies not being reliant on oil from the Middle East . 
That , obviously , is something that every patriotic American wants . 
Obama also mentioned that he had raised fuel-economy standards for cars in the US , and had invested in renewable energy sources , like solar and wind power . 
But , when Romney talked about increasing coal production , Obama neglected to point out that carbon dioxide from coal-fired electricity generation is already a major contributor to climate change ; that we still lack the technology to produce &quot; clean coal &quot; ; and that increasing the use of coal will impose huge burdens on people worldwide . 
It took the devastation of Hurricane Sandy to get the president to mention climate change . 
After that , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he was endorsing Obama , because his policies were better on climate change . 
In response , Obama acknowledged that climate change is &quot; a threat to our children &apos;s future , and we owe it to them to do something about it . &quot; 
Now that he has been re-elected , the question is whether he will pay that debt to our children and to the generations that follow them .
