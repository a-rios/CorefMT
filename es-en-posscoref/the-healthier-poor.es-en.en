The Healthier Poor 
Life expectancy in the world &apos;s high-income countries is now 78 years , while it is only 51 years in the least-developed countries , and as low as 40 years in some AIDS-ridden African countries . 
For every 1,000 children born in rich countries , seven die before their fifth birthday ; for every 1,000 births in the poorest countries , 155 children die before their fifth birthday . 
These deaths are not only human tragedies , but also calamities for economic development , systematically reducing economic growth and helping to keep the poorest countries trapped in poverty . 
But a growing number of programs around the world are proving that the death and illness of the poor can be reduced sharply and rapidly with targeted investments in public health programs . 
Big victories in recent years have come through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . 
The Fund , established six years ago , has provided financing to more than 130 countries to scale up their programs against these three killer diseases . 
Since then , Global Fund programs have helped roughly one million Africans to receive anti-retroviral medicines to treat AIDS , financed the distribution of around 30 million bed nets to combat malaria , and supported treatment of around two million people with TB . 
Malaria can be brought under decisive control through bed nets , indoor spraying of insecticides , and making medicines freely available to poor people in malaria-prone villages . 
In just two days last year , Kenya &apos;s government distributed more than two million bed nets . 
Similar mass distribution programs have been implemented in Ethiopia , Rwanda , Togo , Niger , Ghana , and other places . 
The results are amazing . 
The poor use the bed nets effectively , and the burden of malaria comes down rapidly . 
Likewise , a campaign led by Rotary International and several partners has nearly eradicated polio . 
The number of cases worldwide each year is now in the hundreds , compared to many tens of thousands when the campaign began . 
Success is being achieved in even the most remote and difficult places , such as the poverty-stricken states of northern India . 
Indeed , India is doing much more with its remarkable National Rural Health Mission ( NRHM ) , which is the single largest mobilization of public health measures in the world . 
An astounding half-million young woman have recently been hired as health workers to link impoverished households and public clinics and hospitals , which are being improved , and to increase women &apos;s access to emergency obstetrical care in order to avoid tragic and unnecessary deaths in childbirth . 
Another remarkable success in India is the safe home-care of newborn infants in the first few days of life . 
Currently , an alarming number of newborns die because of infection , mothers &quot; failure to breastfeed during the first days , or other preventable causes . 
By training community health workers , the NRHM has achieved a marked reduction in newborn deaths in Indian villages . 
All these programs refute three widely held myths . 
The first is that the burden of disease among the poor is somehow inevitable and unavoidable , as if the poor are bound to get sick and die prematurely . 
In fact , the poor die of known and identifiable causes that are largely preventable and treatable at very low cost . 
There is no excuse for millions of deaths from malaria , AIDS , TB , polio , measles , diarrhea , or respiratory infections , or for so many women and infants to die in or after childbirth . 
The second myth is that aid from rich countries is inevitably wasted . 
This fallacy is repeated so often by ignorant leaders in rich countries that it has become a major barrier to progress . 
The rich like to blame the poor , partly because it lets them off the hook , and partly because it gives them a feeling of moral superiority . 
But poor countries are capable of establishing effective public health programs rapidly when they are helped . 
Recent success stories have been made possible through a combination of increased spending from poor countries &quot; budgets , supplemented by aid from rich-country donors . 
The third myth is that saving the poor will worsen the population explosion . 
But households in the least-developed countries have many children - an average of five per woman - partly because fear of high childhood death rates leads them to overcompensate with large families . 
When childhood death rates come down , fertility rates tend to decline even more , since families are now confident that their children will survive . 
The result is slower population growth . 
It is time to make good on a basic global commitment - that everybody , poor and rich alike - should have access to basic health services . 
If just 0.1 % of rich-world income were devoted to life-saving health care for the poor , it would be possible to raise life expectancy , decrease child mortality , save mothers in childbirth , slow population growth , and spur economic development throughout the poor world . 
The success stories in public health for the poor are multiplying . 
Given the low cost and the huge benefits of supporting such efforts , there is no excuse for inaction .
