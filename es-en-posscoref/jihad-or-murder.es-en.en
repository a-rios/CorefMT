Jihad or Murder ? 
It is remarkable that some of the most critical concepts of Muslim religious terminology have now become part of the international language of current affairs . 
Questions drawn from Islamic theology are discussed freely by the world public , engaging specialists and non-specialists , Muslims and non-Muslims . 
Theological disputation has moved far from Islam &apos;s religious academies . 
For example , the term jihad , commonly translated as &quot; holy war , &quot; has become nearly ubiquitous . 
Though conceived in early Muslim history as a means of spreading God &apos;s word , Muslim scholars today distinguish between two kinds of jihad - one being an internal struggle against temptation , and the other a physical conflict against an aggressor who threatens the survival or the fundamental rights of a Muslim community . 
In this context , there is widespread rejection of the fundamentalists &quot; use of the term . 
Numerous Muslim scholars have raised their voices to challenge the terrorists &quot; defense of suicide bombings or attacks on civilians , offering long citations from centuries of religious jurisprudence . 
In itself , this approach represents a worthy expression of collective conscience in opposition to the terrorists . 
But many among the public and in the media want more . 
Muslim intellectuals are being encouraged to press the religious argument against fundamentalist violence in order to deprive the terrorists of their most fearsome and potent arguments . 
If Muslim scholars can somehow disprove these arguments , it is thought , then the terrorists &quot; ability to sustain their violent underground will be reduced . 
Is this right ? 
A quick survey of the history of religious conflict shows that theological controversies have never been resolved by theological arguments . 
Looking more closely , one finds that while these controversies were often framed in religious terms , they were not at all about religion . 
The range of opposing interpretations of religious texts is virtually unlimited , and disputes are seldom resolved by rational argument . 
In earlier times , such controversies were decided by political authorities , which used military force to impose one particular point of view at the expense of all others . 
Muslim history is full of such cases . 
Recently , when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , he found scholars who raised theological arguments on his behalf . 
The coalition confronting him had no difficulty finding religious arguments that led to precisely the opposite conclusion . 
Today , it is clear that fundamentalists and their supporters are completely closed off to even the most elaborate theological refutation of their views , even when produced by distinguished religious authorities . 
The first reflex of the fundamentalists is to withdraw from the mainstream , to build around themselves a shell that is impervious to any logic other than their own . 
The most essential questions that humans face today - those that engender the deepest conflicts - have nothing to do with theology . 
They concern disputes over territory , political power , definitions of rights , and distribution of wealth . 
The means of discussing these questions is known to all and is expressed in all religions and all languages . 
The evils most deeply resented - in all societies - are injustice , despotism , corruption , and poverty . 
We all understand what these mean , and how certain people must live with them on a daily basis . 
Why , then , do we follow the fundamentalists to the very heart of their madness ? 
Allowing them to frame these problems in religious terms legitimizes the perspective that they are attempting to impose , particularly in their own societies.It also allows them to camouflage their very worldly thirst for power . 
Repeatedly , the Muslim religious establishment has been urged to issue statements denying fundamentalists the right to use religious terms like jihad . 
But experience has proven that this approach leads nowhere . 
In fact , debates about the use of religious terms lend credibility to fundamentalist efforts to apply these ideas to conditions in the modern world . 
Such debates concede that these religious concepts are generally valid , even when , as in the fundamentalists &quot; case , they simply do not apply . 
As a result , the entire discussion could easily backfire . 
Invariably , fundamentalists dismiss religious critiques of their views as evidence that religious authorities have been corrupted by hostile influences . 
In this way , the terrorists oppose the &quot; purity &quot; and &quot; authenticity &quot; of their arguments to the compromises presumably forced upon religious establishments . 
Speaking to Muslims exclusively in their own religious terms also excludes them from broad ethical frameworks that defend essential human values , most notably the protection of innocent civilians . 
These values are the foundation upon which all religious and cultural traditions rest . 
To be sure , it is important to understand the discourse of those who are making war on societies - their own societies first and foremost . 
But adopting the terrorists &quot; interpretation of events conceals the reality of this conflict . 
Instead of fighting on behalf of political and religious liberty , we risk engaging in a conflict with the false images that the terrorists have created . 
Worse still , we would bring this conflict into our own societies , where different religious and cultural traditions are now inextricably mingled . 
There is simply no need to look to theology to call a crime by its proper name . 
The revulsion provoked by the murder of innocents is deeply felt by all , and it is reprehensible by any standard , religious or not . 
It may even be that religious language does not adequately express the repulsion we all feel toward the terrorists &quot; actions . 
No feeling of victimhood can justify , under any conditions , such crimes against innocents , and no theology can accept the negation of the human essence that we all share .
