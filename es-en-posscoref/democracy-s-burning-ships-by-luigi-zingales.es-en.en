Democracy &apos;s Burning Ships 
CHICAGO - Since the late 1970 &quot; s , the academic diffusion of game theory has led macroeconomists to emphasize the importance of &quot; commitment , &quot; a strategy that aims to enhance long-term economic outcomes by restricting policymakers &quot; discretion . 
The idea seems counterintuitive : How can less produce more ? 
While not historically accurate , one of the best examples of a strategic commitment is provided by the legend of Hernán Cortés , according to which , in his quest to conquer Mexico , he decided to burn the ships that had brought his expedition from Spain . 
At first , this might seem like a crazy move : Why intentionally destroy the only possible way out in case of defeat ? 
Cortes allegedly did it to motivate his troops . 
With no escape route , soldiers were highly motivated to win . 
Alexander the Great is said to have done something similar when conquering Persia . 
To produce its benefit , a commitment strategy should be credible - that is , it cannot be reversed quickly . 
In this sense , Cortés &apos;s strategy was perfect : in case of defeat , the Spanish would have no time to rebuild the burned ships . 
To work properly , a commitment strategy should also be costly in case of failure : had Cortés lost , no Spanish soldier would have escaped alive . 
It is precisely this cost that helped motivate his soldiers . 
The problem is that we are bound to hear about only the successful historical examples of such a strategy . 
Had Cortés &apos;s strategy failed , he would have gone down in history - if he was remembered at all - as an arrogant fool who thought that he could defeat a great empire . 
One of the earliest applications of this strategy to economic policy is in the design of central banks . 
Monetary policymakers , the argument goes , should be independent from the political system , because , when elections near , politicians will likely pressure them to &quot; buy &quot; temporarily higher employment at the cost of permanently higher inflation . 
To prevent this inefficient trade off , governments should tie central bankers &quot; hands by insulating them from political influence . 
Many macroeconomists attribute the sustained decline in inflation since the early 1980 &quot; s to the widespread use of this strategy . 
And , encouraged by its success , policymakers started applying it elsewhere . 
Financial liberalization was sold as a commitment to follow market-friendly policies . 
If a future government deviated from the policy , capital flight would bring it to its knees . 
The same applies to extensive government borrowing from abroad , to currency boards , even to currency unions . 
The creation of the euro is nothing but an extreme form of commitment : European governments tried to lash themselves to the German mast of fiscal discipline . 
The diffusion of these mechanisms raises the issue of democracy . 
When Cortés allegedly burned the Spanish ships , he did not take a poll . 
Had he done so , he might have won ( the strategy was clever ) , but it was not a foregone conclusion . 
But even if the commitment strategy produced beneficial incentives , it might not have been worth the risk . 
Perhaps Cortés , blinded by his dreams of glory , was ready to sacrifice his troops even when the odds of victory were too slim . 
Nowadays , fortunately , democratically elected governments make these decisions , which thus should reflect the people &apos;s will . 
Yet , given their nature , these decisions deserve special scrutiny . 
After all , they are - by design - irreversible decisions that tie the hands of future governments , which makes them tantamount to constitutional norms . 
As such , they should not be subject to the same approval process as normal legislation . 
This problem is particularly severe when the up-front action that seals the commitment has short-term benefits that are more attractive than burning the ship . 
When a government starts to borrow abroad or chooses to enter a currency union , these benefits take the form of reduced interest rates . 
Thus , the immediate benefits become more politically salient than potential future costs . 
By using this strategy , a Machiavellian government can induce a reluctant electorate to accept a policy that is contrary to its will . 
Many people would say that this is exactly the point . 
For southern European countries , joining the euro was - explicitly or implicitly - a way to force their citizens to accept a degree of fiscal discipline that they were incapable of adopting on their own . 
I fear that the latter is true - hence the growing resentment against the European Union . 
To add insult to injury , current European leaders do not &quot; own &quot; their past decisions . 
They do not admit that they or their predecessors are the ones who burned the ships . 
They blame Europe . 
The result is that the euro , sold as a way to integrate Europe further , is tearing it apart .
