Don &apos;t Lend to Your Euro Friends 
MUNICH - After months of games and brinkmanship , and only a week after Greek voters rejected the conditions for a € 7.5 billion ( $ 8.2 billion ) rescue package , the end came swiftly . 
The eurozone &apos;s political leaders agreed to start negotiations on a much larger package , worth € 86 billion , almost half of Greece &apos;s GDP . 
Unfortunately , the deal reveals Europe &apos;s apparent determination to reenact the same tragedy in the future . 
Over the past five years , a whopping € 344 billion has flowed from official creditors like the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund into the coffers of the Greek government and the country &apos;s commercial banks . 
Although the European Financial Stability Facility had officially declared Greece bankrupt on July 3 , the eurozone &apos;s leaders kicked the insolvency can down the road yet again . 
The latest agreement did halt , or at least interrupt , the eurozone &apos;s biggest crisis to date , culminating in an unprecedented period of antipathy , opprobrium , humiliation , pestering , and blackmail within Europe . 
Indeed , Greece came within a hair &apos;s breadth of leaving the eurozone . 
Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis revealed that after taking office , he assembled a group , with the consent of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras , that met in secret to prepare the introduction of a parallel currency and the takeover of Greece &apos;s central bank - effectively an exit ( or &quot; Grexit &quot; ) from the eurozone . 
Germany &apos;s government also was ready to accept what appeared to be the inevitable . 
Had French President François Hollande not advised Greece behind German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s back about how to negotiate , events could have taken an entirely different course . 
The bitter dispute within the Eurogroup ( comprising the eurozone countries &quot; finance ministers ) not only strained relations among the monetary union &apos;s members , but also fueled tensions within national governments . 
Many European leaders are still smarting and licking their wounds . 
The spat resulted from an attempt to set politics above the laws of economics . 
The dogma of European policymakers &quot; infallibility and the irrevocability of every step toward integration collided with reality . 
Europe will face many such conflicts in the future if it continues to apply the same approach to its debt problems that it used in the Greek case . 
The fundamental error occurred in April and May 2010 , when official lenders - in the form of other eurozone member states - replaced Greece &apos;s private creditors . 
That arrangement was proposed by then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet , in clear breach of the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s no-bailout rule , which had been Germany &apos;s fundamental condition for giving up the Deutschmark . 
Christine Lagarde , the French finance minister at the time , said , &quot; We violated all the rules because we wanted to close ranks and really rescue the eurozone . &quot; 
The rules were indeed violated , but whether the bailout decision rescued the euro remains to be seen . 
It certainly rescued many commercial banks , whose exposure toward the Greek state was substantial by the first quarter of 2010 . 
Greek banks had lent most to the Greek government ( € 29 billion ) , followed by French banks ( € 20 billion ) , German banks ( € 17 billion ) , and US banks ( € 4 billion ) . 
The bailout also rescued the ECB , insofar as the fiscal credit replaced some of the Bank &apos;s Target credit that had built up from the beginning of 2008 . 
At that time , the Greek economy confronted a sudden stop of private capital inflows , and the Greek central bank financed the country &apos;s entire current-account deficit with additional refinancing credit from its local electronic printing press . 
But rescuing banks is not the same as rescuing the euro . 
Moreover , rescuing the euro is not the same as rescuing the European project . 
The bailout decision in 2010 transformed a normal commercial dispute between creditors and debtors - one that always arises when debtors fail to repay - into a dispute among sovereign states . 
This whipped up animosity among Europe &apos;s peoples and provided ammunition for radical parties of all stripes , severely damaging the European integration process . 
Without the socialization of debt provided by the rescue packages , Varoufakis , or whoever led Greece &apos;s finance ministry , would have had to declare insolvency and then confront private creditors from a variety of countries . 
These countries &quot; governments would then have felt compelled to rescue tottering banks with their taxpayers &quot; money . 
To be sure , rescuing local banks would have been no walk in the park . 
In 2008 , Germany rescued Hypo Real Estate , and in 2011 Belgium , France , and Luxembourg bailed out Dexia Bank . 
As these cases suggest , cleaning one &apos;s own porch could have been done without much of a fuss , or at least without stoking international tension . 
Banks and their media enablers always predict disaster when write-offs loom . 
But the more than 180 sovereign defaults that have occurred since 1945 did not push the defaulters off a cliff . 
Instead , as a rule , they gained a fresh start . 
In fact , the dangers that are now facing Europe as a result of socializing debts are far greater than those posed by a mere potential financial crisis . 
The lesson to be drawn from the Greek debacle is that the eurozone must develop sovereign insolvency procedures as quickly as possible , thereby preventing other sovereigns from becoming creditors through debt mutualization . 
If the European Union &apos;s national governments want to help one another in a crisis , they should unilaterally provide humanitarian aid , without conditionality and without redemption . 
If you lend to your friend , he will no longer be your friend . 
Unless that wisdom is heeded , it will be impossible to hold Europe together .
