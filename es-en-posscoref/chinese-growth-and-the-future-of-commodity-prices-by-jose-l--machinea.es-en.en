Is China Enough ? 
BUENOS AIRES â€’ For many countries in Latin America , demand from China has been essential to maintaining high GDP growth rates over the last decade . 
During the last two decades , four factors combined to generate a sharp increase in world demand for commodities : rapid growth in global GDP , increasing urbanization in developing countries , a rise in population at a rate of 800 million people per decade , and a significant decrease in poverty . 
With the exception of global population growth , China has been the most dynamic country in all of these respects . 
For example , the number of Chinese living in poverty fell by 650 million over the last two decades . 
Moreover , China accounts for half of the global increase of 1.5 billion people earning between $ 2-13 a day in the past 20 years . 
But should we expect what happened from 1990 to 2010 to continue in the coming decades ? 
To answer that question , several variables must be taken into account : demand growth , technological change , investment , and the commitment to confront global warming , among others . 
Bearing in mind such complexity , let &apos;s consider only some determinants of demand that are linked to increased income . 
Two factors appear to be the most important : China &apos;s growth rate in the coming years , and whether its growth will be sufficient to maintain high levels of global demand for commodities . 
Even if it is , the impact is likely to be different for agricultural exporters ( the members of Mercosur and some Central American countries ) than for exporters of minerals and oil ( Mexico and other South American countries ) . 
Moreover , although fiscal and monetary stimulus in China can compensate in the short term for weaker export demand , this will not be enough to sustain demand growth without economic &quot; normalization &quot; in the developed countries . 
As we know , this is far from assured in Europe ; nor is it evident in the United States and Japan - that is , countries that account for roughly 45 % of Chinese exports . 
In the medium and longer term , the expected and hoped-for increase in China &apos;s domestic consumption should be the most dynamic element of demand , with export growth continuing to slacken and investment remaining - except for brief periods - below 50 % of GDP . 
This is not guaranteed , however , as progress in establishing social insurance - crucial to increasing consumption - has been relatively slow , while monetary transfers to families ( such as those that have been implemented in Brazil , Mexico , and elsewhere in Latin America ) might not be feasible , given the logic of China &apos;s political system . 
Even if China sustains rapid growth , it is unlikely to repeat in the next 20 years the extraordinary decrease in poverty witnessed in recent decades . 
The reason is simple : of the 400 million people living on two dollars a day in 2008 , it is possible that &quot; only &quot; 300 million remain . 
Moreover , the rate of China &apos;s population growth is close to zero , and will turn negative before 2025 . 
As a result , fewer people will cross the poverty line , although more will see their daily earnings grow from two dollars to five , and from five dollars to ten . 
That trend will have a differentiated effect on demand for cereals and soy relative to other products that are more closely linked to higher incomes , such as foods containing higher-quality protein , metals , and oil . 
In terms of the latter products , China might continue to be decisive for global demand growth . 
This is why , in order to maintain food prices in the medium term , other countries or regions will need to start reducing poverty at rates similar to that of China in the recent past . 
Bearing in mind the differences in their productive structures , sub-Saharan Africa and India appear to be the best candidates , given that they accounted for 1.4 billion of the world &apos;s poor in 2008 and 60 % of global population growth . 
Will India and sub-Saharan Africa - which grew at annual rates of 7.3 % and 5 % , respectively , during the last decade - assume the role that China has played in recent years ? 
It seems unlikely , but without them it is difficult to foresee high prices for commodities - and food , in particular - over the next two decades . 
In that case , there will be less time left for the countries that have not taken advantage of the current bonanza to lay the foundations of sustainable growth .
