The Twilight of Pervez Musharraf 
It is said that political power in Pakistan flows from the three A &apos;s : Allah , the Army , and support from America . 
Of the three , it is the army leadership that has the clearest means of ridding the country of Pakistan &apos;s president in uniform , Pervez Musharraf . 
Musharraf hoped to extend his presidency this fall without caving in to opposition demands that he renounce his military position and restore a civilian rival to the post of prime minister . 
Since seizing power following a 1999 coup , Musharraf has survived at least three serious assassination attempts . 
His anti-terrorist partnership with the United States fatally undermined his political alliance with Pakistan &apos;s religious conservatives even before his government stormed Islamabad &apos;s Red Mosque in July , killing more than 100 people . 
The threat of terrorist attacks inside the country will continue to rise . 
Musharraf also has plenty of secular enemies . 
Their anger , inflamed in March when he tried unsuccessfully to sack the Supreme Court &apos;s independent-minded chief justice , rages on . 
The court recently ruled that Nawaz Sharif , who Musharraf unseated eight years ago , must be allowed to return from exile . 
Sharif is planning a grand entrance . 
His &quot; decisive struggle against dictatorship &quot; - and determined opposition to any deal with Bhutto that excludes him - will intensify . 
Musharraf is warning him to remain in London . 
America isn &apos;t happy with Musharraf , either . 
Some in Washington charge that he has done too little to roust al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters from safe havens along the country &apos;s border with Afghanistan . 
His recent flirtation with a plan to bypass Bhutto and declare emergency rule provoked pointed Bush administration criticism . 
But it &apos;s the army that is most likely to eventually decide the fate of his presidency . 
Musharraf &apos;s rule has given the military leadership a strong role in policymaking , but his eight years in office have badly damaged domestic support for the army &apos;s influence within the government . 
Aware of a potential threat from within their ranks , Musharraf has populated his inner circle with relatively junior ( and reliably loyal ) officers . 
As prime minister , she could eventually revisit her deal with Musharraf from a position of strength . 
Military leaders know this , and the threat that they will eventually push him aside will plague his presidency well into next year . 
The army is unlikely to move on Musharraf directly unless subtler methods fail . 
The generals know that another coup would further weaken the military &apos;s popular standing - as well as Pakistan &apos;s relations with the US - at a moment when Bhutto and Sharif have raised expectations at home and abroad for a permanent return to civilian rule . 
But if Musharraf were to refuse to go quietly , the generals could promise him a long list of public corruption charges that he must survive without their protection . 
Musharraf &apos;s presidency won &apos;t survive long without military backing . 
To preserve the appearance that their meddling is benign , senior military officers probably know that they cannot afford to install another general as president . 
Instead , they will most likely support cosmetic political reforms , including a new law that formally separates the roles of army commander and head of state . 
That is the strategy the military adopted in 1988 , following the mysterious plane crash that killed former President ( and General ) Mohammed Zia ul-Haq . 
The army leadership ordered elections , permitted the formation of a civilian government , and then stage-managed the political process from the wings . 
Bhutto , the leader of a secular party that now enjoys substantial support in Washington , would dominate policy planning in the next government at Musharraf &apos;s expense . 
She must build on her domestic support , but she can rely on economic and security cooperation with America to safeguard the country &apos;s stability . 
In addition , the military &apos;s role as guarantor of stability , and its tight control of Pakistan &apos;s nuclear arsenal , the army &apos;s crown jewels , will continue . 
The Bush administration can therefore enthusiastically back a return to civilian rule and claim a much-needed victory for democracy in a Muslim country . 
But Bhutto would inherit Musharraf &apos;s domestic enemies . 
Sharif would fulminate against her every misstep , threats of attack from religious radicals would continue , and the military would safeguard its interests from just off stage . 
Adding to the pressure , America would expect the kind of cooperation in pacifying Pakistan &apos;s tribal areas that Musharraf has proven unable to provide . 
The military will , under any scenario , continue to quell fears of complete political chaos .
