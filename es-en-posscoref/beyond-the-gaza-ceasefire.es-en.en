Beyond the Gaza Ceasefire 
TEL AVIV - Finally , the long-sought truce between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has become a reality . 
Reaching this uneasy state has not been easy . 
For months , wise and responsible people had exhorted Israel to accept the ceasefire that the Hamas leadership in Gaza had proposed . 
&quot; A truce would weaken Palestinian President Abu Mazen , &quot; officials claimed , as if the construction of new Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the refusal to dismantle previous illegal ones had not already weakened him . 
Or they argued that &quot; Hamas does not recognize the state of Israel , &quot; as if other ceasefire agreements with the Arab states and the PLO in the last 60 years had been based on recognition of Israel , rather than on a simple ethical principle that has guided Israel for many years , namely to gain , for us and our enemies , a pause in hostilities . 
In the end , however , logic prevailed over escapism and hesitation , a ceasefire was signed , and we can only regret all the time that was lost and the unnecessary suffering on both sides . 
In this war , which has been going on for nearly a century , it is important to keep one principle in mind : the Palestinians are Israel &apos;s neighbors and will live side by side with Israelis forever . 
Because of this simple fact , the military considerations are very different from those in a conflict between countries that are distant from each other . 
Memories of spilled blood , be it Israeli or Palestinian , remain vivid in the hearts of both peoples . 
An immediate break in the hostilities is therefore more important than a chimerical long-term &quot; capitulation . &quot; 
The launch of five Qassam rockets into Israel five days after the signing of the truce suggests its precariousness . 
So can it last and evolve into something durable ? 
Opponents of the truce predict , - indeed , wish - that it will be short-lived . 
But even skeptics nourish many hopes . 
To be sure , if this new truce is merely technical , if efforts are not made to stabilize and consolidate it , it could become just one another in a long string of bitter episodes . 
But all who had feared a &quot; great Israeli offensive &quot; in Gaza should make every effort to strengthen the truce and create a climate for relaxing tensions that could , with time , lead to a peace agreement with the Palestinian Authority . 
So what should be done to bring this about ? 
Above all , border crossings between Israel and the Palestinian territories should be reopened for the sick , for students , and for families whose members were separated by the blockade . 
Second , a generous ( and , with time , growing ) quota should be set for Palestinian laborers to work in Israel - indeed , they must be allowed to work in the very agricultural centers around Gaza which were the most affected by the rocket attacks . 
Palestinians working in Israel are good for both sides , and better than the foreigners who come from distant lands and live an isolated life in Israel , solitary and under constant threat of expulsion . 
Palestinian workers , who go back home every night , do not become alienated from their normal life . 
Future workers from Gaza , having a moral right to earn their living in Israel , will become natural supporters of the maintenance of the truce . 
Furthermore , past industrial projects that fell victim to the hostilities should be revived and made more legitimate in the eyes of Hamas through the participation of the Arab state . 
The killing by Israel of Hamas terrorists in the West Bank should also be stopped - or at least limited as much as possible - and the Palestinian Authority should be permitted to deal with them in their own way . 
Above all , we must assure that the armistice has its own dynamic . 
In a state of war , people get used to the status quo and cannot imagine anything else . 
But when tensions relax , the idea of taking up arms again becomes painful and unsupportable inasmuch as it means a return to the familiar and terrible experience of suffering . 
So this truce must be seen not as a piece of paper with some legal significance , but as a young plant that needs to be tended to , watered , nursed , and protected , so that it grows into a strong and robust tree that cannot be uprooted with an occasional Qassam rocket or a stray grenade .
