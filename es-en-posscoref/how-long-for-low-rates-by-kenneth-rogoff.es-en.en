How Long for Low Rates ? 
CAMBRIDGE - How long can today &apos;s record-low , major-currency interest rates persist ? 
Ten-year interest rates in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Germany have all been hovering around the once unthinkable 1.5 % mark . 
In Japan , the ten-year rate has drifted to below 0.8 % . 
Global investors are apparently willing to accept these extraordinarily low rates , even though they do not appear to compensate for expected inflation . 
Indeed , the rate on inflation-adjusted US Treasury bills ( so-called &quot; TIPS &quot; ) is now negative up to 15 years . 
Is this extraordinary situation stable ? 
In the very near term , certainly ; indeed , interest rates could still fall further . 
Over the longer term , however , this situation is definitely not stable . 
Three major factors underlie today &apos;s low yields . 
First and foremost , there is the &quot; global savings glut , &quot; an idea popularized by current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in a 2005 speech . 
For various reasons , savers have become ascendant across many regions . 
In Germany and Japan , aging populations need to save for retirement . 
In China , the government holds safe bonds as a hedge against a future banking crisis and , of course , as a byproduct of efforts to stabilize the exchange rate . 
Similar motives dictate reserve accumulation in other emerging markets . 
Finally , oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seek to set aside wealth during the boom years . 
Second , in their efforts to combat the financial crisis , the major central banks have all brought down very short-term policy interest rates to close to zero , with no clear exit in sight . 
In normal times , any effort by a central bank to take short-term interest rates too low for too long will boomerang . 
Short-term market interest rates will fall , but , as investors begin to recognize the ultimate inflationary consequences of very loose monetary policy , longer-term interest rates will rise . 
This has not yet happened , as central banks have been careful to repeat their mantra of low long-term inflation . 
But a third factor has become manifest recently . 
Investors are increasingly wary of a global financial meltdown , most likely emanating from Europe , but with the US fiscal cliff , political instability in the Middle East , and a slowdown in China all coming into play . 
Meltdown fears , even if remote , directly raise the premium that savers are willing to pay for bonds that they perceive as the most reliable , much as the premium for gold rises . 
These same fears are also restraining business investment , which has remained muted , despite extremely low interest rates for many companies . 
It is the combination of all three of these factors that has created a &quot; perfect storm &quot; for super low interest rates . 
Although highly unpredictable , it is easy to imagine how the process could be reversed . 
For starters , the same forces that led to an upward shift in the global savings curve will soon enough begin operating in the other direction . 
Japan , for example , is starting to experience a huge retirement bulge , implying a sharp reduction in savings as the elderly start to draw down lifetime reserves . 
Japan &apos;s past predilection toward saving has long implied a large trade and current-account surplus , but now these surpluses are starting to swing the other way . 
Germany will soon be in the same situation . 
Meanwhile , new energy-extraction technologies , combined with a softer trajectory for global growth , are having a marked impact on commodity prices , cutting deeply into the surpluses of commodity exporters from Argentina to Saudi Arabia . 
Second , many ( if not necessarily all ) central banks will eventually figure out how to generate higher inflation expectations . 
They will be driven to tolerate higher inflation as a means of forcing investors into real assets , to accelerate deleveraging , and as a mechanism for facilitating downward adjustment in real wages and home prices . 
It is nonsense to argue that central banks are impotent and completely unable to raise inflation expectations , no matter how hard they try . 
In the extreme , governments can appoint central bank leaders who have a long-standing record of stating a tolerance for moderate inflation - an exact parallel to the idea of appointing &quot; conservative &quot; central bankers as a means of combating high inflation . 
Third , eventually the clouds over Europe will be resolved , though I admit that this does not seem likely to happen anytime soon . 
Indeed , things will likely get worse before they get better , and it is not at all difficult to imagine a profound restructuring of the eurozone . 
Nevertheless , whichever direction the euro crisis takes , its ultimate resolution will end the extreme existential uncertainty that clouds the outlook today . 
Ultra-low interest rates may persist for some time . 
Certainly Japan &apos;s rates have remained stable at an extraordinarily low level for a considerable period , at times falling further even as it seemed that they could only rise . 
It could unwind remarkably quickly .
