Balancing China &apos;s High Savings 
BEIJING - China &apos;s national savings rate has been very high in recent years , amounting to 52 % of GDP in 2008 ( the most recent year for which statistics are available ) , and is often blamed for today &apos;s global imbalances . 
Countries that save too much export too much , according to conventional wisdom , resulting in high trade surpluses and growing foreign-exchange reserves . 
But this is not always true . 
For instance , if I save $ 100 , but at the same time I invest $ 100 in my factories &quot; fixed assets , I am &quot; balanced domestically &quot; and not running an export surplus with anyone . 
Such an example captures China &apos;s recent economic situation . 
In late 2009 and in early 2010 , China &apos;s savings rate might well have remained at 50 % of GDP had its trade surplus not narrowed significantly compared to previous years . 
Indeed , China recorded a trade deficit in part of this period , as high investment in fixed assets ( owing to government stimulus policies enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis ) fueled domestic demand for goods in the same way that higher consumer spending would . 
Only when a country invests less in fixed assets than the amount that it saves will the &quot; surplus savings &quot; show up in the trade balance . 
The same logic can be applied to the US economy , but in the opposite way : even if the US wants to consume a lot and does not save , it may not run trade deficits if it does not invest much . 
It runs a trade deficit only when it invests a lot while simultaneously not limiting consumption . 
Savings are , of course , no bad thing . 
If Americans and Europeans had saved more , they might not have created the global imbalances that fueled the financial crisis , or the worldwide sovereign-debt problems that have since emerged . 
And savings are particularly good for developing countries . 
One of the most daunting challenges for poor countries is the need to accumulate investment capital under conditions of low savings without incurring too much foreign debt . 
Even for a developing economy with per capita income of $ 3,000 , such as China , building wealth in the middle classes remains a central issue . 
Spurring faster growth of small- and medium-size enterprises through relatively high investment in physical assets and R D programs , improved infrastructure , and more rapid urbanization , all of which require a lot of savings to invest , is vital . 
In any meaningful international comparison , China &apos;s per capita stock of physical capital is still 8-10 times lower than in advanced countries like the United States and Japan . 
Without relatively high savings , a developing country like China may never catch up . 
If a developing country has high savings ( despite efforts to increase current consumption ) as a result of structural factors , the best strategy is not to reduce savings through short-run &quot; external shocks , &quot; such as dramatic exchange-rate appreciation , which may kill export industries overnight . 
Rather , savings should be channeled even more - and more efficiently - to domestic investment in order to avoid large external imbalances . 
For example , China should use its current high savings to build up the country &apos;s infrastructure and speed up urbanization , thereby laying a firmer foundation for future development . 
Savings could remain high , even as current consumption grows slowly , while the trade balance would be held in check by higher demand for imported capital goods . 
Moreover , investment in public infrastructure and urban facilities will not create industrial &quot; over-capacity &quot; ; instead , it will provide long-term public consumption durables that households and companies will use for years to come . 
If China continues on this path , its external surplus will decrease further , other conditions being equal . 
Of course , a country must deal with a savings rate that is &quot; too high &quot; even if it is not necessarily the main cause of external imbalances . 
That is certainly the challenge for China in the long run . 
A savings rate of 50 % of GDP is too high under any circumstances , and household consumption equivalent to 35 % of GDP is too low . 
But this can and should be addressed by domestic policies aimed at bringing about structural change , not by external policies like exchange-rate appreciation . 
Without domestic structural change , currency appreciation would not only undermine exports , but might also decrease imports , owing to higher unemployment and lower income . 
China must recognize that high savings will not provide stable growth over the long run . 
High domestic investment may for the time being prevent &quot; surplus savings &quot; from creating too much upward pressure on the external balance , but , given trends in China &apos;s terms of trade , growth without an increase in domestic consumption is unsustainable over the long run . 
High investment may cause economic overheating and increase the price of capital goods in the medium term , eventually triggering inflation . 
So bringing the savings rate down is necessary if domestic and external balances are to be achieved . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s so-called &quot; export-oriented growth policy &quot; itself may not be wrong for a developing country , because international trade in general creates more jobs and brings more income . 
China has adopted some policies to reduce its trade surplus , such as lowering import tariffs , withdrawing tax rebates for exported goods , and gradual exchange-rate appreciation .
