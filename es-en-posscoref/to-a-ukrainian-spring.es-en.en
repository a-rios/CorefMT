To A Ukrainian Spring 
Every person living in Ukraine is forced to believe in three great falsehoods : the first consists of the assumption that all of today &apos;s humiliating disorders - economic collapse , poverty , unemployment - are natural consequences of our postcommunist transition . 
This is cynical and cruel ; moreover , it is dangerously wrong . 
The truth is that , daily , Ukrainians are deprived by force of much of our national wealth . 
We are deprived of it due to state treachery , illegal agreements , and corrupt and incompetent officials . 
The second falsehood consists of the belief that somebody &quot; out there &quot; will help Ukraine rise to its feet . 
We naively hold our breath waiting for a happy moment when another portion of foreign aid will arrive . 
We must stop believing in imported cures . 
Where is our dignity ? 
We must begin to understand that no one can help Ukraine save we Ukrainians . 
We must apply our own talents and intellect , not wait for handouts from abroad . 
The third falsehood is the fear of instability and social unrest that will supposedly break out if President Kuchma and his cronies lose the upcoming election . 
But instead of unrest , I foresee only celebrations if Kuchma is defeated . 
In any case , instability is unlikely because our state officials , at all levels , will forget about Kuchma the minute the vote-count tolls his defeat . 
They will be too busy thinking about themselves to worry about him or to cause trouble . 
Besides , in civilized countries a change of government is seen as a sign of stability . 
Ukraine needs and is ready for such a sign . 
The parliamentary elections to be held on March 31 st will provide an answer to the main question everyone asks about Ukraine : can we overcome our lack of belief in ourselves , overcome our fears , to win a true democratic independence ? 
If it is to be the latter , it does not matter who the master here is to be : Kuchma , his successor , Russia , or even some other powerful state . 
But Ukrainians now have peaceful and constitutional means to change their country and live their lives without a master . 
To do so , we must unite against the current regime . 
President Kuchma knows perfectly well how little trust the people place in him . 
This is why he refrained from naming the political parties that support him after himself . 
Instead , he set up dozens of parties that aim to elect pro _ Kuchma figures to Parliament by stealth . 
These Kuchma crony parties go under many names : &quot; For a United Ukraine , &quot; the &quot; Social Democratic Party ( United ) &quot; , the &quot; Green Party of Ukraine , &quot; &quot; Women For the Future , &quot; the &quot; Democratic Union , &quot; &quot; New Generation , &quot; the &quot; Team of a Winter Generation &quot; among others . 
Each may sound legitimate and benign , but all stand for the same corrupt system . 
Ukrainians must vote for parties headed by leaders that they know and trust . 
But only half of our parliament , the Verkhovna Rada , is elected from party lists . 
The other half are elected directly in so _ called majority constituencies . 
Here is where many deputies already allied with Kuchma are to be found . 
Ordinary Ukrainians know who they are because their bosses are telling them , even ordering them , to vote for these people . 
Such candidates organize concerts and throw money , medicines , food , cloths , computers , and other goodies around . 
Some have even promised to build gas pipelines . 
My advice to voters is : take everything you are given ! 
These gifts were bought with money taken unjustly from ordinary Ukrainians , so ordinary citizens have a right to them . 
So take these presents , but don &apos;t give your vote in return ! 
If Ukrainians do give these politicians-bearing-gifts their votes , they may continue to receive gifts at the next election , but meanwhile the rulers will keep ruining the country and crippling our souls . 
Only three political forces offer real , viable alternatives to our ruling criminal clans . 
First is Oleksander Moroz &apos;s left-wing bloc . 
Those who favor the Left should support the Moroz bloc instead of the Communists , who are locked in the blind alley of the past . 
The second force is the right centrist party headed by former prime minister Viktor Yushchenko , who was a reform-minded prime minister . 
The third political force is the bloc which I lead . 
These forces will all get into parliament , but the wider their representation , the sooner common sense and justice will prevail here . 
My experience as chairwoman of the Verkhovna Rada Budget Committee and as deputy prime minister in the Yushchenko Cabinet proves that criminal elements here can be brought to heel if the fight against corruption is pursued with vigor and brains ; and that Ukraine can become more powerful and prosperous . 
All that is necessary is for Ukrainian voters to bring to power people devoted to this task . 
In opposing the current regime , we know that we will be exposed to dirt and open slander . 
But this does not matter . 
We are not seeking ostentatious posts and cheap popularity . 
We do not desire artificial recognition or flattering awards . 
We will not timidly look around and lose our way ; we will not turn back . 
We will pursue our goals regardless of where we find may ourselves - in parliament ( supporting the government or in opposition ) , in the presidential palace , or even in prison for our beliefs ( as I found myself not many weeks ago ) . 
Ukrainians need not wait long to improve their lives . 
A &quot; Ukrainian Spring &quot; will surely come if we seize the moment !
