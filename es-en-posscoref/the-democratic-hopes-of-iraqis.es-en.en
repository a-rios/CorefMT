The Democratic Hopes of Iraqis 
The escalating violence in Iraq gives a bleak impression of that country &apos;s prospects . 
Sectarian conflict seems to be increasing on a daily basis , with militias massacring hundreds of Sunnis and Shiites solely on the basis of their religious identities . 
Yet it would be a mistake to think that this bloodlust represents widespread sentiment among Iraqis . 
While neither American nor Iraqi security officials have yet found a way to tame the militias , the Iraqi public is increasingly drawn toward a vision of a democratic , non-sectarian government for the country . 
In 2004 and 2006 , I was involved in conducting two nationwide public opinion surveys in Iraq . 
Contrasting the findings of these surveys demonstrates that over the two years when sectarian violence has increased , Iraqis increasingly view their fate in a national , rather than communal , context . 
Over this period , the number of Iraqis who said that it was &quot; very important &quot; for Iraq to have a democracy increased from 59 % to 65 % . 
These same Iraqis saw a link between an effective democracy and the separation of religion and politics , as under a western system . 
Overall , those who responded that they &quot; strongly agree &quot; that &quot; Iraq would be a better place if religion and politics were separated &quot; increased from 27 % in 2004 to 41 % in 2006 . 
Particularly significant were increases from 24 % to 63 % during this period among Sunnis and from 41 % to 65 % among Kurds . 
Opinion on this question within the majority Shiite community remained stable , with 23 % strongly agreeing in both 2004 and 2006 . 
Similarly , the survey found declining support for an Islamic state . 
Between 2004 and 2006 , the number of Iraqis who said it was &quot; very good to have an Islamic government where religious leaders have absolute power &quot; fell from 30 % to 22 % . 
Declines occurred in all three leading ethnic communities : from 39 % to 35 % among Shiites , from 20 % to 6 % among Sunnis , and from 11 % to 5 % among Kurds . 
There was some increase in the number of Shiites who thought that there should be a strong religious element in national laws , the majority still opposed this . 
Nationalist sentiment is also increasing . 
Asked whether they considered themselves &quot; Iraqis , above all &quot; or &quot; Muslims , above all , &quot; the 2006 survey found that 28 % of Iraqis identified themselves as &quot; Iraqis , above all , &quot; up from 23 % in 2004 . 
In the capital , Baghdad , the center of so much sectarian violence , the numbers were even more impressive , with the share of the population who saw themselves as &quot; Iraqis , above all &quot; doubling , from 30 % to 60 % . 
By contrast , similar surveys in other Arab capitals find a decided tilt toward a Muslim identity . 
In Amman , Jordan , the most recent figure is 12 % who put their national identity ahead of their Muslim identity . 
The figure is 11 % in Cairo , Egypt , and 17 % in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . 
Curiously , in Tehran , Iran , the choice is markedly in favor of Iranian , rather than Muslim , identity . 
Among residents of the Iranian capital , the share of &quot; nationalists &quot; soared from 38 % in 2000 to 59 % in 2005 . 
At the same time , Iraqi attitudes show a strong reaction to daily violence . 
Between 2004 and 2006 , the proportion who strongly agreed that life in Iraq is &quot; unpredictable and dangerous &quot; increased from 46 % to 59 % . 
The change was felt in all communities , rising from 41 % to 48 % among Shiites , from 77 % to 84 % among Sunnis , and from 16 % to 50 % among Kurds . 
At the same time , the surveys found little support among any of these three major groups for sectarian conflict . 
The violence has had a major effect on Iraqi attitudes toward foreigners . 
By 2006 , distrust of Americans , British , and French had reached 90 % , and attitudes toward Iraq &apos;s neighbors were also tense . 
More than half of Iraqis surveyed said that they would not welcome Turks , Jordanians , Iranians , or Kuwaitis as neighbors . 
These feelings , it appears , are directly related to the violence gripping Iraq , and the role of foreigners in the country &apos;s perilous security situation . 
So it appears that Iraqis are showing greater attachment to their national identity and are supportive of a non-sectarian approach to government . 
These are the basic traits of a modern political order . 
Among Sunnis , the decline in support for an Islamic state is most dramatic , and may have significant ramifications for the ability of religious extremists to recruit among them . 
Although Iraqis remain angry about the violence in their country , this anger has not undermined their sense of national identity . 
At the same time , they appear to be holding onto important democratic values . 
The key question , of course , remains whether these values can be translated into a peaceful reality .
