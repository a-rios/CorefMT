Alpha , Beta , and Beyond 
NEW YORK - Even in normal times , individual and institutional investors alike have a hard time figuring out where to invest and in what . 
Should one invest more in advanced or emerging economies ? 
And which ones ? 
How does one decide when , and in what way , to rebalance one &apos;s portfolio ? 
Obviously , these choices become harder still in abnormal times , when major global changes occur and central banks follow unconventional policies . 
But a new , low-cost approach promises to ease the challenge confronting investors in normal and abnormal times alike . 
In the asset management industry , there have traditionally been two types of investment strategies : passive and active . 
The passive approach includes investment in indices that track specific benchmarks , say , the S &amp; P 500 for the United States or an index of advanced economies or emerging-market equities . 
In effect , one buys the index of the market . 
Passivity is a low-cost approach - tracking a benchmark requires no work . 
But it yields only the sum of the good , the bad , and the ugly , because it cannot tell you whether to buy advanced economies or emerging markets , and which countries within each group will do better . 
You invest in a basket of all countries or specific regions , and what you get is referred to as &quot; beta &quot; - the average market return . 
By contrast , the active approach entrusts investment to a professional portfolio manager . 
The idea is that a professional manager who chooses assets and markets in which to invest can outperform the average return of buying the whole market . 
These funds are supposed to get you &quot; alpha &quot; : absolute superior returns , rather than the market &quot; beta . &quot; 
The problems with this approach are many . 
Professionally managed investment funds are expensive , because managers trade a lot and are paid hefty fees . 
Moreover , most active managers - indeed , 95 % of them - underperform their investment benchmarks , and their returns are volatile and risky . 
Moreover , superior investment managers change over time , so that past performance is no guarantee of future performance . 
And some of these managers - like hedge funds - are not available to average investors . 
As a result , actively managed funds typically do worse than passive funds , with returns after fees even lower and riskier . 
Indeed , not only are active &quot; alpha &quot; strategies often worse than beta ones ; some are actually disguised beta strategies ( because they follow market trends ) - just with more leverage and thus more risk and volatility . 
But a third investment approach , known as &quot; smart &quot; ( or &quot; enhanced &quot; ) beta , has become more popular recently . 
Suppose that you could follow quantitative rules that allowed you to weed out the bad apples , say , the countries likely to perform badly and thus have low stock returns over time . 
If you weed out most of the bad and the ugly , you end up picking more of the good apples - and do better than average . 
To keep costs low , smart beta strategies need to be passive . 
Thus , adherence to specific rules replaces an expensive manager in choosing the good apples and avoiding the bad and ugly ones . 
For example , my economic research firm has a quantitative model , updated every three months , that ranks 174 countries on more than 200 economic , financial , political , and other factors to derive a measure or score of these countries &quot; medium-term attractiveness to investors . 
This approach provides strong signals concerning which countries will perform poorly or experience crises and which will achieve superior economic and financial results . 
Weeding out the bad and the ugly based on these scores , and thus picking more of the good apples , has been shown to provide higher returns with lower risk than actively managed alpha or passive beta funds . 
And , as the rankings change over time to reflect countries &quot; improving or worsening fundamentals , the equity markets that &quot; smart beta &quot; investors choose change accordingly . 
With better returns than passive beta funds at a lower cost than actively managed funds , smart beta vehicles are increasingly available and becoming more popular . 
( Full disclosure : my firm , together with a large global financial institution , is launching a series of tradable equity indices for stock markets of advanced economies and emerging markets , using a smart beta approach ) . 
Given that this strategy can be applied to stocks , bonds , currencies , and many other asset classes , smart beta could be the future of asset management . 
Whether one is investing in normal or abnormal times , applying a scientific , low-cost approach to get a basket with a higher-than-average share of good apples does seem like a sensible approach .
