Iran &apos;s Republic of Fear 
WASHINGTON , DC - Iran &apos;s clerical regime governs by a simple formula : he who is the most frightening , wins . 
Indeed , it is a reliable guide to his political philosophy . 
This view was not invented by Khamenei , but rather is drawn from the Koran and the Shiite tradition . 
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard have uniforms bearing a Koranic verse that reads , &quot; Make ready for them whatever force and strings of horses you can , to terrify thereby the enemy of God and your enemy , and others besides them that you know not ; 
God knows them . &quot; 
But cultivating fear in others also makes one more susceptible to fear , and nothing is more frightening to Khamenei and the leaders of the Islamic Republic than the social dynamism unleashed by the democratic movement brewing inside the country . 
The regime seems convinced that there is only a small likelihood of a military attack on its nuclear program . 
It does not believe that sanctions can bring about its collapse . 
Thus , external forces do not appear to pose much of a threat . 
What has shaken the government , and indeed threatens the existence of the ruling Islamic ideology , is the pressure of the Iranian people for human and political rights . 
Hossein Saffar Harandi , a former minister of culture and Islamic guidance , expressed this fear when he said that &quot; citizens who want the government to be accountable before the people ( are ) part of a soft war against the Islamic Republic . &quot; 
For 30 years , the Islamic Republic has relied on the heavy hand of the internal-security apparatus to silence dissidents and critics . 
But , since Iran &apos;s post-election crisis in June , the people have become fearless , and in turn are terrifying the government . 
The extent to which Khamenei fears this social upsurge is stunning . 
He is afraid of the humanities , books , arts , universities , satellites , the Internet , and even mobile phones . 
For him , the state must control public access to global culture and technology . 
If not , these forces will work to undermine the state . 
Unlike the Islamic Republic &apos;s founder , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , Khamenei lacks charisma and deep learning . 
Both his political legitimacy and religious authority are highly questionable , and the street violence and prison brutality of recent months has undermined his authority and shaken his social base . 
Increasingly reliant on the Revolutionary Guard as the bulwark of his regime , Khamenei has cut himself off from the possibility of compromise . 
Khamenei &apos;s foreign policy is now completely subject to how the domestic situation in Iran develops . 
As recent months have shown , he will consider a compromise with the West only when he loses his certainty that all is under control internally . 
It is like a seesaw : Khamenei &apos;s domestic weakness changes the balance of Iran &apos;s foreign policy . 
Thus , initially intimidated by the post-election crisis , the regime acceded to the October 1 proposal in Geneva that would have allowed the controlled enrichment of Iran &apos;s uranium outside the country . 
In November , when the government thought that street brutality had intimidated the protest movement , Iranian officials backed away from the compromise . 
In this sense , the Iranian people can be regarded as a strategic ally of the West , not only because they want democracy at home and peace in the region , but because their continued protests offer the West the most effective leverage against the Islamic Republic &apos;s nuclear program . 
This regime cannot survive in the long term with a political crisis such as the one it now faces . 
Continued crackdowns would result in a military dictatorship , while an accommodation with the protest movement would produce some kind of consensual semi-democratic government . 
In either case , however , the democratic movement would not die . 
It would reemerge continuously , despite heavy repression over short periods of times , raising the kinds of challenges that pose an existential threat to any non-democratic government . 
Support of human rights and democracy in Iran is not only a matter of morality . 
Empowering the Iranian people means weakening Khamenei and his military allies . 
And a weakened Khamenei is more likely to compromise on the nuclear front .
