How Inequality Fueled the Crisis 
CHICAGO - Before the recent financial crisis , politicians on both sides of the aisle in the United States egged on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the giant government-backed mortgage agencies , to support low-income lending in their constituencies . 
There was a deeper concern behind this newly discovered passion for housing for the poor : growing income inequality . 
Since the 1970 &quot; s , wages for workers at the 90th percentile of the wage distribution in the US -such as office managers - have grown much faster than wages for the median worker ( at the 50th percentile ) , such as factory workers and office assistants . 
Perhaps the most important is that technological progress in the US requires the labor force to have ever greater skills . 
A high school diploma was sufficient for office workers 40 years ago , whereas an undergraduate degree is barely sufficient today . 
But the education system has been unable to provide enough of the labor force with the necessary education . 
The reasons range from indifferent nutrition , socialization , and early-childhood learning to dysfunctional primary and secondary schools that leave too many Americans unprepared for college . 
The everyday consequence for the middle class is a stagnant paycheck and growing job insecurity . 
Politicians feel their constituents &quot; pain , but it is hard to improve the quality of education , for improvement requires real and effective policy change in an area where too many vested interests favor the status quo . 
Moreover , any change will require years to take effect , and therefore will not address the electorate &apos;s current anxiety . 
Thus , politicians have looked for other , quicker ways to mollify their constituents . 
We have long understood that it is not income that matters , but consumption . 
A smart or cynical politician would see that if somehow middle-class households &quot; consumption kept up , if they could afford a new car every few years and the occasional exotic holiday , perhaps they would pay less attention to their stagnant paychecks . 
Therefore , the political response to rising inequality - whether carefully planned or the path of least resistance - was to expand lending to households , especially low-income households . 
The benefits - growing consumption and more jobs - were immediate , whereas paying the inevitable bill could be postponed into the future . 
Cynical as it might seem , easy credit has been used throughout history as a palliative by governments that are unable to address the deeper anxieties of the middle class directly . 
Politicians , however , prefer to couch the objective in more uplifting and persuasive terms than that of crassly increasing consumption . 
In the US , the expansion of home ownership - a key element of the American dream - to low- and middle-income households was the defensible linchpin for the broader aims of expanding credit and consumption . 
Why did the US not follow the more direct path of redistribution , of taxing or borrowing and spending on the anxious middle class ? 
Greece , for example , got into trouble doing precisely this , employing many thousands in the government and overpaying them , even while it ran up public debt to astronomical levels . 
In the US , though , there have been strong political forces arrayed against direct redistribution in recent years . 
Directed housing credit was a policy with broader support , because each side thought that it would benefit . 
The left favored flows to their natural constituency , while the right welcomed new property owners who could , perhaps , be convinced to switch party allegiance . 
More low-income housing credit has been one of the few issues on which President Bill Clinton &apos;s administration , with its affordable-housing mandate , and that of President George W. Bush , with its push for an &quot; ownership &quot; society , agreed . 
In the end , though , the misguided attempt to push home ownership through credit has left the US with houses that no one can afford and households drowning in debt . 
Ironically , since 2004 , the homeownership rate has been in decline . 
The problem , as often is the case with government policies , was not intent . 
It rarely is . 
But when lots of easy money pushed by a deep-pocketed government comes into contact with the profit motive of a sophisticated , competitive , and amoral financial sector , matters get taken far beyond the government &apos;s intent . 
This is not , of course , the first time in history that credit expansion has been used to assuage the concerns of a group that is being left behind , nor will it be the last . 
In fact , one does not even need to look outside the US for examples . 
The deregulation and rapid expansion of banking in the US in the early years of the twentieth century was in many ways a response to the Populist movement , backed by small and medium-sized farmers who found themselves falling behind the growing numbers of industrial workers , and demanded easier credit . 
Excessive rural credit was one of the important causes of bank failures during the Great Depression . 
The broader implication is that we need to look beyond greedy bankers and spineless regulators ( and there were plenty of both ) for the root causes of this crisis . 
And the problems are not solved with a financial regulatory bill entrusting more powers to those regulators . 
America needs to tackle inequality at its root , by giving more Americans the ability to compete in the global marketplace . 
This is much harder than doling out credit , but more effective in the long run .
