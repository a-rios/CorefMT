Olympic Gamesmanship 
NEW YORK - China lobbied long and hard to host this summer &apos;s Olympics , and thousands of Chinese literally danced in the streets when the decision was made to award Beijing the games . 
This was to be a chance for the Chinese to show the world just how far they and their country had come . 
I do not know if there is a Mandarin equivalent for &quot; Be careful what you wish for , &quot; but if there is , it surely applies . 
China is getting a great deal of international attention , but not the sort it bargained for . 
On the contrary , China is finding itself under intense international scrutiny for everything from its policy toward Tibet , human rights , and product safety to the level of its currency , its policy in Sudan , and global climate change . What was meant to be a moment of celebration has turned into one of criticism . 
Indeed , it is likely that several prominent world leaders , including British Prime Minster Gordon Brown , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , will not attend the opening ceremonies . 
Several prominent American politicians have voiced support for a boycott . 
Still other heads of state , including French President Sarkozy , are weighing staying away . 
Of course , China merits criticism in many areas of its domestic and foreign policy . 
But snubbing China is misguided . 
It ignores what the country has accomplished , and it risks consequences that are inconsistent with what the critics themselves want to see . 
Some perspective is called for . 
Modern China is only some six decades old . 
Its economic growth has been and is truly astounding . 
Hundreds of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty . 
Indeed , Chinese economic growth must be acknowledged as one of history &apos;s great achievements in poverty reduction . 
China is not simply wealthier ; it is also a far more open place politically than it was during the Mao era . 
Civil society is growing ; there are now more than 300,000 NGOs . Official statistics show that more than 85,000 public protests occurred in 2005 ( and probably more each year since ) over issues such as corruption , public health , the environment , and land use . 
Even the recent earthquake in Sichuan revealed how Chinese politics are changing . 
Cameras were allowed in ; senior officials were seen and heard . 
There are also indications that China &apos;s foreign policy is evolving . 
China has played a helpful role of late in encouraging North Korean cooperation with demands to limit its nuclear capabilities . 
In Sudan , China supported a UN Security Council resolution establishing an international operation and committed 315 engineers to the UN-African Union force . 
None of this excuses or justifies the shortcomings in Chinese behavior at home or abroad , which are many and real . 
But reality is not one-dimensional . 
China is changing , in many ways for the better , and further change in the right direction is not likely to result from a policy of isolating or sanctioning China . 
If we want China to become a full participant , a stakeholder , in the international system , we are more likely to achieve this outcome by integrating China into the world &apos;s institutions . 
The Chinese need to see how they benefit from inclusion - and how they would suffer from not being one of the countries shaping and buttressing today &apos;s international institutions . 
We should seek China &apos;s integration as a matter of self-interest . 
In a globalized world , global challenges largely require global responses , which are impossible if a country of China &apos;s size and population and wealth does not participate . 
Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons , promoting more efficient energy use , taking action on climate change , and maintaining an open global economy - these and other tasks require Chinese participation , even cooperation , if globalization is not to overwhelm us all . 
One useful step on our part would be to end the anachronism of bringing together many of the world &apos;s principal leaders in the annual G-8 meeting of industrialized countries and not including China ( or India or Brazil , for that matter ) as a matter of course . 
But integration will succeed only if China and its leaders are open to it . 
Communism and socialism do not command public support as they once did . 
Materialism and consumerism cannot be a substitute for political and religious freedoms , which remain severely constrained . 
Nationalism can all too easily fill a void . 
This is dangerous , as history demonstrates that leaders who allow or stimulate excessive nationalism can all too easily become trapped by it . 
This argues not simply for keeping nationalism in check , but for allowing greater political and religious freedom so that there are alternative sources of legitimacy and allegiance in Chinese society beyond that of economic advancement . 
This is something that the Chinese will largely have to do by and for themselves . 
Outsiders can and should make their views known , but mostly in private and without saying and doing things likely to stimulate the very nationalism we want to discourage . 
All of which brings us back to this summer &apos;s events in Beijing . 
China needs to show respect for human rights and allow journalists to report . 
Rather than boycott Beijing , the world &apos;s leaders should embrace the Olympics and what they represent . 
The Olympics are a venue in which individuals and countries compete , but in conformity with a set of rules . This is exactly what we want from China in the twenty-first century .
