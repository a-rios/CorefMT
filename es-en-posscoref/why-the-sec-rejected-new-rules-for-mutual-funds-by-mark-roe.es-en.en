Money-Market Resistance 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) recently rejected proposed rules aimed at making money-market funds safer in a financial crisis - a rejection that has caused consternation among observers and other regulators . 
Given the risks that money market funds can pose to the global financial system , as shown by their destabilizing role in the 2008 financial crisis , it is not hard to see why they are worried . 
Money-market funds take excess cash from investors and use it to purchase short-term IOUs from businesses , banks , and other financial institutions . 
They mimic bank accounts by allowing investors to write checks and promise that their investment &apos;s value will not fall . 
In 2012 , American &quot; prime &quot; money-market funds , which buy bank and corporate debt , were worth nearly $ 1.5 trillion . 
The money flowing through these funds went to many of the world &apos;s largest banks , including not just the obvious US suspects ( JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America , and Citi ) , but also major European and Japanese banks such as Barclays , Deutsche Bank , Bank of Tokyo , Sumitomo , Credit Suisse , and ING . 
These six international banks alone accounted for nearly 20 % of the prime money-market funds &quot; value . 
Many readers know how money-market funds work : An investor buys a $ 1.00 share from the XYZ fund , which keeps each share &apos;s value at a constant $ 1.00 , allowing the investor to believe that the money - invested in a pool of safe , secure , but not always government-guaranteed assets - is on deposit . 
Even if the asset pool declines in value , the fund &apos;s managers keep the value of each share at $ 1.00 by rounding upward the fund &apos;s real value . 
If the fund &apos;s losses are big enough that rounding off still leaves it short of a stable $ 1.00 value , the fund &quot; breaks the buck . &quot; 
That happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008 . 
The Reserve Fund , a well-established money-market fund with too many unpaid IOUs from Lehman , could not keep its value steady . 
It broke the buck . 
All money-market funds then became suspect , and many investors fled - withdrawing one-third of a trillion dollars in a single week . 
Since much of the money-market funds &quot; assets are IOUs from the world &apos;s biggest banks , the withdrawals weakened the already-shaky global banking system . 
The Federal Reserve , seeking to stem the growing panic and stabilize the American and international banking system , promptly guaranteed the value of all money-market funds . 
The proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value &quot; float &quot; - and not be rounded up - to reflect its true , underlying risk . 
The proposal would also have required that money-market funds hold back a fraction of some redemptions , thereby making investors take some risk that funds might not have complete transactional liquidity if their investments weakened . 
A majority of the commissioners turned down the proposals after substantial lobbying from the mutual-fund industry . 
If money-market funds had to maintain capital reserves , industry representatives argued , yields to investors would decline and the industry &apos;s profits would suffer . 
And , if retail investors saw their money-market funds &quot; values declining from the amount that they had invested , and if they knew that they could not get all of their money back immediately , the funds would become less attractive . 
Investors might choose other places for their excess cash , like banks . 
Banks are obliged to hold reserves , maintain capital , and pay deposit insurance to ensure that they can honor their deposits . 
The mutual-fund industry , one can assume , feared that the SEC &apos;s rules would induce customers to redirect much of their cash directly into banks . 
As a result of the SEC &apos;s inaction , money-market funds will continue to operate outside the scope of bank-style rules on capital and reserves , even though investors treat them like bank accounts . 
Unlike banks , though , they do not pay the government to insure their investors . 
But the 2008 financial crisis showed that , when push comes to shove , the government will backstop money-market funds nonetheless . 
The rejected proposals are thus good policy : money-market funds should be made safer - via capital requirements and liquidity restrictions - because they already receive a de facto government guarantee . 
Their steady value makes them appear safer to investors than they are to the world &apos;s financial system . 
The SEC &apos;s rejection of the proposed rules demonstrates the power of concerted lobbying - and that concentrated interests often trump diffuse benefits . 
Typically , an interest group lobbies Congress , blandishing persuasive arguments , campaign contributions , and other support ; often enough members - or enough key members - come to see the merit of the group &apos;s point of view ( or at least vote as if they do ) . 
Meanwhile , ordinary citizens do not notice unless the issue receives significant media attention . 
Often no one lobbies the other side of the issue . 
One might think that banks would counter-balance the mutual-fund industry &apos;s lobbying efforts , because the likely effect of forcing money-market funds to pay for more of their systemic costs would be to expand funds flowing directly to banks . 
But inflows through money-market funds are not so bad for banks , which get the cash without having to set aside reserves or pay for deposit insurance . 
Some banks may even prefer these flows to direct deposits . 
So the mutual-fund industry had the regulators all to itself . 
Its lobbyists told the SEC commissioners that current rules already did everything possible to ensure safety ; that retail investors want money-market funds &quot; steady value ; that change would hurt all investors ; and that the recent Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation disrupts regulators &quot; ability to bail out money-market funds next time . 
Other regulators were watching , as were academics and journalists - and some regulators may now feel compelled to take over the money-market safety rules from the SEC or push the SEC back into action . 
With no one having a direct financial interest in the outcome pressing an alternative view , the SEC &apos;s initial decision was as predictable as it was bad .
