An IMF We Can Love ? 
CAMBRIDGE - What a difference the crisis has made for the International Monetary Fund . 
It was just a few months ago that this important but unloved institution , a landmark of post-war global economic arrangements , seemed destined to irrelevance . 
The IMF has long been a whipping boy for both left and right - the former because of the Fund &apos;s emphasis on fiscal rectitude and economic orthodoxy , and the latter because of its role in bailing out indebted nations . 
Developing nations grudgingly took its advice , while advanced nations , not needing the money , ignored it . 
In a world where private capital flows dwarf the resources at its disposal , the IMF had come to seem an anachronism . 
And , when some of the IMF &apos;s largest debtors ( Brazil and Argentina ) began to prepay their debts a few years ago with no new borrowers in sight , it looked like the final nail in the coffin had been struck . 
The IMF seemed condemned to run out of income , in addition to losing its raison d &quot; Ãªtre . 
It shrank its budgets and began to downsize , and , while it was handed some new responsibilities in the meantime - surveillance over &quot; currency manipulation , &quot; in particular - its deliberations proved largely irrelevant . 
But the crisis has invigorated the IMF . 
Under its capable managing director , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the Fund has been one of the few official agencies ahead of - instead of behind - the curve . 
It moved quickly to establish a fast-disbursing emergency line of credit for countries with &quot; reasonable &quot; policies . 
It ardently championed global fiscal stimulus on the order of 2 % of world GNP - a position that is all the more remarkable in view of its traditional conservatism on all fiscal matters . 
And , in the run-up to the G-20 summit in London , it thoroughly overhauled its lending policies , de-emphasizing traditional conditionality and making it easier for countries to qualify for loans . 
Even more significantly , the IMF has emerged from the London meeting with substantially greater resources , as well as new responsibilities . 
The G-20 promised to triple the Fund &apos;s lending capacity ( from $ 250 billion to $ 750 billion ) , issue $ 250 billion of new Special Drawing Rights ( a reserve asset made up of a basket of major currencies ) , and permit the Fund to borrow in capital markets ( which it has never done ) if necessary . 
The IMF was also designated as one of two lead agencies - along with an expanded Financial Stability Forum ( now renamed the Financial Stability Board ) - charged with providing early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and issuing the requisite policy recommendations . 
Another piece of good news is that the Europeans have now given up their claim on naming the IMF &apos;s managing director ( as have the Americans their corresponding claim on the World Bank presidency ) . 
These senior officials are henceforth to be selected &quot; through an open , transparent , and merit-based selection process . &quot; 
This will provide for better governance ( although Strauss-Kahn &apos;s leadership has been exemplary ) , and will enhance both institutions &quot; legitimacy in the eyes of developing nations . 
So the IMF now finds itself at the center of the economic universe once again . 
How will it choose to deploy its newfound power ? 
The greatest risk is that it will once again over-reach and over-play its hand . 
The institution has since acknowledged its errors in all these areas . 
One encouraging fact is that developing countries will almost certainly get a larger say in how the Fund is run . 
But simply giving developing nations greater voting power will make little difference if the IMF &apos;s organizational culture is not changed as well . 
The Fund is staffed by a large number of smart economists , who lack much connection to ( and appreciation for ) the institutional realities of the countries on which they work . 
Their professional expertise is validated by the quality of their advanced degrees , rather than by their achievements in practical policymaking . 
This breeds arrogance and a sense of smug superiority over their counterparts - policymakers who must balance multiple , complicated agendas . 
Countering this will require proactive efforts by the IMF &apos;s top leadership in recruitment , staffing , and promotion . 
One option would be to increase substantially the number of mid-career recruits with actual practical experience in developing countries . 
This would make the IMF staff more cognizant of the value of local knowledge relative to theoretical expertise . 
Another strategy would be to relocate some of the staff , including those in functional departments , to &quot; regional offices &quot; in the field . 
The World Bank , which engaged in a similar decentralization a while back , has become better at serving its clients as a result ( without facing difficulties in recruiting top talent ) . 
This is an important moment for the IMF . 
The international community is putting great store in the Fund &apos;s judgment and performance .
