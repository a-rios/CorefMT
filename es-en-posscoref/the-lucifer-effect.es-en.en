The Lucifer Effect 
Why do good , ordinary people sometimes become perpetrators of evil ? 
The most extreme transformation of this kind is , of course , the story of God &apos;s favorite angel , Lucifer - a story that has set the context for my psychological investigations into lesser human transformations in response to the corrosive influence of powerful situational forces . 
Such forces exist in many common behavioral contexts , distorting our usual good nature by pushing us to engage in deviant , destructive , or evil behavior . 
When embedded in new and unfamiliar settings , our habitual ways of thinking , feeling , and acting no longer function to sustain the moral compass that has guided us reliably in the past . 
Over the past three decades , my research and that of my colleagues has demonstrated the relative ease with which ordinary people can be led to behave in ways that qualify as evil . 
We have put research participants in experiments where powerful situational forces - anonymity , group pressures , or diffusion of personal responsibility - led them blindly to obey authority and to aggress against innocent others after dehumanizing them . 
My recent book The Lucifer Effect : Understanding How Good People Turn Evil describes the radical transformations that took place among college students playing randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison created at Stanford University . 
It goes on to establish direct parallels with the abuses committed by American soldiers at Iraq &apos;s Abu Ghraib prison , presenting much of the social science research illustrating the power of social situations to dominate individual dispositions . 
This body of work challenges the traditional focus on the individual &apos;s inner nature , dispositions , and personality traits as the primary - and often the sole - factors in understanding human failings . 
Instead , I argue that while most people are good most of the time , they can readily be led to act anti-socially , because most people are rarely solitary figures improvising soliloquies on the empty stage of life . 
On the contrary , people are often in an ensemble of different players , on a stage with various props , costumes , scripts , and stage directions from producers and directors . 
Together , they comprise situational features that can dramatically influence behavior . 
What individuals bring into any setting is important , but so are the situational forces that act on them , as well as the systemic forces that create and maintain situations . 
Most institutions that are invested in an individualistic orientation hold up the person as sinner , culpable , afflicted , insane , or irrational . 
Programs of change follow either a medical model of rehabilitation , therapy , reeducation , and treatment , or a punitive model of incarceration and execution . 
But all such programs are doomed to fail if the main causal agent is the situation or system , not the person . 
As a result , two kinds of paradigm shift are required . 
Second , legal theory must reconsider the extent to which powerful situational and systemic factors should be taken into account in punishing individuals . 
Although much of The Lucifer Effect examines how easy it is for ordinary people to be seduced into engaging in evil deeds , or to be passively indifferent to the suffering of others , the deeper message is a positive one . 
It is by understanding the how and why of such deeds that we are in a better position to uncover , oppose , defy , and triumph over them . 
By becoming more &quot; evil smart , &quot; we build up resistance to having our moral compass reset negatively . 
In this sense , The Lucifer Effect is a celebration of the human capacity to choose kindness over cruelty , caring over indifference , creativity over destructiveness , and heroism over villainy . 
At the end of my narrative , I invite readers to consider fundamental strategies of resisting and challenging unwanted social influences , and I introduce the notion of &quot; the banality of heroism . &quot; 
After all , most heroes are ordinary people who engage in extra-ordinary moral actions . 
With this in mind , I propose a situational perspective for heroism , just as I do for evil : the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination and evil in some of us can inspire the heroic imagination in others . 
We must teach people , especially our children , to think of themselves as &quot; heroes-in-waiting , &quot; ready to take heroic action in a particular situation that may occur only once in their lifetime .
