A Kick-Off for Peace ? 
Yerevan - Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan &apos;s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic . 
Given the two countries &quot; long-strained relations , this visit would have been remarkable at any time . 
Of course , ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey . 
In the new context set by the war in Georgia , the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone . 
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey &apos;s geography and history . 
Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition , secularism and Islam , and democracy and tyranny , Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West . 
For the peoples of the Caucasus , Turkey marks our path to Europe . 
It is a NATO member , bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs . 
It aspires to join the European Union , and would bring the EU to our three borders , even as we , too , aspire to join one day . 
Indeed , Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker . 
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation . 
This year , as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter , Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel . 
Now , in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis , Turkey &apos;s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus . 
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts . 
But , in order to succeed , Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region &apos;s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes . 
If this pledge is adopted and respected , conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different , more tolerant context , marking a historic breakthrough to peace . 
In fact , why not take the idea of such a pact one step further ? 
We in this region can , and I believe should , call for a non-aligned Caucasus , free of security blocs and adversarial alliances . 
After all , security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines , with their attendant security challenges . 
Our countries and peoples have , throughout history , lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided . 
Today , we share a common vision of European integration , and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned . 
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region &apos;s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance . 
But , at the end of the day , we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation . 
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts . 
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral , the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world , and certainly not in this interconnected region . 
In fact , real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations . 
One is a lesson from history : Russia &apos;s strategic interests here cannot be ignored . 
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos . 
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever . 
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region . 
Ironically , both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest . 
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia &apos;s strategic role in the region . 
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia &apos;s real and imagined reliance on Russia . 
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul &apos;s visit to Yerevan , real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries &quot; closed border - the last in Europe . 
Or , for a start , the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational . 
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months , then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show . 
President Gul &apos;s visit does mark a watershed - either as a failure to make history , or as the beginning of a new era .
