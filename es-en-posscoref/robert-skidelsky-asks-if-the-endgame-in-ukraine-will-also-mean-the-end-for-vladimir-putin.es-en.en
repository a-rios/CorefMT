Endgame for Putin in Ukraine ? 
LONDON - Vladimir Putin may ( or may not ) enjoy 80 % public support in Russia for his Ukraine policy ; but it has become increasingly clear that he has bitten off more than he can chew . 
The question is : At what point will his position as President become untenable ? 
Leave to one side the moral and geopolitical background of the Ukraine imbroglio . 
Russians are justified , I believe , in their view that the West took advantage of Russia &apos;s post-communist weakness to encroach on their country &apos;s historic space . 
The Monroe Doctrine may be incompatible with contemporary international law ; but all powers strong enough to enforce a strategic sphere of interest do so . 
There is merit , I also believe , in Putin &apos;s contention that a multipolar world is better than a unipolar world for advancing the cause of human flourishing . 
No single power or coalition is wise or disinterested enough to claim universal sovereignty . 
So it should be no surprise that Russia and other countries have started to build an institutional structure for multi-polarity . 
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization , which includes Russia , China , and four ex-Soviet Central Asian states , was established in 2001 . 
Last month , the five BRICS countries - Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa - established the New Development Bank and a contingent reserve fund to diversify sources of official lending to developing countries . 
The BRICS &quot; &quot; no strings &quot; policy explicitly challenges the conditionality imposed on borrowers by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , though the policy remains untested . 
Indeed , it is impossible to imagine China &apos;s leaders approving a loan to a country that , say , recognizes Taiwan or accepts Tibetan claims to independence . 
But the fact remains that Russia is too weak to challenge the West further , at least in the way that it did in Ukraine . 
Russia &apos;s GDP is around $ 2 trillion , and its population of 143 million is falling fast . 
The United States and the European Union have a combined GDP of about $ 34 trillion and a population of 822 million , with the US population growing rapidly . 
This means that the West can inflict much more damage on Russia than Russia can inflict on the West . 
Even in its heyday , the Soviet Union was a one-track superpower . 
With an economy about a quarter of the size of America &apos;s , it was able to maintain rough military parity by spending four times as much of its national income on defense as the US did - to the detriment of the living standards of ordinary citizens . 
Today the balance of power is even more unfavorable . 
Russia &apos;s economy is weaker , and its armaments are rusty . 
It retains a formidable nuclear capacity , but it is inconceivable that Russia would use it to secure its aims in Ukraine . 
So we are left with a looming endgame in which Putin can neither retain his spoils - Crimea and control of Russian-speaking parts of eastern Ukraine - nor back down . 
Russia will be required to disgorge these acquisitions as a condition of normalizing its relations with the West . 
But Putin will most likely try to prop up eastern Ukraine &apos;s separatists as long as he can - perhaps with military assistance disguised as humanitarian aid - and will absolutely refuse to give up Crimea . 
This will lead to a further escalation of Western sanctions : restrictions on gas exports , general export restrictions , suspension from the World Trade Organization , withdrawal of the FIFA 2018 World Cup soccer tournament , and so on . 
This , in conjunction with the tightening of current sanctions , including the exclusion of Russian banks from Western capital markets , is bound to cause serious shortages , declining living standards , and major problems for Russia &apos;s ownership class . 
The Russian public &apos;s natural reaction will be to rally to their leader . 
But support for Putin , though broad , may not be deep . 
It is support before , not after , the debate about the costs of Putin &apos;s policy has taken place . 
And that debate is being silenced by state control of the media and the suppression of opposition . 
It is natural and right to think of possible compromises : Ukraine &apos;s guaranteed neutrality , greater regional autonomy within a federal Ukraine , an interim international administration in Crimea to supervise a referendum on its future , and the like . 
The question is not how much of this kind of package Putin would accept , but whether any of it will be offered to him . 
The West no longer believes anything he says . 
US President Barack Obama has publicly accused him of lying . German Chancellor Angela Merkel , formerly Putin &apos;s strongest backer in Europe , is reported to have described him as delusional . 
( The last straw for her apparently was his attempt to blame the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on the Ukrainian government . ) 
All leaders lie and dissemble to some extent ; but the scale of disinformation coming from the Kremlin has been epic . 
So the question must be asked : Will the West be prepared to make peace with Putin ? 
Leaders whose foreign-policy adventures end in defeat do not usually survive long in office . 
Either formal mechanisms are used to dethrone them - as occurred , for example , in the Soviet Union , when the Central Committee forced Nikita Khrushchev out of power in 1964 - or informal mechanisms come into play . 
Putin &apos;s power elite will start fracturing - indeed , that process may have begun already . 
Pressure will grow for him to step aside . 
There is no need , it will be said , for his country to go down with him . 
Such a scenario , unimaginable a few months ago , may already be shaping up as the Ukraine drama moves to its endgame . 
The Putin era may be over sooner than we think .
