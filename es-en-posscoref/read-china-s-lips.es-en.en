Read China &apos;s Lips 
NEW HAVEN - The Chinese have long admired America &apos;s economic dynamism . 
But they have lost confidence in America &apos;s government and its dysfunctional economic stewardship . 
That message came through loud and clear in my recent travels to Beijing , Shanghai , Chongqing , and Hong Kong . 
Coming so shortly on the heels of the subprime crisis , the debate over the debt ceiling and the budget deficit is the last straw . 
Senior Chinese officials are appalled at how the United States allows politics to trump financial stability . 
One high-ranking policymaker noted in mid-July , &quot; This is truly shocking ... We understand politics , but your government &apos;s continued recklessness is astonishing . &quot; 
China is no innocent bystander in America &apos;s race to the abyss . 
In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s , China amassed some $ 3.2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves in order to insulate its system from external shocks . 
Fully two-thirds of that total - around $ 2 trillion - is invested in dollar-based assets , largely US Treasuries and agency securities ( i.e. , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) . 
As a result , China surpassed Japan in late 2008 as the largest foreign holder of US financial assets . 
Not only did China feel secure in placing such a large bet on the once relatively riskless components of the world &apos;s reserve currency , but its exchange-rate policy left it little choice . 
In order to maintain a tight relationship between the renminbi and the dollar , China had to recycle a disproportionate share of its foreign-exchange reserves into dollar-based assets . 
Those days are over . 
China recognizes that it no longer makes sense to stay with its current growth strategy - one that relies heavily on a combination of exports and a massive buffer of dollar-denominated foreign-exchange reserves . 
Three key developments led the Chinese leadership to this conclusion : 
First , the crisis and Great Recession of 2008-2009 were a wake-up call . 
While Chinese export industries remain highly competitive , there are understandable doubts about the post-crisis state of foreign demand for Chinese products . 
From the US to Europe to Japan - crisis-battered developed economies that collectively account for more than 40 % of Chinese exports - end-market demand is likely to grow at a slower pace in the years ahead than it did during China &apos;s export boom of the past 30 years . 
Long the most powerful driver of Chinese growth , there is now considerable downside to an export-led impetus . 
Second , the costs of the insurance premium - the outsize , largely dollar-denominated reservoir of China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves - have been magnified by political risk . 
With US government debt repayment now in play , the very concept of dollar-based riskless assets is in doubt . 
In recent years , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and President Hu Jintao have repeatedly expressed concerns about US fiscal policy and the safe-haven status of Treasuries . 
Like most Americans , China &apos;s leaders believe that the US will ultimately dodge the bullet of an outright default . 
But that &apos;s not the point . 
There is now great skepticism as to the substance of any &quot; fix &quot; - especially one that relies on smoke and mirrors to postpone meaningful fiscal adjustment . 
All of this spells lasting damage to the credibility of Washington &apos;s commitment to the &quot; full faith and credit &quot; of the US government . 
Finally , China &apos;s leadership is mindful of the risks implied by its own macroeconomic imbalances - and of the role that its export-led growth and dollar-based foreign-exchange accumulation plays in perpetuating those imbalances . 
Moreover , the Chinese understand the political pressure that a growth-starved developed world is putting on its tight management of the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate relative to the dollar - pressure that is strikingly reminiscent of a similar campaign directed at Japan in the mid-1980 &quot; s . 
However , unlike Japan , China will not accede to calls for a sharp one-off revaluation of the renminbi . 
At the same time , it recognizes the need to address these geopolitical tensions . 
But China will do so by providing stimulus to internal demand , thereby weaning itself from relying on dollar-based assets . 
With these considerations in mind , China has adopted a very transparent response . 
Its new 12th Five-Year Plan says it all - a pro-consumption shift in China &apos;s economic structure that addresses head-on China &apos;s unsustainable imbalances . 
By focusing on job creation in services , massive urbanization , and the broadening of its social safety net , there will be a big boost to labor income and consumer purchasing power . 
As a result , the consumption share of the Chinese economy could increase by at least five percentage points of GDP by 2015 . 
A consumer-led rebalancing addresses many of the tensions noted above . 
It moves economic growth away from a dangerous over reliance on external demand , while shifting support to untapped internal demand . 
In addition , it takes the heat off an undervalued currency as a prop to export growth , giving China considerable leeway to step up the pace of currency reforms . 
But , by raising the consumption share of its GDP , China will also absorb much of its surplus saving . 
That will sharply reduce the pace of foreign-exchange accumulation and cut into China &apos;s open-ended demand for dollar-denominated assets . 
So China , the largest foreign buyer of US government paper , will soon say , &quot; enough . &quot; 
Yet another vacuous budget deal , in conjunction with weaker-than-expected growth for the US economy for years to come , spells a protracted period of outsize government deficits . 
That raises the biggest question of all : lacking in Chinese demand for Treasuries , how will a savings-strapped US economy fund itself without suffering a sharp decline in the dollar and / or a major increase in real long-term interest rates ? 
The cavalier response heard from Washington insiders is that the Chinese wouldn &apos;t dare spark such an endgame . 
After all , where else would they place their asset bets ? 
Why would they risk losses in their massive portfolio of dollar-based assets ? 
China &apos;s answers to those questions are clear : it is no longer willing to risk financial and economic stability on the basis of Washington &apos;s hollow promises and tarnished economic stewardship . 
The Chinese are finally saying no . 
Read their lips .
