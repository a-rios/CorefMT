A Partnership in Peril 
The Iraq war divided &quot; old &quot; and &quot; new &quot; Europe and imposed unprecedented strains on the relationship between America and Europe . 
For nearly 60 years , the Atlantic partnership has been a force for good , not only for Europe and North America , but for the world . 
Are these ties beyond repair , or can they be restored ? 
Relations disintegrated alarmingly fast . 
In the aftermath of September 11 th , even French newspapers carried headlines reading &quot; We are all Americans . &quot; 
It began to seem as though our fundamentally common outlook and our much-vaunted shared values had reasserted themselves . 
Within a year , everything looked different , especially in Germany . 
The transatlantic partnership once was a basic tenet of German foreign policy - and yet Germany &apos;s Chancellor won re-election on what was seen as an anti-American platform . 
Although some of this sentiment was misrepresented , Germany clearly would not support military action in Iraq . 
Many Germans remain torn not only about Iraq , but about war in general . 
Many believe that Germany &apos;s stance represents pacifist , rather than anti-American , sentiment . 
They may be right . 
Germany has changed over the last decade , sending peacekeeping troops to Somalia , Bosnia , East Timor , Kosovo , the Caucasus , Macedonia and , in response to September 11 th , Afghanistan . 
But none of those troops has fought a war . 
A closer look at the problem suggests that the division over Iraq is not merely an isolated incident , but reflects a range of deep-seated difficulties . 
The list of issues on which Europe and America now hold deeply different views is longer than it has been in a generation . 
There is discord on defence , with growing irritation in the US over what it views as the pretentious posturing of the so-called European Defence Initiative . 
The US sees falling European defence budgets accompanied by new and unnecessary command structures , which merely duplicate the command structure that exists within NATO . 
On the Middle East , a difference in emphasis has become a yawning gulf . 
Trade disputes fester . 
Differences on global environmental policy are acute , with America in the dock over its refusal to sign the Kyoto accord . 
Cultural divisions are also more intense . 
Many Europeans regard the use of capital punishment in the US as backward and repugnant . 
Many Americans ascribe Europe &apos;s lack of total commitment to its anti-terrorism cause to latent anti-Semitism . 
In Europe , there is a move towards greater integration , though some Europeans , especially the British , are divided on its desirability . 
Some integration advocates see a united Europe as a strong partner of the US . 
Others are motivated by a desire to set up a rival power center , however unrealistic this appears to be . 
Some commentators have begun pointing to the different views of the US and Europe on the role of international law , as opposed to the use of force , in resolving disputes . 
Because Europe is militarily insignificant , they argue , it is not surprising that Europeans emphasize diplomacy , rather than military might , to resolve disputes . 
On the other hand , no one should be surprised that Americans chafe at constraints on their ability to take advantage of US military hegemony . 
The truth is that transatlantic differences have existed for a long time . 
During the Cold War , they were largely suppressed in the face of the Soviet threat and Europeans &apos; recognition of their need of the US to meet that threat . 
Indeed , it is somewhat surprising that the partnership did not show more strains sooner after the Cold War ended . 
These strains are not helped by negativism on both sides of the Atlantic . 
Although the US and Europe do have issues to resolve , there is a real danger that the portrayal of every possible event as heralding a new split will end up being self-fulfilling . 
Too much is at stake to allow this to go on . 
Europe and North America do retain a fundamental common outlook . 
If they work together , more progress can be made in tackling the world &apos;s problems than if they see each global flashpoint as an opportunity to seek advantage at the other &apos;s expense . 
If , on the contrary , the Atlantic partnership disintegrates into rivalry or hostility , the world will become more dangerous . 
What is to be done ? 
If the political will is there , the partnership can be preserved and sustained . 
This means that decision-makers , on both sides of the Atlantic , should always take into account the effect of their decisions ( and of their language ) on the relationship . 
Of course , this cannot always be decisive . 
But if it is always regarded as relevant , the worst damage may be avoided . 
One specific suggestion is that governments , on both sides of the Atlantic , set up a Standing Conference of senior officials to identify potential problems before they become sources of difficulty . 
Forewarned is forearmed , and early action might diffuse problems which would otherwise become intractable . 
In a new , unstable century , the relationship between Europe and America is more important than ever . 
Arguments , like the one over Iraq , should not sound the relationship &apos;s death knell , but must be managed in such a way as to inflict the minimum of harm on the partnership . 
Every effort must be made to ensure that future disagreements , which will undoubtedly arise , do less damage . 
Too much is at stake to allow Atlantic partnership to flounder .
