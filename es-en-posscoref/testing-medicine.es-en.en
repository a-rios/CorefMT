Testing Medicine 
Most people are surprised to learn that rigorous application of formal rules of evidence to evaluate medical research and decide on the best treatments is a recent phenomenon . 
They might be just as surprised to learn that health policy is not yet subject to the same approach . 
So-called &quot; evidence-based medicine &quot; entails a hierarchy of empirical proof that ranks medical studies according to their quality . 
Physiological research on animals , or of human responses in laboratory settings , rank low on the hierarchy . 
Observational studies that compare outcomes for patients who receive particular treatments and control subject who do not rank higher , but may still be misleading . 
Convincing studies of drugs and surgical procedures usually come only from randomized trials , in which patients receive treatment or don &apos;t according to a process analogous to a coin flip . 
Well-conducted randomized trials incorporate additional safeguards against bias , including use of placebo medication that allows investigators to blind patients and caregivers to whether patients are , or are not , receiving active treatment . 
Doctors have made many errors that they could have avoided had these principles been applied . 
For example , for a decade leading doctors advocated hormone replacement therapy to lower cardiovascular risk in post-menopausal women . 
These recommendations , based on physiological and observational studies , proved profoundly misleading . 
Randomized trials ultimately showed no benefit , and a clear increase in breast cancer and vascular blood clots . 
Similarly , cardiologists once prescribed drugs to reduce sudden death in patients after heart attacks . 
The drugs suppressed arrhythmias - disturbances of the heartbeat associated with sudden death . 
The logic seemed clear : suppress the asymptomatic but nasty-looking arrhythmias , and you will reduce sudden death . 
Unfortunately , when investigators undertook randomized trials , they found that treated patients had a higher death rate . 
Clinicians stopped using the drugs , but not before causing a large number of unnecessary deaths . 
But awareness that principles of evidence-based medicine should also guide health policy has been slower to take root . 
Here , although randomized trials are not feasible , it remains possible to follow evidence-based medicine &apos;s primary rule : to base action on systematic summaries of the highest quality evidence available . 
Consider the issue of whether countries should fund health care publicly , through taxes , or privately , through health insurance and user fees . 
Private health insurance has proved enormously wasteful , with large administrative expenditures on activities that include developing insurance packages , marketing those packages , and assessing claims . 
Public funding eliminates these activities , resulting in far lower administrative costs . 
Likewise , user fees discourage the poor and elderly from accessing needed health services , whereas public funding largely eliminates inequities in the provision of care while producing health outcomes that are as good as , if not better than , mixed public-private funding models . 
Public funding also benefits a country &apos;s economy , because large employers are spared the expense of providing health benefits to their workers . 
Thus , the evidence suggests that public funding of all key aspects of medical care - physician and hospital services , drugs , and devices  -  offers benefits of equity , efficiency , and industrial advantage . 
The medical community has come to accept the need for systematic reviews to guide decisions regarding drugs and surgical therapies , but their use in health policy is only now taking hold . 
Systematic reviews have summarized the evidence regarding the provision of hospital services by large for-profit companies versus not-for-profit providers . 
The primary studies forming the basis of these reviews come largely from the United States , where for-profit and not-for-profit providers work side by side in the same environment , and where large administrative databases allow accurate detection of death rates . 
But , while these observational studies are threatened by bias from patient selection - sicker patients mean higher death rates , for example Â­ - the available administrative databases document patient characteristics such as age , severity of illness , and co-morbidity , including diabetes and high blood pressure . 
This information allows statistical approaches that level the playing field , helping to protect against biases associated with patient selection . 
These systematic reviews have shown that for-profit hospital care leads to higher death rates than not-for-profit care , despite higher charges to third-party payers . 
Systematic reviews have demonstrated the same phenomenon in outpatient dialysis facilities - lower death rates in not-for-profit facilities - and have also shown higher quality care in not-for-profit nursing homes . 
The reason that not-for-profit providers can achieve higher quality care with better health outcomes at lower cost is evident . 
While for-profit providers have higher administrative costs and larger executive salaries , their main burden relative to not-for-profit provision is the need to generate returns for their shareholders . 
These additional costs mean that approximately 20 % of the total income that not-for-profit providers can devote to patient care is unavailable . 
The result is cutting corners , deficiencies in care , and poorer outcomes for patients . 
Principles of evidence-based medicine have transformed the way we look at clinical interventions and may prevent repetitions of public-health disasters such as the inappropriate promotion of hormone replacement therapy and anti-arrhythmic drugs . 
Application of these principles to health policy can lead to wiser decisions about how to run our health systems . 
The available evidence provides strong support for public funding of health services delivered by not-for-profit providers .
