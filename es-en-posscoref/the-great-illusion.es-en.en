The Great Illusion 
The saddest of the books on my office bookshelf is an old one published nearly a century ago : Norman Angell &apos;s The Great Illusion : A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to Their Economic and Social Advantage , which tried to prove that military conquest was obsolete . 
Angell &apos;s argument was simple : in all prolonged modern industrial wars , everybody loses . 
Losers lose the most , but winners also are worse off than if peace had been maintained . 
Many fathers , sons , and husbands are dead , and so are many mothers , wives , and daughters . 
Much wealth has been blown up . 
Much architecture has been turned into rubble . 
Confiscation damages the rule of law on which modern industrial prosperity rests . 
The most that even the winners can say is that they are little losers rather than big losers . 
Modern industrial war is , as the computer in the 1982 movie War Games put it , a very peculiar game : &quot; The only way to win is not to play . &quot; 
At the time that Angell wrote , some people argued that war was an important means to promote national prosperity ; that commercial prosperity was the fruit of military power . 
Angell puzzled over how pre-WWI pan-German politicians could believe that German prosperity required a big battle fleet when the absence of one made no difference to the prosperity of Norway , Denmark , or Holland . 
He looked forward to the coming of an age of rational statesmanship , when every prime minister and foreign minister would recognize that regardless of the matter in dispute , binding arbitration between nations was a better strategy than war . 
He was , of course , right in his judgment that the only way to prevent any modern industrial war from becoming a destructive tragedy for all was to quickly conclude a ceasefire . 
Governments that view aggressive war as a means to prosperity have been rare since the end of World War I : the Imperial Japanese government that launched World War II in the Pacific and Saddam Hussein &apos;s two grabs for oilfields are examples that spring immediately to mind . 
In one sense , governments have learned the lesson Norman Angell preached . 
But what makes The Great Illusion the saddest book on my office bookshelf is that we have found other reasons to fight wars , and the years since Angell wrote his book have seen the most terrible and bloody wars ever . 
We have fought wars to preserve colonial domination and wars to end it . 
We have seen civil wars . 
We have seen ideological wars . 
We have seen wars of extermination like the one that Hitler and the Nazis waged against not just Jews and Gypsies , but Poles and Russians . 
We have seen ethnic wars and wars fought to make governments stop killing their citizens . 
Indeed , we have seen more religious wars than at any time since the end of the Thirty Years War in 1648 . 
Yet there is cause for hope . 
From the pro-consulate of Julius Caesar until 1945 , there was most likely at least one army crossing or about to cross or thinking of crossing the Rhine in arms . 
Now there are none . 
A little more than a century and a half ago the United States appeared willing to go to war with the world &apos;s only superpower of the time to try to turn Vancouver , British Columbia , into a city ruled from Washington , D.C. rather than from Ottawa or London . 
Vancouver is a lovely city , and I would love to have the voters of British Columbia inside the US , because I think they would add much health to the American electorate . 
But nobody thinks that idea worth fighting a war over . 
A century ago , a French politician was no more likely to advocate peace and detente with Germany than a modern Arab politician is likely to advocate peace and detente with Israel . 
Academic foreign policy &quot; realists &quot; ( who somehow strike me as not a very realistic bunch ) attributed the end of Franco-German antagonism to the fact that they had something bigger to be scared of : Russia , which was terrifying under Stalin , frightening under Khrushchev , and worrisome under Brezhnev . 
Let the Cold War end , they said , and then we will see France and Germany begin to rattle their sabers again , for that is the tragedy of international power politics . 
Yet the Cold War has been over for fifteen years , and military conflict between France and Germany today seems as unlikely as military conflict between America and Canada . 
I hope that it is the fact of European interdependence - an interdependence carefully constructed by Jean Monnet , Robert Schumann , Konrad Adenauer , and those who followed in their footsteps - and not the memory of the horror of World War II that has caused the armies that used to cross the Rhine in arms to vanish . 
If so , there is a chance that the globalized economic age to which we look forward will be a more peaceful age than the twentieth century was . 
If not , then Angell may well continue to be as irrelevant as he was right .
