Stop Subsidizing Climate Change 
LONDON - Next week , governments will gather in Warsaw , Poland , for a crucial round of climate negotiations , with both expectation and ambition running at an all-time low . 
But it does not have to be like this : The Warsaw meeting provides an opportunity to galvanize action on one of the most potent forces driving climate change - the billions of dollars spent by governments on fossil-fuel subsidies . 
The Warsaw talks are a staging post on the route to the 2015 United Nations climate summit in Paris , at which governments will seek to forge an agreement that prevents dangerous climate change , defined as global warming of more than two degrees Celsius . 
Failure would expose future generations to catastrophic climate risks , while trapping millions of people in poverty as a result of more frequent , intense , and protracted droughts , floods , and storms . 
Basic carbon arithmetic illustrates the scale of the problem . 
According to the most recent assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , we are on a trajectory toward exhausting the twenty-first century &apos;s entire carbon budget by 2030 . 
So , can we head off the impending collision between the energy systems driving the global economy and our planet &apos;s ecological limits ? 
The necessary innovations are emerging . 
Recent developments in wind , solar , tidal , bio-energy , geothermal , and fuel-cell technology are transforming the scope for low-carbon energy production . 
Aside from saving the planet , these technologies could open up new investment opportunities , deliver affordable energy , and sustain growth . 
But that potential will be realized only if governments actively pursue green industrial policies . 
They need to align the goal of avoiding dangerous climate change with disincentives for carbon-intensive energy - including taxes , carbon markets , and support for green alternatives . 
Fossil-fuel subsidies have the opposite effect . 
They actively promote carbon-intensive energy and deter green investment . 
According to the International Energy Agency , governments pumped $ 523 billion into fossil-fuel subsidies in 2011 . 
From a climate-change perspective , this is a world turned upside down : for every $ 1 in support for renewable energy , another $ 6 promotes carbon-intensive fuels . 
Most fossil-fuel subsidies can be traced to developing countries , where they drain budgets and provide transfers to wealthy households . 
But rich countries operate their own subsidies , which average $ 7 for every ton of CO2 they emit . 
Research by the United Kingdom &apos;s Overseas Development Institute that examined tax and consumer subsidies provided by governments in 11 OECD countries found support equivalent to $ 72 billion , or around $ 112 per adult . 
It is difficult to think of a more irresponsible use of public money . 
The inconsistencies between climate goals and energy policies are becoming increasingly stark . 
Germany is providing lavish support for the construction of new coal plants . 
Britain offers generous tax concessions for oil and gas exploration , including bumper deals for companies involved in fracking . 
The United States spends heavily to subsidize gasoline and other fossil fuels . 
In all of these cases , bold climate-change targets are being undermined by business-as-usual subsidies . 
Carbon markets could provide a corrective to fossil-fuel subsidies , but they are not doing so . 
The European Union claims the mantle of global leadership on climate change , yet its leaders have allowed the price of carbon in the EU &apos;s Emissions Trading Scheme to collapse , owing to reckless over-supply of carbon credits . 
By contrast , South Korea has signaled that it will enforce a greenhouse-gas cap that is projected to push prices to 20 times the EU level by 2017 - and green-energy investment there is booming . 
With energy prices moving center stage , there is a danger that already-weak incentives for investment in low-carbon energy will be further undermined . 
Across Europe , calls for &quot; affordable energy &quot; are fast becoming a euphemism for increased fossil-fuel subsidies and a rollback of commitments on green energy . 
Recent debates in the UK illustrate the emerging fault lines . 
Five years ago , Britain broke the international mold by enacting legislation mandating an 80 % cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 . 
Today , political leaders openly attack &quot; burdensome &quot; green taxes . 
The government has delayed setting a decarbonization target for electricity generation , there is uncertainty over pricing for green energy sources , and the Green Investment Bank is under-financed . 
Unsurprisingly , investment in renewable energy has fallen to a four-year low . 
Expecting the Warsaw climate negotiations to deliver a major breakthrough would be a triumph of hope over evidence . 
Yet the talks provide a platform for practical action - and for governments to demonstrate leadership by example . 
The G-20 countries , which have already agreed , in principle , to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies , should seize the moment . 
They could hold a &quot; side-summit &quot; in Warsaw at which they set a schedule for translating principle into practice . 
The target should be full elimination of all fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020 . 
Rich G-20 countries could go further and faster . 
They should pledge to eliminate all subsidies by the time they arrive at the UN &apos;s COP 21 climate-change summit in Paris in 2015 , starting next year with the withdrawal of all support for gasoline and for coal , oil , and gas exploration . 
And they should divert part of the savings into energy cooperation aimed at supporting low-carbon transitions in developing countries . 
Eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies would be just one small step on the road to a global climate agreement .
