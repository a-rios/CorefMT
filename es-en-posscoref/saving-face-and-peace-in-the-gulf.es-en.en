Saving Face and Peace in the Gulf 
PRINCETON - The West and Iran are playing a dangerous game . 
In the past ten days , Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz and warned the United States against sending an aircraft carrier back into the Persian Gulf . 
The US predictably responded that its aircraft carriers could and would patrol wherever necessary to promote freedom of navigation . 
Iran then announced that it would conduct naval exercises in the Strait . 
In the game of &quot; chicken , &quot; two cars drive straight at each other at top speed ; either one driver &quot; chickens out &quot; and swerves , or they collide in a fireball . 
Governments around the world cannot stand by and watch that game play out across the world &apos;s energy lifeline . 
It is time for third parties to step in and facilitate solutions that allow Iran to save face while significantly and credibly reducing its supply of enriched uranium . 
Iran may or may not be planning to go all the way to production of a nuclear weapon . 
Nonetheless , it is in clear violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , as determined by the International Atomic Energy Agency , which is charged with monitoring the treaty . 
Its continuing non-compliance is destabilizing the entire Middle East , with serious repercussions for global security . 
Although the Iranian government could most likely be deterred from using a nuclear weapon , the price of a nuclear Iran could well be a regional arms race - a nuclear Saudi Arabia , possibly followed by Turkey and Egypt . 
Nuclear weapons , components , and materials in a region that is already volatile and violent , and that determines the world &apos;s oil prices , is an appalling scenario . 
The market has already taken the measure of the past week &apos;s tensions , driving up the price of some oil contracts to their highest levels in eight months . 
Trying to force Iran to back down with steadily mounting sanctions has not produced results . 
Despite the tightening economic noose - the US imposed sanctions on all companies that do business with Iran &apos;s central bank , and the European Union plans to impose sanctions on Iranian oil exports by the end of January - many nuclear experts now estimate that Iran is very close to enriching enough uranium to build a bomb . 
But how else can the US , the EU , and the United Nations make clear that the &quot; international community &quot; means what it says ? 
To go soft now is to lose all credibility with respect not only to Iran , but also to any other country thinking about pursuing a nuclear path . 
The logic is compelling enough , except that the current course leaves Iran &apos;s government no alternative between publicly backing down , which it will not do , and escalating its provocations . 
After all , what government wants to be seen as &quot; chickening out &quot; ? 
And , in this case , decision-makers on both sides face domestic opponents who are only too ready to pounce at the least sign of weakness . 
In the US , the Republican Party &apos;s leading presidential candidate in this year &apos;s election , Mitt Romney , declared at a recent debate , &quot; If you elect me as President , Iran will not have a nuclear weapon . &quot; 
His principal challenger , Rick Santorum , told NBC News that he would &quot; order air strikes &quot; if it &quot; became clear that &#91; Iran &#93; was going to get nuclear weapons . &quot; 
So this is no time for President Barack Obama to go wobbly . 
Iranian politics is much harder to read . 
In the ongoing power struggle between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , each is more likely to out-tough the other than to propose concessions to the West . 
Moreover , many Iranian analysts point out that Khamenei and his inner circle are convinced that the US is ultimately bent on regime change - and is willing to use force to achieve it . 
Hence Iranian missile tests , threats to close the Strait of Hormuz , and announcements of nuclear progress should be read as efforts to deter more than provoke . 
The more publicly the West threatens Iran , the more easily Iranian leaders can portray America as the Great Satan to parts of the Iranian population that have recently been inclined to see the US as their friend . 
The net effect is to keep Iran speeding down the road toward a crash . 
It is time for cooler heads to prevail with a strategy that helps Iran step back . 
The key players here are Brazil and Turkey , whose governments negotiated an ill-timed deal with Iran in May 2011 , whereby Iran would transfer 1,200 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for 1,200 kilograms of medium-enriched uranium for medical research at a Tehran reactor . 
That deal quickly fell apart , but it could be time to try again . 
The stage is already set in Turkey , which agreed on January 6 to host a new round of nuclear talks between Iran and the 5 + 1 group ( the five permanent members of the UN Security Council + Germany ) . 
A new deal would probably have to go beyond the swap proposed in May 2011 , but there are other possibilities . 
For example , add Egypt and Qatar to the equation and bring in the UN to provide an umbrella for a proposed regional nuclear-fuel bank , to which Iran would make the first contribution . 
Bring in South Korea ( a major customer for Iranian oil ) and Russia and begin exploring options for a global fuel bank . 
And ensure that all countries in the region reaffirm the basic rules of freedom of navigation in a way that allows them to claim vindication . 
Where the political will exists to allow the other side sufficient margin to reach an agreement , creative solutions can be found . 
Still , diplomats know that war can be preferable to humiliation , which is why saving face is just as important as threatening force - and why other countries should step in and provide the room that both sides need to avoid a head-on collision .
