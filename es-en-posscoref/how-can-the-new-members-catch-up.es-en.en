How Can the New Members Catch Up ? 
Of the ten new EU member states , eight have undergone a transformation whose speed and scope has been unprecedented . 
Wherever one looks in the postcommunist accession countries ­ ­ - at money , markets , ownership structures , banking sectors , foreign trade , health care , environmental protection , and education - one sees institutions that have been reconstructed from the ground up . 
In many of the transition countries , inflation was brought down from majestic heights - 251 % in Poland in 1989 - and all now have fully convertible currencies . 
Private enterprise dominates production and employment , whereas it accounted for only 23.1 % of GDP in Poland in 1989 and just 4 % in the Czech Republic and Slovakia . 
Similarly , after the collapse of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ( COMECON ) in 1991 , the transition countries quickly redirected their foreign trade to the West . 
Educational opportunities have multiplied , air and water pollution have plummeted , and life expectancy has increased almost to West European levels across the region . 
Since the early 1990 &apos;s , the prospect of eventual admission to the EU has helped spur these institutional changes . 
But now the task for the new member states - which account for 20 % of the enlarged EU &apos;s population but only 5 % of its GDP - is no less difficult : to achieve the rapid catch-up growth rates needed to close the economic gap with the EU &apos;s leaders . 
Membership itself will certainly help . 
Increased policy credibility will boost inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , while EU structural funds will support further institution building , infrastructure investment , and environmental protection . 
There is little empirical doubt about the positive impact of FDI inflows . 
FDI promotes technology transfer and contributes relatively more to economic growth than domestic investment , because it increases total investment in the economy more than one for one , owing to complementarities with domestic firms . 
Empirical research also confirms the positive impact of EU structural funds on growth . 
EU structural assistance has increased annual GDP growth , on average , by 0.4-0.9 % in Greece , Portugal and Ireland , and by 0.3 to 0.5 % in Spain , thereby helping poorer countries catch up with richer member states . 
EU membership provides the opportunity to catch up , but the actual economic outcomes will depend on the quality of domestic policies - and whether the EU policies most conducive to economic growth are strengthened , not weakened . 
This implies several imperatives for the EU and the new member countries alike . 
Defend the Stability and Growth Pact . In the long term , large budget deficits lead either to a crisis or to slower economic growth . But even in the short term , there is a negative correlation between large budget deficits , slow economic growth , high inflation , and a distorted foreign-exchange market . 
Moreover , fiscal deficits and inflation squeeze out investment and limit productivity gains . 
Strengthen single-market policies . The benefits of the single market are evident , not least by creating a much more attractive location for foreign investors . 
Surveys indicate that the internal market has helped more than 60 % of companies that export to more than five EU countries boost their cross-border sales , and that 80 % of consumers believe that the range of goods has increased , while 67 % say that their quality has improved . 
Cross-border trade in goods has grown by around a third since the creation of the Internal Market in 1992 due to two principles : mutual recognition , which allows companies to apply their own national rules , and EU directives that harmonize national rules . 
But mutual recognition does not work well for relatively more complex products , and EU directives affecting items like construction products , machinery , and pressure equipment have been problematic to implement . 
Pre-tax prices of new cars can differ up to 70 % between member states due in large part to regulations that suppress competition . 
Services are even more susceptible than goods to internal market barriers . 
For example , a new directive requires non-household customers to be able to choose their electricity supplier by July 2004 and their gas supplier by July 2007 . 
But the directive ignores household customers , who in 2001 were able to choose their electricity supplier in only five EU States and their gas supplier in only three . 
As for labor mobility , practice has yet to catch up with theory . 
In 1992-2002 , only 4 % of the total EU population moved across borders either to work or to retire . 
During this period , only 8 % of EU students completed part of their studies in another member state . 
Integration of EU financial markets - launched in 1999 with the adoption of the Financial Services Action Plan ( FSAP ) - also needs to accelerate . 
According to the European Commission , creating a single European capital market would reduce the cost of equity capital for EU businesses by 0.5 % and lower the cost of corporate debt financing by 0.4 % . 
It would also boost GDP in the EU-15 over ten years by about 1.1 % and raise employment by 0.5 % . 
But , by 2002 , only 31 of the FSAP &apos;s 42 provisions had been implemented . 
Target early EMU entry . Entry into the euro as soon as possible is the best strategy for the accession countries , because it will mobilize them to complete structural reforms in order to meet the Maastricht criteria for inflation , interest rates , fiscal deficits , and public debt . 
This would have obvious benefits for long-term economic growth , as would elimination of exchange-rate risks , hedging costs , and transaction costs in foreign trade . 
The accession countries are already highly integrated with the EU economy , with pronounced cyclical convergence between the accession countries and the EMU countries . 
Continuing EU integration is likely to align the business cycles of these countries in a manner similar to the synchronization of supply and demand shocks in the EU in the 1990 &apos;s . 
Thus , costs associated with giving up an independent monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate would not be significant . 
In each of these areas , the Union &apos;s new members still face a difficult path to full integration . 
In many of them , so does the EU .
