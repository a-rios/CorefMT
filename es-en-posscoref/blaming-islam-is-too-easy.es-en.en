Blaming Islam is Too Easy 
The terrorist attacks in America and the war against the Taliban have incited wide speculation about the relationship between culture and economic development . 
Most pointedly , is the Islamic world thwarted from modernizing because its culture is trapped in the Middle Ages ? 
Is poor economic development in much of the Middle East and Central Asia the result of cultural practices that are hostile to economic growth ? 
The usual charge is that the Islamic world missed the advances of the European Enlightenment , when the state and religion were separated , modern scientific ideas were adopted , and cultural attitudes towards women modernized . 
As a result , it is alleged , the Islamic world cannot cope with the demands of modernization , either in technology or in cultural practices , such as the granting of rights to women , which is necessary for economic success in the modern world . 
As always with crude generalizations , elements of truth are intermixed with a mass of confusion . 
The truth is that certain cultural practices support economic modernization . 
These include a tendency towards greater equality between men and women and their roles in society ; a culture that rewards educational attainment with high social status ; the secularization of many aspects of modern life , including the preeminence of modern science ; and cultural practices that favor social mobility in the choice of occupations . 
The falsehood is to believe that some cultures are static and inimical to change , while others are somehow uniquely modern . 
In all parts of the world , cultures have had to adjust to the changes in economic organization , technology , and scientific knowledge of the past two hundred years . 
In Western Europe and the US , for example , the cultural acceptance of social and economic equality between men and women has involved a long process of political struggle and evolving social norms . 
The pace of change has varied markedly within regions and across cultural sub-groups . 
The Islamic world , which stretches over 15,000 kilometers , dozens of countries , and more than 1 billion followers of the faith , is similarly subject to widespread cultural variation . 
Islamic countries in the Mediterranean region ( such as Morocco , Tunisia , Egypt , and Turkey ) are culturally and politically distinct from Islamic countries in the Arabian Peninsula ( such as Saudi Arabia , Yemen , and Oman ) , which differ from Islamic countries in Central Asia ( such as Afghanistan , Pakistan , Tajikistan ) , Southeast Asia ( such as Indonesia and Malaysia ) and Sub-Saharan Africa ( such as Mali and Chad ) . 
Consider one example : the number of children per woman in society , known as the &quot; total fertility rate . &quot; 
In societies where women are not allowed to work and are expected to remain home and raise children , the number of children is very high . 
Economic growth tends to suffer : when poor households have many children , the education given to each child also tends to be reduced . 
In some parts of the Islamic world , most notably in the Arabian peninsula , the fertility rate remains very high . 
A woman in Yemen will on average give birth to more than 7 children in her lifetime . 
In Saudi Arabia , the average is over 6 children . 
In other parts of the Islamic world , the fertility rate is far lower and has declined in recent decades , signaling a major shift in cultural norms . 
In Tunisia , the average fertility rate has dropped from 6.2 in the 1970s to 2.3 today , just slightly above the 2.0 average in the US . 
Similarly , in Turkey the fertility rate fell from 5.2 in the early 1970s to 2.7 in the late 1990s . 
In Indonesia , the decline in fertility rates was about the same . 
Women have entered the labor force in these societies in much greater number , delivering economic gains and improvements in their social status . 
We can therefore note that in Islamic societies like Tunisia , Turkey , Indonesia , and Malaysia , economic growth and cultural change has proceeded rapidly in the past generation . 
Some of these countries have been among the world &apos;s fastest growing economies in recent decades . 
Islamic culture has neither been a barrier to growth , nor has it been static . 
As in other parts of the world , culture in these countries has shown its vibrancy and also its capacity to adjust to changing conditions . 
In the Arabian peninsula , cultural change has been slower , as has economic development . 
Causation probably runs in both directions here : cultural factors may have impeded economic growth , while poor economic performance ( say , bad economic policies and over-dependence on oil ) may have slowed the adaptation of cultural practices to the needs of a modern economy . 
In very remote places like Afghanistan or Chad , weak connections with the world economy also delayed the process of social change . 
These examples should warn us away from three current tendencies . 
The first is to give easy labels to complex and diverse societies . 
The idea of a single conservative &quot; Islamic world &quot; is as mistaken as a single modern &quot; Western society . &quot; 
Diversity is very high ; cultural practices vary widely . 
Simplistic labels reflect more prejudice than understanding . 
The second tendency is to believe that culture is somehow static and unchanging . 
Cultures everywhere change in response to technological developments , economic growth , and - of course - globalization . 
The third tendency is to believe that culture is the key to economic development . 
Cultural differences across societies are often more the outcome than the cause of differences in economic development .
