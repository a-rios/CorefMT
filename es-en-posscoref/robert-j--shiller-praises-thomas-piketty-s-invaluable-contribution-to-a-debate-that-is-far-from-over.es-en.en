Inequality Disaster Prevention 
NEW HAVEN - Thomas Piketty &apos;s impressive and much-discussed book Capital in the Twenty-First Century has brought considerable attention to the problem of rising economic inequality . 
But it is not strong on solutions . 
As Piketty admits , his proposal - a progressive global tax on capital ( or wealth ) - &quot; would require a very high and no doubt unrealistic level of international cooperation . &quot; 
We should not be focusing on quick solutions . 
The really important concern for policymakers everywhere is to prevent disasters - that is , the outlier events that matter the most . 
And , because inequality tends to change slowly , any disaster probably lies decades in the future . 
That disaster - a return to levels of inequality not seen since the late nineteenth to early twentieth century - is amply described in Piketty &apos;s book . 
In this scenario , a tiny minority becomes super-rich - not , for the most part , because they are smarter or work harder than everyone else , but because fundamental economic forces capriciously redistribute incomes . 
In The New Financial Order : Risk in the 21st Century , I proposed &quot; inequality insurance &quot; as a way to avert disaster . 
Despite the similarity of their titles , my book is very different from Piketty &apos;s . 
Mine openly advocates innovative scientific finance and insurance , both private and public , to reduce inequality , by quantitatively managing all of the risks that contribute to it . 
And I am more optimistic about my plan to prevent disastrous inequality than Piketty is about his . 
Inequality insurance would require governments to establish very long-term plans to make income-tax rates automatically higher for high-income people in the future if inequality worsens significantly , with no change in taxes otherwise . 
I called it inequality insurance because , like any insurance policy , it addresses risks beforehand . 
Just as one must buy fire insurance before , not after , one &apos;s house burns down , we have to deal with the risk of inequality before it becomes much worse and creates a powerful new class of entitled rich people who use their power to consolidate their gains . 
In 2006 , I co-authored a draft paper with Leonard Burman and Jeffrey Rohaly of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution &apos;s Tax Policy Center that analyzed variations on such a plan . 
In 2011 , Ian Ayres and Aaron Edlin proposed a similar idea . 
Underlying such plans is the assumption that some substantial degree of inequality is economically healthy . 
The prospect of becoming rich clearly drives many people to work hard . 
But massive inequality is intolerable . 
Of course , there is no guarantee that an inequality-insurance plan will actually be carried out by governments . 
But they are more likely to follow such plans if they are already legislated and take effect gradually , according to a formula known in advance , rather than suddenly in some revolutionary departure from past practice . 
To be truly effective , increases in wealth taxes - which fall more on highly mobile retired or other affluent people - would have to include a global component ; otherwise , the rich would simply emigrate to whichever country has the lowest tax rates . 
And the unpopularity of wealth taxes has impeded global cooperation . 
Finland had a wealth tax but dropped it . 
So did Austria , Denmark , Germany , Sweden , and Spain . 
Increasing wealth taxes now , as Piketty proposes , would strike many people as unfair , because it would amount to imposing a retroactive levy on the work carried out to accumulate that wealth in the past - a change to the rules of the game , and its outcome , after the game is over . 
Older people who worked hard to accumulate wealth over the course of their lifetime would be taxed on their frugality to benefit people who didn &apos;t even try to save . 
If they had been told that the tax was coming , maybe they would not have saved so much ; maybe they would have paid the income tax and consumed the rest , like everybody else . 
Moreover , once the reality of a Piketty-type wealth tax was understood , the rich might procreate more , because wealth in the form of children cannot be taxed away - which is why it would probably be better to tax income and maintain a deduction for philanthropic contributions outside of the family . 
And , if there are to be wealth taxes , instituting them now to take effect only in the future - and only if inequality becomes much worse - would preempt the perception that the rules had been changed after the game had ended . 
The advantage of income-tax increases is that they could be based not just on current income , but on some average of income over the course of years , and could allow deductions for investments , thus sharing some features with wealth taxes without penalizing those who saved more to accumulate more wealth . 
Moreover , a long-term plan legislated by one or a few countries today , before any substantial impact on actual tax payments occurs , could help to promote an international dialogue about appropriate future policy toward inequality . 
That would create room for a more uniform tax response among countries , thus reducing the ability of the super-rich to evade taxation by switching location . 
Piketty &apos;s book makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary inequality . 
He has identified a serious risk to our society . 
Policymakers have a responsibility to implement a workable way to insure against it .
