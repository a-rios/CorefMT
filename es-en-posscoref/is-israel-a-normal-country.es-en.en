Is Israel a Normal Country ? 
NEW YORK  -  Israel &apos;s decision in May to drop commandoes onto a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists was brutal . 
The killing of nine civilians by those commandoes was a terrible consequence . 
Israel &apos;s blockade of Gaza and occupation of Palestinian territories on the West Bank , not to mention the road blocks , destruction of homes , and other daily torments of the Palestinians , are also a form of institutionalized inhumanity . 
Nevertheless , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s description of the Israeli raid on the activists &quot; boat as &quot; an attack on the conscience of humanity , &quot; which &quot; deserves every kind of curse , &quot; and as a &quot; turning point in history &quot; after which &quot; nothing will be the same , &quot; seems hysterical . 
Whatever one thinks of various Israeli governments ( and I don &apos;t think much of the current one ) , reactions to Israeli government-sponsored violence tend to be much fiercer - not just in Turkey - than to crimes committed by the leaders of other countries , with the exception perhaps of the United States . 
But then , in the minds of many critics , the two countries are often conflated . 
Israel has never done anything comparable to the late Syrian leader Haffez al-Assad &apos;s 1982 massacre of more than 20,000 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama . 
Far more Muslims are still being murdered by fellow Muslims than by Israelis , or indeed by Americans . 
And if one thinks of the death toll of the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( more than four million ) , talk of turning points in history , after the killing of nine people , sounds a little absurd . 
But none of that seems to count as much as what Israel does . 
So is it true , as many defenders of Israel claim , that the Jewish state is judged by different standards from other countries ? 
I believe that it is . 
But , while anti-Semitism certainly plays a part , it may not be the main reason . 
Especially after the 1973 &quot; Yom Kippur &quot; War , many Europeans , I suspect , sighed with relief that Jews could be aggressors , too . 
Jewish brutality relieved the burden of wartime guilt . 
Eagerness to overcome this guilt might even have prompted some people to exaggerate Israeli aggression . 
The old anti-Semitic slogan , promoted by the Nazi newspaper Der St√ºrmer , that &quot; the Jews are our misfortune , &quot; has been given new currency by the Israeli conflict with the Palestinians . 
There are other reasons , however , for the double standard directed at Israel . 
One is what the liberal Israeli philosopher and peace activist Avishai Margalit has termed &quot; moral racism . &quot; 
The bloodlust of an African or Asian people is not taken as seriously that of a European - or other white - people . 
After all , some might say ( and many more might think ) , what can one expect from savages ? 
They don &apos;t know any better . 
This is , of course , a deeply colonial sentiment , and the legacy of colonialism works against Israel in another way , too . 
As was true of Apartheid-era South Africa , Israel reminds people of the sins of Western imperialism . 
Israel is regarded in the Middle East , as well as by many people in the West , as a colony led by white people ( even though many prominent Israelis have their roots in Teheran , Fez , or Baghdad ) . 
The Palestinians are seen as colonial subjects , and the longer Israel continues to occupy Arab territories , the more this perception will be confirmed . 
Finally , Israel is still a democracy , so it should not be judged by the same standards as dictatorships . 
We must expect more of Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government than of , say , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s regime in Iran , not because Jews are morally superior to Persians , but because Netanyahu was freely elected and is subject to the rule of law , whereas Ahmadinejad has helped to wreck whatever was democratic about Iran . 
In a sense , to hold Israel to the highest standards is to pay it the compliment of being treated like a normal democracy . 
If some critics of Israel refuse to treat Israel as a normal country , however , the same is true of some of Israel &apos;s staunchest defenders . 
Special pleading for Israel as a nation of victims - the natural heirs of the targets of Nazi mass murder - is another way to apply a double standard . 
The French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut was right to criticize the Erdogan for over-reacting to the raid on the &quot; Gaza freedom flotilla . &quot; 
Israel as a nation of victims is , in fact , contrary to its founders &quot; creed . 
They wanted to create a new nation , a normal nation , a nation of good Jewish soldiers and farmers , different from the powerless Jews who fell victim to European persecution . 
It was only later , starting perhaps with the Eichmann trial in 1961 , that the Holocaust became a staple of state propaganda . 
Later still , under such leaders as Menachem Begin , military enterprises were justified by references to the Nazi genocide . 
That all Jews , including Israeli Jews , should remain haunted by a horrible past is understandable . 
But it must never be used to justify aggression against others . 
Israel is an immensely powerful country - freer , richer , and better armed than all its neighbors . 
Holding its leaders to account for their actions is essential , not only to protect Palestinians from brutality , but to preserve the freedom of Israelis . 
Allowing the past to cloud our critical faculties undermines Israeli democracy , and will have further dangerous consequences in the future .
