The Return of American Realism 
NEW YORK - There are many recurring debates in American foreign policy - for example , isolationism versus internationalism , and unilateralism versus multilateralism . 
But no debate is more persistent than that between those who believe that American foreign policy &apos;s principal purpose should be to influence the external behavior of other states and those who hold that it should be to shape their internal nature . 
This debate between &quot; realists &quot; and &quot; idealists &quot; is intense and long-standing . 
During the Cold War , there were those who argued that the United States should try to &quot; roll back &quot; the Soviet Union , bring down the communist system , and replace it with democratic capitalism . 
Others deemed this to be too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons , and the US opted instead for a policy of containment , working to limit the reach of Soviet power and influence . 
As it turned out , after 40 years of containment , the Soviet Union and its empire unraveled , though this outcome was a byproduct of US policy , not its principal purpose . 
George W. Bush was the most recent &quot; idealist &quot; proponent of making democracy promotion the main priority for US foreign policy . 
Bush embraced the so-called &quot; democratic peace &quot; theory , which holds that democracies not only treat their own citizens better , but also act better toward their neighbors and others . 
It was , of course , his father , George H.W. Bush , who was a strong representative of the alternative , &quot; realist &quot; approach to American foreign policy . 
Much of this debate can be viewed through the lens of American involvement with Iraq . 
George W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 2003 to change the government . 
He expected regime change in Baghdad to lead to a democratic Iraq , a development that would in turn transform the region when people elsewhere in the Arab world saw this example and forced their own governments to follow suit . 
By contrast , in the earlier Iraq war , the first President Bush , after amassing an unprecedented international coalition that succeeded in liberating Kuwait , did not press ahead to Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein and his government , despite the urging of many that he do just that . 
Nor did he intervene on behalf of the Shia and Kurdish uprisings that erupted just after the war ended early in 1991 . 
To him , intervention would have placed US soldiers in the midst of a complex domestic struggle , one that would have cost enormous resources to sort out if it could be sorted out at all . 
President Barack Obama appears to agree with this realist approach . 
The new US policy toward Afghanistan makes no mention of trying to transform that country into a democracy . 
On the contrary , as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated before Congress in January , &quot; If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of Central Asian Valhalla over there , we will lose . &quot; 
For his part , Obama said in March that &quot; We have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan , and to prevent their return to either country in the future . &quot; 
This shift is also evident in US policy toward China . 
Speaking during her trip to Asia in February , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made clear that human rights issues would be a secondary concern in US-China relations . 
Similarly , the joint statement issued by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev after their April 1 meeting in London , while mentioning that US-Russia relations would be &quot; guided by the rule of law , respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights , and tolerance for different views , &quot; placed far greater emphasis on reducing nuclear arms , addressing Iran &apos;s nuclear program , and stabilizing Afghanistan . 
US support for Russia &apos;s admission to the World Trade Organization was unconditional . 
This change in US foreign policy is both desirable and necessary . 
Mature democracies do tend to act more responsibly , but immature democracies can easily succumb to populism and nationalism . 
It is difficult and time-consuming to build mature democracies . 
While encouraging the rule of law and the growth of civil society , the US still needs to work with other governments , democratic and otherwise . 
Pressing problems , such as the economic crisis , nuclear proliferation , and climate change , will not wait . 
The good news is that history shows that it is possible to make peace with and work with non-democracies . 
Israel , for example , has had peaceful relations with non-democratic Egypt and Jordan for more than three decades . 
The US and the Soviet Union cooperated in limited ways ( for example , in controlling nuclear arms ) despite fundamental differences . 
Today , the US and authoritarian China have mutually beneficial trade and financial ties , and have shown on occasion that they can work together on strategic issues , for example in shaping North Korea &apos;s behavior . 
This is not to say that promoting democracy will have no role in American foreign policy . 
It will , and it should . 
But democracy promotion is too uncertain a proposition , and the world too dangerous a place , for it to occupy center stage in what the United States does . 
Barack Obama &apos;s foreign policy will thus resemble that of George Bush - the father , that is , not the son .
