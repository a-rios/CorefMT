Britain &apos;s Cultural Kowtow 
LONDON - You would think that the British , having practically invented appeasement , and paid a heavy price for it , would know better . 
But appeasement of China for commercial gain apparently is not considered morally repellent . 
How else could Liu Binjie , China &apos;s censor-in-chief and the point man for silencing the Nobel laureate writer and human-rights activist Liu Xiaobo , be invited to lead a delegation of 21 officially sanctioned writers and dozens of ministerial minions to London to celebrate Chinese literature at the London Book Fair ? 
Indeed , Liu is the British Council &apos;s guest of honor for the event . 
The Council says that it invited officially approved Chinese writers because it wanted to create greater understanding of Chinese literature and promote cultural exchange between the two countries . 
But is it really true that the world can or should learn about China only by reading works that are sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party ? 
After all , didn &apos;t Boris Pasternak , Alexander Solzhenitsyn , Milan Kundera , and Václav Havel teach the world as much about the repressive societies in which they lived than anything turned out by the Soviet bloc &apos;s official publishers ? 
The Council &apos;s excuse is a smokescreen , and simultaneously kowtows to Chinese totalitarianism and insults those Chinese writers who have been imprisoned , banned , or forced into exile merely for writing what their conscience demands . 
In his &quot; My Statement on Leaving China &quot; ( 去国宣言 ) , Yu Jie , a writer who left for the United States in order to escape persecution , explicitly declared that he was forced to flee his country in order to write freely . 
Before his exile , Yu had been thrown into a dark room and tortured , because Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 . 
Indeed , at the moment the award was handed over in Oslo , several policemen were pummeling Yu &apos;s face , saying , &quot; We are going to beat you to death to avenge the government &apos;s humiliation . &quot; 
Today , China is producing literary exiles at a faster rate that the Soviet Union ever achieved . 
No British governmental institution would have invited the chief Soviet censor as its guest of honor at an event celebrating Russian literature . 
So , why the double standard ? 
We all know the answer : money . 
China has it , and Britain and other Western countries want it . 
They want Chinese consumers to buy their products . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron wants to change the fact that Britain exports more to tiny Ireland than it does to China . 
A little literary appeasement seems a small price to pay . 
Today , growing political terror is having a stifling effect on Chinese society . 
More than 100 writers have been thrown into prison for publishing political essays on the Internet , and their family members have been monitored , or , like Liu Xiaobo &apos;s wife , have been placed under house arrest . 
Last year , the writer Zhu Yufu published a poem online , a verse of which reads : &quot; It &apos;s time Chinese people ! / the square belongs to everyone / the feet are yours / it &apos;s time to use your feet and take to the square to make a choice . &quot; 
For this , he was detained for &quot; inciting subversion of state power , &quot; and in February was sentenced to seven years in jail . 
In repressive societies , good literature is by definition subversive . 
With the simplest of words , Zhu was attempting to awaken a nation , and , for China &apos;s dictators , nothing is more subversive or terrifying than the word &quot; choice . &quot; 
China is shipping 10,000 titles to the London Book Fair . 
That &quot; choice &quot; may seem overwhelming , but it would be safe to bet that not one of these books probes impartially the taboos of Chinese politics and recent history . 
In China , thousands of &quot; sensitive words , &quot; including &quot; self-immolating lamas , &quot; &quot; democracy , &quot; &quot; human rights , &quot; &quot; Tiananmen protest , &quot; and even the title of my book Beijing Coma , cannot even be searched online . 
This ever-growing list of forbidden words and taboo subjects , drawn up by Liu Binjie and his army of censors , starves the nation &apos;s soul and encages the minds of writers . 
The British Council claims that it is showcasing &quot; the amazing breadth and diversity of Chinese literature today . &quot; 
But any genuinely diverse discussion would include not only the 21 state-approved writers on the list , but other officially recognized writers on the more critical end of the spectrum , such as Yan Lianke , who was refused permission to attend this year &apos;s London Book Fair three times . 
A diverse discussion would also have to include writers who have been completely silenced in China , such as Wang Lixiong , Tan Hecheng , Mo Jiangang , and Yang Jisheng . 
The works of these banned writers are packed with vivid detail about contemporary Chinese life . 
Their literary power derives from their authors &quot; courage to ask awkward questions and write with honesty . 
The British Council &apos;s decision to ignore them , as well as exiled writers banned from entering China , such as myself , has turned what should be a cultural event into an unprincipled commercial-political transaction . 
Britain has not only produced great literature , but has an historic tradition of supporting free speech and providing refuge for persecuted writers . 
Not Napoleon , not Tsar Nicholas I , not even Hitler when he was being appeased in the 1930 &quot; s , could force Britain to compromise on its commitment to intellectual freedom . 
Instead , the task of corrupting a centuries-old humanistic tradition has fallen to the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s ignoble censor-in-chief and engineer of China &apos;s literary exodus - and to the greed of some for Chinese gold .
