China &apos;s Jobless Growth Miracle 
BEIJING - Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang recently cited job creation as vital to his country &apos;s &quot; ultimate goal of stability in growth . &quot; 
His observation could not be more accurate . 
In fact , one of the most baffling features of China &apos;s economic rise is that , even amid double-digit GDP growth , employment grew at a measly 1.8 % average annual rate from 1978 to 2004 . 
Households , it seems , have largely missed out on the benefits of economic development in China . 
The superficial explanation of the discrepancy between GDP growth and job gains attributes the gap to the restructuring of inefficient state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , which caused public-sector employment to plummet , from 112.6 million to 67 million , from 1995 to 2004 . 
But there is a more fundamental cause : China &apos;s bias toward industrialization . 
China &apos;s government has long viewed industrialization as the key to modernization . 
During Chairman Mao &apos;s Great Leap Forward , scrap metals were melted to meet wildly optimistic steel-production targets and thus to propel rapid industrial development . 
Today , the government promotes industrial and infrastructure projects that , by encouraging investment and generating tax revenues , enable the economy to meet ambitious - though no longer harebrained - growth targets . 
The problem is that the manufacturing sector does little to create jobs , largely because relatively high productivity growth in the sector - averaging more than 10 % annually over the last two decades - constrains demand for more workers . 
By contrast , China &apos;s services sector has registered only about 5 % annual productivity growth , and thus is a much more effective engine of job creation . 
In fact , services are responsible for the lion &apos;s share of employment in most advanced economies . 
But , whereas 80 % of the American labor force was employed in service industries in 2012 , only 36 % of China &apos;s workers worked in the sector . 
To bolster employment in services , China &apos;s government must loosen its regulatory grip , ease barriers to entry in branches like telecommunications , and encourage labor mobility . 
China &apos;s focus on industrial production is problematic in another respect : it is extremely capital-intensive , owing largely to the distortions wrought by government policies . 
Beyond keeping interest rates below market levels , the government offered the automobile , machinery , and steel industries , among others , preferential access to cheap credit , favorable tax treatment , and public investment support . 
Such policies spurred firms to adopt capital-intensive technologies , obscuring labor &apos;s natural comparative advantages . 
At the same time , the government &apos;s interventions have limited the growth of private-sector firms by impeding their access to finance . 
Though SOEs employ only 13 % of the total workforce , and contribute about 30 % of GDP , they absorb half of all investment . 
Together , banks and the government provide about 35 % of investment in SOEs , but only 10 % of investment in private companies . 
But private firms are significantly more labor-intensive than SOEs - which use almost four times as much capital - and thus have been responsible for most of China &apos;s job creation in recent decades . 
With average employment growth of 10.4 % per year , the formal private sector partly compensated for the SOE layoffs from 1995 to 2004 . 
The informal sector grew even faster , at an annual rate of 24 % , albeit from a low base . 
Given the obvious benefits of a flourishing and rapidly expanding private sector , China &apos;s government should take steps to ensure that such firms - especially the small and medium-size enterprises that so often are crowded out of credit markets - can access the capital they need to expand . 
This would inevitably lead to a surge in job creation . 
The uncomfortable truth is that Chinese households have benefited far too little from the country &apos;s economic-growth miracle . 
Indeed , households &quot; share of national income has declined considerably in the last decade , in sharp contrast to the advanced economies , where households &quot; share is consistently high . 
By allowing the private sector to flourish , and encouraging the shift toward a services-oriented economy , China &apos;s government could bolster employment growth and , in turn , domestic consumption . 
As Li seems to recognize , structural rebalancing is needed not only to improve Chinese citizens &quot; wellbeing , but also to bolster economic and social stability at a time of profound global uncertainty .
