A New Vision for India 
NEW DELHI - India &apos;s Bharatiya Janata Party , led by Narendra Modi , has stormed into office , winning its first absolute majority and reducing the formerly dominant Congress party to a rump , with just 44 of 543 seats in the lower house . 
Although India &apos;s sputtering economy was the dominant issue in the campaign , Modi &apos;s victory implies a significant transformation ahead for India &apos;s foreign policy as well . 
In short , an era of timidity and hesitation , bordering on paralysis , under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) has ended . 
There is no shortage of external challenges facing India &apos;s new government . 
Upon assuming office in 2004 , the UPA frittered away the positive national-security and foreign-policy position that the previous BJP government had achieved , neglecting key partnerships as it struggled to work effectively in the face of chronic infighting . 
For example , the Communist-led Left Front , part of the UPA , foiled the implementation of the momentous civil nuclear deal with the United States , and consistently undermined the creation of a balanced nuclear-liability bill . 
Indeed , that bill is still languishing - a situation that Modi should rectify soon . 
With its decisive parliamentary majority ( 282 seats , plus another 50 or so held by its allies ) , the BJP has the mandate that Modi needs to pursue a bold and creative foreign-policy agenda . 
The question is whether he will use his political capital effectively to advance India &apos;s interests . 
Even while it adopts a more emphatic international posture , Modi &apos;s government must guard against regression to non-aligned posturing and overzealous assertion of &quot; strategic autonomy . &quot; 
Instead , it must follow the global trend toward economic and security alliances . 
Economic diplomacy will undoubtedly play a central role in Modi &apos;s efforts . 
After all , India &apos;s international prominence is based largely on its economic potential . 
Among India &apos;s top priorities should be measures to strengthen its relationships in its immediate neighborhood . 
Modi has already highlighted the imperative of making the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) a &quot; living body , &quot; instead of the moribund group that it was under Congress . 
To this end , the relevant parties must abandon the usual saber rattling , and implement confidence-building measures . 
This logic likely drove Modi &apos;s decision to invite SAARC leaders - including Pakistan &apos;s Nawaz Sharif - to witness his swearing in as Prime Minister . 
To build on this , Modi should work to expand intra-regional trade linkages and foster person-to-person connections . 
Of course , economic cooperation and development will be impossible without sustained peace - and that will not be easy to achieve in a region beset by deep-rooted tensions , including between India and Pakistan , and the threat of state-sponsored terrorism . 
Making matters worse , India and China are locked in a longstanding border dispute . 
Add to that the turmoil in the nearby Middle East - exacerbated by America &apos;s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan - and India &apos;s security situation is not immediately conducive to harmony and cooperation . 
A more peaceful and prosperous future will demand a clear and credible strategic vision from Modi , including a zero tolerance approach to terrorists and their sponsors . 
At the same time , with the US retreating from the Middle East , India must take responsibility for the security of its interests in the region , such as by developing a blue-water naval capacity to secure its maritime energy-trade routes . 
This imperative is one of the factors linking India and Japan . 
As many Indian strategists have noted , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may embody the kind of self-confident and decisive leader that Modi aspires to become . 
Increased investment and defense cooperation with Japan will add much-needed substance to India &apos;s &quot; Look East &quot; policy , which could be advanced further by implementing long-planned projects with Bangladesh , Myanmar , and Thailand , as well as by building road and maritime infrastructure and strengthening trade links . 
Engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - something that the Congress government was always reluctant to pursue - must also become a priority , if only to ensure regional stability . 
India &apos;s membership in the ASEAN + 6-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership was a step in the right direction , but much more needs to be done . 
But India &apos;s most important partnership remains that with the US . 
The problem is that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did not seem to recognize this , leading to a growing divide that has cost India dearly . 
And Modi &apos;s relationship with the US has not been entirely positive , either , owing to American officials &quot; decision to deny him a visa following the deaths of many Muslims during riots a decade ago in Gujarat , where he was Chief Minister . 
Given the bilateral relationship &apos;s economic and strategic importance , Modi must reinvigorate ties , and quickly . 
For starters , he must work with the US to address commercial and economic issues , including American concerns over India &apos;s weak intellectual-property protections and fears within India &apos;s information-technology industry regarding proposed US immigration reform . 
Success will require both sides &quot; patience and willingness to compromise , bolstered by confidence-building measures . 
For its part , India could initiate realistic tax reforms , like eliminating transfer-pricing and retroactive taxation . 
Modi &apos;s final foreign-policy challenge is Russia - another country that the Congress-led government neglected . 
Modi must now assess what kind of relationship can reasonably be expected with President Vladimir Putin &apos;s increasingly assertive administration , while recognizing that it is not in India &apos;s interests to have Putin view China as Russia &apos;s only potential strategic partner in Asia . 
One way to gauge India &apos;s relationship with Russia - as well as with the US and even Israel - is to allow for increased foreign investment in domestic defense industries , including more co-production initiatives . 
Indeed , according to former US Under-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter , stronger military cooperation and increased technology transfer is the most effective approach to deepening US-India ties . 
Why not adopt the same approach to strengthen India &apos;s relationships with Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Japan ? 
Modi undoubtedly faces major foreign-policy challenges . 
But , with a clear , confident vision and credibility-enhancing policies , he has a rare opportunity to put India firmly on the path toward peace and prosperity .
