The Power of a European Energy Union 
DUBLIN - One of the top priorities established by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of his election last summer was the creation of a European energy union . 
He was right to do so . 
Done properly , a more cohesive energy policy could achieve three strategic objectives simultaneously . 
By coordinating research and investment , encouraging conservation , and integrating energy markets , an energy union would help fight climate change , provide Europe with a much needed economic stimulus , and protect the continent from supply shocks , such as those caused by the crises in North Africa and Ukraine . 
Of course , the European Union &apos;s ability to act is dependent on the willingness of its member states ; and , though some of the continent &apos;s leaders have championed the initiative , others have proved less enthusiastic . 
A crucial test of their collective resolve will be whether they are willing to support key infrastructure projects that deliver on all three objectives . 
One good example of such a project is the North Sea Countries &apos; Offshore Grid Initiative , a proposal that would link offshore wind farms to a new regional grid , and allow countries to balance variable power supplies across borders . 
The idea - first advanced in a 2009 memorandum of understanding signed by nine EU member states and Norway - has enormous potential ; by 2030 , North Sea winds could provide Europe with 10 % of its electricity - carbon-free . 
But if the project is to go forward , it urgently needs a political mandate . 
The integrated grid can be imagined as a large ring , connecting Norway with the United Kingdom , and then linking across the channel to France , Belgium , and Holland , before moving on to Germany and returning to Scandinavia . 
Its implementation would allow Europe to introduce a free-trade zone for renewable energy , reducing the need for storage and excess capacity to back up variable power supplies . 
Not only would the grid pay for itself ; once in place , it would reduce the cost of new wind farms by some 30 % , by providing them with an existing connection to energy markets . 
An interconnected energy system would make particular sense for the UK and Germany , which could use the one-hour time difference between them to smooth out the peaks and troughs in demand . 
Renewable energy production is by nature intermittent , and the sheer number of fluctuating power sources in Germany is already pushing its existing grid to the limit . 
Interconnection would also reduce the number of new onshore transmission lines the country needs . 
The German government has produced a policy paper outlining how a more integrated regional market might work . 
Last year , the UK matched Germany &apos;s investments in clean energy , spending some $ 15.2 billion on solar panels and wind farms . 
But Britain will need to do a lot more if it is to meet its climate targets . 
According to a parliamentary report , &quot; the cost of developing such a supergrid could be very high ... but it may bring a host of economic benefits - including tens of thousands of new jobs in the offshore renewable industry . &quot; 
A regional initiative would also allow Prime Minister David Cameron to accommodate opposition within his party to onshore renewable energy plants . 
Each of the individual countries involved in the project would benefit from its construction . 
Holland and Belgium need a cost-effective way to develop their own offshore resources . 
Denmark already benefits from an interconnected electricity market ; and the lesson it has learned is that it makes sense to integrate even further . 
Norway would be able to sell its hydropower and secure a backup supply should climate change leave it running dry . 
Advances in cable technology would allow Ireland to link to France , providing an alternative route to European markets if the UK elects to remain outside the network . 
Juncker &apos;s € 315 billion ( $ 360 billion ) investment plan , proposed in December , includes some € 87 billion in interconnection projects . 
It would make sense to combine these into a single initiative , with common standards for technology , planning , and regulations . 
Doing so would lower the cost of capital on loans from the European Investment Bank and give a boost to European technology companies . 
The Baltic states are also planning their own offshore grid . 
But it is not just Northern Europe that could gain from such an approach . 
Europe &apos;s southeastern and Mediterranean countries could also benefit from sharing power . 
Most of the necessary legal and regulatory framework is already in place . 
There is no need for treaty changes or complex new legislation . 
All that is needed is political direction , so that the European Commission can establish the necessary governance structures . 
The strength of Europe &apos;s commitment to a true energy union will be revealed when the European Council meets on March 19 . 
Among the decisions it will make will be whether to build these regional grids . 
If the EU and its member states reach an agreement , they could simultaneously boost their economies and improve their energy security . 
If not , they could end up buying the technology from China or the United States , which will be investing in their own grids in the coming years .
