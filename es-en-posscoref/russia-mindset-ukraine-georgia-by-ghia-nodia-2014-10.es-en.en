The Cold War and the Cold Shoulder 
TBILISI - The Ukraine crisis has shattered key Western assumptions about Russia , and many analysts and policymakers have fallen back on the belief that Russian President Vladimir Putin must be acting irrationally . 
But it is Western assumptions that need to be questioned . 
In particular , what has made Russia so keen to undermine the current international order , first in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine now ? 
On the surface , these campaigns seem like post-imperial territorial conflicts . 
Russia , according to this view , recognizes that it cannot get its old empire back , so it is chipping away at neighboring territories instead , justifying its actions by a nebulous concept of ethnic and historical justice . 
And , like Serbia &apos;s former President Slobodan Milošević , Putin dresses up foreign aggression as national salvation in order to bolster his domestic popularity and marginalize his opponents . 
Putin &apos;s approach closely resembles the vision set out by Russian Nobel laureate Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his 1990 essay &quot; Rebuilding Russia . &quot; 
Referring to the former Soviet satellite states , he suggested letting those &quot; ungrateful peoples &quot; go , but keeping Russia &apos;s rightful territories , such as eastern and southern Ukraine , northern Kazakhstan , and eastern Estonia , with their ethnic Russian populations , and Georgia &apos;s Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which are cultural extensions of Russia &apos;s North Caucasus . 
But it would be misleading to portray Putin as merely another out-of-control national romantic . 
He singled out Georgia and Ukraine not to redeem Russians &quot; emotional commitment to South Ossetia or Crimea , but to punish those countries for their dangerous liaisons with the West - in particular Georgia &apos;s ambition to join NATO and Ukraine &apos;s desire to sign an association agreement with the European Union . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s reaction is consistent with its recurrent discourse about being &quot; squeezed out &quot; of its own neighborhood and &quot; encircled &quot; by hostile Western powers . 
Western politicians &quot; vain attempts to convince Putin that the eastward expansion of NATO and the EU would benefit Russia by creating a zone of peace and prosperity along its borders were naive and insulting . 
It is not for Americans or Europeans , however reasonable they may sound , to tell Russia what is or is not in its interests . 
From the current Russian regime &apos;s perspective , declarations that EU and NATO expansion is about spreading values , accountable institutions , and good governance , not military or economic competition , is beyond hypocritical . 
The spread of Western values and institutions is precisely what Putin fears most . 
Supporting democracy on Russia &apos;s borders can have a dangerous &quot; demonstration &quot; effect , by encouraging ordinary Russians to demand the same for themselves . 
Indeed , Putin believes that the past decade &apos;s democratic uprisings in Georgia and Ukraine were Western conspiracies against Russia . 
That may sound paranoid , but his anxiety is rational : European-style democracy on Russia &apos;s borders would make it much harder to maintain authoritarian rule at home . 
But the insult represented by attempted EU and NATO expansion runs deeper . 
Russia &apos;s Cold War defeat and the loss of its empire transformed the country from a global superpower into a second-rate regional actor within just a couple of years , with a decade of economic upheaval and decline to follow . 
This geopolitical collapse occurred in part because Russians ( not to mention their &quot; captive nations &quot; in Central and Eastern Europe ) were seduced into believing that Western-style democracy and free markets worked better . 
Given this mindset , Putin and his supporters at home and abroad view democracy and free markets not as the path to peace and prosperity , but as part of a wicked conspiracy to destroy Russia . 
It does not help that when many Russians recall the country &apos;s experiment with democracy in the 1990s , they remember nothing but misery and humiliation . 
Western leaders are deceiving themselves if they think that cajoling and reasoning with Putin , or offering token signs of respect , can break that mindset . 
But turning a blind eye to Russian aggression , as the West did when Russia attacked Georgia in 2008 - portraying the conflict as a clash between two hotheaded leaders - is not an option , either . 
In short , while it is perfectly rational for the West to want Russia as a partner , Russia considers the US and the EU enemies . 
The West can offer no conceivable partnership terms that Putin would accept . 
History suggests that Russia changes only when it experiences an unambiguous geopolitical defeat . 
Its loss in the Crimean War of 1853-1856 led to the abolition of serfdom and other liberal reforms . 
Its defeat by Japan in 1905 brought about Russia &apos;s first parliament and the reforms of Pyotr Stolypin . 
The Afghanistan debacle of the 1980s created the environment that led to Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s perestroika . 
Ultimately , the Russian people will decide for themselves what constitutes a defeat . 
If Putin is able to portray his attack on Ukraine as a success , Russia will continue to bully and posture on the international stage . 
But if Russians come to believe that Ukraine was a misadventure , a very different country could emerge .
