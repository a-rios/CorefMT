Time to Talk with Iran 
BERLIN - The recent comprehensive assessment by America &apos;s spy agencies about Iran &apos;s nuclear program and ambitions - the so-called &quot; National Intelligence Estimate &quot; - has opened the door to fresh strategic discussions among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany . 
Such a strategic reconsideration is probably most necessary for those in the Bush administration ( and a few elsewhere ) , who until recently have been prophets of imminent danger . 
For Europeans , the NIE has not removed , but rather confirmed , the concerns that in 2003 prompted the EU-3 ( Britain , France , and Germany ) - namely , that Iran &apos;s nuclear program could eventually give it a military nuclear capability , and that even before that point , it might trigger regional nuclear proliferation . 
The NIE also confirmed two assumptions that have since guided European diplomatic approach : Iran reacts to external incentives and disincentives , and taking legitimate Iranian interests into consideration is the best way to influence Iran &apos;s leaders . 
Most Europeans who have been dealing with the issue also assume that Iran is aiming at capacities that would eventually make available all options , including quick development of a nuclear weapon , rather than actually acquiring , let alone testing , a weapon and thereby violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
So concern about Iran &apos;s nuclear program is still justified . 
The robust diplomatic approach that is needed to confront the problem must include three components . 
First , it should be based on a broad international consensus . 
Second , it should clearly communicate that the issue is proliferation , not the nature of the Iranian regime . 
Third , any further sanctions should be accompanied by an earnest offer of dialogue and engagement . 
By contrast , some American policymakers continue to believe that Iran would abandon its enrichment program if only the European Union imposed unilateral sanctions . 
But a clear-headed analysis of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s behavior indicates that EU sanctions would lead to more trade diversion , with China , Russia , Turkey , or Dubai benefiting from reduced levels of European exports to Iran . 
Of course , some imports would become more expensive for Iran , but the economic effect of such sanctions would remain limited . 
Politically , Ahmadinejad certainly would not miss the chance to exploit unilateral measures for propaganda purposes - claiming that Iran has a conflict not with the international community , but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological progress . 
For these reasons , Europeans favor a new Security Council resolution , even if its measures are weaker than what the United States or the EU could impose unilaterally . 
Such a resolution would send an effective signal to the Iranian public and political elite that Iran is in conflict with the entire international community . 
Iranians do not like to be isolated ; even the clerical elite has a strong interest in exchanges with the rest of the world , and they like to send their children to Western schools . 
Making it obvious that it is Ahmadinejad &apos;s policies that are isolating Iran would strengthen the still-fragile anti-Ahmadinejad alliance of pragmatic conservatives and reformers , which has lately become more vocal . 
This is important to bear in mind , as a parliamentary ( majlis ) election is scheduled for March 2008 . 
The election will not be entirely free , but the government will be unable to manipulate them entirely . 
The majlis plays a role in the political process , to the point of being able to induce or hinder policy changes : witness the way a conservative majlis blocked reformist President Mohammad Khatami in the last years of his term . 
Europeans should now be confident enough to call for a common policy with the US that focuses on domestic developments in Iran . 
Such a policy can include additional Security Council sanctions , but it must also carry an offer of dialogue that pragmatic forces in Iran would not refuse . 
Both the EU and the US should be prepared to enter into direct , comprehensive , and unconditional negotiations with Iran . 
Where security guarantees are concerned , America is Iran &apos;s actual foe and potential partner . 
So far , the two governments have communicated either through the EU or on strictly limited issues through their ambassadors in Baghdad . 
The US has so far insisted that it will agree to a comprehensive dialogue only if Iran first suspends its enrichment activities . 
But this should be the result of , not a precondition for , negotiations . 
Whatever the US and Europe decide to do about Iran will affect that country &apos;s internal political dynamics . 
There are no easy mechanics at work here . 
The best method of strengthening Ahmadinejad , however , appears to be to threaten the country and the regime as a whole . 
An honest offer of engagement would allow Ahmadinejad &apos;s pragmatic opponents to show that it is Iran &apos;s president and his controversial policies , not the West , that are at fault .
