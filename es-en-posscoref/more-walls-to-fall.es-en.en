More Walls to Fall 
MOSCOW - The German people , and the whole world alongside them , are celebrating a landmark date in history , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
Not many events remain in the collective memory as a watershed that divides two distinct periods . 
The dismantling of the Berlin Wall - that stark , concrete symbol of a world divided into hostile camps - is such a defining moment . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall brought hope and opportunity to people everywhere , and provided the 1980 &quot; s with a truly jubilant finale . 
That is something to think about as this decade draws to a close - and as the chance for humanity to take another momentous leap forward appears to be slipping away . 
The road to the end of the Cold War was certainly not easy , or universally welcomed at the time , but it is for just this reason that its lessons remain relevant . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , the world was at a historic crossroads . 
The East-West arms race had created an explosive situation . 
Nuclear deterrents could have failed at any moment . 
We were heading for disaster , while stifling creativity and development . 
Today , another planetary threat has emerged . 
The climate crisis is the new wall that divides us from our future , and current leaders are vastly underestimating the urgency , and potentially catastrophic scale , of the emergency . 
People used to joke that we will struggle for peace until there is nothing left on the planet ; the threat of climate change makes this prophesy more literal than ever . 
Comparisons with the period immediately before the Berlin Wall came down are striking . 
Like 20 years ago , we face a threat to global security and our very existence that no one nation can deal with alone . 
And , again , it is the people who are calling for change . 
Just as the German people declared their will for unity , the world &apos;s citizens today are demanding that action be taken to tackle climate change and redress the deep injustices that surround it . 
Twenty years ago , key world leaders demonstrated resolve , faced up to opposition and immense pressure , and the Wall came down . 
It remains to be seen whether today &apos;s leaders will do the same . 
Addressing climate change demands a paradigm shift on a scale akin to that required to end the Cold War . 
But we need a &quot; circuit-breaker &quot; to escape from the business-as-usual approach that currently dominates the political agenda . 
It was the transformation brought about by perestroika and glasnost that set the stage for the quantum leap to freedom for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , and opened the way for the democratic revolution that saved history . 
Climate change is complex and closely entwined with a host of other challenges , but a similar breakthrough in our values and priorities is needed . 
There is not just one wall to topple , but many . 
There is the wall between those states that are already industrialized and those that do not want to be held back in their economic development . 
There is the wall between those who cause climate change and those who suffer the consequences . 
There is the wall between those who heed the scientific evidence and those who pander to vested interests . 
And there is the wall between the citizens who are changing their own behavior and want strong global action , and the leaders who are so far letting them down . 
In 1989 , incredible changes that were deemed impossible just a few years earlier were implemented . 
But this was no accident . 
The changes resonated with the hopes of the time , and leaders responded . 
We brought down the Berlin Wall in the belief that future generations would be able to solve challenges together . 
Today , looking at the cavernous gulf between rich and poor , the irresponsibility that caused the global financial crisis , and the weak and divided responses to climate change , I feel bitter . 
The opportunity to build a safer , fairer , and more united world has been largely squandered . 
To echo the demand made of me by my late friend and sparring partner President Ronald Reagan : Mr. Obama , Mr. Hu , Mr. Singh , and , back in Berlin , Ms. Merkel and her European counterparts , &quot; Tear down this wall ! &quot; For this is your Wall , your defining moment . 
You cannot dodge the call of history . 
I appeal to heads of state and government to come in person to the climate change conference in Copenhagen this December and dismantle the wall . 
The people of the world expect you to deliver . 
Do not fail them .
