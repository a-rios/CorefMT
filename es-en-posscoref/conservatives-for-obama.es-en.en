Conservatives for Obama 
SAN FRANCISCO  -  
So was I , working out of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University . 
I am voting for Barack Obama . 
Meritocracy is at the core of American conservative beliefs . 
His administration has been inept , corrupt , and without accomplishment . 
After this performance , why give the Republicans another turn at the helm ? 
Let &apos;s give the other party a chance , even if its policies are not exactly what conservatives may like . 
In America , we call it &quot; throwing the bums out . &quot; 
When meritocracy is downgraded , as it has been during the Bush years , bad things happen . 
Worst of all , racism has flourished , because productivity and social utility have become less effective in protecting targets of discrimination . 
Nowhere is this better illustrated than in America &apos;s current debate over illegal immigration . 
It is not so much the illegality of their entrance into the US that riles many conservative Republicans ; it &apos;s the migrants themselves , especially Hispanics who can &apos;t speak English . 
Never mind that Hispanic migrants are among the hardest-working people in the US . 
It is a bitter irony that John McCain , the war hero , is considered a traitor by the conservative wing of his party because he has a compassionate attitude towards undocumented immigrants . 
Sadly , the Republican Party has been hijacked during the Bush years by sloganeers using code phrases like &quot; illegal immigration &quot; and &quot; protecting the middle class &quot; to mask their racism , and &quot; economic incentive effects &quot; to justify tax policies that are blatantly tilted to the rich . 
Responding to this politics of hate , Obama likes to call himself a &quot; hope monger , &quot; not a &quot; hate monger . &quot; 
It &apos;s a great line and it applies . 
Hope always sells well in America . 
Reagan understood that , and it is one of the reasons he was a great and beloved president , even if some of his policies were flawed . 
As Hillary Clinton , Obama &apos;s rapidly fading rival for the Democratic nomination is finding out to her dismay , policies can be an overrated commodity in presidential elections that really matter . 
The hope that Obama is holding out for Americans is one of reconciliation - racial , political , between the wealthy and the poor , and between America and its allies . 
This is powerful stuff , and dwarfs the narrow technocratic instincts of Mrs. Clinton , whose schoolgirl approach to the campaign has justly earned her defeat after defeat in the primaries . 
Just as Reagan had his &quot; Reagan Democrats &quot; who were attracted by his message of hope after the malaise of the Jimmy Carter years , Obama will have his &quot; Obama Republicans , &quot; attracted by the hope of national reconciliation and healing . 
Non-Americans must understand that there is yet another revolution brewing in the US , and that Senators Clinton and McCain are both likely to be swept away by it . 
When conservative Republicans support liberal Democrats ( Obama has been rated the most liberal member of the US Senate ) , &quot; the times they are a-changin , &quot; &quot; as Bob Dylan wrote 45 years ago . 
Moreover , a crucial difference today is that the generational conflict that so characterized the 1960 &quot; s - &quot; Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command , &quot; as Dylan put it - is absent . 
The young may be taking the lead - what Obama calls &quot; a revolution from the bottom up &quot; - but there is little opposition from today &apos;s parents . 
Indeed , I personally know a successful US hedge fund manager who is quite conservative and consistently votes Republican , but who is thinking of supporting Obama . 
His daughter dates an African-American , and , to his credit , he believes in racial reconciliation . 
True , an Obama victory would certainly increase his own taxes , but some things - for example , the promise of a multi-cultural America - are simply more important . 
There appear to be many Republicans and independents who feel the same way . 
Obama can lose these people , however , if he forgets that he is a reconciler , not a class warrior , and goes from tilting towards the poor to soaking the rich . 
In any case , America &apos;s allies should feel relieved by how the presidential election is shaping up . 
America needs Obama , but McCain is a reasonable alternative . 
He is no Bush , and conservative Republicans &quot; hatred of him is his badge of honor . 
He would stand up to the haters at home ( including those in his own party ) and to the terrorists abroad . 
That &apos;s a lot better than what we have today .
