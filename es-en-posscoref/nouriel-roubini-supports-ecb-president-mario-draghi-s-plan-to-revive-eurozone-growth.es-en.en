Abenomics , European-Style 
NEW YORK - Two years ago , Shinzo Abe &apos;s election as Japan &apos;s prime minister led to the advent of &quot; Abenomics , &quot; a three-part plan to rescue the economy from a treadmill of stagnation and deflation . 
Abenomics &quot; three components - or &quot; arrows &quot; - comprise massive monetary stimulus in the form of quantitative and qualitative easing ( QQE ) , including more credit for the private sector ; a short-term fiscal stimulus , followed by consolidation to reduce deficits and make public debt sustainable ; and structural reforms to strengthen the supply side and potential growth . 
It now appears - based on European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s recent Jackson Hole speech - that the ECB has a similar plan in store for the eurozone . 
The first element of &quot; Draghinomics &quot; is an acceleration of the structural reforms needed to boost the eurozone &apos;s potential output growth . 
Progress on such vital reforms has been disappointing , with more effort made in some countries ( Spain and Ireland , for example ) and less in others ( Italy and France , to cite just two ) . 
But Draghi now recognizes that the eurozone &apos;s slow , uneven , and anemic recovery reflects not only structural problems , but also cyclical factors that depend more on aggregate demand than on aggregate supply constraints . 
Thus , measures to increase demand are also necessary . 
Here , then , is Draghinomics &quot; second arrow : to reduce the drag on growth from fiscal consolidation while maintaining lower deficits and greater debt sustainability . 
There is some flexibility in how fast the fiscal target can be achieved , especially now that a lot of front-loaded austerity has occurred and markets are less nervous about the sustainability of public debt . 
Moreover , while the eurozone periphery may need more consolidation , parts of the core - say , Germany - could pursue a temporary fiscal expansion ( lower taxes and more public investment ) to stimulate domestic demand and growth . 
And a eurozone-wide infrastructure-investment program could boost demand while reducing supply-side bottlenecks . 
The third element of Draghinomics - similar to the QQE of Abenomics - will be quantitative and credit easing in the form of purchases of public bonds and measures to boost private-sector credit growth . 
Credit easing will start soon with targeted long-term refinancing operations ( which provide subsidized liquidity to eurozone banks in exchange for faster growth in lending to the private sector ) . 
When regulatory constraints are overcome , the ECB will also begin purchasing private assets ( essentially securitized bundles of banks &quot; new loans ) . 
Now Draghi has signaled that , with the eurozone one or two shocks away from deflation , the inflation outlook may soon justify quantitative easing ( QE ) like that conducted by the US Federal Reserve , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England : outright large-scale purchases of eurozone members &quot; sovereign bonds . 
Indeed , it is likely that QE will begin by early 2015 . 
Quantitative and credit easing could affect the outlook for eurozone inflation and growth through several transmission channels . 
Shorter- and longer-term bond yields in core and periphery countries - and spreads in the periphery - may decline further , lowering the cost of capital for the public and private sectors . 
The value of the euro may fall , boosting competitiveness and net exports . 
Eurozone stock markets could rise , leading to positive wealth effects . 
Indeed , as the likelihood of QE has increased over this year , asset prices have already moved upward , as predicted . 
These changes in asset prices - together with measures that increase private-sector credit growth - can boost aggregate demand and increase inflation expectations . 
One should also not discount the effect on &quot; animal spirits &quot; - consumer , business , and investor confidence - that a credible commitment by the ECB to deal with slow growth and low inflation may trigger . 
Some more hawkish ECB officials worry that QE will lead to moral hazard by weakening governments &quot; commitment to austerity and structural reforms . 
Moreover , QE may actually reduce moral hazard . 
If QE and looser short-term fiscal policies boost demand , growth , and employment , governments may be more likely to implement politically painful structural reforms and long-term fiscal consolidation . 
Indeed , the social and political backlash against austerity and reform is stronger when there is no income or job growth . 
Draghi correctly points out that QE would be ineffective unless governments implement faster supply side structural reforms and the right balance of short-term fiscal flexibility and medium-term austerity . 
In Japan , though QQE and short-term fiscal stimulus boosted growth and inflation in the short run , slow progress on the third arrow of structural reforms , along with the effects of the current fiscal consolidation , are now taking a toll on growth . 
As in Japan , all three arrows of Draghinomics must be launched to ensure that the eurozone gradually returns to competitiveness , growth , job creation , and medium-term debt sustainability in the private and public sectors . 
By the end of this year , it is to be hoped , the ECB will start to do its part by implementing quantitative and credit easing .
