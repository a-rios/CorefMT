A Strategic Rallying Cry for Europe 
MADRID - At the end of June , Greece was hurtling toward implosion and the European Union was consumed by an increasingly vicious internal debate over migration . 
That might not sound like the most auspicious time for the European Council to give final approval for the preparation of a long-awaited new &quot; global foreign and security strategy &quot; for the EU . 
But that is what happened , with the endorsement - complete with deliver-by date - buried in the conclusions of the Council &apos;s June 25-26 meeting . 
The initiative has the potential to revolutionize how Europe addresses the many challenges it now faces and , perhaps more important , to give the EU the sense of purpose that it so badly needs . 
That the EU needs a new security strategy is clear . 
The current one , created in 2003 , is deeply outmoded , as epitomized by its opening line : &quot; Europe has never been so prosperous , so secure , nor so free . &quot; 
This is clearly no longer the case today . 
The constant state of turmoil in which Europe has found itself is a result of the increasing complexity and intertwining of its internal and external realities - shaped , most notably , by four overlapping existential threats . 
First , Russia has revived a traditional security challenge that Europe had , it was thought , solved long ago . 
Second , transnational terrorism poses a multifaceted and fundamental danger . 
Third , a burgeoning migration crisis is raising questions about European values and identity . 
And finally , a general lack of vision for the future of the European project has led to disaffection throughout the continent , undermining cohesion and , in turn , the EU &apos;s capacity to address the trials it faces . 
These menaces exacerbate and intensify one another . 
The activities of terrorist groups contribute to violence and instability in neighboring regions , driving an increasing number of migrants to the EU . 
The difficulty of integrating immigrant communities into European societies has sometimes led to radicalization , providing ammunition to nationalist politicians and further fracturing Europe . 
Russia &apos;s leaders , too , have worked insidiously to break down solidarity , without which the EU is powerless to respond to the threats it faces . 
All of this raises serious questions about the EU &apos;s global role , while diminishing the viability of the European project itself . 
Given this interconnectedness , it is unsurprising that the EU &apos;s compartmentalized responses - such as the European Agenda on Migration , the Eastern Partnership , and the Energy Security Strategy - while important , have proved inadequate . 
What is needed is an overarching framework that not only underpins a self-reinforcing and coordinated response to core security threats , but also takes advantage of linkages and opportunities to buttress Europe &apos;s capacity to act . 
Such a reconceptualization - not just revision - of Europe &apos;s security strategy must account for the fact that the internal and external are becoming increasingly difficult to separate . 
Indeed , internally focused initiatives- the digital single market is one clear example - have significant international impacts , while external events shape life in the EU . 
Given this , the new security strategy should account for the wider implications of domestic policies , leveraging the full array of tools that Europe has at its disposal . 
Of course , lofty rhetoric and ambitious intentions will mean little unless Europe &apos;s leaders commit to the sustained implementation of concrete initiatives . 
This is why the drafting process itself is so important ; it presents an opportunity for a serious discussion involving EU institutions and the wider European policy community , which has already spent considerable time reflecting on these issues . 
Federica Mogherini , the EU &apos;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission , is correct when she urges the close involvement of member states in the discussions , in order to give them a sense of ownership over whatever strategy emerges . 
The aim should be to produce viable ideas , build consensus , and find linkages - first and foremost within the EU , but without forgetting allies and partners . 
In fact , that external dimension is essential . 
The ongoing euro crisis has stripped away the rationale that undergirded the integration process for decades . 
No longer able to point toward shared prosperity as its raison d &apos;Ãªtre , the EU is floundering in its search for a new narrative - one that convinces citizens and member states that European integration still has real value . 
A strategy that focuses not only on how the world impacts the EU , but also on how European values and interests can and should be projected abroad would provide a rallying cry , a broader mission , and a clear purpose . 
The European integration process has , at its core , always been values-driven and rules-based - two qualities that are on retreat in today &apos;s world . 
By carrying the banner of liberalism , good governance , and the rule of law internationally , the EU can reverse the centrifugal forces at home that have intensified during the crisis , thereby strengthening its capacity to respond to today &apos;s challenges and securing its position in tomorrow &apos;s world . 
This is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss .
