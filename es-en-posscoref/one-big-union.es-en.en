One Big Union 
PARIS - In the last few weeks , the idea of establishing a European banking union has become the latest remedy advanced as a solution to the long-running euro crisis . 
But , whatever the merits of a banking union - and there are many - proposals to establish one raise more questions than can currently be answered . 
The motivations of those who advocate a banking union differ markedly . 
For some , particularly in southern Europe , it is seen as a means of shifting the burden of supporting their indigent banks to those with deeper pockets . 
For others , especially in the European Union &apos;s Brussels Eurocracy , it is seen as another leap forward in the construction of a European super-state . 
Taking their cue from the sacred Rome Treaty &apos;s reference to &quot; ever closer union , &quot; the European Commission &apos;s theologians view every crisis as an opportunity to advance their federalist agenda . 
The European Central Bank has been more thoughtful , though no less enthusiastic , arguing that a banking union should have three objectives . 
First , stronger eurozone-wide supervision should reinforce financial integration , &quot; mitigate macroeconomic imbalances , &quot; and improve the conduct of monetary policy . 
How a single EU supervisor would address the problem of imbalances is not explained , but it is surely a worthy aim . 
The second objective should be to &quot; break the link between banks and sovereigns , &quot; which has been a particularly dangerous feature of the last year , while the third is to &quot; minimize the risks for taxpayers through adequate contributions by the financial industry . &quot; 
The third aim could be achieved country by country , but it is certainly arguable that an across-the-board banking levy , or a Europe-wide financial-transaction tax , would eliminate competitive distortions . 
How might these laudable objectives be achieved ? 
The European Commission has argued that a fully-fledged banking union would need to rest on four pillars : a single deposit protection scheme covering all EU ( or eurozone ) banks ; a common resolution authority and common resolution fund , at least for systemically important and cross-border banks ; a single European supervisor for the same banks ; and a uniform rule book for prudential supervision of all banks in Europe . 
Anyone who has been involved in banking supervision can see at once that these four pillars will require careful construction . 
Many individual countries have taken a generation to develop their own domestic schemes . 
And , in this case , three big political issues have yet to be resolved . 
First , the identity of the single European banking supervisor remains undecided , and the ECB has seen an opportunity for a power grab . 
Central bankers in Europe have always resented the narrow monetary-policy mandate given to the ECB under the Maastricht Treaty . 
Banking supervision was not included among the ECB &apos;s objectives , though one article of the treaty gives the system of European central banks as a whole the task of contributing to effective supervision . 
They now argue that the simplest solution would be to expand that remit and make the ECB the de facto pan-European supervisor . 
That is not the outcome favored by the European Commission , which has only just set up the European Banking Authority . 
The EBA is closely linked to the Commission itself , and is seen as the natural candidate for a broader role . 
The Commission has a case , but it also has a problem . 
During the political horse-trading that preceded the creation of the EBA ( together with two equivalent bodies for securities and insurance ) , it was agreed that the new authority would be based in London . 
That seemed logical at the time , but not if the EBA &apos;s role is to be broadened . 
How could a eurozone supervisor be based outside the eurozone ? 
The second unresolved question is how to achieve a banking union in legal terms . 
Constitutional change on this scale would normally require a new European treaty . 
But that would take time , and Europe &apos;s leaders have run out of it . 
Furthermore , there is no guarantee that voters in countries that require a referendum on treaty changes would support a further transfer of sovereignty . 
So the likely outcome is that , in the EU &apos;s time-honored fashion , the banking union will be constructed using existing powers , finessing the sovereignty question , and avoiding any reference to public opinion . 
That points towards reliance on the ECB . 
The final question is what such a eurozone banking union would mean for the single financial market , and especially for EU countries that are outside the single currency . 
Many of them would sign up willingly , as they intend to join as soon as possible , in spite of the euro &apos;s difficulties . 
But that is not the case for the United Kingdom , and London remains the continent &apos;s biggest financial center , by far . 
I fear that the French and Germans have now lost patience with the troublesome British , and are reluctant to cut a deal . 
And Euroskeptic British politicians see this as an opportunity to recast the UK &apos;s relationship with the EU ; indeed , for some , it means a chance to negotiate an exit . 
Opinion in the City of London tends to favor a middle way , which would allow the UK to cling to the benefits of the single market , without conceding unified regulation . 
That will be hard to pull off . 
I suspect that a banking union of some kind will be implemented , and soon . 
Otherwise , the eurozone banking system will collapse . 
But the consequences of such a step for Europe &apos;s great free-trade experiment could be serious , and , if not managed carefully , could lead to Britain &apos;s withdrawal . 
The political stakes are high , and the outcome is likely to reflect that .
