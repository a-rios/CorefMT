What the West Can Do 
TBILISI - Given the tremendous damage that Russia has inflicted on Georgia , it is easy to conclude that the Kremlin has achieved its objectives . 
To be sure , Russia has tightened its control of the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . 
It shattered the Georgian military , grievously damaged Georgia &apos;s economy , and stirred up discord within the Western alliance . 
For three years , it has tried every conceivable tactic to bring Saakashvili down - fomenting a domestic uprising , imposing an economic blockade , beefing up its forces in the enclaves , and finally a war . 
Yet Georgia &apos;s president remains in power . 
Here in Tbilisi , tension is understandably high . 
Russian tanks are less than 25 miles away , and the wheat fields along the main road to Gori were ablaze , set on fire by Russian troops , as I drove through Russian checkpoints to get to that deserted , occupied city . 
( Most memorable sight : drunken Russian soldiers in stolen Georgian uniforms - &quot; because they are better than ours . &quot; ) 
Russia &apos;s invasion of Georgia has reshaped the strategic landscape . 
Talk about taking away the 2014 Winter Olympics or ejecting Russia from the G-8 may ( or may not ) have some effect on the Kremlin , but the most important thing the West can do now is strengthen the government in Tbilisi . 
The equation is simple : if Saakashvili survives , Vladimir Putin loses . 
The intense personal hatred between these men overlays two centuries of tortured history between Russia and Georgia . 
Many people report that Putin simply &quot; loses it &quot; when discussing the upstart Saakashvili , who led his country from near bankruptcy into a golden age of economic growth and the world &apos;s highest rate of foreign direct investment relative to GDP . 
All this has been halted by Russian tanks . 
The Kremlin has probably lost its chance to remove Saakashvili by overt force , although sinister , more stealthy means cannot be ruled out . 
Having just dined with him in a public restaurant , I wish his security was a little tighter . 
( His predecessor , Eduard Shevardnadze , was a near-miss target for several assassination attempts that are widely believed to have been Russian-directed . ) 
The Kremlin &apos;s best hope now is that Georgia &apos;s economy will crumble , its currency will collapse , and an unhappy populace , encouraged by some opposition leader ( perhaps bankrolled by Russia ) , will force Saakashvili from power . 
The Western response to this challenge must go beyond rhetoric . 
What matters most right now is massive economic and military assistance . 
Public commitments to help rebuild Georgia are the best way to prevent Russia from achieving its goal . 
Prime Minister Vladimir Gurgenidze estimates that rebuilding railroads , bridges , ports and other infrastructure will cost at least $ 1 billion ; this does not include humanitarian relief , refugee resettlement costs , or rebuilding Georgia &apos;s military . 
Gurgenidze also foresees negative economic growth , a huge budget deficit , and a collapse of tourism , which was just taking off in this beautiful country . 
United States Senator Joseph Biden has called for an immediate $ 1 billion supplemental appropriation , a proposal quickly endorsed by Barack Obama . 
Congress will be in session only briefly before the election , and a supplemental appropriation will pass only if President Bush pursues it vigorously as a bipartisan measure . 
Even if delayed until next year , its immediate proposal by Bush and endorsement by both presidential candidates would help morale in Georgia . 
The European Union , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must match American support . 
In the long run , Georgia and Russia must coexist peacefully . 
Here , Georgia must do its part . 
Saakashvili , an immensely talented 41-year-old , saved his country from utter collapse in 2003 . 
On occasion , he has berated the Europeans for insufficient support - not a good tactic for someone trying to join the EU - and has used rhetoric about Russia that , while understandable , only increases the danger to himself . 
Saakashvili cannot pick up his tiny country and move it to Mexico . 
He has to manage the situation with greater care . 
There will be consequences , of course , for Russia &apos;s relations with the West . 
( Bush &apos;s inattentiveness to this Russian threat - dramatically illustrated by his literal embrace of Putin in Beijing as Russian tanks rolled into Georgia - may have led the Kremlin to think it could get away with its invasion . ) 
While the West will not going to war over Georgia , Russia must understand that it will pay for using force , or the threat of force , against neighbors that were once part of the Soviet space . 
This is especially true for Ukraine and Azerbaijan , which are likely to be Moscow &apos;s next targets for intimidation . 
The rules of the post-Cold War world are changing - but not to the ultimate benefit of Russia , which has underestimated the unifying effect its actions will have on the West . 
Exactly how these relationships evolve depends on what each side does in the coming weeks - especially in Georgia .
