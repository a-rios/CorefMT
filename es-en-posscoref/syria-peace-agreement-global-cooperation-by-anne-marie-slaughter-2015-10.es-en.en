Engaging the World in Syria 
ABU DHABI - A global security crisis of historic proportions is raging in the Middle East , and spreading by the day , as millions of refugees flee Syria and Iraq . 
The crisis is now affecting not just all of Syria &apos;s immediate neighbors , straining their resources and exacerbating social and ethnic tensions ; it now directly involves all of the current permanent members of the Security Council except China . 
It is time for all would-be permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - namely , Germany , India , Japan , Brazil , and Egypt - to step up . 
The desire for a political settlement that could end the Syrian civil war is palpable ; but just what that settlement would look like remains open to debate - or to further conflict . 
Indeed , Russia and the United States are circling each other like boxers before the contest actually begins , supporting different factions and trying to ensure that their allies in the multi-sided conflict are advancing , or at least holding ground . 
The need for broad cooperation - and the support of the entire UN Security Council - is apparent . 
That is why US Secretary of State John Kerry is talking to the Russians , the Saudis , and the Turks to build support for a new round of international talks . 
And the UN and Arab League &apos;s special envoy to Syria , Staffan de Mistura , has created a set of working groups , chaired by Europeans , to &quot; create a framework for concrete talks between Syria &apos;s government and opposition . &quot; 
In enabling a peace deal , a coalition of countries that are not yet directly involved in the crisis could be very helpful . 
Such a coalition - involving , say , Germany , India , Japan , Brazil , and Egypt - could increase the pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to negotiate by convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin that the world is watching his deal-making efforts closely and that his prestige is on the line . 
Moreover , coalition members could convince other relevant regional players to push for a lasting peace . 
Germany , for example , already recognizes that the only long-term solution to Europe &apos;s refugee influx lies in eliminating the need to flee , and has begun to make some moves . 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier traveled to Turkey in September to help broker a deal on keeping refugees in Turkey , in exchange for restarting talks on Turkish accession to the European Union . 
A leading German foreign policy expert , Volker Perthes , is chairing one of de Mistura &apos;s working groups . 
The other countries have yet to take action . 
But they , too , have plenty of motivation - and plenty to offer . 
India - as well as Pakistan - has a great deal to gain from strengthening Southwest Asian trade , energy , and investment ties . 
Since the signing of the Iran nuclear deal , India has been contemplating renewing the plan for an Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline , with the participation of China and Russia . 
But that will be impossible without a settlement in Syria and a decision by Iran to stop supporting Hezbollah . 
India has a strong relationship with Iran , underpinned by long-standing cultural , social , political , and economic ties , with India now funding an overhaul of the Iranian port of Chabahar , which will give it direct access to Afghanistan . 
This places India in a strong position to push Iran to put pressure on Assad . 
Likewise , India can leverage its relationship with Russia - it remains a major importer of Russian arms - to help drive progress . 
Japan &apos;s potential contribution also involves Iran , with which Japan has lately been pursuing a closer relationship - not least because Japan needs Iranian oil and gas . 
Earlier this month in Tehran , the Japanese and Iranian foreign ministers agreed to begin negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty . 
Japan also wants to speed up implementation of the Iran nuclear deal , so that it can take advantage of the business opportunities that will result when economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic are lifted . 
But if Iran is truly to rejoin the international community , it must play a constructive role in its region . 
Japan , which now aspires to enhance its own role on the world stage , must not shy away from making that clear . 
A bonus here is that Japanese and Indian interest in the Syrian peace process could spur China to play an active role in reaching , rather than blocking , a solution . 
Brazil , despite confronting plenty of domestic problems right now , is also in a position to help . 
Not only does it have substantial ties with Russia ; it is also linked to Turkey , exemplified by the two countries &quot; 2010 effort to broker a deal with Iran over its nuclear program . 
Moreover , in 2011 , Brazil put forward a concept paper at the UN outlining how countries seeking to implement the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; doctrine should behave . 
With the Syrian government - through its murder of tens of thousands of civilians with barrel bombs and poison gas - having more than fulfilled the criteria for triggering the international community &apos;s obligation to intervene , Brazil could suggest what an intervention that reflected the principle of &quot; responsibility while protecting &quot; might look like . 
Finally , Egypt - a perennial candidate for a permanent or rotating African seat in a reformed Security Council - has important relationships throughout the region , particularly with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries that are directly supporting some Syrian opposition groups . 
The government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , who has emphasized the need for a comprehensive political settlement , is tacitly supporting Assad , but is also deeply concerned about the Islamic State . 
Egyptian diplomats are thus excellent candidates to exert pressure for compromise . 
Many of these countries &quot; governments might say that the Syrian conflict is too far away to affect them directly . 
But global leadership does not simply mean enjoying the prestige that accompanies presumed power . 
The UN Charter requires countries to use their power to identify &quot; any threat to the peace , breach of the peace , or act of aggression , &quot; and to decide which measures must be taken &quot; to maintain or restore international peace and security . &quot; 
The Syrian crisis is a major &quot; threat to the peace , &quot; and the world must address it together .
