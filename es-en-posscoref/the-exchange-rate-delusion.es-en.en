The Exchange-Rate Delusion 
MILAN - If one looks at the trade patterns of the global economy &apos;s two biggest players , two facts leap out . 
One is that , while the United States runs a trade deficit with almost everyone , including Canada , Mexico , China , Germany , France , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan , not to mention the oil-exporting countries , the largest deficit is with China . 
If trade data were re-calculated to reflect the country of origin of various components of value-added , the general picture would not change , but the relative magnitudes would : higher US deficits with Germany , South Korea , Taiwan , and Japan , and a dramatically lower deficit with China . 
The second fact is that Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan - all relatively high-income economies - have a large trade surplus with China . 
Germany has relatively balanced trade with China , even recording a modest bilateral surplus in the post-crisis period . 
The US has a persistent overall trade deficit that fluctuates in the range of 3-6 % of GDP . 
But , while the total reflects bilateral deficits with just about everyone , the US Congress is obsessed with China , and appears convinced that the primary cause of the problem lies in Chinese manipulation of the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate . 
One problem with this view is that it cannot account for the stark differences between the US and Japan , Germany , and South Korea . 
Moreover , the real ( inflation-adjusted ) value of the renminbi is now rising quickly , owing to inflation differentials and Chinese wage growth , particularly in the country &apos;s export sectors . 
That will shift the Chinese economy &apos;s structure and trade patterns quite dramatically over time . 
The final-assembly links of global-value added chains will leave China for countries at earlier stages of economic development , such as Bangladesh , where incomes are lower ( though without producing much change in the balance with the US ) . 
A somewhat more sensible concern might be that the dollar &apos;s reserve-currency status causes it to be &quot; over-valued &quot; with respect to every currency , not just the renminbi . 
That could create additional pressure on the tradable part of the US economy , and thus might help to explain why the US tradable sector has not generated net employment for two decades . 
But , in order to explain performance relative to Japan and Germany , one would have to argue that the euro and the yen have been undervalued , which makes no sense . 
In fact , the employment generated by the tradable sector has been in services at the upper end of the distributions of value-added per person , education , and income . 
As a result , growth and employment in the tradable sector have gone separate ways , with healthy growth and stagnant employment . 
In Germany , by contrast , the tradable sector is an employment engine . 
The US economy &apos;s distinctive features for at least a decade prior to the crisis that began in 2008 were an unsustainably high level of consumption , owing to an illusory wealth effect , under-investment ( including in the public sector ) , and savings that fell short of the investment deficiency . 
That excess household and government consumption fueled the domestic economy - and much of the global economy as well . 
In several European countries that now confront fiscal and growth challenges , the pattern was somewhat different : most of the excess consumption and employment was on the government side . 
But the effect was similar : an unsustainable pattern of income and employment generation , and lower productivity and competitiveness in these economies &quot; tradable sectors , leading to trade deficits , stunted GDP , and weak job creation . 
One could argue that the euro has been and still is overvalued , and that this has hindered many eurozone economies &quot; productivity relative to non-eurozone countries . 
But the relative productivity deficiencies within the eurozone are more important for growth , and have nothing to do with the exchange rate . 
The focus on currencies as a cause of the West &apos;s economic woes , while not entirely misplaced , has been excessive . 
Developing countries have learned over time that real income growth and employment expansion are driven by productivity gains , not exchange-rate movements . 
This , in turn , requires public and private investment in tangible assets , physical and telecommunications infrastructure , human capital and skills , and the knowledge and technology base of the economy . 
Of course , it is possible for a country &apos;s terms of trade to get out of line with income and productivity levels , requiring a rebalancing . 
But resetting the terms of trade is no substitute for tackling the structural underpinnings of productivity . 
None of this is peculiar to developing countries . 
Underinvestment has long-term costs and consequences everywhere . 
Excess consumption merely hides these costs temporarily . 
In the US , productivity deficiencies have led to a pattern of disconnection from global supply chains . 
So the challenge for America is not only to restore productivity , but also to restore its links to the main currents of world trade . 
China &apos;s growth - and , more generally , that of the major emerging economies - provides a substantial potential tailwind . 
That is certainly true nowadays for Germany , Japan , and South Korea . 
The US and others can take advantage of it as well , but only if productivity relative to income levels in specific areas of potential competitiveness begin to rise . 
As long as America economic policy remains focused primarily on deficits , domestic demand , exchange rates , and backsliding on trade openness , its investment deficiencies will remain unaddressed . 
That means that its employment and income-distribution problems will remain unaddressed as well . 
The good news is that , at a deep level , incentives across advanced and developing countries are aligned . 
The emerging economies would like nothing more than the restoration of sustainable patterns of growth in the advanced economies , and are prepared to be cooperative players in that process . 
But focusing on these countries &quot; exchange rates is not the right way to go about it .
