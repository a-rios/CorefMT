Emerging Markets &quot; Submerging Currencies 
MUNICH - For many emerging economies , 2014 has gotten off to a grim start . 
Concern over the Chinese economy &apos;s marked slowdown and the Argentine peso &apos;s steep slide against the US dollar has triggered heavy selling pressure on an array of emerging-market currencies . 
But the current volatility does not portend sustained weaker growth in emerging economies as a whole . 
Differentiation is needed , and that is what financial markets are now doing . 
The scale of the battering varies widely from country to country . 
For example , the problems currently dogging Argentina are anything but a surprise . 
On the contrary , they are the near-inevitable result of years of policy mismanagement that has spawned high inflation , a badly overvalued currency , and massive erosion of foreign reserves . 
By contrast , the currencies of Central and Eastern Europe &apos;s emerging markets have remained relatively stable . 
For example , thanks to Poland &apos;s robust economic performance , the z≈Çoty has essentially maintained its exchange rate against the euro , slipping 2.2 % since the start of the year ( as of the beginning of February ) . 
The Hungarian forint lost slightly more than 5 % against the single currency over the same period , but this is less sharp than in the past , when the country &apos;s macroeconomic problems made the exchange rate far more sensitive to shifts in market sentiment . 
The stabilization of the eurozone economy and the reduction of imbalances have helped to improve the growth outlook for Central and Eastern European countries . 
Furthermore , most of these countries have made progress taming their own imbalances . 
By contrast , the Russian ruble has continued its lengthy nosedive this year , tumbling by more than 5.5 % against the euro by the beginning of February . 
The reasons are mainly homegrown : a poor investment climate , heavy capital outflows , and a shriveling current-account surplus . 
A look at Latin America also reveals wide regional differences . 
The Argentine peso , the region &apos;s main culprit , has plummeted by 19 % this year against the US dollar . 
In Brazil , the real &apos;s losses in 2014 have been comparatively mild , but this comes on the heels of the hefty depreciation last year . 
Capital is also heading for the exit in Mexico and Chile . 
The region &apos;s reliance on commodities is fraying nerves . 
If Chinese economic growth turns out to be weaker than expected , commodity prices and exports are likely to fall , undermining Latin American countries &quot; growth . 
However , with global industrial-production indicators climbing since the second half of 2013 , pointing especially to improvements in the advanced economies , gloomy forecasts for commodity markets seem off the mark . 
So far , Asian currency losses have been limited . 
The South Korean won has experienced the largest slide , with a loss of 3 % from the start of the year to the beginning of February ( though this comes in the wake of a protracted upward trend ) . 
The Indian and Indonesian currencies have been weathering the storm quite well , but both fell steeply last year . 
The Indian rupee , burdened by a chronic current-account deficit , stubbornly high inflation , and a sharp slowdown in growth , lost 11 % year on year by the end of 2013 . 
Paradoxically , China , the country currently under the brightest spotlight , is the only major emerging economy whose currency rose slightly against the US dollar in January . 
Given the enormous challenges that China faces - from rebalancing its growth model to addressing credit and real-estate bubbles - this is remarkable . 
Chinese officials are poised to tighten monetary policy and impose regulatory measures to curb debt momentum , which is bound to mean sacrificing short-term economic growth in order to put growth back on a stable footing . 
Evidently , the markets think the authorities are up to the task . 
Turkey , a country whose enormous growth potential is marred by major imbalances , has not been so fortunate . 
The Turkish lira is being pilloried , sliding more than 7 % against the euro in January and 24 % since the middle of last year . 
But Turkey &apos;s vulnerability to an abrupt shift in financial markets from risk-on to risk-off was foreseeable . 
Yawning current-account deficits ( funded mainly by short-term capital inflows ) , domestic political uncertainty , and past episodes of unorthodox monetary policy have all undermined investor confidence in recent months . 
As in China , the necessary adjustment processes will weigh on short-term growth , though the medium- and long-term outlook is positive . 
The financial markets are evidently punishing the currencies of countries that , due to macroeconomic imbalances or political instability , are susceptible to external shocks of any kind . 
Indeed , some players fear that the spiral of depreciation , higher inflation , and rising interest rates could broaden out into a full-scale crisis of confidence . 
But , while the further withdrawal of capital cannot be ruled out , not all investors swim with the tide . 
With prices in the affected countries at a much more favorable level , confidence-building policy measures could quickly encourage forward-looking investors to test the water . 
Broadly speaking , devaluations can help boost competitiveness and reduce external deficits . 
But in the short term , they can exacerbate economic problems by inciting higher wage demands , fueling inflationary pressure , and boosting external-financing costs . 
In these circumstances , monetary policy must perform a balancing act . 
In order to counter a devaluation-fueled rise in domestic inflation , the central bank needs to raise key interest rates - but without throttling the economy . 
Policymakers are more likely to succeed to the extent that domestic reforms address macroeconomic imbalances and other obstacles to long-term growth .
