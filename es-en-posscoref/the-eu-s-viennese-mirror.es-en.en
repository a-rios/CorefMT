The EU &apos;s Viennese Mirror 
If a European Union bureaucrat could travel to fin de si√®cle Vienna , he would be surprised by how closely the Hapsburg Empire resembled today &apos;s EU . 
Like the EU , Austria-Hungary was an experiment in supranational engineering , comprising 51 million inhabitants , 11 nationalities , and 14 languages . 
Presiding over this microcosm of Europe was a double-throned Emperor-King and twin parliaments representing the largely independent Austrian and Hungarian halves of the realm . 
The Hapsburg Empire acted as a stabilizing force for its peoples and for Europe . 
To its scattered ethnic groups , it performed the twin roles of referee and bouncer , pacifying indigenous rivalries and protecting pint-sized nations from predatory states . 
It also filled a geopolitical vacuum at the heart of the continent , placing a check on Germany and Russia . 
So long as it performed these functions , Austria was viewed as a &quot; European necessity &quot; - a balancer of nationalities and of nations for which there was no conceivable substitute . 
But , by the early 1900 &quot; s , the empire faced two problems that cast doubt on its ability to fulfill these missions . 
First , it proved incapable of reconciling and representing its constituents &quot; interests . 
The heart of the problem was the 1867 Compromise , which divided the empire into Austrian and Hungarian halves . 
By excluding the Slavs - who accounted for half the empire &apos;s population - the Compromise was seen as a vehicle for German / Magyar domination . 
All attempts at modifying the arrangement stopped short of what was needed : a political settlement between Germans and Slavs like that between Germans and Magyars . 
Second , due in part to internal nationalist crises , the empire found it increasingly difficult to chart a unified , independent course in international affairs . 
Confronted after 1906 with a more assertive Russia , Austria-Hungary resorted to increasing reliance on Germany , thereby relinquishing the empire &apos;s special status as a geopolitical stabilizer . 
These problems inflicted irreparable damage to Austria-Hungary &apos;s image as a &quot; necessity &quot; - both for its subjects , who came to see national self-determination as a superior alternative to supra-nationalism , and for outside powers , which dismembered the empire in 1918 . 
So ended the first European union . 
Like Austria-Hungary , the EU &apos;s raison d &apos;etre consists in its ability to transcend the indigenous balance of power among its members , and the service this renders to the international system . 
On both counts , the EU confronted challenges in 2007 much like those confronting Austria-Hungary in 1907 . 
Many of the EU &apos;s newest members continue to grapple with questions of geopolitical trust . 
If allowed to fester , this feud could metastasize , leaving the EU in a state of crisis like that which plagued Austria-Hungary . 
A second set of problems confronts the EU externally . 
Like Austria-Hungary , the EU finds itself lodged between two powerful neighbors : a resurgent Russia intent on regaining lost influence , and a seemingly revisionist United States preoccupied with foreign military adventures . 
Three lessons of Austria-Hungary &apos;s experience are instructive for the EU . 
First , despite enjoying greater political inclusion than the Habsburg Slavs , many Central Europeans see themselves as lacking equal standing with the EU-15 , both economically and strategically . 
The upshot may be a tendency for the new members to press their national interests more forcefully in EU fora . 
Fearing a new era of obstructionism , EU leaders have revived talk of a two-speed union , in which a vanguard of western states seeks deeper integration , leaving the newcomers to catch up . 
But , as Habsburg history shows , such arrangements create entrenched privileges among the &quot; haves &quot; and grudges among the &quot; have-nots . &quot; 
In a union of many parts , there are no shortcuts : the EU must provide the same level of integration at the periphery as at the imperial core . 
Second , just as Austria needed a settlement between Germans and Slavs , the EU needs to repeat the Franco-German reconciliation of 1952 between its largest western and eastern members , Germany and Poland . 
The shared steel initiative of 1952 could find its parallel in a German-Polish initiative to jointly manage natural gas imports . 
Finally , much as Austria-Hungary formed an alliance with Germany to fill a strategic need for military security , EU members have sought , through their intake of Russian gas , to meet a strategic need for energy security . 
However , over-reliance on Russia for a strategically vital commodity widens the divergence of interests between members , like Germany , that share a privileged partnership with Russia , and those , like Poland , that consider the Kremlin a threat . 
Much as Austria &apos;s alignment with Germany drove the Slavs to seek Russian patronage at the expense of imperial unity , European alignments with Russia drive the new members to seek US patronage at the expense of EU unity . 
As Austria-Hungary discovered , once geopolitical dependency starts , the dominant power will seek to use the dependent ally as an extension of its own interests rather than see it regain freedom of maneuver . 
While the EU is unlikely to ever achieve independence from Russian energy , it can improve its ability to cope with dependence by finding what Austria-Hungary lacked : a source of leverage to maintain the relationship on relatively equal terms . 
This means , above all , establishing a united voice on energy . 
In the end , many who fought to bring about Austria-Hungary &apos;s demise would live to mourn its passing ; as subsequent events would show , the old empire was still more of a necessity than they realized . 
By learning from its mistakes , today &apos;s Europeans may yet be able to reform and reinvigorate an &quot; empire &quot; whose most important work still lies ahead .
