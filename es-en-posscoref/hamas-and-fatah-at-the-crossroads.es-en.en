Hamas and Fatah at the Crossroads 
Palestinian politics is approaching the point of no return . 
The power struggle between the Islamist Hamas and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and his secular / nationalist Fatah movement is intensifying , with tensions breaking into outright combat . 
Since Hamas was founded in the early 1980 &quot; s , it has refused to come under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) . 
Hamas &apos;s victory in the parliamentary election earlier this year - a democratic watershed - demonstrated that it had come of age politically . 
For the first time in Palestinian history , a religious party is dominant . 
But Fatah has not accepted defeat , while Hamas is convinced that elements within Fatah agree with Israeli and American plans to topple the Hamas government . 
Abbas remains the Palestinian president , and the Basic Law makes him commander of all Palestinian security forces . 
However , while most official security forces remain loyal to him , over the past year Hamas has created an alternative security structure , built around a 4000-member &quot; Operational Force . &quot; 
Moreover , Hamas has announced plans to recruit 1,500 additional security personnel for the West Bank , Fatah &apos;s stronghold . 
In recent weeks , the two sides have clashed frequently across the Gaza strip , heightening tensions further . 
The confrontations have come at a time when Abbas has been trying to persuade Hamas to moderate its anti-Israel stance and ally with Fatah in a national unity government . 
Abbas believes that Hamas &apos;s acceptance of negotiations with Israel is the only way to break the international sanctions that are devastating Palestinian society . 
Despite this , both sides are building up their forces . 
Intelligence reports suggest that Hamas is smuggling weapons and explosives from the Sinai into the Gaza Strip at an accelerated pace . 
The United States , Israel , and some Arab governments plan to arm and train forces loyal to Abbas , especially his presidential guard . 
Israel is considering Abbas &apos;s request to transfer arms and ammunitions from Egypt and Jordan in hopes of bolstering his loyalist forces . 
There is also an American proposal to allow the Badr Brigade - a wing of the Palestine Liberation Army that is currently stationed in Jordan - to relocate to the Palestinian territories as Abbas &apos;s rapid reaction force in Gaza in anticipation of a feared civil war . 
The Badr Brigade is composed of several thousand Palestinians , mostly long-time PLO activists . 
As the maneuvering continues , Israel and Egypt find themselves working together to bolster Abbas and Fatah . 
With the Gaza Strip in its backyard , Egypt has already mediated several times between Hamas and Fatah , and has been trying , so far unsuccessfully , to arrange a swap of prisoners with Israel following Hamas &apos;s abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit . 
But Egypt &apos;s government is angry with Hamas for opposing the formation of a coalition government . 
Indeed , the seizure of Shalit deepened the rift between Hamas and Fatah , which believes that the abduction was staged in order to sabotage discussions about a national unity government . 
More generally , Egypt is concerned that Gaza is becoming politically radicalized and may be transformed into &quot; Hamastan . &quot; 
Egypt also worries about a possible Hamas-Fatah civil war . 
Although Hamas has ruled this out , it has shown no hesitation to use heavy force against its opponents . 
Likewise , Foreign Minister Mahmoud Al-Zahar of the Hamas-led government says that any dissolution of the government or call for early elections by Abbas would be a recipe for civil war . 
Fear of major fighting has already sent many Palestinians into Egypt , leading to the deployment of Egyptian troops on the border to control any mass exodus . 
Israel , meanwhile , is worried that Hamas has strengthened its military grip on Gaza , in terms of both fortifications and networks capable of launching Qassam rockets into neighboring Israeli towns . 
Israel might not wait for Abbas and his forces , but rather launch a full-scale intervention to weaken Hamas . 
Can Hamas and Fatah put aside their differences and form a unity government ? 
Abbas says that if a coalition government is not agreed upon within the next two weeks , he will dissolve the current government , a move Hamas will not tolerate . 
But forming a coalition government is unlikely to ease the tension between Hamas and Fatah . 
New confrontations would likely emerge as soon as a new government was formed . 
Ironically , the most likely way to avoid large-scale confrontation between Fatah and Hamas is through an Israeli incursion into Gaza . 
Facing the Israelis together is the only way that the rival Palestinian groups will postpone their own bloody showdown .
