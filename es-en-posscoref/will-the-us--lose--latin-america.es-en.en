Will the US &quot; Lose &quot; Latin America ? 
On November 4-5 , the fourth Summit of the Americas took place in Mar del Plata , Argentina . 
The heads of state of the hemisphere &apos;s democratic countries met to discuss economic , political , and social issues - and to lose another opportunity to create a new and healthier relationship between the United States and its Latin American neighbors . 
Indeed , the Summit amounted to nothing more than an outsized photo opportunity . 
No important issues were resolved , and no progress was made on the many topics that increasingly divide the countries of Latin America and the US . 
In particular , no progress was made on the creation of a free-trade area for the region . 
This is all the more disappointing , given that the region &apos;s leaders declared more than a decade ago , during the first Summit of the Americas , held in Miami in December 1994 , that free-trade negotiations would be &quot; concluded no later than 2005 . &quot; 
At the center of the failure to make headway on the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) is America &apos;s unwillingness , and that of the Bush administration , to open up its agricultural sector to competition from countries such as Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay . 
True , the US is not the worst offender in the world when it comes to farm protectionism ; the European Union &apos;s trade distortions are significantly more pervasive . 
But it is also true that if the US wants to improve relations with its neighbors to the south , America should make significant bilateral trade concessions to the Latin American countries . 
In the absence of US leadership in matters of international trade , the majority of Latin American countries will not open their economies further to foreign competition , and some may even return to increased protectionism . 
Unfortunately , the lack of progress on trade-related issues is not the only burden on relations between the US and Latin America . 
There are also serious diplomatic and political problems . 
Very few Latin American countries support the Iraq war ; indeed , only a handful of small countries in the region contributed troops to the so-called &quot; coalition of the willing , &quot; and today only El Salvador still has its troops in Iraq . 
More broadly , most Latin American governments are increasingly critical of the Bush administration &apos;s foreign policy , and they are unlikely to support major initiatives in international forums , including in the United Nations . 
Moreover , a growing number of Latin American countries are veering left , and Hugo Ch√°vez , the belligerent and anti-American Venezuelan president , is becoming increasingly popular in every Latin American country . 
Voters across Latin America are becoming skeptical of market-oriented policies and globalization , making it more likely that in coming years , and under new leadership , economic policies in the region will be less friendly to foreign investment in general , and to US economic interests in particular . 
It is not too late for the US to regain its political and diplomatic influence in Latin America . 
But improving relations with its neighbors to the South will require making commitments at several levels . 
Three commitments are particularly important . 
First , US agricultural protectionism should be reduced . 
Second , immigration reform in the US should be enacted in a way that protects the rights of Latino migrants . 
And , third , the US should support the demands of Latin American countries for a greater say in international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
These initiatives will give the signal to Latin American leaders that , despite appearances to the contrary - including the latest Summit of the Americas - the region has not been completely neglected by President Bush and the US .
