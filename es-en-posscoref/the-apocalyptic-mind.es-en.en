The Apocalyptic Mind 
LONDON - It was only to be expected that former US Vice President Al Gore would give this month &apos;s Burmese cyclone an apocalyptic twist . 
&quot; Last year , &quot; he said , &quot; a catastrophic storm hit Bangladesh . 
The year before , the strongest cyclone in more than 50 years hit China .... We &apos;re seeing the consequences that scientists have long predicted might be associated with continual global warming . &quot; 
Surprisingly , Gore did not include the Asian tsunami of 2004 , which claimed 225,000 lives . 
His not so subliminal message was that these natural catastrophes foreshadow the end of the world . 
Apocalyptic beliefs have always been part of the Christian tradition . 
They express the yearning for heaven on earth , when evil is destroyed and the good are saved . 
In their classical religious form , such beliefs rely on signs and omens , like earthquakes and sunspots , which can be interpreted , by reference to biblical passages , as portending a great cataclysm and cleansing . 
Thus , apocalyptic moments are products of a sense of crisis : they can be triggered by wars and natural disasters . 
Classical apocalyptic thinking is certainly alive and well , especially in America , where it feeds on Protestant fundamentalism , and is mass marketed with all the resources of modern media . 
Circles close to the Bush administration , it is rumored , take current distempers like terrorism as confirmation of biblical prophecies . 
In secularized , pseudo-scientific form , apocalyptic thinking has also been at the core of revolutionary politics . 
In his latest book , Black Mass , the philosopher John Gray discusses how political doctrines like Marxism colonized the apocalyptic vision in prophesying the destruction of capitalism as the prelude to the socialist utopia . 
But political messianism was an offshoot of nineteenth-century optimism . 
With the collapse of optimism , contemporary apocalyptic belief lays more stress on catastrophe and less on utopia . 
For example , in his book Flat Earth News , the investigative journalist Nick Davies reminds us of the millennium bug panic . 
Newspapers everywhere carried stories predicting that computer systems would crash on January 1 , 2000 , causing much of the world to shut down . 
The subtext was familiar : those who live by technology will die by it . 
Misreporting of science is now so routine that we hardly notice it . 
Much more serious is when science itself becomes infected by the apocalyptic spirit . 
Faith-based science seems a contradiction in terms , because the scientific worldview emerged as a challenge to religious superstition . 
But important scientific beliefs can now be said to be held religiously , rather than scientifically . 
This brings us back to Al Gore and climate change . 
There is no doubt that the earth became warmer over the twentieth century ( by about 0.7 degrees Celsius ) , which most climate scientists attribute largely to human carbon dioxide emissions . 
If nothing is done to restrict such emissions , global temperature will rise 1.8-4 degrees over the next century . 
At some &quot; tipping point , &quot; the world will be subject to floods and pestilence in classic apocalyptic fashion . 
This is the second doomsday scenario of recent decades , the first being the Club of Rome &apos;s prediction in 1972 that the world would soon run out of natural resources . 
Both are &quot; scientific , &quot; but their structure is the same as that of the Biblical story of the Flood : human wickedness ( in today &apos;s case , unbridled materialism ) triggers the disastrous sequence , which it may already be too late to avert . 
Like Biblical prophecy , scientific doomsday stories seem impervious to refutation , and are constantly repackaged to feed the hunger for catastrophe . 
Scientists argue that the media and politicians are responsible for exaggerating their findings as promises of salvation or warnings of retribution . 
But scientists themselves are partly responsible , because they have hardened uncertainties into probabilities , treated disputable propositions as matters of fact , and attacked dissent as heresy . 
Scientists are notoriously loath to jettison conclusions reached by approved scientific methods , however faulty . 
But their intolerance of dissent is hugely magnified when they see themselves as captains in the salvationist army , dedicated to purging the world of evil habits . 
Today it is the West that foists an apocalyptic imagination on the rest of the world . 
Perhaps we should be looking to China and India for answers about how to address environmental damage , instead of using climate change as a pretext to deprive them of what we already have . 
How do the Chinese feel about their newfound materialism ? 
Do they have an intellectual structure with which to make sense of it ? 
The best antidote to the doom merchants is skepticism . 
We must be willing to take uncertainty seriously . 
Climate change is a fact . 
But apocalyptic thinking distorts the scientific debate and makes it harder to explain the causes and consequences of this fact , which in turn makes it harder to know how to deal with it . 
The danger is that we become so infected with the apocalyptic virus that we end up creating a real catastrophe - the meltdown of our economies and lifestyles - in order to avoid an imaginary one . 
In short , while a religious attitude of mind deserves the highest respect , we should resist the re-conquest by religion of matters that should be the concern of science .
