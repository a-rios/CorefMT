David Cameron &apos;s Europe 
STOCKHOLM - The next 18-24 months are likely to decide the shape of Europe for decades to come , and the United Kingdom has now started the clock on that process . 
Reelected with a resounding - and entirely unexpected - majority in the House of Commons , Prime Minister David Cameron must now use his increased mandate to set out an EU reform package that is attractive to all member states . 
In recent years , the tail has tended to wag the dog in the UK , with Cameron kowtowing to the fanatically anti-European wing of his Conservative Party , if only to hold the pro-withdrawal UK Independence Party at bay . 
In a series of speeches over recent years , Cameron has spoken about a European reform agenda centered on increasing the EU &apos;s competitiveness and improving its institutions &quot; transparency . 
In the wake of Russian revanchism and the mayhem spreading across the Middle East , were Cameron to speak today of the changes that Europe needs to make , I would hope that he would add his support for more effective common foreign and security policies . 
If Cameron sets out such a reform agenda at the European Council in June and is prepared to listen as well as to talk , he could set in motion a process that benefits all of Europe . 
Then , it will be primarily up to EU Council President Donald Tusk , under the Luxembourg , Netherlands , Slovakia , and Malta presidencies of the EU over the next two years , to move a reform package forward by early 2017 . 
This will be a process in which the EU &apos;s 28 member states , rather than the European Commission , must be in command . 
Only by appealing to and involving the EU &apos;s national political institutions can EU reform succeed . 
Next year should be a period of intense debate on a reform package that , when put together , will , it is hoped , be agreed by all of the EU &apos;s members , because Cameron needs to hold his promised in-or-out referendum on the EU before the UK takes over the rotating presidency on July 1 , 2017 . 
At the moment , opinion polls indicate that the UK electorate would vote for continued EU membership . 
Then again , no opinion polls predicted that the general election would result in a majority Conservative government . 
So no one should be under any illusion about the risks inherent in any British referendum on EU membership . 
Of course , the EU is not powerless to influence the outcome . 
The Union can do its part in the coming 18 months by demonstrating its ability to deliver not only a potent reform package , but also implement other key policies , such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States and the Digital Single Market . 
Success in such areas , and the economic benefits they will bring , will make leaving the EU even more unattractive for the UK . 
But a UK decision to leave , should it come to that , would initiate a painful and complicated process of negotiating an exit and agreeing on some sort of new relationship . 
There would be no attractive options , and the result - regardless of how much goodwill both sides bring to the talks - would leave both the UK and the EU visibly diminished , not least on the world stage . 
Moreover , it would be naive to expect that the rest of the EU could just go on as before . 
On the contrary , British withdrawal would likely inspire similar moves in other countries , with the risk that the EU , already weakened , might begin to fragment . 
And , given his current efforts to divide Europe , one can be sure that Russian President Vladimir Putin would do all that he can to encourage , and finance , such a split . 
During this period , the EU would also have to address the ongoing challenges to its eastern neighbors , particularly Ukraine , posed by Putin &apos;s revisionism , as well as the meltdown of much of its southern neighborhood in the Middle East and North Africa . 
In this context , a weakened and fractured Europe - unable to confront threats stemming from its immediate environment - would be a more dangerous place to live . 
Cameron &apos;s remarkable victory should be viewed as an opportunity to launch a renewed and reformed EU in the next two years . 
The UK &apos;s European partners expect Cameron to frame the debate that must now begin if a truly stronger EU - one that can face up to its future and its future challenges - is to emerge . 
In these dangerous times , the consequences of Europe &apos;s disintegration must not be underestimated .
