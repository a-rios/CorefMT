Taming Traffic 
In Paris , New York , and Mexico City , rich and poor alike escape the summer heat in city parks . 
But in many places in the developing world , open public spaces are as rare as stable democracies . 
That may be no accident . 
If it appears frivolous to write about public space in cities like Bogota , Delhi , and Lima , where poverty and squalor run rampant , consider that the government &apos;s subsidy of grass and concrete for pedestrians is a measure of its respect for human dignity and the democratic values . 
Public spaces are where poor and rich meet as equals . 
If governments cannot level the playing field in a global economy , they can at least equalize the enjoyment of a city during leisure time . 
In the Third World , this means offering residents clean and plentiful public parks and keeping the sidewalks clear for pedestrians . 
While the latter is taken for granted in the developed world , sidewalks in Latin America are often akin to disputed territory . 
Pedestrians shouldn &apos;t have to compete with cars . 
City and government officials should ensure that parks and paved paths become as ubiquitous to a city &apos;s landcape as parking spaces . 
As Mayor of Bogot√° , I was almost impeached for insisting that pedestrians win this war with the automobile and commerce . 
Shop-owners and drivers complained that sidewalks should continue to be shared with parked cars , as they had been for years . 
We had to explain that although sidewalks live next to roads , they do not belong to the same family . 
Rather , sidewalks are close relatives of parks and plazas . 
Sidewalks are not merely for going from one place to another , they are for talking , playing , kissing , or sitting on a bench . 
To suggest that parking bays can be carved out of sidewalks is like saying a park or a plaza can be turned into an open-air parking lot with trees . 
People need to walk to be happy . 
A bird can survive inside a small cage and even lay eggs and bear descendants . 
We , too , could live out our lives in the confines of an apartment . 
But just as a bird is happier in a cage the size of an auditorium and even happier when flying free , we walk better on a sidewalk three or ten meters wide . 
We are exuberant if offered an esplanade cleared of cars , noise and pollutants . 
For thousands of years , city streets were pedestrian , even if shared with horses and carriages . 
Any eight-year-old child was safe walking about these streets . 
All this changed dramatically when automobiles appeared . 
Streets became lethally dangerous , particularly for children . 
As automobiles drove pedestrians off to the side of streets , cities in the Third World should have developed a parallel network of exclusively pedestrian walkways . 
Nothing of the sort happened . 
On the recently built road from Delhi to Agra to facilitate the flow of tourists to the Taj Mahal , there must be at least 200 pedestrians and bicyclists for each motor vehicle . 
This regressive design is not exclusive to India ; it is typical of the Third World . 
Investing in road infrastructure tends to be regressive in societies where only a minority own automobiles . 
But upper income people drive and they make the decisions . 
Building an infrastructure for an ever-growing number of cars was a daunting task , one that absorbed the attention and resources of many Third World governments over the past three decades . 
After clogging every square meter of city street , they cut road space through the most spectacular natural settings . 
Practically no urban lakefront , riverbank , coastline , or mountainside has not been threatened . 
Quality public pedestrian space , on the other hand , demonstrates official respect for human dignity and for society &apos;s most vulnerable members - the handicapped , children and the elderly . 
A progressive strategy towards public space deepens democracy , since the pedestrians and bicyclists who benefit most directly are lower-income citizens . 
This is especially true in developing countries , where the population of cities will increase by more than two billion inhabitants over the next 30 years . 
The new urban areas to be created could be different , more egalitarian , and environmentally more sustainable than those built over the last 100 years . 
Public space networks of greenways , parks , plazas , exclusively pedestrian avenues , and streets could be the backbone of the new Third World city . 
As for mobility in a pedestrian city , it is possible to structure low-cost bus-based transit systems and to severely restrict car use during peak hours . 
Generally , cities in developing countries cannot afford architectural jewels such as Notre Dame ; but they can have formidable pedestrian avenues shaded by enormous tropical trees . 
Environmental and social sustainability worldwide depends to a large degree on what happens in developing countries &apos; cities over the next few decades . 
There is not much reason for optimism now . 
But there could be : if the Third World frees its feet , its mind will follow .
