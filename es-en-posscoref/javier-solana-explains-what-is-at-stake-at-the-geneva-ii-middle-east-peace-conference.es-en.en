The Enemy in Syria 
MADRID - The Geneva II Middle East peace conference , to be held on January 22 , will take place against a backdrop of singularly appalling numbers : Syria &apos;s brutal civil has left an estimated 130,000 dead , 2.3 million refugees registered in neighboring countries , and some four million more internally displaced . 
The stakes at the conference are thus exceptionally high , both for Syria and for its neighbors , which are straining against severe destabilization . Lebanon has taken in more than 800,000 Syrian refugees . 
Jordan and Turkey have more than a half-million each . 
These figures , a result of three years of civil war , are simply inacceptable . 
What seemed like a new phase of the Arab revolts in early 2011 has become the worst conflict so far this century . 
Meanwhile , the international community has been disastrously divided . 
Since the fighting began , Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has had Russia &apos;s explicit international support . 
But while Russia &apos;s strategy , from the outset , has been coherent and well-defined , the West &apos;s has not . 
The United States and the European Union have remained hesitant , establishing no clear aims regarding the conflict . 
This vacillation contrasts starkly with the position taken by Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Qatar , which have steadfastly supported the Sunni opposition to Assad , and that of Shia Iran and its Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah , which have been equally resolute in supporting the regime . 
Syria &apos;s civil war has crystallized the complex geopolitical problem that has long characterized the region : the Sunni-Shia cleavage . The sectarian divide underlies the latent struggle for regional control between Saudi Arabia and Iran . 
The radicalization of Syria &apos;s opposition , however , has complicated the situation even further , nesting one problem within another - much like Russian matryoshka dolls . 
The Sunnis are divided , with the more moderate forces opposing the radical Al Qaeda affiliates . 
In fact , in just the last few days , internecine clashes have left more than 700 dead . 
The turn for the worse followed last year &apos;s chain of events , which started with the United Nations &quot; accusation that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons and ended with the US-Russia brokered agreement to destroy the regime &apos;s chemical arsenal ( thereby avoiding a poorly planned and ill-timed Western military intervention ) . 
Indeed , it is now clear that the agreement &apos;s chief side effect has been to breathe new life into the regime , thereby frustrating the hope of the more moderate rebel groups and allowing Al Qaeda-linked forces to gather support and strength within the opposition . 
The consequences of this radicalization are spreading throughout the region and worldwide . 
Syria is now a problem for global security . 
The main concern now seems to have shifted to defeating Al Qaeda , rather than Assad . 
The region is in turmoil , and the presence of groups affiliated with Al Qaeda is an enormous risk for everyone . 
Indeed , ten years after the start of the war in Iraq , groups affiliated with Al Qaeda have taken control of key Iraqi cities , including the symbolically important city of Fallujah . 
The Geneva II conference offers an opportunity to address these dangers . 
We still do not know who will represent the Syrian opposition , or if the Syrian National Council ‒ which demands that Assad step down unconditionally ‒ will even be there . 
The regime , for its part , wants the conference to focus on combating the growing extremist presence within the opposition , which it refers to generically as &quot; terrorist . &quot; 
Nor is it known whether Iran will participate . 
As a key actor in the conflict , Iran should have an important role in its resolution . 
And , despite the resistance of Saudi Arabia and the Sunni opposition , the US and the EU currently seem more inclined to accept Iran &apos;s inclusion in the Geneva II negotiations , especially now that advances are being made in the implementation of the international agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program concluded in November . 
The top priority at the conference must be to secure a ceasefire . 
This is the only way to return to what should be the international community &apos;s main concern : ending the suffering of the Syrian population , restoring their country to them , and offering them the chance to construct the peaceful future they deserve . 
Beyond the geopolitical risks that Syria &apos;s civil war has created , the suffering of millions of human beings cries out for an end to the violence . 
After three years of war , a ceasefire is currently the best path to peace . 
For that reason , Geneva II is an opportunity that must not be wasted .
