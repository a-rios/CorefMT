Our Last Chance for a Safe Planet 
MELBOURNE - Humanity has just about run out of time to address climate change . 
Scientists have pointed out that a rise in temperature of 2º Celsius above pre-industrial levels will put the Earth in dangerous , uncharted territory . 
Yet we currently are on a path toward an increase of 4º or more this century . 
The last chance for action has arrived . 
That chance lies in Paris in December 2015 , when the world &apos;s governments meet for the 21st annual United Nations climate-change meeting . 
Either governments will agree to decisive action , as they have promised , or we will look back at 2015 as the year when climate sanity slipped through our fingers . 
In 1992 , the world &apos;s governments adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , promising to avoid &quot; dangerous anthropogenic &#91; human-induced &#93; interference in the climate system &quot; by reducing the rate of emission of greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide . 
In 1992 , global combustion of coal , oil , and gas , plus cement production , released 22.6 billion tons of CO2 into the air . 
In 2012 , the most recent year for which comparable data are available , emissions were 34.5 billion tons . 
Humanity has accelerated , rather than controlled , human-induced climate change . 
This is now the greatest moral issue of our time . 
Global fossil-fuel use gravely threatens the poor , who are the most vulnerable to climate change ( though the rich are the main cause ) , and future generations , who will inherit a planet that has become unlivable in many places , with food supply subject to massive shocks . 
We are causing this harm in an age when technological breakthroughs enable the world to shift from dangerous fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources , such as wind , solar , nuclear , and hydro , and reduce the impact of fossil fuels by using carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology . 
Pope Francis recently put it just right : &quot; Safeguard Creation , &quot; he said . 
Never forget this ! &quot; 
Yet , for the many powerful interests , climate change remains a game , with the goal being to delay action for as long as possible . 
The giant fossil-fuel companies have continued to lobby behind the scenes against the shift to low-carbon energy , and have used their vast wealth to buy media coverage designed to sow confusion . 
Rupert Murdoch &apos;s media empire in the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia , and elsewhere stands out as playing a particularly cynical and harmful role in spreading anti-scientific propaganda . 
Even so , the politics of climate change may be changing for the better - a change reflected in the Pope &apos;s forceful message . 
Here are six reasons why the stalemate might soon end . 
First , the world is waking up to the calamity that we are causing . 
Though the Murdoch propaganda machine churns out a daily stream of anti-scientific falsehoods , the public also sees prolonged droughts ( now in parts of Brazil , California , and Southeast Asia , to name a few places ) , massive floods ( recently in Bosnia and Serbia ) , and lethal heat waves ( in many parts of the world ) . 
Second , the world &apos;s citizens do not want to go down in flames . 
Public opinion has so far succeeded in blocking the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline , which would accelerate the production of Canada &apos;s oil sands - a shocking prospect , given that neither Canada nor the US yet have committed to a climate plan . 
Third , more severe climate shocks may lie ahead . 
This year could prove to be a major El Niño year , when the waters of the Eastern Pacific warm and create global climate disruptions . 
A big El Niño now would be even more dangerous than usual , because it would add to the overall rising trend in global temperatures . 
Indeed , many scientists believe that a big El Niño could make 2015 the hottest year in the Earth &apos;s history . 
Fourth , both the US and China , the two largest emitters of CO2 , are finally beginning to get serious . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration is trying to stop the construction of new coal-fired power plants , unless they are equipped with CCS technology . 
China , for its part , has realized that its heavy dependence on coal is causing such devastating pollution and smog that it is leading to massive loss of life , with life expectancy down as much as five years in regions with heavy coal consumption . 
Fifth , the Paris negotiations are finally beginning to attract global attention from both the public and world leaders . 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for political leaders to attend a special summit in September 2014 , 14 months ahead of the Paris meeting , to launch intensive negotiations . 
The UN expert network that I direct , the Sustainable Development Solutions Network ( UN SDSN ) , will issue a major report in July on how each of the major economies can successfully decarbonize the energy system . 
Finally , technological advances in low-carbon energy systems , including photovoltaics , electric vehicles , CCS , and fourth-generation nuclear power with greatly enhanced safety features , all help make the transition to low-cost , low-carbon energy technologically realistic , with huge benefits for human health and planetary safety . 
Starting this fall , the UN SDSN will create a platform for all global citizens to participate in the hard work of saving the planet . 
The SDSN will offer a free , online introductory course to climate change , and then host a global online &quot; negotiation &quot; of a global climate agreement . 
We expect that hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions , of interested citizens worldwide will participate online , showing the way for the politicians . 
The control of climate change is a moral imperative and a practical necessity - far too important to be left to politicians , Big Oil , and their media propagandists .
