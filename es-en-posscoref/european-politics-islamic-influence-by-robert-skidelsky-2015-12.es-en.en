European Politics With an Islamic Face ? 
LONDON - Donald Trump &apos;s call to bar Muslims from the United States provoked the following exchange with two young friends of mine : &quot; If the choice was between Muslim immigration and preserving liberal moral values , &quot; I asked , &quot; which would you choose ? &quot; 
They both denied the question &apos;s premise . 
The immigrants themselves , they suggested , might have reactionary moral codes , but their children , growing up in today &apos;s Britain , America , or Continental Europe , would be quite different . 
But is that true ? 
My question focused not on Islamist terrorism - the ostensible ground of Trump &apos;s outburst - but on the threat posed by large-scale Muslim immigration to the code of morals that my young friends , like most educated Europeans , now accept without question . 
Terrorism aside , wouldn &apos;t they worry if Islam came to have a growing influence on British law and politics ? 
This is not just a hypothetical possibility . 
The Muslim population in Europe was 44.1 million in 2010 , or 6 % of the total . 
There were 2.7 million Muslims in the United Kingdom in 2011 ( 4.8 % of the population ) , up from 1.6 million in 2001 . 
Given recent immigration trends and , more important , Muslims &quot; above-average fertility rate ( three children per family versus the British average of 1.8 ) , the Muslim share of the UK population is bound to grow for decades to come . 
Much of Europe is on the same demographic trajectory . 
Of course , demographics is not an exact science : Much depends on assumptions about age profiles , standards of living , inequality , and so on , and sooner or later the Muslim fertility rate will converge with the national average . 
But by then the Muslim population will have expanded rapidly - to 10-20 % of the total in the UK . 
The interesting question concerns the consequences of this . 
Liberals have not worried about ethnic demographics , because they assume that individuals eventually identify with the host society &apos;s norms . 
The standard argument is that immigrants enrich the host , while leaving any incompatible characteristics at home . 
In particular , their political behavior will fall into line with that of the general population . 
If this is right , the sociopolitical impact of a change in the ethnic composition of a population is neutral , or even beneficial . 
Immigrants from Algeria , Bangladesh , Pakistan , or Turkey will , in the course of a generation or two , become European in outlook and politics . 
Their religion will become for them a private matter , as it now is for most Europeans , and they will become integrated in all important respects . 
But that historical pattern , in my view , depended crucially on the small size of the immigrant population and its cultural closeness to the home population . 
( Even so , the process of assimilation was far from frictionless . ) 
Historical experience offers little guide to the social and political consequences of the much greater numbers and more pronounced cultural differences at stake in the postwar migrations to Europe , especially from the Muslim world . 
The incompatibilities are much greater . 
The nub of the problem is that contemporary European civilization is secular , whereas Muslim civilization is religious . 
In Europe , religion has lost its authority over law , legislation , education , morals , and business life . 
The Islamic world has undergone no comparable process . 
There is no systematic separation of faith and state ; the family , not the individual , remains the basic social unit . 
The essential elements of modern European political life - individual rights and duties , and the accountability of government to the governed - are lacking , particularly in the Arab Middle East . 
Despite efforts at secularization , the gap between Muslim and Western outlooks has , if anything , grown in recent years , as religion has regained ascendancy in most Muslim countries . 
Sharia religious law - extreme versions of which hold that conduct decriminalized in the West , such as adultery and homosexuality , is punishable by death - influences their legal codes . 
Moreover , in many countries , large majorities of Muslims say Sharia should be the official law . 
In Europe , Islam is the fastest-growing religion , and Sharia has penetrated European legal systems . 
In the UK , a hundred Sharia courts adjudicate on divorce and other family cases , prompting Home Secretary Theresa May to promise a review of Sharia courts &quot; to determine whether they are consistent with British values . &quot; 
Secularization is not inevitable . 
As the political philosopher Larry Siedentop has argued , &quot; secularization is Christianity &apos;s gift to the world . &quot; 
According to Siedentop , features specific to Christianity led to liberal individualism , and they are absent from the other great world religions . 
The great gift of secularism , in turn , has been tolerance . 
Despite horrific twentieth-century backsliding in Europe , secularism has served to blunt the edge of bigotry , because secular reasoning , unlike divine revelation , is never conclusive . 
Economists regard migration as a movement of individuals in search of a better life and call for more immigration to offset population aging , or to provide workers to do the &quot; dirty jobs . &quot; 
But such evocations of &quot; economic man &quot; miss a key dimension of migration : People carry their culture with them across political frontiers . 
We should not assume that economic success automatically leads to cultural convergence . 
This brings us back to Trump . 
Whatever happens in the US , Muslim immigration into Europe will continue and even expand in the next few years . 
The Syrian catastrophe alone ensures this . 
Everything that dialogue and education can do to close the gap between immigrant and host communities should be done . 
But it may not be possible to prevent a return to religious politics - and the conflict which religious bigotry brings . 
If we are to avoid sleepwalking into a highly troublesome future , we must recognize that failed integration , not terrorism , is the main danger we face .
