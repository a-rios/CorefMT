Can Italy Survive Berlusconi ? 
If history seems likely to rank Silvio Berlusconi as an inconsequential Prime Minister of Italy , it will surely remember him as an extraordinary - and extraordinarily bizarre - one . 
Promising one thing and delivering another was not so much a weakness of his government as its organizing principle . 
Given the erratic nature of Berlusconi &apos;s rule , it is no surprise that , ever since the 2001 election that returned him to power , the center-left l &apos;Unione coalition has won all subsequent elections - administrative , regional , and European . 
Yet the left &apos;s prospects in the upcoming parliamentary election are far from certain , and Berlusconi seems far from doomed . 
Given the country &apos;s economic conditions , one would think that Italy is ripe for decisive change . 
For the last four years , average growth in incomes has been a mere 0.3 % , compared to 1.5 % in the European Union , and in the past two years public debt has again started to rise . 
Moreover , the strategy of Berlusconi &apos;s ruling center-right Casa della Libertà coalition has been to tread water and wait for Europe &apos;s economy to pick up instead of tackling Italy &apos;s structural difficulties . 
As a result , the government is criticized not only by the unions , but also by the employers &quot; association , Confindustria , which in 2001 gave Prime Minister Berlusconi strong support . 
Then there is the ongoing conflict of interests between Berlusconi-the-Premier and Berlusconi-the-magnate , who holds public licenses that make him a semi-monopolist in media and TV advertising . 
During Berlusconi &apos;s tenure in office , his enormous personal assets have tripled . 
While his parliamentary majority has approved many laws that promote his personal interests and have eased some of his legal difficulties , at the beginning of March , Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax fraud . 
Berlusconi &apos;s ministers have scarcely behaved better . 
Two were forced to resign within a month of each other . 
Roberto Calderoli , a prominent official in Lega Nord , the third-largest government party , provoked riots in Libya by wearing a t-shirt printed with the infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad . 
Francesco Storace , the former Minister of Health and a leading member of Alleanza Nazionale , the second-largest government party , is suspected of organizing political espionage , in an Italian-style Watergate . 
But , despite the government &apos;s catastrophic economic and ethical record , opinion polls indicate a lead of only about four percentage points for l &apos;Unione - too small , given the high number of undecided voters , to predict the election &apos;s outcome . 
So what is keeping Berlusconi and his coalition in the race ? 
Above all , Berlusconi &apos;s electoral campaign is aimed , in the manner of President Bush &apos;s 2004 re-election campaign , at energizing his hard-core supporters and mobilizing the growing number of voters who have abstained in recent years . 
In doing this he has not hesitated to use his semi-monopoly over television to exalt his government &apos;s alleged accomplishments . 
His campaign rhetoric highlights anti-communism with an emphasis not seen in Italy since 1948 , coupled with a defense of the family and values cherished by the Roman Catholic establishment , although the Church has so far resisted being drawn into the campaign . 
The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l &apos;Unione . 
Its leader , Romano Prodi , obtained an extraordinary popular endorsement when more than four million people voted for him in Italy &apos;s first-ever primary elections . 
Yet Prodi continues to be a party-less leader of too many parties . 
To be sure , the cohesiveness of l &apos;Unione has strengthened : the two major parties ( Democratici di Sinistra and Democrazia e Libertà - la Margherita ) are united under the symbol of the olive tree , the other parties have endorsed a detailed 280-page government program , and the left-wing Partito della Rifondazione Comunista has given clear signs of moderation and loyalty to the coalition . 
For voters , however , a perception of fragility remains . 
Finally , the uncertainty of the outcome reflects not so much voters &quot; behavior , but a change in the electoral system . 
During the past decade , Italy has used a majority electoral system corrected by a proportional quota . 
Under this system , Casa della Libertà translated a small popular majority in 2001 into a decisive parliamentary majority . 
But , with the same result on the horizon this year for l &apos;Unione , the center-right parliamentary majority changed the electoral law just a few months before the end of its term . 
This is reminiscent of an army that , fearing defeat on the battlefield , poisons the wells as it retreats . 
A proportional system in the absence of individual preferences means that party secretaries , rather than citizens , will choose deputies , and , with no effective electoral threshold , the number of parties will proliferate . 
Although the election ballot will be 40 centimeters long to accommodate all the symbols of the old and new parties , it won &apos;t contain the name of even a single candidate . 
But the worst problem is that the majority system for the Senate could lead to a different majority gaining control there than in the Chamber of Deputies ( the lower house ) , which may well cause legislative paralysis . 
Moreover , President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi &apos;s mandate ends at the same time that parliament dissolves , which means that his successor , elected by the new parliament , would have to nominate a government without a majority in both houses . 
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a German-style grand coalition - an outcome that seems especially unlikely following an election campaign in which both contestants have strongly hinted that their opponent has no legitimate right to govern . 
At the same time , holding another vote would leave the question of the electoral law unresolved . 
The puzzle of Berlusconi &apos;s survival reflects a wider European conundrum . 
Many Europeans , not just Italians , are nervous and unsure of where the continent is going . 
So it is no surprise that an opportunist and charlatan like Berlusconi continues to get a hearing . 
Italians must decide upon the sort of Italy they want if they are to get leaders of the stature they need .
