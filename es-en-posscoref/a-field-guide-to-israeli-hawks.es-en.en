A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip , as well as some settlements in the West Bank , has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world . 
Many denounced Sharon &apos;s plan as a trick . 
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start . 
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders , debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves . 
Like everything in Israel , the process is more complicated , especially where the hawks are concerned . 
Basically , there are two species of Israeli hawks : call one kind ideological and the other strategic . 
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel , the homeland of the Jewish people . 
For them , the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony , which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria . 
Not all ideological hawks are religious , although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies . 
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists , and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists . 
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category . 
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud . 
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky , who founded &quot; Revisionist &quot; Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel &apos;s Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion . 
Then there are the strategic hawks . 
For them , given Israel &apos;s narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity , controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative , but is driven by security considerations . 
For them , Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands , but security outposts , aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland . 
They may be right or wrong in this assessment , but it is not an ideological one . 
Ariel Sharon , who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky &apos;s ideas - is a strategic hawk . 
For ideological hawks , compromises are treason : how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people , let alone God &apos;s promise to Abraham ? 
Strategic hawks , however , are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes . 
It is in this context that Sharon &apos;s moves should be seen . 
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security . 
He has brought neither . 
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein , the danger of an &quot; Eastern front &quot; against Israel has diminished . 
Absent a Palestinian partner , and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel &apos;s harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking : set up an effective barrier , move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements , and wait for another day . 
If one follows Sharon &apos;s statements in the last year , a clear pattern emerges . 
First , he admitted that &quot; eventually &quot; a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks . 
A few months later , he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of &quot; liberated &quot; rather than &quot; occupied &quot; territories . 
Last December , he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement , and that this would entail the &quot; relocation &quot; of some settlements . 
Although this was still merely verbiage , it was novel language for a Likud prime minister . 
Sharon &apos;s latest statements , though , explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated ; the Director of the National Security Council , General Giora Eiland , was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations , including compensation for relocated settlers . 
All of this has radically altered Israel &apos;s domestic political map . 
Some ideological hawks in Sharon &apos;s government threatened to resign ; 
Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net ; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government . 
The test , of course , is not in the planning , but in the implementation of withdrawal , and the road is long and bumpy . 
Sharon &apos;s timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption . 
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon &apos;s future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir , Sharon comes from the military , and for him security - not ideology - is supreme . 
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise .
