Steering Clear of the Euro Precipice 
ATHENS - Renewed turbulence in the eurozone bond market underlines the need to reappraise the policies now being pursued in order to overcome Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis . 
Indeed , the recent election results in France and Greece , reflecting a much broader anti-austerity mood , leave Europe &apos;s authorities with little choice . 
The European Union , the European Central Bank , and private-sector lenders have spent more than € 1 trillion over the past two years , but the eurozone remains in no better shape today than in the autumn of 2009 , when the full scale of Greece &apos;s fiscal problem was revealed . 
Meanwhile , the eurozone &apos;s recession is deepening and unemployment is rising . 
Moreover , skepticism about the eurozone authorities &quot; and leading powers &quot; determination and / or competence to ensure the currency &apos;s viability is increasing systemic risk . 
For example , the European Investment Bank now inserts a drachma clause in its loan deals with Greek enterprises . 
The same message is conveyed by the worries recently expressed by the Bundesbank with regard to the build-up of so-called Target 2 balances . 
In case of a breakup of the eurozone , these balances cause losses for the Eurosystem and member states &quot; central banks . 
Indeed , many eurozone central banks reportedly have reduced their holdings of euro reserves , seeking to diversify into non-traditional currencies . 
What caused the debt crisis , and how to resolve it , remain in dispute . 
What is clear is that a key factor has been the persistence of large imbalances within the eurozone - current-account deficits on the periphery , mirrored by surpluses in the core - owing mainly to differences in productivity and competitiveness . 
Excess savings have been transferred from the core to the periphery , creating conditions for extensive borrowing and accumulation of debt . 
Debt growth exposed critical weaknesses in the eurozone &apos;s economic constitution : national debts are the responsibility of member countries , but the common currency is without a sovereign . 
Unlike most central banks , the ECB cannot act as a lender of last resort , which , in conjunction with the absence of common bonds ( Eurobonds ) , induced large-scale speculation on intra-European national debts . 
Resolving the crisis inevitably includes action on both fronts . 
The causes of the persistent imbalances should be addressed through a combined effort at fiscal consolidation and strengthened competitiveness , with structural reforms focusing on liberalizing markets and encouraging wage flexibility . 
At the same time , the eurozone must be equipped with the instruments needed to restore stability and prevent the recurrence of crisis conditions . 
This agenda includes centralizing European debt through Eurobonds , mobilizing sufficient rescue funds , allowing the ECB to exercise the full range of central-banking powers , and reinforcing policy coordination in order to sustain economic activity in austerity-stricken member countries . 
But sharp disagreements exist over the content and timing of the policy response . 
The weaker countries accept the need for reforms , but favor a longer time horizon for fiscal-deficit reduction in order to encourage a return to growth . 
They also demand faster implementation of the necessary changes to the eurozone &apos;s economic governance in order to create a more stable and hospitable environment for fiscal consolidation and reform . 
A prolonged recession , punctuated by high - or prohibitive - borrowing costs , makes achieving either the fiscal or the reform targets increasingly difficult , if not impossible . 
The burden of adjustment cannot fall exclusively on the deficit countries - unless , that is , a moral element of &quot; punishment &quot; is involved . 
The core countries , led by Germany , distrust the over-indebted countries &quot; determination to pursue reforms if their financing conditions are eased . 
Moreover , they oppose key changes in the eurozone &apos;s economic governance . 
They could envisage the issuance of Eurobonds only after the completion of real economic and fiscal adjustment . 
They reject the use of ECB credit as a substitute for adjustment , because it would eventually fuel inflation . 
And they question the sustainability of economic and fiscal unification - allowing transfers to the weaker countries - in the absence of political unification involving loss of sovereignty . 
If the stalemate persists , the debt crisis will soon reach new peaks . 
Continued recession and recurrent speculative attacks in the bond markets will prevent at least some over-indebted countries from attaining their adjustment targets , creating conditions for political crisis within the eurozone and individual countries . 
It will not be possible to postpone indefinitely strategic decisions concerning the euro &apos;s future . 
It has been argued that in such circumstances , political will emerges , deus ex machina , and saves the day . 
As the crisis develops , accidents may happen that authoritiesRead more from our &quot; The Euro at Bay &quot; Focal Point. find hard to control . 
Moreover , in some quarters of Europe , the euro &apos;s survival is viewed as requiring a cull : its membership should be reduced to those countries with convergent economic structures and performance , notwithstanding the enormous economic and social disruption that would be unleashed , or the heavy blow to Europe &apos;s global influence . 
Given Europe &apos;s current political balance , and taking into account its time-honored tradition of muddling through , the following stand out as minimum requirements for steering clear of the precipice : 
 
A commitment to issue Eurobonds at a fixed date in the near future , as well as setting in motion the legal process for doing so . 
This would bring down borrowing costs for over-indebted countries and support economic activity .  
Implementation of a Marshall Plan-type initiative to finance investment in the weaker countries . 
Mobilizing resources in the EU budget and significantly increasing the lending capacity of the EIB would counter the recessionary effects of austerity .  
Relax deficit-reduction targets for countries particularly hard-hit by recession , while easing monetary policy as much as existing rules permit . 
Higher German inflation is part of the adjustment process.A growing chorus of European and world opinion is pushing in the direction of more growth-oriented policies . 
The resistance will be strong . 
The next few months are critical for the eurozone &apos;s future .
