Happy Days Are Not Here Again 
The National Bureau of Economic Research , the non-profit organization that has long been responsible for marking the beginning and end of America &apos;s recessions , has finally declared that the recession that it said began in March 2001 is over . 
In fact , the NBER says that it ended almost two years ago , in November 2001 . 
Non-economists find it hard to understand why it took the NBER so long to decide that the US recession was over . 
Economics is not supposed to be an exact science , but isn &apos;t this tardiness taking things a bit too far ? 
More importantly , if the recession is over - and has been for so long - why don &apos;t Americans feel any better ? 
Why is the economic mood so negative ? 
The answer lies in the definition of a recession . 
In fact , the questions posed by the NBER may not be the right questions , or at least the most relevant . 
A recession is normally defined as two quarters ( six months ) of decline in GDP . 
By carefully poring over the data , the NBER determined that output most probably started to grow again in December 2001 . 
Having determined that , it was easy to date the end of the recession . 
Indeed , today output is 3.3 % above its pre-recession peak of late 2000 . 
But that does not mean that the economy is performing well . 
Not at all . 
In economics , one has to run to stand still . 
Every year , more than one million additional workers enter America &apos;s labor force , and a functioning economy must find jobs for them . 
One of the marvels of a market economy is how , every year , year after year , productivity - the amount of output produced by each worker in an hour - increases . 
During the 1990 &apos;s , Americans &apos; productivity soared . 
The new economy may have been hyped , but behind all the hype was something real : the rate of productivity growth increased . 
In the 1960 &apos;s , productivity increased by more than 3 % per year , but in the early 1970 &apos;s , productivity growth suddenly declined , by almost two thirds . 
Economists puzzle over why . 
More entrants to the labor force , higher oil prices , and lower investment played a role , but most mysteriously , the pace of technological progress seemed to slow dramatically . 
For all the vaunted supply-side economics , productivity gains remained weak in the 1980 &apos;s . 
The turnaround came during the Clinton administration , although some investments in technology made in earlier years almost surely played a role . 
But with productivity now back up to the levels of the 1960 &apos;s , the economy &apos;s annual growth potential increased from around 2.5 % to around 3.5 % . 
The important point is that unless the economy is growing at a fairly strong pace , say around 3 % , no jobs will be created . 
That is what has happened during the Bush years . 
The economy has grown , but not enough to create new jobs , let alone to create enough new jobs for all the new entrants to the labor force . 
Today , unemployment is the highest it has been since 1994 , at 6.2 % ( far higher than the 5.3 % of Japan &apos;s supposedly moribund economy ) . 
But even this number masks the true extent of the problem . 
Jobs are so scarce that many Americans have given up looking - the so-called discouraged worker effect . 
Had labor force participation remained at the level of the late 1990 &apos;s , the unemployment rate would be far higher . 
More and more workers have joined the ranks of the long-term unemployed - out of a job so long that they are no longer eligible for unemployment benefits . 
Ironically , one early argument used by the Bush administration to resist increases in unemployment benefits was that it would discourage workers from looking for a job . 
They seemed callously to suggest that the problem of unemployment was with workers too lazy to pound the pavement to find work . 
But if there are no jobs , looking does no good . 
So the NBER &apos;s efforts at dating recessions - defined the way they do - are of only limited relevance . 
After all , there is nothing magic about the number zero . 
Indeed , the focus on zero can be misleading . 
The gap between an economy &apos;s potential and its actual performance is what matters most . 
Assume that America &apos;s annual growth potential is 3.5 % . 
In a $ 10 trillion economy , that means America lost something like $ 320 billion in 2001 , $ 440 billion in 2002 , and , if growth turns out to be even 3 % in 2003 , $ 500 billion in 2003 . 
The Bush administration has been setting all kinds of records , such as the largest adverse turnaround in America &apos;s fiscal position in the space of just over two years - more than $ 700 billion per year - from a robust surplus to a yawning deficit . 
But this waste , in excess of a trillion dollars over three years , sets another record . 
So Americans are right not to let declarations about the end of the US recession make them feel good . 
Weak economic performance - whether it is called a recession or not - smells just as bad . 
Those responsible for such economic mismanagement should be held accountable .
