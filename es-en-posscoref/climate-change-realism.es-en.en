Climate Change Realism 
NEW YORK - &quot; Wonderful , Wonderful Copenhagen , &quot; a popular song from the 1952 film musical &quot; Hans Christian Andersen , &quot; will probably be played many times this fall , as world leaders will be gathering in the Danish capital in December ( and in New York in September ) to confront the challenge of climate change . 
But , unless international thinking gets considerably more realistic in a hurry , what happens in Copenhagen will be anything but wonderful . 
It should come as no surprise that there is little consensus on a comprehensive accord that would have a meaningful impact on the world &apos;s climate . 
Governments will not sacrifice near- and medium-term economic growth for long-term environmental benefits . 
This is especially true now , given that much of the developed world is in the midst of a painful recession . 
The United States , for one , will not accept ceilings that reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions significantly if it means accepting higher costs and taxes that risk slowing economic recovery . 
Developing countries are , if anything , even more opposed to such ceilings or &quot; caps . &quot; 
Four hundred million Indians still lack electricity ; 
India cannot be expected to rule out greater use of coal if that proves to be the best way to produce electricity for one-third of its citizens . 
China , too , is unlikely to agree to &quot; caps &quot; on emissions of any kind , given the relatively low standard of living of most Chinese . 
But such a stance dooms prospects for a new global treaty , as developed countries will rightly insist that poorer countries be part of the solution . 
The consequences of failure in Copenhagen could be considerable . 
In the short run , we may well see climate-related concerns become the newest excuse for increased trade protectionism . 
So-called &quot; carbon tariffs &quot; are likely to be introduced to penalize imports from countries or companies deemed not to be doing enough to curb emissions . 
World trade is already down sharply as a result of the economic crisis ; introducing new tariffs would inevitably reduce trade further , causing the loss of additional jobs and leading to new frictions . 
Over time , a failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would lead to additional climate change , which in turn would increase the severity of poverty , the scale of internal displacement and migration , the scarcity of water , the prevalence of disease , and the number and intensity of storms . 
The result could be more failed states and more conflict between states . 
Climate change is as much a matter of security as it is an economic and human concern . 
So what should be done ? 
The most important step for those preparing for Copenhagen is to embrace national policies that increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions . 
The US has at long last done some of this in adopting new and much higher standards for automobile fuel efficiency . 
Regulatory policy can increase the efficiency of appliances , housing , and machinery . 
Such reforms should appeal to rich and poor countries alike , as they would reduce spending on energy and dependence on oil imports . 
Coordinated national actions are not the same as unilateralism . 
There is no unilateral answer to what is a global challenge . 
But to describe a challenge as global is not to argue that the remedy is to be found only in an ambitious , formal , and universal treaty . 
Such an accord might well be desirable , but it is simply not an option for climate change any time soon . 
The goal for the representatives of the nearly 200 countries who will meet in Copenhagen should not be a single sweeping agreement so much as a set of more modest agreements . 
Coal is one place to begin , as it will continue to generate the lion &apos;s share of the world &apos;s electricity for decades to come . 
Greater sharing of existing cleaner-coal technologies is needed , as is continued development of next-generation clean-coal plants . 
Nuclear power is another area requiring attention . 
So , too , are renewable forms of power , such as solar and wind . 
Here , too , mechanisms are needed for sharing new technologies and helping poorer countries pay for them in exchange for adopting policies that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Moreover , stopping the destruction of forests is essential , given how much carbon is trapped in them . 
One objective for Copenhagen should be to create a well-endowed global fund to support policies that discourage the cutting and burning of trees , help countries such as Brazil and Indonesia protect their rain forests , and provide alternative livelihoods to those who currently benefit from destroying them . 
Focusing on steps such as these would go a long way toward attaining the often-discussed goal of halving global carbon emissions by mid-century . 
But reaching an accord that sets binding ceilings for what each country will be allowed to emit is not an option in Copenhagen . 
The consensus simply does not exist . 
Smaller steps , however , can and should be taken . 
Those who want to master the challenge of climate change now will reject such realism . 
But , as is often the case , those who insist on getting everything risk getting nothing .
