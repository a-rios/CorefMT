New Light on Income Inequality 
ABU DHABI - Speeches by politicians on inequality tend to be short on facts and long on ideological assertion . 
In developing and emerging economies , one charitable explanation for the poor quality of public discourse about income inequality is that data on income distribution are often unavailable or dubious . 
On this most important of subjects , debates tend to generate more heat than light . 
A new set of studies could help put an end to all that . 
Led by Nora Lustig , a professor of economics who specializes in Latin America , a team at Tulane University &apos;s Commitment to Equity Institute created comprehensive databases on both the state of income distribution and the effects of government policies on that distribution . 
Crucially , the figures are comparable across a large set of middle- and low-income countries and also with data available for advanced countries . 
Preliminary conclusions emerging from these studies will illuminate political debates - and likely annoy ideologues of both the right and the left . 
Start , Lustig argues in a recent paper , with the fact that world income inequality is not rising . 
Consider the Gini coefficient , the most common measure of inequality , which runs from a value of zero for perfect equality to 100 for perfect inequality ( one person receives all the income ) . 
The average Gini score ( not weighted by population ) in countries for which there are data declined slightly in the 2000-2010 period , from 39 to 38 . 
Yes , the score rose in rich countries over the same period - from 29.8 to 30.4 . 
But it fell precipitously in Latin America , from a scandalous 55.1 in 2000 - which made the continent the world &apos;s most unequal region - to a still-very-high 50.2 a decade later . 
The Gini score also dropped in South Asia . 
In Sub-Saharan Africa , where data are more fragile , it seems to have remained roughly constant . 
Moreover , inequality seems to be dropping precisely where it was most acute to begin with . 
This is true both for regions , particularly Latin America , and for countries , such as Brazil and South Africa . 
So the often-heard assertion that rising inequality is the central economic fact of our times is probably due to a disparity of a different kind : the outsize impact of rich-country pundits and news outlets on international debates . 
Another set of findings is sure to upset zealots from the right : tax-and-transfer schemes can have , and are having , a significant impact in reducing inequality . 
In one comparison of middle-income countries in Asia , Africa , and Latin America , Lustig shows that Gini coefficients after taxes and transfers ( including the cash value of education and health services ) are significantly lower than those for initial market incomes . 
The average drop for the nine emerging countries - including the still hugely unequal South Africa - that she compares is more than three points ( 55.7 to 52.5 ) . 
The same exercise , which treats pensions as deferred consumption and therefore abstracts from the redistributive role of pensions among the older populations of the advanced economies , yields a drop of seven points in the United States and a bit more than nine points in the European Union . 
So emerging countries are doing better - but could improve considerably . 
But this does not mean that activists should demand higher taxes and public spending under all circumstances . 
The quality of government programs makes a big difference . 
Brazil has a public sector that is roughly twice the size of Chile &apos;s - total tax revenue is approximately 20 % of GDP in the latter and somewhere around 40 % ( estimates differ ) in the former . 
And social expenditure ( again treating pensions as deferred consumption ) is also twice as large in Brazil : 16 % versus 8 % of GDP . 
But , according to Lustig , the effect of government redistribution on inequality is the same in both countries : a nearly four-point drop in the Gini score . 
What Lustig does not explore is that the contrast is even sharper if one recalls that Brazil &apos;s government spends a great deal less than Chile &apos;s on infrastructure , relative to GDP . 
It is hard to escape the conclusion that some public expenditure in Brazil serves little purpose other than keeping certain political constituencies conveniently quiet . 
A case also worth noting is that of Bolivia , where left-wing administrations have significantly expanded social-welfare spending . 
But , because cash transfers are universal , rather than targeted at the poor , the overall effect is not progressive but neutral , another paper finds . 
Crucially , taxes and transfers are not the only way to fight inequality . 
Earlier work by Lustig and her coauthors found that a declining wage premium - that is , a drop in the wage gap between workers with high and low education - explained part of the decline in the Gini coefficient in Latin American countries . 
It is not easy to disentangle the role of supply and demand factors in the reduction of the wage premium , but both seem to have played a role . 
On the demand side , exchange-rate devaluations made non-traditional exports more competitive and helped boost demand for relatively unskilled labor . 
On the supply side , a sharp increase in years of schooling , and especially in access to higher education , swelled the ranks of professionals and other skilled workers and helped lower their relative wages . 
This is all good for income distribution , but the resulting politics remains fraught . 
Student activists demanding ( along with the rest of society ) a fairer distribution of resources may not wish to hear that the growing numbers of professionals often resulted from the rapid and controversial expansion of private - and sometimes for-profit , universities - and that this accounts for part of the drop in inequality . 
Similarly , young men and women who worked hard to get to university with the expectation of very high relative compensation are not happy to find that the wages of , say , journalists and psychologists , are rising much more slowly than those of computer technicians or machine operators . 
Indeed , this frustration is behind ( though not always overtly ) many of the recent university student protests in Latin America and elsewhere . 
So income inequality is bound to prove politically controversial when it is worsening , and also when it tends to decline . 
Studies like those led by Lustig can illuminate the inevitable controversies , so that they yield better policies rather than simple acrimony .
