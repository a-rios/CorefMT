Nationalism , Madness , and Terrorism 
BOSTON - If we want to understand what drove the Boston Marathon bombing suspects , Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , to terrorism , the answer almost certainly does not lie in Dagestan , where the brothers lived before moving to the United States , or in the two wars fought in Chechnya in the last 20 years . 
Instead , a key to the Tsarnaevs &quot; behavior may perhaps be found in developments in England 500 years ago . 
Several new phenomena appeared in sixteenth-century England that revolutionized human experience . 
English society was redefined as a &quot; nation &quot; - that is , a sovereign community of equal members . 
With that , the era of nationalism began , and social mobility became legitimate . 
At the same time , a special variety of mental illness was first observed , which we would later call schizophrenia and depressive disorders - different from a multitude of mental illnesses already known . 
It called into being a new term , &quot; madness , &quot; the first medical specialization ( eventually named &quot; psychiatry &quot; ) , and special legislation regarding the &quot; mad . &quot; 
Madness expressed itself in degrees of mental impairment , the common symptoms of which were chronic discomfort in one &apos;s environment ( social maladjustment ) , uncertainty about oneself , oscillation between self-loathing and megalomania , and sometimes a complete loss of identity . 
Suicide became common , and the nature of violent crime changed , with a new type - irrational and unconnected to self-interest - becoming increasingly prevalent . 
These phenomena were connected . 
It was nationalism that legitimated mobility ; the two of them together that produced madness ; and the new mental disease that expressed itself in suicide and irrational violence . 
Nationalism implied a specific image of society and reality in general - a consciousness that was to become the cultural framework of modernity . 
In its original , English , form it was essentially democratic . 
As it spread , it carried the seeds of democracy everywhere . 
By considering a living community sovereign , nationalism implicitly but drastically reduced the relevance of God ; even when combined with religion and presented in a religious idiom , it was essentially secular . 
National consciousness , dramatically different from the fundamentally religious , hierarchical consciousness that it replaced , shapes how we live today . 
Nationalist principles emphasize the self-governing individual , including the right to choose one &apos;s social position and identity . 
A member of a nation cannot learn who or what s / he is from the environment , as would an individual in a religious and rigidly stratified social order , in which everyone &apos;s position and behavior is defined by birth and divine providence . 
Modern culture cannot provide us with the consistent guidance that other cultures give to their members . 
By providing inconsistent guidance ( for we are inevitably guided by our cultural environment ) , nationalism actively disorients us - a cultural insufficiency called anomie . 
Because a clear sense of identity is a necessary condition for adequate mental functioning , malformation of identity leads to discomfort with one &apos;s self and social maladjustment , reaching clinical proportions among the more fragile of us . 
That is why the addition of madness to the roster of familiar mental illnesses coincided with the emergence of nationalism . 
The more choices for the definition of one &apos;s identity that a society offers - and the more insistent it is on equality - the more problematic the formation of identity in it becomes . 
That is why the most open and freest society today , the Unites States , leads the world in rates of severe mental disease - supplanting England , yesterday &apos;s freest and most open society . 
Indeed , foreigners at one time considered madness &quot; the English malady . &quot; 
Most examples of violent crime by mentally ill people were committed first in England , and then in the US , often seeming politically motivated , even when mediated by religion . 
The first such case was likely that of Peter Berchet , a young Protestant , who felt that he had to kill the royal councilor Christopher Hatton , also a Protestant , whom Berchet believed to be a Catholic sympathizer . 
Attempting to answer this calling , Berchet murdered another Protestant whom he mistook for Hatton . 
To all appearances the act of a Puritan fanatic , the authorities suspected Berchet of being a part of an organized Puritan conspiracy . 
He was to be questioned to divulge the names of his co-conspirators and then executed . 
It was as natural for an Elizabethan Protestant to see the cause of his mental discomfort in a government overrun by Catholic sympathizers as it is for someone with a Muslim connection in the US today to see this cause in America as the embodiment of Western offenses against the faith . 
Blaming one &apos;s existential discomfort on external factors is a kind of self-therapy . 
A story is constructed , which rationalizes one &apos;s discomfort as reflecting an awareness of some general evil . 
One may then join an organization committed to fighting that evil or be impelled to act on one &apos;s own - to the point of committing murder . 
The thinking behind such acts bears the most distinctive mark of delusion : the loss of the understanding of the symbolic nature of human reality , confusing symbols and their referents , and seeing people in terms of what they represent . 
It is precisely this modern irrationality - a product of modernity itself - that the terrorist attack launched by the Tsarnaev brothers reflected .
