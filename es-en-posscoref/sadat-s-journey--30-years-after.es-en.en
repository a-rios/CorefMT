Sadat &apos;s Journey , 30 Years After 
TOLEDO  -  
His peace overture to Israel stunned the Middle East . 
He had , as he put it , gone &quot; to the end of the earth &quot; ( the Knesset in Jerusalem ) , and in doing so transformed the region &apos;s politics beyond recognition . 
From that moment , the question for the Arabs was no longer how to destroy Israel , but how to reach an accomodation with it . 
In his dramatic leap into the future , Sadat taught Arab leaders the realities of a changing world . 
For Sadat &apos;s peace overture was born out of a sober strategic analysis of the regional balance of power . 
It was clear to him that Israel was a nuclear power that , in October 1973 , had once again proven itself to be unbeatable in a conventional war - a war Sadat himself had never expected to win when he launched it . 
Understanding Clausewitz &apos;s dictum that war is a continuation of politics by other means , Sadat had sent the Egyptian Army across the Suez Canal in order to unleash a peace process . 
He was defeated militarily , but his decision to go to Jerusalem meant that he would succeed politically . 
During all of their abortive attempts to destroy Israel , the Arabs had relied on the military backing of the Soviet Union . 
But a strategy of peace with Israel , Sadat knew , required an alliance with the United States . 
This alliance was so vital an objective for Sadat that one may rightly wonder what came first in his strategy . 
Perhaps Sadat might have opted to secure the American alliance without making peace with Israel if he had been able to do so . 
But he could not , and he knew it . 
Indeed , in 1974 , when General Gamasy , the architect of the 1973 war , questioned Sadat &apos;s flexibility in the disengagement talks with Israel , Egypt &apos;s president calmed him down by saying , &quot; Don &apos;t forget , General , we are talking here about peace with the Americans ! &quot; 
Another shift implicit in Sadat &apos;s strategy was to keep Egypt at a distance from pan-Arabism . 
Weary of inter-Arab politics , and tired of the high price Egypt had paid for the Palestinian cause , Sadat wanted to move away from Nasser &apos;s pan-Arab ambitions and an excessive focus on the question of Palestine toward an emphasis on Egypt &apos;s role as a power lying at the strategic crossroads between Asia and Africa . 
Sadat would , of course , continue to champion the Palestinian cause as the heart of an Arab consensus and sometimes as a fig leaf for his own Egypt-focused foreign policy . 
But , for all practical purposes , Sadat had embarked on a path leading to a separate peace with Israel . 
One lesson of Sadat &apos;s initiative is that in protracted conflicts where deep emotions and historical hatreds are involved , when almost every conceivable diplomatic formula has been tried and failed , the shock of a visionary , generous , and imaginative step can open new paths . 
The major problem in the Arab-Isreli conflict , as in many other intricate disputes , has always been the incapacity or unwillingness of leaders to conduct a peace policy that is not supported by their societies &quot; prevailing , and frequently paralyzing , consensus . 
Leaders , more often than not , are hostage to the socio-political environment that produces them , rather than its shapers . 
Sadat gained a privileged place in history and achieved immortality the moment he fled from the comfortable prison of inertia , and from the pantomime solidarity and hollow rhetorical cohesion of Arab summits . 
The test of statesmanship did not end there . 
Sadat &apos;s spectacular leap into the future needed to be met by Israel &apos;s prime minister , Menachem Begin , at almost every juncture down a tortuous road to peace . 
Arguably , only a political &quot; hawk &quot; like Begin , a man with a keen sense of the dramatic and a political romantic with a beady eye to the judgment of history , could have responded in such a way to Sadat &apos;s initiative . 
That Begin was able to rise to the occasion had much to do with the psychological impact of Sadat &apos;s astonishing initiative . 
Through his visit to Jerusalem , Sadat made more ordinary the nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
Sadat &apos;s initiative transformed the conflict from a fight about Israel &apos;s right to exist into a negotiation of interests between legitimate sovereign states . 
Here , indeed , is the central point : the need to move away from mythological , mutually exclusive rights of existence , conflicting historical narratives , and religious claims of ownership . 
Sadly , this is where the Palestinian-Israeli tragedy remains stuck to this very day , thus making the conflict practically insoluble . 
Through his visit to Jerusalem , Sadat shook away Israel &apos;s siege mentality and gave psychological living space to an otherwise claustrophobic nation in the midst of a hostile Arab world . 
Peace is never a zero-sum game . 
In its peace with Israel , Egypt reached its strategic objective of an alliance with the US . 
But Israel was wrong to believe that Egypt could be a gateway into the Arab world . 
The gate to Israeli-Arab reconciliation remains where it was always been - in the hands of the Palestinians .
