China &apos;s Daring Depreciation 
BEIJING - On August 11 , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) lowered the central parity rate of the renminbi by 1.9 % , sending shockwaves around the globe . 
Many foreign commentators condemned the devaluation as a blatant attempt to boost Chinese exports - a move that would , they warned , spark a new round of currency wars . 
But there are good reasons to believe that this was not China &apos;s motivation at all . 
In fact , China knows full well that currency wars are self-defeating . 
During the 1997 Asian financial crisis , China &apos;s economic situation was much worse than it is today , but the government still resisted the temptation to devalue the renminbi - and the country managed to emerge from the crisis virtually unscathed . 
Today , a devaluation would probably do little for China &apos;s trade surplus . 
After all , the country already accounts for more than 12 % of global exports , so expanding its share further would probably worsen its terms of trade . 
The dominance of processing trade in China - the import of raw materials and components and the export of finished goods - makes the effectiveness of devaluation even more dubious . 
Moreover , China now holds a massive volume of overseas assets and liabilities ; its non-financial corporations have borrowed as much as $ 1 trillion abroad . 
As devaluation causes businesses &quot; debt burdens to grow in renminbi terms , the risk of non-performing loans and bankruptcies rises . 
Beyond an awareness of the short-term risks of competitive devaluation lies the Chinese government &apos;s serious commitment to its longer-term goal of shifting the country &apos;s growth model from one based on investment and exports to one driven by domestic consumption . 
Indeed , China plans to shrink its trade surplus - which , to be sure , remains large - and offset the negative impact of that process by increasing domestic demand . 
Given these factors , it seems likely that the recent devaluation was driven by a different goal . 
And , in fact , an announcement made on the same day as the devaluation - one that has been largely overshadowed by the panic - offers an important indication of what that goal was . 
From now on , China &apos;s government declared , the renminbi &apos;s central parity rate will align more closely with the previous day &apos;s closing spot rates . 
This suggests that the devaluation was aimed primarily at giving the markets a greater role in determining the renminbi exchange rate , with the goal of enabling deeper currency reform . 
As it stands , Chinese exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate by a maximum of 2 % on either side of the central parity , which the PBOC fixes daily . 
When the moving market rate reaches the edges of the fluctuation band , the PBOC can intervene in the market by buying or selling its foreign-exchange reserves . 
Market makers now have been instructed that the offer prices they report to the PBOC should be based on the market &apos;s closing parity rate from the previous day , along with the demand and supply conditions in the foreign-exchange market and the movements of major currencies &quot; exchange rates . 
If the PBOC is now simply moving closer to averaging the offer prices that are not subject to its interference , it is moving closer to an entirely market-based exchange-rate regime . 
But this shift carries serious risks . 
If the renminbi were to depreciate by , say , 2 % every day , it would take very little time for the currency to lose 20 % of its value - enough to cause a panic and , regardless of the country &apos;s economic fundamentals , send the exchange rate into a tailspin . 
That is why the PBOC has retained the right to influence the reporting of offer prices by market makers and intervene directly in the market . 
And this is precisely what the PBOC did on August 12-13 , when stronger-than-expected depreciation pressure and surging devaluation expectations raised the risk that the planned one-off exchange-rate adjustment could trigger a rout . 
So the PBOC informed the market that the depreciation would not exceed 3 % - a credible statement , given abundant official reserves with which to stabilize the exchange rate . 
The renminbi rebounded , and calm was restored . 
This episode showed that the renminbi is under significant depreciation pressure , which is likely to intensify as the PBOC , amid weak GDP growth , loosens monetary policy ( particularly as the US Federal Reserve is gradually tightening its monetary policy ) . 
Add to that efforts to liberalize the capital account and internationalize the renminbi , and some exchange-rate volatility can be expected . 
For China &apos;s monetary policymakers , reforming the exchange-rate system , while preventing depreciation from getting out of hand , poses a serious challenge . 
For the rest of the world , encouraging China to loosen its grip over the exchange rate , even as the renminbi depreciates significantly , is an equally serious imperative . 
Neither side can afford to fail .
