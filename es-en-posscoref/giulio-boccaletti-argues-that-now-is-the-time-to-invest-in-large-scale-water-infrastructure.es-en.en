Scaling Up Water Sustainability 
NEW YORK - Since 2000 , when the United Nations Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) were adopted , the global community has rightly focused significant attention on providing access to basic water and sanitation services . 
From 1990 to 2010 , more than two billion people gained access to improved water sources . 
As the United Nations prepares to adopt so-called Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) as the post-2015 successor to the MDGs , the high-stakes business of large-scale water infrastructure should be placed front and center . 
The conventional wisdom has been that improved access to water depends on digging wells , adopting community-based solutions , and focusing aid programs on reaching more people . 
But these important measures are only one part of a much larger - and more capital-intensive - strategy . 
According to a recent report by UNICEF and the World Health Organization on their joint monitoring program for water supply and sanitation , more than 1.2 billion of those who gained access to water from 1990 to 2008 had it piped to their premises . 
This number dwarfs the impact of the &quot; small-scale &quot; sources - from dug wells to rainwater harvesting - that many believe have done the most to solve the problem . 
In fact , the number of those who gained access to water was higher in the decade preceding adoption of the MDGs . 
India and China accounted for the vast majority of those gains , as both countries enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1990 &quot; s and were able to lift large numbers of people out of poverty . 
As these examples suggest , countries have been most successful at delivering water services when they can rely on their own economic growth to bridge the gap in water-infrastructure costs . 
But the gap is widening . 
The 2013 World Economic Forum Global Risks report identified &quot; water supply crises &quot; as the biggest &quot; societal risk &quot; to global prosperity . 
According to some estimates , meeting the needs of a growing global economy will require the world to begin devoting at least $ 1 trillion annually to water infrastructure within the next 20 years - roughly double the level of annual spending today . 
Addressing this development challenge will require new thinking , innovation , and action in areas such as sustainable hydropower , efficient agriculture , and access to safe drinking water for cities . 
The first step should be ensuring that the natural infrastructure - the rivers , aquifers , and wetlands that determine the quantity , reliability , and quality of our water - can continue to function . 
In many cases , this is by far the most cost-effective option to ensure long-term water sustainability . 
Several countries around the world - from Colombia and Mexico to China and the United States - have begun investing along these lines . 
Of course , even if only 10 % of total investment in water resources were committed to cost-effective natural infrastructure - the same proportion that , for example , New York City devotes to protecting its own natural infrastructure , the reservoirs of the Catskills - we would still need to find about $ 100 billion per year . 
Mobilizing capital at that scale requires allocating the right risks to the right investors . 
Not surprisingly , the capital available for investments with a limited track record , uncertain future cash flows , and untested regulatory frameworks is extremely scarce . 
The key to scaling up investment in natural infrastructure will be to ensure that at every successive stage of growth , there is a sufficient amount of capital available to support the risks involved . 
Public-sector capital has traditionally been the &quot; risk taker of last resort , &quot; underwriting large-scale projects and paying for much of the existing water infrastructure . 
But , given credit constraints , many public institutions will be unable to underwrite the development and deployment of new solutions , particularly those that need to establish their track record at scale without a guaranteed revenue source . 
Private capital - particularly the large amounts of private savings stored in middle-income countries - could , in principle , single-handedly underwrite new combinations of natural and engineered infrastructure solutions . 
But private capital would face significant opportunity costs , and investors are unlikely to opt for vehicles with which they have limited experience . 
That leaves philanthropic capital - whether from private or public sources - as a key component of early-stage investment . 
Philanthropy has an important role to play in bearing the risks involved while natural-infrastructure solutions establish the track record needed to tap larger sources of public and private capital . 
While small-scale solutions , such as dug wells , will remain an important part of efforts to ensure water security , a truly sustainable water-management path - particularly in the fast-developing countries of Latin America , Asia , and Africa - will require hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment . 
The process of formulating the SDGs offers an ideal opportunity to begin describing such a path .
