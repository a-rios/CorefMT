The World after Bush 
LONDON - There is a marvelous painting by Brueghel in the Brussels art gallery . 
The British poet , W.H. Auden , was sufficiently impressed to write a poem about it . 
The painting shows Icarus , his wings melted , plunging to a watery grave . 
No one seems very interested . 
The world goes on , the peasants continue plowing their fields , getting on with their lives . 
They show no interest in the dramatic fall of Icarus . 
Real life often seems simply to tick on like that , regardless of headline news and momentous events . 
So President George W. Bush will go back to Crawford , Texas at the end of the year . 
Will anyone notice ? 
Does anyone care anymore ? 
His wings scorched from Iraq to Guant√°namo , Bush already seems to be yesterday &apos;s story ; his minders carefully steer audiences into the front rows at public events , lest the absence of interest in what he is doing and saying becomes too obvious . 
The reason we should take more notice of his departure is not what his absence will make possible , but what will remain absolutely the same . 
Consider four examples . 
First , we will still have to find better ways of managing the world &apos;s economy , reducing its inequities , and coping with its environmental hazards . 
Most importantly , American and European leadership is required to avoid a lurch into protectionism and the consequent killing off of the Doha trade round . 
At the same time , the West needs to develop together a negotiating position on carbon emissions and climate change that will engage China and India . 
It will have to take account of its historic responsibility for today &apos;s global warming , of size of population , and of present economic strength . 
Second , the Palestine-Israel struggle will continue . 
Moreover , the American presidential campaign has shown that it is not only the absence of a responsible hands-on American policy in the last seven years that has contributed to today &apos;s bloody stand-off . 
Even Senator Barack Obama , who has demonstrated a clear commitment to building a more open-minded , less unilateral relationship with the rest of the world , has said things about Palestine and Israel that would appear to rule out the sort of initiatives required for a peace agreement . 
Indeed , far from criticizing continuing Israeli settlement of the West Bank , Obama has pledged his support - more than some members of the Israeli Cabinet have done - to Jerusalem as an undivided capital of Israel . 
This looks like a green light for all those intransigent supporters of the settlers who have campaigned for the development of East Jerusalem deep into the West Bank , a line of settlements running down to the Dead Sea . 
It is difficult to see how any future American diplomacy based on this approach will attract Palestinian support . 
So the Middle East will continue to dominate diplomatic argument and debate . 
Third , nuclear proliferation will still plague us . 
How do we deal conclusively with North Korea , which probably already possesses a handful of nuclear weapons ? 
How do we manage our relationship with Iran , which may - or may not - wish to develop a military nuclear capability as well as civil nuclear power ? 
These questions , with all the knock-on effects in East and West Asia , must be tackled in the run-up to discussions about the renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2010 . 
The nuclear powers that signed the NPT believe it is solely about preventing proliferation . 
Other countries argue that it is about disarmament , and that the nuclear countries have clearly agreed to work towards giving up their nuclear weapons . 
This fudge has been the foundation for the international approach to proliferation . 
It now seems clear that if we want a non-proliferation treaty with more teeth - for example , tougher monitoring and surveillance - countries with nuclear weapons will have to honor what others believe is their side of an unfair bargain . 
Finally , even after Bush - who became so unpopular in Europe ( not always fairly ) - the European Union will find it hard to become the partner in tackling global problems that America needs and seeks . 
The latest row about the so-called Lisbon Treaty , caused by its rejection in a referendum in Ireland , reminds everyone of Europe &apos;s main problem . 
Europe sometimes seems more concerned about is own institutional arrangements and internal affairs than about its global responsibilities . 
But global poverty , environmental catastrophe , proliferation , Afghanistan and the Middle East are not problems that can be put on hold while Europe talks to itself . 
Moreover , Europe too often gives the impression that its citizens can be taken for granted . 
If what Europe &apos;s leaders decide among themselves is criticized or rejected by those who elect them , it just shows - the elite seems to suggest - how correct it was to ignore them in the first place . 
But Europe cannot be built on this democratic deficit . 
The EU must increase the involvement of its own voters in endorsing and supporting the decisions taken in Brussels . 
This lesson needs to be learned fast . 
So , Bush and Cheney will go . 
But a lot of the same old problems will be around . 
Welcome to the real world .
