Europe &apos;s Ukrainian Blunder 
BERLIN - The European Union has probably never experienced anything like it before : Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s government pretended to negotiate an association agreement , only to back out at the last minute . 
EU leaders felt duped ; in Moscow , however , the mood was celebratory . 
As we now know , Yanukovych &apos;s real motivation for the negotiations was to raise the price that Russia would have to pay to keep Ukraine in its strategic orbit . 
Only a few days later , Yanukovych and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a Russian loan worth $ 15 billion , a cut in natural-gas prices , and various trade agreements . 
From Yanukovych &apos;s point of view , this agreement made sense in the short run : the gas deal would help Ukraine survive the winter , the loan would help keep it from defaulting on its debt , and the Russian market , on which the economy depends , would remain open . 
In the medium term , however , by rejecting the EU and embracing Russia , Ukraine faces the risk of losing its independence - on which the post-Soviet order in Europe depends . 
In terms of its strategic orientation , Ukraine is a divided country . 
Its eastern and southern regions ( especially Crimea ) want to return to Russia , whereas its western and northern regions insist on moving toward Europe . 
For the foreseeable future , this domestic conflict can be resolved , if at all , only with a lot of violence involved , as the ongoing mass protests in Kyiv suggest . 
But no sensible person can seriously desire such an outcome . 
Ukraine needs a peaceful , democratic solution , and this will be found only within the status quo . 
The EU &apos;s behavior demands explanation . 
Yanukovych had always been the Kremlin &apos;s ally . 
So why did the EU press for an association agreement , without being able to offer Ukraine anything comparable to what Russia offered ? 
The answer can be found in the relationship between Europe and Russia . 
With the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia not only lost its status as a world power ; within Europe , it was forced to withdraw toward a frontier that it had extended westward since Peter the Great - ultimately to the Elbe and Thuringia . 
After Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as President of the Russian Federation , he followed three strategic goals , which he continues to pursue : an end to post-Soviet Russia &apos;s strategic submission to the West ; reestablishment of sovereignty over most of the ex-Soviet republics , or at least enough control over them to stop NATO &apos;s eastward expansion ; and gradual recovery of Russia &apos;s status as a global power . 
These goals were not to be enforced by the Red Army , but by Russia &apos;s economic potential , especially a strategic energy policy supported by vast oil and natural-gas reserves . 
This would require securing control over these resources . 
The ultimate goal would be to regain Russian control over the Ukrainian pipeline network . 
At that point , Ukraine could be coaxed into joining Putin &apos;s &quot; Eurasian Union , &quot; a Russian alternative to the EU aimed at keeping ex-Soviet countries within Russia &apos;s sphere of influence . 
Apart from using the Nord Stream and South Stream pipelines to disconnect Ukraine from Russian energy exports to Europe , the Kremlin successfully blocked European access to the hydrocarbon-rich Caspian Sea and Central Asia . 
Virtually the only way that countries like Azerbaijan , Turkmenistan , and Kazakhstan can export their output to the West is via Russia &apos;s pipeline network . 
The sole exception , the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan ( BTC ) oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey , was pushed through by the United States ; 
Europe has done nothing similar . 
None of this is exactly a secret in Western capitals ; on the contrary , Putin &apos;s ultimate goal - a far-reaching revision of the post-Cold War strategic order in Europe - has become increasingly clear as Russia has moved closer to achieving it . 
But neither the EU nor the US has been willing or able ( so far ) to formulate an effective response . 
The EU &apos;s Ukraine initiative was supposed to be an attempt to provide such an answer . 
Europe played for high stakes , because if Ukraine does lose its independence in one way or another , European security will be at risk - a risk nowhere more keenly felt than in Poland and the Baltic states . 
With Yanukovych &apos;s rejection of the association agreement , the EU has lost its bet . 
Putin cannot be faulted for skillfully pursuing his interpretation of Russian interests . 
The blame for the outcome in Ukraine falls squarely on the EU &apos;s leaders , who represented European interests so badly . 
Grand gestures and paper-thin statements cannot mask Europe &apos;s neglect of its own strategic interests , which will not be helpful in its relations with Russia . 
If Europeans want to change this , they will have to invest in their interests and devise an effective approach to ensure that these investments pay off . 
This is true not only with respect to Ukraine . 
At the end of 2013 , Russian diplomacy can look back on a year of impressive successes : Syria , the interim nuclear agreement with Iran , and now Ukraine &apos;s rejection of Europe . 
Whether Europe &apos;s leaders see the connections and understand the consequences remains a serious question .
