Cross-Border Banking in the Balance 
LONDON - The gravity of the eurozone crisis has finally sunk in . 
The stakes could not be higher . 
Governments and international financial institutions have scrambled to put together a solution within exceedingly tight political and economic constraints . 
Many questions have yet to be answered about the design ; implementation will be at least as challenging . 
Eurozone leaders must now aim to preserve not only the single currency , but also the gains from financial integration in Europe . 
No region of the world has benefited more from cross-border banking , yet these achievements are now at risk - and with them the European bank groups themselves . 
The threat to cross-border banks comes not only from their deteriorating balance sheets in the face of lower sovereign-debt quality and weaker growth prospects , but also from the policy response itself . 
The fact that Europe &apos;s banks need massive amounts of new capital is by now generally accepted . 
Yet , despite valiant attempts by the new European Banking Authority to mandate and coordinate the measures that are needed , a European solution must take account of the network of foreign subsidiaries across Europe . 
Mobilizing support for European banks will be hard ; extending it to subsidiaries will be even harder . 
But , unlike the ill-advised exposure to sovereign debt across Europe , cross-border banking through foreign subsidiaries has been beneficial for investors , and for home and host countries alike - nowhere more so than in emerging Central and Eastern Europe , still the most important export market for the eurozone . 
For core eurozone banks , this has been a region of extraordinary returns , and it is now integral to their operations . 
In emerging Europe , foreign subsidiaries have helped to build financial systems that are less prone to instability , and have helped economies to converge more rapidly with average European income levels . 
When the global crisis erupted in 2008 , there was no regulatory framework to protect the cross-border networks , and large vulnerabilities , in the form of excessive leverage and foreign exchange , were exposed . 
Much has been achieved since then : balance sheets have been strengthened and funding models adjusted . 
Along with institutional reforms at the European level - particularly the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board and the European Banking Authority - regulation and supervision have been reinforced in subsidiaries &quot; host countries . 
Some of this might make finance more costly , but it will also make banking operations less risky . 
On balance , this is a good thing . 
Even so , the threat to financial stability is possibly even graver today than it was in 2008 , as the capacity of Western European governments to backstop banking systems is clearly reaching its limits . 
Allowing foreign banks &quot; subsidiaries to become orphaned amid a worsening crisis in home countries would undermine confidence in emerging Europe &apos;s financial systems , which could trigger asset-price declines and precipitous contractions in credit . 
Ultimately , this would boomerang back on Western European banks , given their deep financial and real linkages with the region . 
In 2008 , such a catastrophic scenario was narrowly avoided , owing to policy intervention , including the coordination effort under the so-called Vienna Initiative ( in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , among others , was involved ) . 
A new pact to secure the achievements of financial integration is now urgently needed . 
Authorities from these banks &quot; home and host countries must sit down together . 
As with the Vienna Initiative , a &quot; Vienna 2.0 &quot; would require commitments by all concerned parties . 
In responding to the higher capital requirements imposed by authorities , and choosing whether to raise more capital or sell off assets , the banks must take into account the important role that their subsidiaries play in many countries . 
For many banks , this happens naturally - their subsidiaries , as important value creators , are critical to their business models . 
For some , however , the subsidiaries are smaller relative to the parents &quot; size - and thus less central to their strategies . 
Home countries must also contribute . 
Within the eurozone , any recapitalization , guarantees , and other funds offered to parent banks should be made available to subsidiaries in equal measure . 
Any restructuring requested in return for capital support should take into account the cross-border nature of the groups and not discriminate against subsidiaries abroad . 
Subsidiaries &quot; host countries , for their part , must reassure parent banks that financial regulation will remain predictable . 
Some of the recent abrupt - and at times overly ambitious - measures to tax the industry or redistribute the burden of foreign-currency loans have undermined capital cushions and set back recovery in credit and growth . 
All of this requires coordination . 
The European Banking Authority has a chance to establish itself . 
It must ensure that national interests do not undermine the integrity of the cross-border bank groups . 
Ultimately , we need a Europe-wide deposit insurance and bank-resolution authority that can take over and restructure failed banks . 
Just as the eurozone has fostered financial development and economic growth among its members , the current crisis now risks inflicting severe collateral damage far beyond its borders . 
Any sustainable solution to the crisis must ensure the integrity of the bank groups and respect the interests of these banks &quot; home and host countries . 
Ultimately , it is cross-border banking that is in the balance .
