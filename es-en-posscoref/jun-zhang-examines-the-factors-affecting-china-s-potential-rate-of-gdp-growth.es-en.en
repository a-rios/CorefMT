China &apos;s Untapped Growth Potential 
SHANGHAI - China &apos;s economic slowdown , from a nearly 10 % annual output gain in 2007 to below 8 % today , has fueled widespread speculation about the economy &apos;s growth potential . 
While it is impossible to predict China &apos;s future growth trajectory , understanding the economy &apos;s underlying trends is the best way to derive a meaningful estimate . 
Whereas short-term demand largely dictates an economy &apos;s real growth rate , its potential growth rate is determined on the supply side . 
Some economists - citing indicators like investment ratios , industrial value-added , and employment - compare China to Japan in the early 1970 &quot; s . 
After more than two decades of sustained rapid growth , Japan &apos;s economy slackened considerably in 1971 , leading to four decades of annual growth rates averaging less than 4 % . 
This correlation is reinforced by the convergence hypothesis - the benchmark theory for estimating an economy &apos;s potential growth rate - which states that a rapidly growing developing economy &apos;s real growth rate will slow when it reaches a certain share of the per capita capital stock and income of an advanced economy . 
According to the economists Barry Eichengreen , Donghyun Park , and Kwanho Shin , that share is about 60 % of America &apos;s per capita income ( at 2005 international prices ) . 
At first glance , the experiences of Asia &apos;s most advanced economies - Japan and the four &quot; Asian Tigers &quot; ( Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan ) - seem to be consistent with this theory . 
In 1971-1973 , Japan &apos;s per capita GDP fell to roughly 65 % of that of the United States in purchasing-power-parity terms , while the Asian Tigers experienced economic downturns of varying degrees when they reached roughly the same income level relative to Japan . 
But Eichengreen , Park , and Shin also found that once this income level is reached , annual growth rates tend to fall by no more than two percentage points . 
This means that GDP growth should have slowed gradually in Japan after 1971 , instead of plummeting by more than 50 % . 
Likewise , given the remaining income gap with the US , the Asian Tigers should have grown faster than they have in the last two decades . 
But they each suffered a substantial slowdown ( albeit less sharp than Japan &apos;s ) . 
These inconsistencies can be explained by external shocks - a point emphasized by Hideo Kobayashi in his book Post-War Japanese Economy and Southeast Asia . 
During Japan &apos;s economic boom , its total factor productivity ( TFP , or the efficiency with which inputs are used ) contributed about 40 % to GDP growth . 
When growth plummeted , TFP fell even faster - a dramatic change that was clearly linked to the 1971 yen appreciation and the 1973 oil crisis . 
From a microeconomic perspective , a sudden exchange-rate shock and sharp increase in oil prices impedes firms &quot; ability to adjust their technology and production methods to meet new cost conditions , eventually undermining TFP growth . 
Such a cost shock has a more prolonged effect than a negative demand shock . 
Without negative external shocks , exorbitant TFP growth would have declined gradually , as the returns from institutional adjustment , reallocation of resources , and technological catch-up naturally diminished , in accordance with the convergence hypothesis . 
External shocks also explain China &apos;s GDP slowdown since 2007 . 
The renminbi &apos;s gradual yet sustained appreciation against the US dollar is the cost shock &apos;s main driver , but the demand shock that followed the 2008 global financial crisis aggravated the situation . 
It is likely that TFP has declined substantially as China &apos;s economy has slowed in response to these shocks . 
Unlike Keynesians , who focus on demand shocks , followers of the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter view cost shocks as important potential catalysts for structural reform and industrial upgrading - both of which are needed to avoid falling into a low-growth rut in the long term . 
In the short term , a cost shock devastates some economic activities , forcing companies either to shut down or move on to another line of business . 
But what Schumpeter called &quot; creative destruction &quot; can facilitate the eventual emergence and expansion of new , more efficient firms . 
The problem is that many country-specific factors , such as political concerns and pressure from vested interests , can impede this process . 
In this sense , China &apos;s government is facing an important test . 
If it fails to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the cost shock and economic slowdown to implement the necessary structural reforms , China &apos;s potential growth rate , as dictated by TFP , will never rebound fully . 
Given that improving overall productivity is the best way to defend against cost shocks , the new round of structural reform should be aimed at creating conditions for economic transformation and upgrading . 
The key is to establish a level playing field guided by market rules , reduce government intervention in the economy , and stop protecting inefficient businesses . 
Such efforts would go a long way toward increasing China &apos;s potential growth rate . 
Indeed , considering that China &apos;s per capita income amounts to only about 10-20 % of that of the US , with massive regional differentials within China , its growth potential , as dictated by the convergence hypothesis , is far from tapped . 
But the degree to which it can fulfill this potential in the coming decades will depend largely on its TFP prospects . 
In 2007 , the economists Dwight Perkins and Thomas Rawski estimated that , in order for China &apos;s economy to maintain a 9 % growth rate and a 25-35 % investment ratio until 2025 , it would need to maintain an annual TFP growth rate of 4.3-4.8 % . 
Given that China &apos;s TFP growth has averaged 4 % for more than 30 years , and is likely to slow in the coming decade , this scenario is improbable . 
Maintaining 6 % annual GDP growth with the same investment ratio would require annual TFP growth of only 2.2-2.7 % . 
With China &apos;s productivity still well below that of developed countries , and allocational efficiency likely to improve in the next ten years as labor and capital are redistributed across the country , 3 % TFP growth is feasible . 
Aided by structural reforms , China &apos;s economy could expand even faster , achieving 7-8 % annual growth over the next ten years . 
Either way , convergence will remain swift .
