Fragile and Unbalanced in 2012 
NEW YORK - The outlook for the global economy in 2012 is clear , but it isn &apos;t pretty : recession in Europe , anemic growth at best in the United States , and a sharp slowdown in China and in most emerging-market economies . 
Asian economies are exposed to China . 
Latin America is exposed to lower commodity prices ( as both China and the advanced economies slow ) . 
Central and Eastern Europe are exposed to the eurozone . 
And turmoil in the Middle East is causing serious economic risks - both there and elsewhere - as geopolitical risk remains high and thus high oil prices will constrain global growth . 
At this point , a eurozone recession is certain . 
While its depth and length cannot be predicted , a continued credit crunch , sovereign-debt problems , lack of competitiveness , and fiscal austerity imply a serious downturn . 
The US - growing at a snail &apos;s pace since 2010 - faces considerable downside risks from the eurozone crisis . 
It must also contend with significant fiscal drag , ongoing deleveraging in the household sector ( amid weak job creation , stagnant incomes , and persistent downward pressure on real estate and financial wealth ) , rising inequality , and political gridlock . 
Elsewhere among the major advanced economies , the United Kingdom is double dipping , as front-loaded fiscal consolidation and eurozone exposure undermine growth . 
In Japan , the post-earthquake recovery will fizzle out as weak governments fail to implement structural reforms . 
Meanwhile , flaws in China &apos;s growth model are becoming obvious . 
Falling property prices are starting a chain reaction that will have a negative effect on developers , investment , and government revenue . 
The construction boom is starting to stall , just as net exports have become a drag on growth , owing to weakening US and especially eurozone demand . 
Having sought to cool the property market by reining in runaway prices , Chinese leaders will be hard put to restart growth . 
They are not alone . 
On the policy side , the US , Europe , and Japan , too , have been postponing the serious economic , fiscal , and financial reforms that are needed to restore sustainable and balanced growth . 
Private- and public-sector deleveraging in the advanced economies has barely begun , with balance sheets of households , banks and financial institutions , and local and central governments still strained . 
Only the high-grade corporate sector has improved . 
But , with so many persistent tail risks and global uncertainties weighing on final demand , and with excess capacity remaining high , owing to past over-investment in real estate in many countries and China &apos;s surge in manufacturing investment in recent years , these companies &quot; capital spending and hiring have remained muted . 
Rising inequality - owing partly to job-slashing corporate restructuring - is reducing aggregate demand further , because households , poorer individuals , and labor-income earners have a higher marginal propensity to spend than corporations , richer households , and capital-income earners . 
Moreover , as inequality fuels popular protest around the world , social and political instability could pose an additional risk to economic performance . 
At the same time , key current-account imbalances - between the US and China ( and other emerging-market economies ) , and within the eurozone between the core and the periphery - remain large . 
Orderly adjustment requires lower domestic demand in over-spending countries with large current-account deficits and lower trade surpluses in over-saving countries via nominal and real currency appreciation . 
To maintain growth , over-spending countries need nominal and real depreciation to improve trade balances , while surplus countries need to boost domestic demand , especially consumption . 
But this adjustment of relative prices via currency movements is stalled , because surplus countries are resisting exchange-rate appreciation in favor of imposing recessionary deflation on deficit countries . 
The ensuing currency battles are being fought on several fronts : foreign-exchange intervention , quantitative easing , and capital controls on inflows . 
And , with global growth weakening further in 2012 , those battles could escalate into trade wars . 
Finally , policymakers are running out of options . 
Currency devaluation is a zero-sum game , because not all countries can depreciate and improve net exports at the same time . 
Monetary policy will be eased as inflation becomes a non-issue in advanced economies ( and a lesser issue in emerging markets ) . 
But monetary policy is increasingly ineffective in advanced economies , where the problems stem from insolvency - and thus creditworthiness - rather than liquidity . 
Meanwhile , fiscal policy is constrained by the rise of deficits and debts , bond vigilantes , and new fiscal rules in Europe . 
Backstopping and bailing out financial institutions is politically unpopular , while near-insolvent governments don &apos;t have the money to do so . 
And , politically , the promise of the G-20 has given way to the reality of the G-0 : weak governments find it increasingly difficult to implement international policy coordination , as the worldviews , goals , and interests of advanced economies and emerging markets come into conflict . 
As a result , dealing with stock imbalances - the large debts of households , financial institutions , and governments - by papering over solvency problems with financing and liquidity may eventually give way to painful and possibly disorderly restructurings . 
Likewise , addressing weak competitiveness and current-account imbalances requires currency adjustments that may eventually lead some members to exit the eurozone . 
Restoring robust growth is difficult enough without the ever-present specter of deleveraging and a severe shortage of policy ammunition . 
But that is the challenge that a fragile and unbalanced global economy faces in 2012 . 
To paraphrase Bette Davis in All About Eve , &quot; Fasten your seatbelts , it &apos;s going to be a bumpy year ! &quot;
