Keep Financial Regulation Out of US-EU Trade Talks 
ANN ARBOR - The United States and the European Union have embarked on a new round of trade talks , which holds out the promise of deepening the two sides &quot; already robust economic relationship . 
But the talks should not be used to weaken US financial reforms that are just taking root . 
The EU &apos;s Commissioner for Internal Market and Services , Michel Barnier , has been barnstorming the US , looking for support to include financial services as part of the talks on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership . 
Meanwhile , the financial industry is pushing the talks as a way to overturn the pesky - and highly effective - rules being implemented in the US under the Dodd-Frank Act . 
Tough new rules on derivatives , capital requirements , financial structure , consumer and investor protections , and the like could be jeopardized in the trade talks , with the US Congress able to hold only an up-or-down vote on a final agreement , which would encompass a broad range of topics . 
And other commentators view the talks as another forum for cooperation , hoping that trade negotiations will improve coordination among financial regulators . 
The US would be wise to reject that view . 
Now is not the time to place America &apos;s hard-fought financial reforms at risk . 
Shadow banking is coming into the light ; new derivatives regulation is entering into force ; capital requirements are going to be higher ; structural reforms and resolution authority are reducing subsidies ; and investors and consumers are better protected . 
The financial industry battled against this new legislation . 
It lobbied regulatory agencies and Congress to delay or weaken reforms after they were enacted ; urged Congress to block key nominees and withhold essential funding ; and launched aggressive lawsuits to stymie implementation of important rules . 
The last thing that the US ( and the EU ) needs is to enable the financial industry to have another bite at the apple . 
And that is exactly what trade talks - and subsequent Congressional votes - would do . 
To be sure , there have been sharp disagreements between the US and Europe over elements of reform . 
Until this month , the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission had been at odds with Barnier over the territorial scope of US derivatives rules . 
Likewise , the Federal Reserve &apos;s proposed capital and holding-company requirements for foreign firms operating in the US - while better than national treatment and , in my judgment , prudent - deeply angered the European Commission . 
And the US has been concerned about providing for national treatment in European rules governing derivatives , as well as rules regarding hedge fund managers . 
Yet there are plenty of other fora in which to resolve disagreements between US and European regulators , including the bilateral process that resulted in the recent agreement between the US and Europe on a framework for derivatives regulation . 
The G-20 has been driving financial reforms at a global level ; the Financial Stability Board pursues agreement among regulators ; and technical teams at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the International Organization of Securities Commissions , and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors hash out industry-relevant reforms . 
The last thing we need is another process , particularly one not focused on how to prevent another financial meltdown like the one from which the US and Europe are still trying to recover . 
Trade talks would merely serve as a one-way ratchet to pull back from reforms , not advance them . 
Globally , there is certainly much work still to be done . 
On bank resolution , the US has a solid framework in place , but is still working through how to make winding down a major financial firm plausible ; in Europe , there is agreement on the need for resolution authority , but a lot more to do to make this authority work within the context of EU member states &quot; legal and political frameworks . 
On derivatives , there is now general agreement on how to approach trading , clearing , and transparency , but much more work to do on capital requirements , margin requirements , clearinghouse supervision , and other issues . 
Capital and liquidity rules are taking shape , but a final agreement is still on the horizon , rather than close at hand . 
I am all for a stronger , harder push to reach global agreement on core reforms . 
In fact , such an agreement is essential in order to reduce the chances of another devastating global financial crisis . 
But there is no reason to seek to accomplish this through trade talks that would likely weaken , not strengthen , the forces of reform .
