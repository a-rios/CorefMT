The New Bogeymen of Financial Capitalism 
The sub-prime crisis has diverted attention from rising fears about Sovereign Wealth Funds ( SWF &apos;s ) as the new bogeyman of global finance . 
But the minute the sub-prime crisis subsides , anxieties about SWF &apos;s will return . 
Indeed , if SWF &apos;s continue to grow their investments are bound to permanently alter the relative weight of state and privately controlled assets in advanced economies . 
According to Morgan Stanley , SWF &apos;s are expected to manage $ 12 trillion by 2015 , up from about $ 2.5 trillion today . 
Both sums dwarf the sums controlled by hedge funds and private equity groups . 
Thus some of the biggest investors - both passive and strategic - in financial markets in the coming years will be government institutions . 
That the biggest of these institutions are in China , Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia and some unstable petro-states adds another worry to the mix . 
The growth of SWF &apos;s is a direct consequence of the accumulation of more than $ 5 trillion in foreign reserves by emerging-market economies in Asia and among oil and commodity exporting countries . 
These economies &quot; current-account surpluses , together with massive inflows of capital , have led their monetary authorities to try to prevent their national currencies from appreciating in order to maintain the competitiveness of their industries . 
Initially , these countries invested their foreign reserves in liquid assets - short-term United States Treasury bills and government securities issued by other reserve currency countries . 
Then they realized that their holdings in liquid and low-return assets far exceed what is needed to avoid the type of speculative runs that East Asia experienced in 1997 , and Russia in 1998 . 
After all , why hold US T-bills with a meager 5 % return , German Bunds with a 4 % return , or Japanese government bonds with a 0.5 % return when you can acquire foreign firms , invest in real assets , stock markets , or higher-yielding corporate bonds ? 
The answer seemed a no-brainer . 
So central banks are transferring their excess reserves to existing or newly created SWF &apos;s , which in turn invest in high-return equities . 
But the emergence of SWF &apos;s is creating a political backlash in the form of &quot; financial protectionism . &quot; 
Examples include the China National Overseas Oil Company &apos;s failed effort to buy the US energy firm UNOCAL , and Dubai Ports &quot; failed bid to buy a firm managing major US ports . 
There is now legislation pending in the US Congress aimed at tightening the approval process for foreign acquisition of US firms , and a similar reaction is occurring in Asia and Europe . 
Of course , not all SWF &apos;s favor strategic investments , i.e. taking controlling stakes in the acquired firms . 
Some , like Singapore &apos;s Government Investment Corporation , prefer passive and diversified investments with no controlling stake in companies . 
And China , when it took a 10 % stake in the US private equity group Blackstone , eschewed any voting rights in the company &apos;s management , perhaps as a way of keeping US financial regulators happy . 
A third type of SWF takes the form of oil investment funds among oil / energy exporting countries , which are saving their windfalls into foreign assets . 
Norway , indeed , has been doing this - very quietly - for many years 
Views about how to respond to the SWF &apos;s vary . 
The United Kingdom has adopted a laissez faire approach , while political concerns dominate in the US , France and Germany . 
Some worry about reciprocity : if Chinese firms are allowed to invest in US and EU firms , shouldn &apos;t US and EU firms be allowed to invest freely in any Chinese firm ? 
Others worry about national security : what would happen if &quot; our &quot; ports and security industries or other &quot; strategic &quot; firms were taken over by China , Russia , or Saudi Arabia ? 
Still others worry about the fact that SWF &apos;s are state-owned : what would happen to corporate governance when investors may have objectives other than maximizing risk-adjusted returns ? 
Similarly , there are concerns about transparency : many SWF &apos;s do not reveal their investment strategies and how they operate . 
What would happen if a small group of huge state-owned SWF &apos;s made very large investments in a variety of assets ? 
How might equity prices or bond yields be distorted by $ 200 billion gorillas that need to invest $ 4 billion per week ? 
Dire predictions that the rise of the SWF &apos;s means that the global financial system is becoming a form of state capitalism may be exaggerated . 
But a small group of government players managing a vast amount of foreign assets does create complications . 
Of course , so long as the US runs annual current-account deficits of almost a trillion dollars , it will need to borrow from strategic rivals such as China , Russia , and unstable Middle East petro-states , which increasingly will lend in the form of high-yield equity investments rather than low-yield T-bills . 
So unless the US starts to save more , it will find it hard to complain about the form - equity rather than debt - that the financing of its external deficit takes . 
It is also true that the massive accumulation of foreign reserves that is now feeding the SWFs &quot; growth is excessive and driven by misguided exchange-rate policies , with vastly undervalued currencies resulting in current-account surpluses . 
These countries need to allow greater exchange-rate flexibility and currency appreciation to reduce their external surpluses - and thus the need to accumulate huge foreign reserves in the first place . 
Indeed , emerging-market economies should reduce their accumulation of foreign assets rather than hope to weather the political backlash against SWF &apos;s in the US and EU . 
SWF &apos;s are , it seems , here to stay and grow , and they do offer significant benefits . 
But if they grow too large while their activities remain opaque , widespread &quot; financial protectionism &quot; will become all but inevitable .
