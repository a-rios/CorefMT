Central Banking &apos;s New Club Class 
NEW YORK - In the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis , the world &apos;s central banks played a critical role in rescuing the global financial system . 
They stepped in when private markets froze , acting as lenders and dealers of last resort , and provided additional liquidity to grease the wheels of finance . 
These central banks offered their services primarily to domestic actors , but they also extended their largess to foreign private entities . 
Indeed , even foreign states benefited after central banks entered into swap agreements , giving one another unlimited access to their respective currencies . 
This has created a worrying precedent . 
Originally created as a temporary fix in 2007 , the swap lines established at that time connecting the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Swiss National Bank have been extended each time a new crisis has unsettled the markets . 
More recently , however , six central banks announced that they had made their swap lines permanent . 
But did these central banks have the legal authority to do so ? 
And , even if they did , should they have used it ? 
The original swap lines might fairly be classified as emergency measures . 
But what may be permissible and justifiable in a financial emergency may not be appropriate as standard practice during normal times . 
Central bankers might argue that we have entered a state of permanent market crisis analogous to the never-ending &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
But even this frightening analogy does not answer the question of whether central banks should assume positions of power in international relations . 
Of course , a central bank &apos;s mandate is price stability in the national economy that it serves , and price stability is influenced by exchange rates . 
So a case can be made that central banks should have the power to intervene in foreign-exchange markets , and that this power should - at least in times of crisis - include commitments to foreign central banks to provide unlimited liquidity in the domestic currency . 
What is less clear , though , is whether the same justification can be used by central banks to create permanent swap lines with just a few other central banks of their choosing . 
This is akin to an announcement on a cruise ship approaching an iceberg that the crew will definitely rescue first-class passengers but not necessarily others . 
Not every country &apos;s central bank - not even every &quot; friendly &quot; country &apos;s central bank - has been invited to join the swap-lines club . 
Membership is restricted to the United States Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan , the Swiss National Bank , and the Bank of Canada . 
There may be a legal rationale for this neo-imperial elitism . 
The so-called C-6 might argue that , given their price-stability mandate , only central banks of countries whose economic fate might destabilize domestic prices should receive privileged access to domestic currency . 
But the choice of monetary partners is nonetheless a matter of judgment . 
For example , why Canada and not Mexico ? 
Aren &apos;t both members of NAFTA ? 
Why Switzerland and not Brazil , one of the largest emerging markets ? 
Picking partners is an inherently political act . 
It bestows access to high-demand currencies on a select few , relatively strong , countries precisely when the weakest countries are at their most vulnerable . 
Having been left outside the club , these countries have no option but to self-insure by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves . 
Indeed , empirical research suggests that countries without explicit or implicit access to liquidity tend to hold much higher reserves than the privileged few - only to be blamed by the same privileged few for contributing to global imbalances by hoarding excess reserves . 
The C-6 swap club &apos;s members may be correct in thinking that global finance requires more proactive central banking . 
But is it fair or right that they should be allowed to take matters into their own hands and determine a system of international monetary management designed to serve their own interests , with little regard for other , equally exposed , countries ? 
The joint announcement by the C-6 cements the great divide between first-class and coach economies . 
We are being asked to trust that these select central banks will do the right thing . 
Trust is important . 
But when it comes to political decision-making , democratic control and accountability are essential .
