The Case for Slowing Population Growth 
Global debates about population policy are confusing . 
One side argues that rising human populations threaten our environment and prosperity . 
Land , water , energy , and biodiversity all seem to be under greater stress than ever , and population growth appears to be a major source of that stress . 
The other side of the debate , mainly in rich countries , argues that households are now having so few children that there won &apos;t be enough to care for aging parents . 
Those who fret about population growth have the better argument . 
Issues confronting Europe , Japan , and to a lesser extent the United States and some middle-income countries concerning aging populations are manageable . 
Moreover , the benefits of slower population growth outweigh the adjustment costs . 
By contrast , if global populations continue to rise rapidly , the stresses on the world &apos;s resources will worsen . 
Governments should therefore refrain from deliberate policies to raise birthrates , even in places where birth rates are low . 
Part of the confusion of the public debate reflects different population trends in different parts of the world . 
The fastest population growth is taking place in the poorest regions . 
Poor people , especially poor people living on farms , tend to have the most children ( often six or more per woman ) , and therefore the highest rates of population growth . 
Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and for security when parents reach old age . 
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning . 
Finally , poor families have many children as a kind of insurance policy against high child mortality rates . 
As a result of high fertility rates in Africa , the UN Population Division predicts a doubling of Africa &apos;s population from around 900 million today to around 1.8 billion in 2050 . 
Rapidly growing populations are also young populations , because of the high number of children per household . 
In Africa , the median age is now a mere 19 years and is projected to rise to around 28 years in 2050 . 
In Europe , the trends run in the other direction . 
The UN projects a decline in population to around 630 million in 2050 , from around 725 million people today . 
With few children and longer life expectancy , the median age of the population rises sharply in this forecast , from 39 years in 2005 to around 48 years in 2050 . 
For the world as a whole , population is expected to continue to grow by another 2.5 billion people from 2005 to 2050 . 
All of that growth will be in the developing world : 1.3 billion more people in Asia , 900 million more in Africa , the rest in Latin America and other regions . 
Adding another 2.5 billion people to the planet will put enormous strains not only on societies with rising populations , but on the entire planet . 
Total energy use is soaring , reflecting the combined effect of rising per capita incomes - and thus rising per capita energy use - and population growth . 
Higher energy use is already changing the world &apos;s climate in dangerous ways . 
Furthermore , the strains of increased global populations , combined with income growth , are leading to rapid deforestation , depletion of fisheries , land degradation , and the loss of habitat and extinction of a vast number of animal and plant species . 
Population growth in developing regions - especially Africa , India , and other parts of Asia - needs to slow . 
Public policies can play an important role by extending access to family planning services to the poor , expanding social security systems , reducing child mortality through public health investments , and improving education and job opportunities for women . 
A part of the European public , looking at Europe &apos;s looming population decline , wants to head in the other direction , promoting a return to larger families . 
That would be a big mistake . 
Advocates of faster European population growth worry that there won &apos;t be enough young workers to pay for public pensions . 
But this concern can be met through increased saving by today &apos;s young and middle-aged as they prepare for retirement , and by working past the age of 65 . 
These workers will reap large benefits from living in societies with stable or gradually declining populations . 
Most obviously , they will spend much less in direct household expenditures to raise children . 
They will also save on investments in new roads , power plants , schools , and other public services . 
They will enjoy less congested cities and fewer environmental pressures on the countryside . 
European economies will face lower costs in limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from energy use , leading to more effective control of climate change . 
The quality of life , in short , will tend to improve as Europe &apos;s population declines in coming decades . 
There is nothing radical in calling for slower population growth . 
For tens of thousands of years , the human population tended to rise and fall without a substantial long-term trend . 
Only in the past two centuries , with the rise of modern economic life , did the world &apos;s population soar , from around one billion people in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and around 9 billion by 2050 . 
This explosive growth was made possible by huge advances in science and technology . 
But this unprecedented growth has also put tremendous pressures on the planet . 
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth through voluntary means , and we should recognize that leveling off of the Earth &apos;s population now would add to human happiness and strengthen environmental sustainability later .
