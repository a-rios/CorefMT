The American Mirror 
What will the next year bring for the world economy ? 
What will happen to production in the developing world , and in the rich industrial core ? 
Indeed , do we even still dare to maintain that distinction anymore ? 
After all , most rich countries have entered a post-industrial age , while developing countries now have - or soon will - as great a share of their population working in &quot; industry &quot; as the world &apos;s rich nations . 
In the United States , the fears of nine months ago that America &apos;s economy might succumb to deflation have been dispelled . 
What remains is a sense of tremendous opportunity wasted . 
Ever since George W. Bush took office , America &apos;s annual real GDP growth has averaged 2.3 % - a pace that would have been acclaimed as normal and satisfactory when George W. Bush &apos;s father or Ronald Reagan was president , but that after the Clinton boom now seems tawdry and sluggish . 
Indeed , it is clear that the American economy could have grown much faster than it has . 
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a drop in the employment / population ratio from 64.4 % in 2000 to 62.3 % today , together with a decline in non-farm payroll employment in this period from 131.8 million to 130.2 million . 
Underlying the business cycle , the rapid progress of the information-technology revolution is pushing American productivity growth ahead as fast as - or faster than - ever . 
Had the Federal Reserve been more aggressive in pushing interest rates down , or had Bush and Congress passed tax cuts aimed at boosting short-term demand and employment , the US economy would have grown at a pace not seen in a generation and a half . 
Will America &apos;s economy grasp its opportunity to grow rapidly over the next year ? 
Probably . 
Unless stagnant employment causes a sudden cutback in household consumption , tax rebates and low interest rates should push the US economy ahead at a 4 % growth rate over the next year . 
This may or may not be enough to produce lots of payroll jobs and significantly cut the unemployment rate , but it will be enough growth for the US to continue to be the fastest growing component of the world economy &apos;s post-industrial core . 
Real GDP growth in Japan and western Europe is unlikely to reach even half the pace seen in the US . 
However , the absence of rapid growth in western Europe and Japan is not a great handicap for developing countries , because Europe and Japan were never all that open to imports from developing countries to begin with . 
Solid demand growth in the US will provide increased demand for developing-country exports - albeit not at the prices that prevailed when the dollar was stronger . 
More importantly , the developing world has little to fear from sudden panic on Wall Street . 
American domestic interest rates are so low and the fear of a large further decline in the dollar so great that it is nearly impossible to envision a sudden withdrawal of capital from developing countries to the post-industrial core . 
So 2004 is unlikely to see a repeat of the capital flight that hit Mexico in 1995 or East Asia in 1997-98 . 
If hysteria hits world capital markets , the excitement is much more likely to come in the form of capital flight from the US . 
More important than short-run cycles , however , are long-run trends . 
Annual Labor productivity growth in the US has acclerated steadily in the past 30 years , from 1.2 % in the period from the mid-1970 &quot; s to the mid-1990 &quot; s , to 2.3 % in the late 1990 &quot; s , and to 4.2 % since 2000 . 
How much of the second jump in productivity growth will be sustained is uncertain , but it is safe to bet that some of it will . 
The more intriguing question is this : when will the rapid IT-driven productivity growth seen in the US spread to the rest of the rich countries ? 
We do not know , but we do know that it will . 
Similarly , we do not know when world trade in information services like form processing , accounting , and customer service will truly boom as a result of the Internet and the fiber-optic cable . 
The lesson is that governments , firms , investors , workers , and parents worldwide should begin betting on the long-run trends that have become visible over the past decade . 
Such bets probably won &apos;t pay off in the next year , or two , or three . 
Karl Marx was not wholly wrong when he wrote that the most industrialized countries are mirrors in which the rest of the world can see its own future . 
The mirror that is the US shows that the returns from taking advantage of the economic changes made possible by the IT revolution are very high . 
The hard question for other countries is how to do this .
