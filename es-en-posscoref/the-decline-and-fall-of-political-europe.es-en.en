The Decline and Fall of Political Europe 
PARIS - A series of decisions taken over the last few years in Europe have alarmed me . 
The first imposed the rule of unanimity within the European Union for any decision regarding foreign policy or the use of armed force for other than humanitarian purposes . 
Because everyone must agree , nothing is agreed . 
As a result , Europe cannot develop a common foreign policy . 
The second alarming decision limited the Union &apos;s budget to a mere 1 % of EU GDP , thus preventing any new common policy initiative for much of the past decade . 
The third decision concerns the British vetoes of the candidacies of Jean Luc Dehaene and Jean Claude Juncker for President of the European Commission . 
When this last British &quot; no &quot; came down , I sadly declared the death of the political Europe , a charge that brought me harsh criticism , even from friends . 
These decisions have become more alarming over time as the need for &quot; more Europe &quot; has become progressively more obvious . 
Only a united and strong Europe can tackle the global fight against climate change , encourage the adoption of new financial rules in order to avoid the excesses that led to the crisis of 2008-2009 , and handle a rising China that will soon account for 20 % of world trade . 
The great banking , financial , and economic crises , which every country in the world still confronts , has made things worse . 
Ireland , by far the biggest beneficiary of EU membership has demonstrated a powerful anti-European reflex , despite being hit early and hard by the crisis . 
Meanwhile , Germany , long the proud holder of the European torch , has increasingly turned its back on that legacy , particularly after the markets reminded Germans that their country was much more Europeanized than they seemed to believe or realize . 
Germany rallied to Europe when the crisis was at its global nadir last year . 
The timing of this is particularly odd , as this new insularity comes almost immediately after Germany , France , and Great Britain cynically agreed to endow the EU with both a president of the EU Council and a foreign affairs minister . 
Of course , there is still the euro , Europe &apos;s only great political success over the last two decades . 
Everyone admires Germany &apos;s rigorous management and capacity to reform . 
But the crisis has changed everything . 
It impaired a number of European countries less robust than Germany . 
The three Baltic states , Hungary , and non-EU Iceland are bankrupt . 
Of course , they don &apos;t belong to the eurozone , but Greece , Spain , Portugal , and Ireland do , and their problems are nearly as desperate . 
Yet Germany insists on imposing its own rigor on the eurozone as a whole , a strategy the above-mentioned states can pursue only at the risk of social chaos . 
These countries may exit the crisis - their crisis - only if monetary policy allows them room to grow . 
But Germany refuses this option , thus seriously endangering Europe &apos;s common currency . 
And , thanks to Germany , the interest rates that Greece will pay for loan packages put together by other eurozone countries will be very high , which means that its economy will be unable to recover for some time , and that its financial drama will weigh heavily on the euro &apos;s collective destiny . 
Moreover , German Chancellor Angela Merkel took the liberty of pondering whether imperiled states should be excluded from the eurozone . 
While Merkel seems to believe that all eurozone countries should play by the same rules , she does not seem to realize that today it is Germany that is going it alone in pursuit of its own narrow national interests . 
Why is Merkel acting this way ? 
One reason is that she leads a coalition government that is facing elections , and that finds itself in a very tricky situation with its own parliament . 
If &quot; political Europe &quot; had more power , the Greek crisis would have been dealt with through a brutal conversation at the top . 
Given the state of global finance , the euro &apos;s demise would be a phenomenal catastrophe . 
It can still be avoided , but only if all Europeans remember their solidarity and act with unusual courage and tenacity .
