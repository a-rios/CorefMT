Virtual Vices 
In a popular Internet role-playing game called Second Life , people can create a virtual identity for themselves , choosing such things as their age , sex , and appearance . 
These virtual characters then do things that people in the real world do , such as having sex . 
Depending on your preferences , you can have sex with someone who is older or younger than you - perhaps much older or younger . 
In fact , if your virtual character is an adult , you can have sex with a virtual character who is a child . 
If you did that in the real world , most of us would agree that you did something seriously wrong . 
But is it seriously wrong to have virtual sex with a virtual child ? 
Some Second Life players say that it is , and have vowed to expose those who do it . 
Meanwhile , the manufacturers , Linden Labs , have said they will modify the game to prevent virtual children from having sex . 
German prosecutors have also become involved , although their concern appears to be the use of the game to spread child pornography , rather than whether people have virtual sex with virtual children . 
Laws against child pornography in other countries may also have the effect of prohibiting games that permit virtual sex with virtual children . 
In Australia , Connor O &apos;Brien , chair of the criminal law section of the Law Institute of Victoria , recently told the Melbourne newspaper The Age that he thought the manufacturer of Second Life could be prosecuted for publishing images of children in a sexual context . 
The law is on solid ground when it protects children from being exploited for sexual purposes . 
It becomes much more dubious when it interferes with sexual acts between consenting adults . 
What adults choose to do in the bedroom , many thoughtful people believe , is their own business , and the state ought not to pry into it . 
If you get aroused by having your adult partner dress up as a schoolchild before you have sex , and he or she is happy to enter into that fantasy , your behavior may be abhorrent to most people , but as long as it is done in private , few would think that it makes you a criminal . 
Nor should it make any difference if you invite a few adult friends over , and in the privacy of your own home they all choose to take part in a larger-scale sexual fantasy of the same kind . 
Are computers linked via the Internet - again , assuming that only consenting adults are involved - so different from a group fantasy of this kind ? 
When someone proposes making something a criminal offense , we should always ask : who is harmed ? 
If it can be shown that the opportunity to act out a fantasy by having virtual sex with a virtual child makes people more likely to engage in real pedophilia , then real children will be harmed , and the case for prohibiting virtual pedophilia becomes stronger . 
But looking at the question in this way raises another , and perhaps more significant , issue about virtual activities : video game violence . 
Those who play violent video games are often at an impressionable age . 
Doom , a popular violent videogame , was a favorite of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold , the teenage Columbine High School murderers . 
In a chilling videotape they made before the massacre , Harris says &quot; It &apos;s going to be like fucking Doom .... That fucking shotgun &#91; he kisses his gun &#93; is straight out of Doom ! &quot; 
There are other cases in which aficionados of violent videogames have become killers , but they do not prove cause and effect . 
More weight , however , should be given to the growing number of scientific studies , both in the laboratory and in the field , of the effect of such games . 
In Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adults , Craig Anderson , Douglas Gentile , and Katherine Buckley , of the Department of Psychology at Iowa State University , draw these studies together to argue that violent video games increase aggressive behavior . 
If criminal prosecution is too blunt an instrument to use against violent video games , there is a case for awarding damages to the victims , or families of the victims , of violent crimes committed by people who play violent video games . 
To date , such lawsuits have been dismissed , at least in part on the grounds that the manufacturers could not foresee that their products would cause people to commit crimes . 
But the evidence that Anderson , Gentile , and Buckley provide has weakened that defense . 
Andr√© Peschke , editor-in-chief of Krawall.de , one of Germany &apos;s leading online computer and video game magazines , informs me that in ten years in the video game industry , he has never seen any serious debate within the industry on the ethics of producing violent games . 
The manufacturers fall back on the simplistic assertion that there is no scientific proof that violent video games lead to violent acts . 
But sometimes we cannot wait for proof . 
This seems to be one of those cases : the risks are great , and outweigh whatever benefits violent video games may have . 
The evidence may not be conclusive , but it is too strong to be ignored any longer . 
The burst of publicity about virtual pedophilia in Second Life may have focused on the wrong target . 
Video games are properly subject to legal controls , not when they enable people to do things that , if real , would be crimes , but when there is evidence on the basis of which we can reasonably conclude that they are likely to increase serious crime in the real world . 
At present , the evidence for that is stronger for games involving violence than it is for virtual realities that permit pedophilia .
