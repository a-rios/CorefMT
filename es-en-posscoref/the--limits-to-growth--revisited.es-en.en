The \ Since the Cold War &apos;s end , all kinds of barriers have come down , and the world economy has fundamentally changed . 
Until 1989 , the global market encompassed between 800 million and one billion people . 
Today , it is three times larger , and growing . 
Indeed , we are witnessing one of the most dramatic revolutions in modern history , and it is occurring almost unnoticed . 
From a model applicable to the minority of the world &apos;s population , &quot; Western consumer society &quot; is becoming the dominant economic model of the world , one to which there is increasingly no alternative . 
By mid-century , the lives of seven billion people might be governed by its laws . 
The West has established the economic model of the twenty-first century , with its hitherto unheard of standard of living , and almost all nations and regions are trying to equal it , no matter what the cost . 
When , in the 1970 &quot; s , the Club of Rome issued its famous report on the &quot; Limits to Growth , &quot; the reaction was one of concern . 
Over the years , however , as the world economy continued to grow without interruption - and , in the current age of globalization , seemingly without limits - the dire predictions of the Club of Rome have become increasingly an object of ridicule . 
And yet the Club of Rome &apos;s basic insight - that we live and work in a finite global ecosystem , with exhaustible resources and capacities - has returned to challenge us again . 
The world is not preoccupied today by the &quot; limits to growth , &quot; but awareness of the consequences of growth on the earth &apos;s climate and ecosystem is becoming prevalent . 
China , for example , needs annual growth rates of 10 % to keep its huge economic , social , and ecological problems under control . 
There would be nothing sensational about this if China were a country like Luxembourg or Singapore . 
But China has 1.3 billion people . 
So the consequences of its economic growth are much more serious . 
Global demand for energy , raw materials , and food is increasingly influenced by rising demand in China and India , whose combined population is 2.5 billion . 
Other large and populous emerging countries in Asia and South America are following in these giants &quot; footsteps . 
Steadily rising prices of raw materials , agricultural products , and energy already reflect fears about future shortages . 
These undesirable consequences of the expansion of world markets have assumed alarming proportions within a relatively short period of time . 
China is on course , this year or next , to overtake the United States as the world &apos;s largest CO2 emitter , even though its per capita emissions are only one-fifth or even less of the US level . 
What will the world look like when China reduces this difference to one-half ? 
And India is following close behind China in its level of carbon emissions . 
Will the global ecosystem be able to absorb these additional pollutants without considerable changes in the ecosphere ? 
Obviously not , as a large majority of climatologists are now warning . 
These basic data have been known for a long time , and only a few deny that rapidly accelerating man-made climate change is occurring . 
But one might conclude from the bizarre debates we engage in about climate change that what the world needs is a change in its political and psychological mood , rather than a profound social and economic transformation . 
So , despite grand rhetoric , very little is being done . 
Emerging countries continue to grow every year . 
The US has almost totally backed away from the global fight against pollution , and , through uncontrolled growth , solidifies its position as the world &apos;s leading polluter . 
The same pattern holds true for Europe and Japan , albeit on a slightly smaller scale . 
In view of this global challenge , the G-8 countries have made a heroic decision : the eight richest industrial countries - which are also the largest polluters - promised to &quot; seriously examine &quot; cutting their emissions in half by 2050 . 
This rhetorical heroism is enough to leave the world speechless . 
Indeed , it remains to be seen if the European Union will even be able to implement its promise to cut CO2 emissions by 20-30 % by 2020 . 
So far , the EU has not really come up with any practical ways to do this . 
But the solution to the challenge of global climate change is as plain as day . 
The only chance of improvement is to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and emissions . 
This must happen in the emerging countries , and even more urgently in the old industrial economies . 
Such decoupling can occur only if we do away with the illusion that pollution is cost-free . 
We can no longer get away with subsidizing economic growth and standards of living at the expense of the global environment . 
Human population has simply become too large to be able to afford it . 
Doing away with this illusion requires the creation of a global emissions market - still a very distant goal . 
It also requires more energy efficiency , which means a reduction of waste in both energy production and consumption . 
Rising energy prices already point in this direction , but this knowledge has yet to register . 
Finally , it requires a technological and politico-economic breakthrough in favor of renewable energy , rather than a return to nuclear power or coal . 
In essence , then , we are confronted by a three-pronged challenge of a new &quot; green &quot; industrial revolution . 
Coping with this global challenge also offers an enormous opportunity for future prosperity and social justice that we must seize . 
Of course , there will be many powerful losers as we make these changes . 
They are not about to accept their &quot; disempowerment &quot; without a struggle . 
At the moment , they still seem to have the upper hand , as evidenced by much talk and no action . 
This is precisely what needs to change .
