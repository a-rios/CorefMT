Competing on Corporate Tax 
BERKELEY - Corporate tax reform has emerged as an area of potential bipartisan action in the United States Congress over the next few months . 
There is widespread agreement that the US corporate tax system is deeply flawed . 
Despite the high rate , corporate tax revenues comprise a relatively small share of government revenue , partly because a rising share of total business receipts - currently more than 30 % - flows through so-called &quot; pass-through &quot; business organizations , which are not subject to corporate tax . 
Indeed , most corporate tax revenues are paid by a small number of large multinational companies that earn more than half of their income from their foreign operations . 
These companies compete in global markets with firms headquartered in countries that use business-friendly tax policies to attract the investments , income , and associated externalities of multinational companies . 
The problem for the US is that developed and emerging economies have been slashing their rates , leaving the US - which had one of the developed world &apos;s lowest corporate tax rates after the 1986 tax reform - at a serious disadvantage . 
Most recently , the United Kingdom reduced its rate to 20 % , half of the combined US federal and average state rates . 
And , since 2013 , the UK has applied a special tax rate on income from patents , which will fall gradually to 10 % by 2017 . 
Twelve European Union countries currently have or are implementing similar special tax regimes , or &quot; patent boxes , &quot; for income from intellectual property , which is taxed at rates of 5-15 % . 
The US statutory corporate tax rate , at 39 % in total , is more than 14 percentage points above the OECD average - making it the highest in the developed world . 
These differences affect corporate decisions about how much to invest , how to finance investment , and where to do business . 
The pro-growth rationale for a sizable reduction in the US rate has garnered bipartisan support - a rarity in today &apos;s Congress . 
Obama has proposed a rate of 28 % , with a preferential rate of 25 % for manufacturing , and additional special provisions to promote investment in research and development and clean energy . 
There is also bipartisan agreement that the foregone revenues from a rate reduction should be covered mainly by broadening the tax base - the same approach adopted in the 1986 tax reform . 
Broadening the base would also reduce the tax system &apos;s complexity and enhance its efficiency . 
But there remain deep fissures over which preferences should be eliminated and which activities currently outside the corporate tax base should be brought into it . 
Another area of controversy is how to reform the taxation of American multinationals &apos; foreign earnings . 
Every other G-7 country , and 28 of the other 33 OECD members , have &quot; territorial &quot; tax systems , which allow globally engaged companies to repatriate most of their active foreign earnings without paying a significant additional domestic tax . 
By contrast , the US adheres to a &quot; worldwide &quot; model , which subjects American companies &apos; foreign earnings to US corporate tax , with a credit for taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions . 
America &apos;s high corporate rate and worldwide approach to taxing the foreign earnings of its multinationals undermine their competitiveness in global markets and in cross-border acquisitions . 
Current US law attempts to blunt these competitive disadvantages through deferral , allowing US multinationals to delay tax payments on their foreign subsidiaries &apos; earnings until they are repatriated to the US . 
But deferral has costs . 
Deferred earnings are &quot; locked out &quot; of the US economy , meaning that the government receives no tax revenues from them and they are not directly available for domestic use by the US parent companies . 
And these companies incur a cost of about 7 % of their incremental deferred foreign income as a result of suboptimal use . 
The Obama administration proposes ending deferral , requiring instead that US companies either pay an effective tax of at least 22.4 % on their earnings in every foreign jurisdiction where they operate , or pay an additional tax to the US on this income at the time it is earned . 
A key goal is to moderate the incentives for US multinationals to &quot; shift their profits to tax havens . &quot; 
But most of the earnings subject to the minimum tax would not be the result of profit-shifting to tax havens ; they would be generated by real economic activity to serve foreign markets . 
The affected earnings would include , for example , a significant share of foreign income earned by US multinationals in the EU , which accounted for about 45 % of US multinationals &apos; total foreign income in 2012 . 
Sixteen of the 28 EU countries have statutory tax rates below 22.4 % , and effective tax rates are likely to be even lower . 
Furthermore , while non-US companies can take advantage of the generous patent boxes in 12 EU countries , US companies would be subject to the much higher minimum rate , undermining their ability both to compete in these markets and to acquire foreign companies with desirable intellectual property . 
They would instead become more attractive targets for foreign acquirers and would have even stronger incentives to move their headquarters , R D , and future intellectual property to lower-tax jurisdictions with territorial systems . 
In a world of mobile capital - especially profitable intangible capital with R D externalities - the US should adopt a &quot; hybrid &quot; territorial system that includes base-protection measures consistent with those successfully used by other developed countries . 
And it should promote multilateral measures to combat profit-shifting to tax havens . 
As the US embarks on corporate tax reform , policymakers should bear in mind that other countries are using carrots , not sticks , to compete for the activities and income of global companies .
