Harnessing the Remittance Boom 
ROME - For more than a decade , Asia &apos;s economies have been on the move - and so have its people . 
The scale of migration from rural to urban areas and across international borders is historically unprecedented , and twenty-first-century Asia is its focal point . 
In Asia &apos;s developing countries , the power and potential of remittances - the money that migrant workers send home to their families ( many of whom live in poor and remote areas ) - is immense . 
Currently , over 60 million migrant workers from the Asia / Pacific region account for more than half of all remittance flows to developing countries , sending home about $ 260 billion in 2012 . 
China , India , and the Philippines are the three largest recipients of remittances , while Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan , and Vietnam are also in the top ten . 
The money is often a lifeline : it is estimated that 10 % of Asian families depend on payments from abroad to obtain their food , clothing , and shelter . 
But , while remittances to developing countries are five times higher than official development assistance , the enormous potential returns for society have not been realized - and can be secured only if the flow of money can be channeled into effective rural and agricultural development , particularly in fragile states and post-conflict countries . 
Doing so would contribute significantly to creating jobs , enhancing food security , and fostering stability in countries emerging from strife . 
In order to establish such channels , we must scale up key initiatives , identify new opportunities , and map out the road ahead . 
The fourth Global Forum on Remittances , which runs May 20-23 in Bangkok , will do just that . 
Convened by the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) and the World Bank , the forum will bring together policymakers , private-sector players , and civil-society leaders to chart a course for leveraging the development impact of remittances sent home each year in Asia and around the world . 
At IFAD , our starting point is always the three billion people who live in the rural areas of developing countries . 
We work to create conditions in which poor rural women and men can grow and sell more food , increase their incomes , and determine the direction of their own lives . 
We believe that diasporas and the global donor community can leverage the flow of migrant investment if they form partnerships with national governments for long-term development of the rural communities that are so often the beginning of the migration chain . 
More than 215 million people around the world live outside of the countries they call home . 
But most families that rely on remittances operate outside of the world &apos;s financial system as well . 
Despite the global prevalence of electronic money transfers , most migrant workers are excluded from the convenience of modern banking services , dependent on costly cash transfers that often require rural recipients to travel significant distances . 
As a result , migrant workers are forced to initiate more than one billion separate transactions worldwide each year . 
That means more than one billion trips for rural women and men to collect their money . 
Adding up the cost of the transfer , travel , and time , remittances are far too expensive for people living in poverty . 
IFAD has been working in more than 40 countries to ensure that rural families can have easy access to remittances , and are better able to use them as savings or investments that go back into their communities . 
The amount of money at stake is staggering : It is estimated that over the next five years , more than $ 2.5 trillion will be sent in remittances to developing countries , with almost 40 % - coming in the form of payments of $ 50 , $ 100 , or $ 500 at a time - destined for rural areas . 
While the majority of family remittances will always be used to meet immediate needs , IFAD &apos;s experience shows that rural families would seize opportunities to save and invest , even small amounts , if they had better options . 
While remittances should and can be leveraged to bring about impressive results in poverty reduction , let us not forget that there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed . 
Young people , the leaders and farmers of tomorrow , are leaving their rural communities behind in search of better opportunities . 
We need to turn rural areas into vibrant and economically stable communities that provide opportunities for young people to earn a living , build their capacities , and start a family . 
We should not ignore the enormous development potential of remittances to rural areas . 
Let us empower families to use their hard-earned money in ways that will help to make migration a matter of choice , not a necessity for the generations to come .
