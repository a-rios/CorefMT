The Future of the Iran Nuclear Deal 
NEW YORK - &quot; There &apos;s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip , &quot; goes the old English proverb . 
Something seemingly resolved and certain in fact is neither . 
If no such expression exists in Farsi , I predict one soon will . 
The reason , of course , is the &quot; Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran &apos;s Nuclear Program , &quot; the framework just adopted by Iran and the P5 + 1 ( the UN Security Council &apos;s five permanent members - China , Britain , France , Russia , and the United States - plus Germany ) . 
The agreement constitutes an important political and diplomatic milestone , and it contains more detail and is broader in scope than many anticipated . 
But , for all that , the text leaves unanswered at least as many questions as it resolves . 
In reality - and as the coming weeks , months , and years will demonstrate - major issues have yet to be settled . 
It is closer to the truth to say the real debate about the Iran nuclear accord is just beginning . 
The framework places significant limits on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , including the number and type of centrifuges , the sort of reactors , and the amount and quality of enriched uranium that the country may possess . 
Standards are set for the inspections needed to provide confidence that Iran is fulfilling its obligations . 
And provision is made for easing economic sanctions once Iran has verifiably met its commitments . 
The bottom line is that the agreement will provide an estimated one-year warning from the moment that Iran might decide to build one or more nuclear weapons to the point at which it could achieve that goal . 
This assessment assumes that the monitoring called for in the accord will detect any Iranian non-compliance early enough to enable a coordinated international response , particularly the reintroduction of sanctions , before Iran could acquire nuclear weapons . 
There are no less than five reasons not to assume the deal will enter into force or have the desired impact . 
The first involves the next 90 days . 
What was announced was an interim framework ; a formal , comprehensive accord is supposed to be completed by the end of June . 
In the meantime , there could easily be changes of heart and mind as those who negotiated the interim deal return home and face criticism from their governments and publics over its terms . 
Already , significant differences are emerging in how the US and Iranian sides are representing what was negotiated . 
A second concern stems from the specific issues that remain to be resolved . 
The most difficult might be the timing of when various economic sanctions are to be removed - the issue of greatest concern to Iran . 
But these same sanctions are also the source of the greatest leverage over Iranian behavior , which means that many in the US and Europe will want them to remain in place until Iran has fully met its critical obligations . 
A third source of doubt is whether the various parties will approve any long-term pact . 
The two main uncertainties involve Iran and the US . 
So-called hardliners in Iran will undoubtedly object to an agreement with the &quot; Great Satan &quot; that places limits on their country &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
But there is also a widespread desire among Iranians to get out from under economic sanctions , and Iran will approve a pact if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei favors it , which he presumably does . 
The uncertainties are greater in the US . 
President Barack Obama must contend with a far more complex political environment , beginning with the US Congress . 
There is widespread and understandable concern about leaving Iran with any nuclear capabilities , about the adequacy of provisions for monitoring and inspection , and about what will happen in ten or 15 or 25 years when various limits on Iran expire . 
Persuading Congress to approve the final pact and / or lift sanctions is anything but assured . 
This question of gaining political approval is closely tied to a fourth area of concern : how any final agreement is implemented . 
The history of arms control suggests there will be occasions when Iran , which has a record of withholding relevant information from UN weapons inspectors , is suspected of not living up to the letter , much less the spirit , of what was negotiated . 
Agreement is needed on the process for judging Iranian behavior and for determining appropriate responses . 
The fifth concern stems not so much from the accord as from everything else about Iran &apos;s foreign and defense policies . 
The agreement is only about Iran &apos;s nuclear activities . 
It says nothing about Iran &apos;s missile programs or support for terrorists and proxies , much less about what it is doing in Syria or Iraq or Yemen or anywhere else in the turbulent Middle East , or about human rights at home . 
Iran is a would-be imperial power that seeks regional primacy . 
Even a nuclear agreement that is signed and implemented will not affect this reality and might even make it worse , as Iran could well emerge with its reputation enhanced and a long-term option to build nuclear weapons intact . 
Obama is right : A nuclear agreement of the sort outlined is preferable to Iran possessing nuclear weapons or going to war to prevent that outcome . 
But any agreement must also generate widespread confidence in the US and the region that it will place a meaningful ceiling on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , and that any cheating will be discovered early and dealt with firmly . 
This will not be easy ; indeed , it is no exaggeration to predict that the effort to generate such confidence may well prove as demanding as the negotiations themselves .
