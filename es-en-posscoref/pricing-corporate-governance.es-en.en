Pricing Corporate Governance 
CAMBRIDGE - Do markets appreciate and correctly price the corporate-governance provisions of companies ? 
In new empirical research , Alma Cohen , Charles C.Y. Wang , and I show how stock markets have learned to price anti-takeover provisions . 
This learning by markets has important implications for both managements of publicly traded companies and their investors . 
In 2001 , three financial economists - Paul Gompers , Joy Ishii , and Andrew Metrick - identified a governance-based investment strategy that would have yielded superior stock-market returns during the 1990 &quot; s . 
The strategy was based on the presence of &quot; entrenching &quot; governance provisions , such as a classified board or a poison pill , which insulate managements from the discipline of the market for corporate control . 
During the 1990 &quot; s , holding shares of firms with no or few entrenching provisions , and shorting shares of firms with many such provisions , would have outperformed the market . 
These findings have intrigued firms , investors , and corporate-governance experts ever since they were made public , and have led shareholder advisers to develop governance-based investment products . 
Even if anti-takeover provisions hurt firms &quot; performance , however , investors may be unable to make trading profits if prices come to reflect the effects of these publicly-known provisions . 
Indeed , in our study , Cohen , Wang , and I show that the association between governance and returns documented for the 1990 &quot; s subsequently disappeared . 
No such association existed during the 2000 &quot; s or any sub-period within this decade . 
After out-performing the market during the 1990 &quot; s , the governance-based strategy subsequently performed on par with it . 
How can one make sense of the association between governance and returns during the 1990 &quot; s and its subsequent disappearance ? 
We find that this pattern is due to markets &quot; learning over time to appreciate the difference in expected future profitability between firms that have good and bad governance ( in terms of their levels of anti-takeover protection ) . 
Consistent with such learning , the attention to governance by the media , institutional investors , and researchers jumped sharply at the beginning of the 2000 &quot; s , and has remained at historically high levels . 
For example , the number of governance-related articles in US newspapers tripled from 2000 to 2002 , and the number of governance-related resolutions brought to a vote by institutional investors ( many focusing on anti-takeover provisions ) more than doubled , with both figures remaining at elevated levels ever since . 
Market prices seem to have been affected by the increase in attention to governance . 
We found evidence that , by 2001 , markets learned to appreciate the difference between good-governance and bad-governance firms in terms of their expected future profitability . 
We examined the extent to which firms &quot; earning announcements surprised markets ( as reflected in stock-price reactions to these announcements ) and stock analysts ( as measured by the gap between announced and forecast earnings ) . 
We found that , during the 1990-2001 period , but not afterwards , the earning announcements of good-governance firms were more likely to surprise both markets and analysts than the earning announcements of bad-governance firms . 
It should be emphasized that , while trading on anti-takeover provisions could no longer be used to out-perform the market during the 2000 &quot; s , such provisions remain quite consequential for firms &quot; valuation . 
Throughout the 2000 &quot; s , firms with higher entrenchment levels have had lower market capitalization ( relative to their book value ) . 
Indeed , the incorporation of entrenchment levels into market prices is what made it impossible to trade profitably using information on such levels . 
Overall , our findings support the view that markets might be unable to price new governance provisions and practices accurately right away , but that they can be expected to learn over time to do so . 
Such learning can take considerable time , but it does happen . 
Both managements and investors should take market learning into account , paying close attention to the potential increase in market capitalization that eliminating anti-takeover provisions could produce . 
Many firms have already eliminated anti-takeover provisions in recent years , removing staggered boards and supermajority requirements for mergers . 
Lowering entrenchment levels , rather than trading on them , continues to offer opportunities for substantial returns to firms &quot; shareholders . 
Furthermore , while markets now price anti-takeover provisions , our findings raise the possibility that markets do not ( yet ) price other governance features whose emergence is relatively more recent . 
The introduction of new governance arrangements and their subsequent incorporation into prices is a gradual process , a work constantly in progress . 
Thus , while investors can no longer profit by basing their trading decisions on standard anti-takeover provisions , our findings leave open the possibility that an investment strategy based on other features of corporate governance might be worthwhile . 
Thus , managements should not dismiss governance reforms that are potentially valuable , but that investors are not yet focused on , and that markets do not yet price . 
Investors eventually do learn . 
And , when they do , they appropriately reward or penalize firms for their governance choices .
