Central Europe &apos;s Misguided War on Drugs 
WARSAW - It was two decades ago this summer that communist rule began to implode from Tallinn in the Baltic to Tirana in the Adriatic , ushering in free elections , market reforms , and expanded civil liberties . 
Since then , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have come a long way . 
Many are now members of the European Union . 
My homeland , Poland , has a steady economy and a thriving media . 
Yet Poland , like many of the other new democracies in our region , remains stuck in the past when it comes to the humane treatment of drug users . 
Indeed , throughout the former Soviet bloc , there is a disturbing trend in using outdated , conservative , and heavy-handed policies to address drug abuse . 
For example , Gdansk - the birthplace of the Solidarity movement - does not have a single methadone treatment center . 
People must travel for three hours to get the medicine that is proven to control cravings and reduce the harms of drug use . 
And they are the lucky ones . 
Only 5 % of opiate users in Poland have access to methadone at all , compared to 40 % in Germany . 
Instead of focusing on treatment that works , the Polish government chooses to give priority to long-term rehabilitation centers located in the depths of the countryside that have little , if anything , to do with evidence-based medicine . 
Poland also chooses to treat possession of even the smallest quantities of drugs as criminal , as evidenced by the fact that 60 % of people sentenced for drug possession in Poland are marijuana smokers . 
Addressing drug use through criminalization and rehabilitation centers does nothing to curb demand , however , and usage rates have failed to decline . 
By driving users underground , criminalization contributes to a deepening public-health crisis . 
This pattern persists across Central and Eastern Europe , where governments have also opted to imprison drug users . 
In Hungary , for example , the penal code calls for two years imprisonment for personal possession by a drug-dependent person . 
In neighboring Slovakia , the penalty for personal possession is , as in Poland , up to three years . 
This approach is not only inhumane , but also economically untenable : leaders in these countries should be encouraged to redirect scarce law enforcement , court , and prison resources towards more pressing causes . 
Simply put , governments can no longer afford to drain precious time and money that could be better spent elsewhere by locking up people for drug-related offenses . 
If Poland and its neighbors are to chart a new way forward , at least three things must happen . First , these countries should look West for alternative , and more humane , drug policies . 
A report released recently by the United Kingdom &apos;s Drug Policy Commission correctly calls for a &quot; smarter &quot; drug policy that focuses on addressing associated violence rather than simply making arrests . 
Officials in Central and Eastern Europe should pay heed to recent comments by the UK &apos;s Home Office , which said that &quot; harm reduction underpins every element of our approach to tackling this complex issue . &quot; 
Portugal recently went a step further in voting to decriminalize recreational drugs , including heroin and cocaine - a move that has led to a significant decline in drug-related deaths and a fall in new HIV infections . 
Second , law-makers should listen to their constituents : a recent public awareness campaign by Gazeta Wyborcza , a leading Polish daily newspaper , collected more than 23,000 signatures in five days for a petition calling for changes to the current drug law . 
The changes , modeled after Germany &apos;s progressive policies , would stop punishing people for possessing small amounts of drugs for their own use , impose stricter penalties for dealers and provide more effective treatment for drug-dependent people . 
In a step forward , a debate in the Polish parliament on the proposed drug law is set to start in September . 
Young people should not start their working lives with criminal records because of personal possession . 
Finally , at the European level , EU policymakers can help by encouraging member states to decriminalize possession of small amounts of drugs . 
By freeing up resources devoted to enforcing policies against low-level users , countries can better tackle serious drug-supply issues and provide people with the effective treatment that they need and deserve .
