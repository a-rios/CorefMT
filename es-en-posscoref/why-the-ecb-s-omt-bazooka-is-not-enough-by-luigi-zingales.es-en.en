Mario Draghi &apos;s Opiate of the Markets 
CHICAGO - From the standpoint of European stability , the Italian elections could not have delivered a worse outcome . 
Italy &apos;s parliament is divided among three mutually incompatible political forces , with none strong enough to rule alone . 
Worse , one of these forces , which won 25 % of the vote , is an anti-euro populist party , while another , a Euro-skeptic group led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , received close to 30 % support , giving anti-euro parties a clear majority . 
Despite these scary results , the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds relative to German bunds has increased by only 40 basis points since the election . 
In July 2012 , when a pro-European , austerity-minded government was running the country , with the well-respected economist Mario Monti in charge , the spread reached 536 basis points . 
Today , with no government and little chance that a decent one will be formed soon , the spread sits at 314 points . 
So , are markets bullish about Italy , or have they lost their ability to assess risk ? 
A recent survey of international investors conducted by Morgan Stanley suggests that they are not bullish . 
Forty-six percent of the respondents said that the most likely outcome for Italy is an interim administration and new elections . 
And they regard this outcome as the worst-case scenario , one that implies a delay of any further economic measures , deep policy uncertainty , and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome . 
The survey also clearly indicated why the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds is not much wider : the perceived backstop provided by the European Central Bank . 
Although investors believe that the backstop is unlikely to be used , its mere presence dissuades them from betting against Italy . 
In other words , the &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) scheme announced by ECB President Mario Draghi last July has served as the proverbial &quot; bazooka &quot; - a gun so powerful that it does not need to be used . 
Then-US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought a bazooka during the 2008 financial crisis . 
He failed , because he believed that even a fake gun would work if it looked scary enough . 
Not falling for the trick , speculators repeatedly called his bluff . 
Draghi , with his famous pledge to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to ensure the euro &apos;s survival , succeeded where Paulson did not . 
After all , he controls the monetary spigot . 
But even Draghi &apos;s bazooka is partly a bluff . 
Draghi designed it to relieve the ECB of the huge political responsibility of deciding when to save a country from default . 
For this reason , triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments . 
But , if the bazooka is needed , how likely is it to be fired before the German election in September ? 
The Morgan Stanley survey did not ask this question , probably because everybody knows the answer : not likely at all . 
Thus , markets remain calm because they expect the bazooka not to be needed . 
In that case , the fact that it cannot be triggered easily does not pose a significant problem . 
Its presence is enough to support a benign self-fulfilling prophecy . 
In other words , Draghi &apos;s bazooka has anesthetized markets , impairing their ability to assess risk . 
But as with all anesthetics , Draghi &apos;s cannot and will not last forever . 
Either the underlying problem is fixed before the patient wakes up , or the pain will be devastating . 
The investors surveyed by Morgan Stanley put the chance of a renewed crisis in Italy below 25 % . 
I believe that it is higher than 50 % . 
Even after Germany &apos;s election , I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives - and even the composition - of Italy &apos;s ruling coalition . 
Indeed , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will face a serious dilemma following her likely re-election . 
Without strict conditionality , she would risk shifting the domestic consensus in favor of Germany &apos;s emerging Euro-skeptic mood . 
But , by insisting on such conditionality , she would trigger a huge political crisis in Europe . 
If the German government gets to decide who governs Italy , why should Italians bother voting ? 
The eurozone will look like a German protectorate , rather than a voluntary union of sovereign countries . 
The political backlash would be enormous . 
The only hope is that the eurozone makes strong progress toward establishing fiscal-redistribution mechanisms , such as European unemployment insurance , before Draghi &apos;s anesthetic wears off . 
Otherwise , Europe will face a very rude awakening indeed .
