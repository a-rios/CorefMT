Is Low-Wage China Disappearing ? 
BEIJING - Reports about labor shortages , wage disputes , and wage increases for migrant workers in China have abounded of late . 
They naturally raised concerns , or expectations , that China &apos;s labor-cost advantages may be disappearing . 
It is my hope that China &apos;s comparative advantage as a low-wage producer does disappear - the sooner the better . 
But why should I , a Chinese economist , wish to see China &apos;s competitiveness reduced through rising labor costs ? 
After all , when a country still lacks real advantages , such as higher education , efficient markets and enterprises , and a capacity for innovation , it needs something like low wages to maintain growth . 
While cheap labor has been a key factor in generating high growth over the past three decades , it has also contributed to profound income disparities , especially in recent years . 
And persistent , widening inequality might cause social crises that could interrupt growth and damage competitiveness . 
China must avoid such a scenario , and if wages could increase in some meaningful way , it would indicate that the economy might finally reach the next stage of development , during which income disparities would be narrowed . 
Unfortunately , China has not yet reached that point - and will not any time soon . 
Agriculture remains the main source of income for more than 30 % of China &apos;s labor force , compared to less than 2 % in the United States or 6 % in South Korea . 
Another 30 % of the labor force comprises migrant workers , who have doubled their incomes by moving from agriculture to the industrial and service sectors . 
Although migrant workers earn only about $ 1,500 per year on average , the income gap between them and agricultural laborers provides a powerful incentive for the latter to try to find better-paid non-farm jobs . 
Naturally , this competition in the labor market suppresses non-farm wages : whereas labor productivity in non-farm sectors increased by 10-12 % annually in the past 15 years , migrant workers &quot; real wages have increased by only 4-6 % per year . 
As a result , income disparity between low-end labor , on the one hand , and professionals and investors , on the other , has also increased . 
All this means that the process of industrialization in China still has a long way to go . 
To reduce farm labor to 10 % of the labor force ( the point at which , judging by historical experience elsewhere , China may achieve worker-farmer wage equilibrium ) , the economy needs to create about 150 million new non-farm jobs . 
Even if the economy continues to grow at 8 % per year , China might need 20-30 years to reallocate agricultural laborers and reach &quot; full employment . &quot; 
But this requires generating eight million new jobs every year , including five million for farmers leaving the countryside . 
During this long process of industrialization , wages will increase gradually , but it is very unlikely that they will grow at the same rate as labor productivity . 
This is bad news for reducing income inequality , as capital gains and high-end wages may grow much faster . 
But it should be the good news for competitiveness , because Chinese wages will remain relatively low in terms of &quot; wage efficiency . &quot; 
Indeed , the wage increases of recent years have not changed the basic cost structure of Chinese companies . 
An analysis by Goldman Sachs shows that , despite real wage gains , the share of labor costs in total manufacturing costs is lower than it was in 2001 - a trend that continued in the first half of 2010 . 
To prevent serious social tension , China &apos;s government ( at various levels ) has begun to intervene by enforcing higher minimum wages , in addition to investing in a social safety net for the poor . 
In some provinces , minimum wages have increased by more than 30 % . 
But the minimum wage is normally much lower than the effective wage , and thus has not changed the fundamental relationship between wages and labor productivity . 
Nevertheless , artificial wage increases enforced by government policies could slow down the process of labor reallocation and make some &quot; surplus labor &quot; permanent . 
Income disparities will not be fundamentally altered until the market equilibrium wage inches upwards sufficiently to create labor demand at decent wage levels . 
So will companies , both multinationals and Chinese , leave for Vietnam , Bangladesh , or Mozambique ? 
Perhaps . 
But that will happen only if the other countries &quot; wages are relatively more efficient ( i.e. , productivity there is ultimately higher than in China ) , and not just because Chinese nominal wages go up . 
For now , however , this does not seem to be the case in general . 
Evidence that China &apos;s wage efficiency remains high relative to other developing countries comes in the form of continued growth in inflows of foreign direct investment over the past 12 months , despite wage increases . 
In July , for example , FDI increased by 29.2 % year on year , much higher than the global average . 
There may be many factors behind China &apos;s strong FDI performance , but it does mean that the nominal wage increase itself may not lower the capital gains that concern investors most . 
In any case , the Chinese wage story is much more complicated than it might seem . 
Nominal wages may increase , while real wages stagnate , owing to higher inflation . 
Even if real wages increase in some coastal cities , &quot; surplus labor &quot; could keep the national average flat . 
And even a real wage increase on the national level will not undermine competitiveness if labor productivity grows still faster . 
So the conclusion seems to be that wage growth will not threaten China &apos;s competitiveness in the next 10 or even 20 years . 
As China will not complete the process of reallocating workers from agriculture to more modern economic sectors any time soon , it should remain a cost-competitive economy for the foreseeable future .
