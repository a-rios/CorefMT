The New Growth Conundrum 
PARIS - For most governments , the rate of economic growth that can reasonably be expected in the coming years is a key question . 
And , at least for the advanced economies , it has become a particularly puzzling one . 
If the past is a good predictor of the future , the outlook is bleak . 
Since 2008 , economic growth has consistently disappointed expectations . 
Of the countries most affected by the financial crisis , only a few - the United States , Germany , and Sweden - have rediscovered the path to sustained growth . 
The consensus view among economists and policymakers is that the financial crisis and the euro crisis have damaged both demand and supply , but that a gradual healing process has begun . 
On the demand side , according to this view , the hangover from pre-crisis private indebtedness and crisis-generated public indebtedness still weighs on domestic demand . 
Gradually , consumers will start spending and investing again ( as is becoming the case in the US ) , and fiscal policy will become neutral again ( as is already the case in Germany ) . 
On the supply side , the crisis has lowered potential output growth , because , in Europe at least , firms have invested less , impeding the adoption of new technologies . 
Moreover , in some cases - for example , the United Kingdom - wage decreases and flexible layoff rules have encouraged firms to substitute labor for capital , reducing output per employee . 
Clogged capital markets and resistance to social hardship have also delayed the replacement of incumbent firms by more efficient new entrants . 
The aggregate result has been lower-than-anticipated productivity : in the UK , more person-hours were needed to produce a unit of output in 2013 than in 2007 . 
Here , too , the supply-side effect of the crisis is likely to persist until firms invest in new equipment , innovation accelerates , and the churning process in labor markets resumes . 
But the view that advanced economies are gradually healing is challenged from both sides . 
Starting with demand , Larry Summers , the Harvard economist and senior US official under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama , recently proposed that advanced economies have found themselves in the grip of secular stagnation . 
Summers &apos;s view is that pre-crisis indebtedness was not an exogenous anomaly ; it was the consequence of insufficient global demand . 
The global distribution of income had shifted away from the advanced countries &quot; middle class toward the rich and the emerging economies , resulting in excess worldwide savings . 
The only way to avoid stagnation was to push the middle class deeper into debt , helped by low interest rates and lenient lending rules . 
In other words , the savings glut ( as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called it ) predated the crisis and could continue to affect global demand , unless the emerging countries &quot; middle class provides the global economy with a new consumer of last resort . 
This is likely to happen eventually ; but , despite efforts by the US and the International Monetary Fund in the context of the G-20 , this rebalancing process has not yet been completed . 
The challenge on the supply side stems from a new dispute among economists and technology experts about the pace of technological progress . 
For Robert Gordon of Northwestern University , information and communication technologies have already delivered most of the productivity boost that can be expected from them ; there is no major innovation wave in sight that could offset the slowdown in potential growth . 
Laggards can look forward to reaping catch-up dividends ; but countries at the technology frontier should accept that very slow annual per capita growth - little more than 1 % - is the new normal . 
By contrast , the MIT scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that the Second Machine Age is yet to come . 
They claim that ever-increasing computing power , worldwide connectivity , and the almost unlimited potential for generating new innovations through recombining existing processes will trigger major transformations in both production and consumption , in the same way that the steam engine transformed the world in the nineteenth century . 
Growth should accelerate as a consequence , at least if properly measured . 
Combining the challenges cited by Gordon and Summers to the view that advanced economies are gradually healing leads to some depressing conclusions . 
If Gordon is right about slow productivity growth , the debt overhang inherited from the crisis and public-finance woes will persist for much longer than anticipated . 
If , in addition , Summers is right that demand is bound to remain deficient , the combination of financial troubles and persistent mass unemployment is likely to push governments toward radical solutions - debt default , inflation , or financial protectionism . 
If , on the contrary , Brynjolfsson and McAfee are right , growth will be much more robust , and debt issues will be forgotten sooner than expected . 
The challenge , instead , will be to cope with the labor-reducing and income-inequality effects of emerging technologies . 
That will be especially true if these transformations take place against the background drawn by Summers of persistent mass unemployment . 
The risk is that social problems become intractable , as technological advances come to be regarded as benefiting the rich while creating additional hardship for the masses . 
In such a scenario , governments will have to look for innovative responses . 
Scenarios like these may seem far-fetched . 
But , while certainly discomfiting , they are hardly irrelevant .
