The Human Thatcher 
LONDON - It is difficult to separate some of my personal memories of Margaret Thatcher - mundane but revealing - from the sweeping judgments of history . 
I had worked for her as the Conservative Party &apos;s research director , and as a minister for about 15 years , before going to Hong Kong as Britain &apos;s last Governor there . 
Because she had negotiated Hong Kong &apos;s handover to China , she was a frequent and welcome visitor during my tenure . 
Thatcher was always hugely supportive of the preservation of Hong Kong &apos;s rule of law , civil liberties , and democratic aspirations . 
She sympathized with , and appeared to like , pro-democracy campaigners . 
I also remember that , while our official residence was full of excellent , hardworking staff ( to whom she was always kind and courteous ) , she was the only visitor - and there were many - who made her own bed ! 
The job was done with all the care and precision of a grand hotel : boxed corners and neatly turned-down cover . 
Invariably , when she traveled on business to Beijing , she would insist on first shopping for a present for the former Chinese leader , Zhao Ziyang , with whom she had negotiated Hong Kong &apos;s handover . 
Since the Tiananmen killings , which he had tried to avert through compromise , he had been under house arrest . 
By asking whichever senior officials she saw to pass on her gift and her best wishes to Zhao , the Chinese leadership would understand that the outside world was still thinking of him and wanted to ensure his survival . 
It was typically practical and kind . 
As a national leader , Thatcher &apos;s principal achievements were to reverse Britain &apos;s decline , which had gained momentum in the 1970 &quot; s , before her first term as Prime Minister in 1979 . 
Little of the extensive coverage of her death has focused on what Britain was like in those years . 
The economy was on its knees , and the abuse of trade-union power had made Britain almost ungovernable . 
Paradoxically , she made accountable and authoritative government possible again partly by curtailing the state &apos;s role in the economy . 
Her reforms laid the foundations for a period during which Britain &apos;s per capita wealth grew faster than most of its competitors . &quot; 
Thatcher &apos;s reforms reinvigorated the private sector , promoted home ownership , lowered taxes on enterprise , deregulated large parts of the economy , and reined in the unions &quot; power to use their industrial muscle . 
She set about this reform program with determination , but - at least until her last years - with subtle pragmatism as well . 
She moved step by step , invariably in the same direction . 
No one in government would be in any doubt about what she wanted to do . 
The reforms that she undertook struck a chord internationally . 
Her period in office coincided with the crumbling of Soviet communism in Europe , which culminated with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 . 
She had been an outspoken critic of Soviet communism , like her transatlantic friend and partner , Ronald Reagan . 
Her espousal of free markets - indeed , her ringing declarations about the link between political and economic freedom - inspired the Soviet bloc &apos;s peoples , who had suffered under the Soviet yoke for 40 years . 
While her antipathy to German reunification was ill-judged , her doubts about the ability to reconcile greater political integration in the European Union with democratic accountability in its member states has gained many more sympathizers over the years - and not only in her own country . 
She pushed for greater integration of the European single market , while questioning whether this really required ceding more political authority to the European Commission . 
Many consider the Falklands War in 1982 as the apogee of her patriotism . 
It was just as much a sign of her political bravado . 
The recovery of this far-flung British dependency , whose citizens were resolutely committed to remaining British subjects after the Argentine invasion , was a daring military act . 
It could have gone terribly wrong , bringing down her and her administration . 
Even the Reagan administration came close to balking at supporting Britain &apos;s military campaign . 
But fortune favored the brave , and victory solidified her reputation for decisiveness and raw courage . 
As Britain &apos;s taxi drivers liked to say , she was the best man in the government . 
Thatcher &apos;s confidence in the strength of Britain &apos;s relationship with the United States was underpinned by her friendship with Reagan . 
They were very different characters who shared a similar philosophy , albeit expressed with more charm by a president who much admired her directness and her simple , even blunt assertions of the old verities . 
&quot; Isn &apos;t she wonderful , &quot; he is reported to have said to an aide , one hand over the telephone , as she scolded him from London for some US policy error . 
It was a sentiment shared by many Americans who went to hear her lecture after her retirement . 
I most admired Thatcher for her political style . 
She never required a focus group to tell her what she believed or how to express it . 
She regarded ideas as the very core of politics , and she battled for those that she held . 
She did not &quot; triangulate &quot; in an effort to find the middle point between opposing views ; she deplored the idea that the middle ground of politics , where most voters dwell , was pre-determined by a wishy-washy elite consensus . 
An effective leader , she believed , could shift this political terrain by convincing people of the truth and relevance of his or her position . 
Thatcher was often more careful than her admirers have subsequently suggested in the way she set about doing this . 
But , ultimately , her passion for the ideas to which she was devoted splashed bright colors across a political world usually painted in shades of grey . 
Margaret Thatcher was not perfect . 
Like everyone else , she made mistakes and got some things wrong . 
But she was undoubtedly a giant of twentieth-century politics , a leader who changed her and our world - for the better .
