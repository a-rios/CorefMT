Can Japan Reboot ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s recent policy decisions - to increase monetary stimulus dramatically , to postpone a consumption-tax increase , and to call a snap election in mid-December - have returned his country to the forefront of an intense policy debate . 
The problem is simple : How can aging advanced economies revive growth after a financial crisis ? 
The solution is not . 
It is now clear that the first round of Abe &apos;s reforms - known as &quot; Abenomics &quot; - has failed to generate sustained inflation . 
Hopes for continued recovery have now given way to two consecutive quarters of negative growth . 
The question is whether Abenomics 2.0 will put Japan &apos;s economy back on the path to renewed prosperity . 
My own view is that the &quot; three arrows &quot; of Abenomics 1.0 basically had it right : &quot; whatever it takes &quot; monetary policy to restore inflation , supportive fiscal policy , and structural reforms to boost long-run growth . 
But , though the central bank , under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda , has been delivering on its side of the bargain , the other two &quot; arrows &quot; of Abenomics have fallen far short . 
There has been no significant progress on supply-side reforms , especially on the core issue of how to expand the labor force . 
With an aging and shrinking population , Japan &apos;s government must find ways to encourage more women to work , entice older Japanese to remain in the labor force , and develop more family-friendly labor policies . 
Above all , Japan needs to create a more welcoming environment for immigrant workers . 
There has been some movement on immigration . 
Panicked by deadlines for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , the government managed to clear the import of foreign construction workers ( though the decision had to make its way through a half-dozen ministries ) . 
But overall progress has been slow . 
Japan desperately needs more nurses and hospice workers to care for its aging population , but bureaucratic and political resistance to immigration is deeply entrenched . 
When I first started asking my Japanese academic friends about Abe &apos;s supply-side reforms , they said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , they &apos;re coming . &quot; 
Then , after a while , they would say , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , they &apos;re coming - but slowly . &quot; 
Recently , the mantra has changed to , &quot; Don &apos;t worry , we still think they &apos;re coming . &quot; 
One can only hope so . 
Without structural reforms , especially of the labor market , Abenomics cannot succeed in the long run . 
The timing of the April 2014 consumption-tax hike ( from 5 % to 8 % ) was also unfortunate . 
It would not have been easy for Abe to postpone the move , given that it had been locked in place by broad-based political agreement before he took office . 
But the government could have engaged in more aggressive fiscal stimulus to counteract the hike &apos;s short-term effects . 
Instead , two successive quarters of negative growth have had a dispiriting psychological impact . 
True , the slump is partly an illusion : the earlier boom was fueled by Japanese households &quot; effort to beat the tax by front-loading purchases of consumer durables - a nuance that seems to have been lost in the public debate . 
But the big picture remains : Abenomics so far has failed to turn around a deflationary mindset . 
Mind you , Japan &apos;s outsize government debt and undersize pension assets are a huge problem , and only the most reckless and crude Keynesian would advise the authorities to ignore it . 
For the moment , the risks are notional , with interest rates on ten-year government debt below 0.5 % . 
But saying that Japan &apos;s debt is irrelevant is like saying that a highly leveraged hedge fund is completely safe ; the risks may be remote , but they are not trivial . 
Think about what would happen if the Bank of Japan actually managed to convince the public that inflation will average 2 % on a sustained basis . 
Would ten-year interest rates still be 0.5 % ? 
What if other factors - say , a sharp decline in emerging-market growth - led to a sharp rise in global real interest rates , or a rise in risk premia on Japanese debt ? 
In principle , Japan could weather such shocks without high inflation or other extreme measures , but it is folly to deny the country &apos;s vulnerability . 
A hedge fund can simply go out of business ; that is not an option for a great nation . 
Fiscal sustainability requires an eventual rise in the consumption tax , and of course Japan should not wait until international investors start doubting its willpower . 
The problem is in the timing and tactics . 
Postponing the second consumption-tax increase seems like a good compromise between pushing Abenomics to escape velocity and maintaining long-run credibility . 
But this brings us back to Japan &apos;s deeper problems . 
Demand policies alone will not alone prevent two more lost decades , much less guarantee two golden ones . 
Demographic decline was a key factor in setting off Japan &apos;s 1992 financial crisis and the long malaise that followed . 
Japan is still a rich country , but its ranking in terms of real per capita income has now slipped below that of many other advanced economies - including the United Kingdom , by some measures - and far below that of the United States . 
Japan &apos;s experience holds important lessons for Europe , the main one being that stimulus policies , though necessary in the short run to support demand , cannot address long-term structural deficiencies . 
If Abenomics 2.0 fails to embrace deep structural reform , it will fare no better than the original .
