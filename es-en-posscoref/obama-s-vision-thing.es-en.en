Obama &apos;s Vision Thing 
MADRID - Humbled by the Republicans &quot; landslide mid-term election victory , US President Barack Obama will now need to negotiate every minor detail of his domestic agenda with a confrontational Congress - at least until the next elections in 2012 . 
Congress can obstruct Obama &apos;s foreign policy as well , but this remains a domain where any US president &quot; enjoys almost royal prerogatives , &quot; to use Alexis de Tocqueville &apos;s somewhat inflated description . 
These prerogatives , however , have so far allowed Obama only to describe the world that he wants , not to bring it about . 
George W. Bush committed the cardinal sin of all fallen empires - that of overreach . 
The Obama alternative was supposed to be collective global security sustained by multilateral structures . 
Rather than containing rising powers such as China and India , they would be drawn into a civilized world order , one based on global governance and &quot; smart diplomacy . &quot; 
Yet , instead of building such an order , Obama &apos;s presidency has so far been a mighty struggle to stem the decline in American power . 
He has fallen desperately short in making real progress towards the Promised Land , in which America lives in peace with the Muslim world , thanks to an Israeli-Palestinian settlement ; brings about a nuclear-free planet ( a noble , yet entirely delusional pledge ) ; gets Russia &apos;s support in addressing other global problems ; contains China &apos;s quest to translate its growing economic power into major strategic gains ; ends its two diversionary wars in Muslim countries ; and leads a solid international alliance to cut short Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Foreign policy has almost invariably been the refuge of US presidents hit by mid-term defeats . 
Can a president shown to be hesitant in the Middle East and Afghanistan even before his mid-term setback muster the authority needed to advance his global vision after such a domestic debacle ? 
One should hope so , if only because no better alternative to Obama &apos;s vision is in view . 
And now , with a Republican-controlled House of Representatives , Obama might not be able to fulfill major foreign-policy promises , including ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , a key item in the president &apos;s vision for reinvigorating the Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
Should Congress not ratify the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia , Obama &apos;s most tangible foreign-policy achievement so far , the entire inspection system for nuclear arms might collapse . 
But , with respect to most other foreign-policy issues , the question is one of presidential leadership . 
Obama &apos;s problem lies not in his vision for America and the world , but in his deficient efforts to move from theory to practice . 
Nevertheless , despite the new Congress &apos;s overwhelmingly pro-Israel cast , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu should not assume that the Republicans will stymie Obama if he pushes resolutely for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal . 
After all , it was a Republican who produced the Reagan Plan , calling on Israel to withdraw to the 1967 borders . 
Thus , however much they despised Bill Clinton , the Republicans were prepared to allow him the glory of being a Middle East peacemaker , believing that any agreement reached with the Palestinians at the 2000 Camp David Summit was in America &apos;s interest . 
Obama was recently advised by David Broder , a long-time Washington Post columnist , to launch an attack on Iran . 
Convinced that history will judge the president by his success in containing the Iranian threat , Broder also assumes that a war with Iran would reignite the American economy . 
That is a strange idea , given that today &apos;s two ongoing wars have only compounded the US economy &apos;s weaknesses . 
An American war against Iran is plausible only as a response to a blatant and immediate Iranian challenge to vital US interests , such as a major terrorist attack , an invasion of an ally in the Gulf , or disruption of the free flow of Middle East oil to the West . 
The Iranian regime is far too astute to cross any of these red lines . 
Iran , like North Korea , will continue to test Obama &apos;s capacity to build international alliances aimed at putting pressure on defiant states . 
Those , like Netanyahu , who stick to the lunacy of a military operation against Iran , will not find a ready ally in Obama . 
Such an operation would make America appear to be doing Israel &apos;s bidding - even George W. Bush refused when former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert asked the US to attack a Syrian nuclear reactor - and destroy Obama &apos;s strategy of reconciliation with the Muslim world . 
Glory in foreign policy is no guarantee of future electoral gains . 
Conversely , Obama did not lose the mid-term elections because of his foreign policy &apos;s inconsistencies . 
He lost because US unemployment remains near 10 % , with no prospect of rapid improvement . 
And only one major foreign-policy test for Obama has clear implications for the US economy and job creation : the need to recalibrate relations with China in a way that restores balance to bilateral trade . 
At the end of the day , Bill Clinton was right : now , as then , &quot; It &apos;s the economy , stupid . &quot; 
It certainly wasn &apos;t - and isn &apos;t - foreign policy , as George H. W. Bush , one of America &apos;s most proficient presidents in international affairs - can attest .
