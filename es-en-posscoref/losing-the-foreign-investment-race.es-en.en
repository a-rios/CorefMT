Losing the Foreign Investment Race 
Latin America is in serious trouble when it comes to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . 
True , inward FDI reached about $ 70 billion in 2006 , but this is below the 1998-1999 peak , and a large share came from Latin American firms investing in neighboring countries , whereas inflows from Europe and the United States have fallen . 
Many companies are withdrawing from the region , and large investments from China , particularly in Brazil , though promised , have failed to materialize . 
At its peak in the 1970 &quot; s , and again in the 1990 &quot; s , Latin America &apos;s share of total global FDI reached 17 % . 
Now it is only 8 % ( in 2006 ) , after averaging 11 % over the previous five years . 
Among developing countries , Latin America &apos;s share of global FDI also fell dramatically , from 40-50 % in the 1970 &quot; s to about half that in 2006 . 
Redressing the problems of high unemployment and large informal sectors - where almost half of all goods and services are produced - is perhaps the region &apos;s most urgent policy challenge , particularly because most investment and growth by domestic firms is related to high commodity prices , which do little to create new jobs . 
Likewise , FDI inflows have been expanding only in resource-intensive sectors , while falling in services and practically stagnating in manufacturing . 
What is lacking are effective government policies to attract high-quality FDI , particularly for exports , which could have a multiplier effect domestically , creating both direct and indirect employment . 
But , in addition to the right legal and regulatory framework to ensure appropriate links to the national economy - which is also lacking in most of the region - the search for desirable investors requires an effective foreign investment promotion agency . 
To change the way Latin American countries sell themselves to foreign investors is a creative challenge . 
Selling goods for export and selling the country to foreign investors is very different . 
As Padraic White , a pioneer in this field who headed the Irish Industrial Development Agency ( IDA-Ireland ) from 1980 to 1990 argues , FDI promotion requires imagination and the ability to think innovatively . 
As White points out , promoters of FDI are not selling a product , which the country &apos;s embassies abroad may be able to do . 
The sales technique should be based on fiscal and regulatory concepts and be expressed in legal and financial jargon , which only experts can do . 
For this reason , FDI has to be promoted separately from domestic investment and exports . 
Furthermore , foreign investors do not want to deal with diplomats or civil servants . 
They want to talk to private-sector experts who understand the technical and financial needs of their companies or sectors . 
Yet , except for Costa Rica &apos;s foreign investment promotion agency , CINDE , modeled after the IDA-Ireland , none of Latin America &apos;s FDI promotion agencies have succeeded in adopting best practices . 
Many promote both foreign and domestic investment , despite the failure of such institutional arrangements in the past . 
Ireland , for example , had to separate the two functions before it became successful . 
Moreover , most FDI promotion agencies in the region lack the minimum financial and human resources needed in order to be effective , owing to governments &quot; lack of political will to support them and to eliminate parallel processes that confuse investors . 
An effective FDI promotion agency must be headed by an executive director with strong credentials and an excellent reputation in the private sector , supplemented by good international contacts and fluency in English . 
Just as importantly , there cannot be any conflict of interest ( or even the perception of such a conflict ) with other personal or political activities , past or present . 
The executive director should put together a team of analysts located in critical locations abroad and able to conduct business intelligence . 
This requires investigation of markets and trends , and identification of specific firms that would be desirable for the clusters or niches that the country wants to promote . 
The team will also need &quot; promoters &quot; in these locations , with public-relations expertise and technical knowledge of the country and the clusters . 
Finally , the team will need local &quot; service providers &quot; with technical knowledge of specific clusters to support foreign investors once they have located in the country , thereby ensuring that they remain and expand . 
International competition for investors is brutal , so waiting for them to fall from the sky is not an option . 
Without the right strategy , Latin America will continue to fall behind .
