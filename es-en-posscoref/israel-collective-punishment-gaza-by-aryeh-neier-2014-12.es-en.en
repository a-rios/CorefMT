Israel &apos;s Terrorist Aid 
NEW YORK - The decision by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government to demolish the family home of Abdelrahman al-Shaludi , a Palestinian who rammed his car into a group of pedestrians , killing two ( including a three-month-old baby ) , was both callous and counterproductive . 
By punishing people whose only known offense was being related to a criminal , Israel inadvertently shifted the focus from the attack , the perpetrator of which was killed immediately after his crime , to Israel &apos;s apparent embrace of a policy of collective punishment . 
If Israel &apos;s principal concern is deterring terrorist attacks , it should be doing everything in its power to ensure that such acts are universally condemned . 
Punishing terrorists &quot; families and neighbors , or those who share their ethnic and religious identity , has the opposite effect , intensifying hostility toward Israel and dissipating the moral outrage that should be mobilized against the actual perpetrators of terrorism . 
As observers increasingly equate the two sides , regarding both as victims and victimizers alike , international support and sympathy for Israel wanes . 
This is not the first time that Israel has been accused of collective punishment . 
The latest house demolition seems to confirm that Israel &apos;s government is resuming the practice of collective punishment that it abandoned a decade ago . 
Why would Netanyahu &apos;s government resume a failed policy ? 
The most likely explanation is that Netanyahu wants to reassure the Israeli public that no act of terrorism will be tolerated - even if that means a vindictive and cruel response . 
In fact , such domestic political considerations were probably also a major driver of the killing and destruction that took place in Gaza over the summer . 
Of course , Israel has the right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket barrages like that launched from Gaza into its territory , and to punish lawfully those responsible . 
But Israel did more than defend itself . 
While the initiative may have appeased Israeli public outrage over the rockets , it damaged Israel &apos;s standing in many other countries considerably . 
More problematic , Israel &apos;s actions in Gaza probably increased its vulnerability to terrorist attacks , not only by fueling animosity toward Israel , but also by suggesting that Netanyahu &apos;s government will most likely discredit itself with its response . 
That propensity to act against its own interests to appease an enraged and emotional public was underscored by the recent destruction of al-Shaludi &apos;s family home . 
To be sure , Israel is not alone in responding irrationally to terrorist provocations . 
Some aspects of the United States &quot; response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , reflect the same tendency - but on a significantly larger scale and with more far-reaching consequences . 
While the attacks were immensely costly in terms of lives lost and material damage , the US-led war in Iraq that followed was beyond disproportionate ; it was truly devastating . 
And its consequences continue to unfold , as the brutal predations of the Islamic State attest . 
It is time for governments in Israel , the US , and elsewhere to recognize that by allowing their citizens &quot; outrage to drive their responses to terrorist attacks , they are offering themselves as the terrorists &quot; best weapon . 
Only by adopting a pragmatic and legal approach can they galvanize support against their enemies and reduce their citizens &quot; vulnerability to attack . 
That , rather than slaking the public &apos;s thirst for vengeance , should be their primary objective .
