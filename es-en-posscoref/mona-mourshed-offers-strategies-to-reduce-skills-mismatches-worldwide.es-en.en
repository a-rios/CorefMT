Closing the Skills Gap 
WASHINGTON , DC - In an age of skyrocketing unemployment , it may seem reasonable to assume that companies do not have to worry about finding workers . 
But a recent McKinsey survey of more than 2,800 employers worldwide has underscored just how flawed that perception is . 
Four out of ten employers said that they cannot find workers to fill entry-level positions in their firms , with more than one-third of respondents saying that their businesses are suffering from a lack of appropriate skills in the labor market . 
Meanwhile , young people worldwide are struggling to find jobs . 
While the eurozone crisis helps to explain why more than half of young people in Greece and Spain are unemployed , rapidly growing economies like South Africa and Nigeria are experiencing similar rates of youth joblessness . 
In the Middle East and North Africa , one in three young people are unemployed . 
And , in the United States , roughly half of bachelor &apos;s degree-holders under the age of 25 were jobless or underemployed upon graduation last year . 
All of this points to the costly skills mismatch at play in today &apos;s economy . 
In the US alone , the opportunity cost of failing to improve education would amount to $ 1.7 trillion by 2030 . 
Similarly , by bridging its growing skills gap , China could augment its GDP by $ 250 billion by 2020 . 
So why isn &apos;t more being done to ensure that young people acquire the skills they need ? 
The problem is rooted in divergent perceptions among the various players in the labor market . 
More than 70 % of the educational institutions surveyed by McKinsey believe that their graduates are ready for the job market ; more than half of employers and young people disagree . 
Closing this gap requires that educators and employers work together more closely . 
Employers should communicate their requirements to educators ; educators need to give their graduates the tools that will enable them to meet these requirements . 
The problem is missed connections , so the solution is to make more of them . 
But such synchronization will not be easy to achieve . 
One-third of employers never interact with education providers , while only 15 % do so once a month or more . 
Both sides would benefit from building strong reciprocal ties , with employers telling educators what they need ( and even helping to design curricula and offering their employees as faculty ) and educators providing students with practical experience and hands-on learning . 
In fact , some promising initiatives are underway . 
Many employers in the auto , tourism , advanced manufacturing , and shipbuilding industries have taken to &quot; pre-hiring &quot; young people - that is , guaranteeing them a job if they complete a rigorous training program . 
A useful example is the cooperation between Brazil &apos;s state-owned energy giant Petrobras and Prominp - a coalition of government agencies , businesses , trade associations , and labor unions - aimed at unleashing the full potential of the country &apos;s oil and gas sector . 
First , Petrobras and Prominp develop a five-year personnel projection in specific skill areas , such as shipyard welding , pipefitting , and petroleum engineering . 
Prominp then identifies an education provider to co-develop an appropriate curriculum with selected companies and train 30,000 people annually . 
Petrobras pays 90 % of the costs , and the government covers the rest . 
But such initiatives remain too few in number and too narrow in scope to resolve the global skills mismatch . 
Moreover , developing effective programs requires far more data about young people &apos;s journey from education to employment than is currently available . 
Governments can play a critical role in collecting the data needed to determine which skills are in demand and what kind of training is effective . 
For example , Colombia &apos;s Labor Observatory tracks students &quot; progress - including where they attended university , what they studied , when and where they were first employed , what their starting salaries were , and whether they were promoted - for up to five years after graduation . 
Prospective students can use this information to gain a far more accurate picture of their future prospects . 
Of course , young people must become proactive if such schemes are to be effective . 
Fewer than half of the young people that McKinsey surveyed claimed to have even basic knowledge of average wages or the prevalence of job opportunities in their chosen field . 
Little wonder , then , that half of them were not convinced that their post-secondary studies had improved their employment opportunities . 
Students must take ownership of their education . 
Before enrolling in an academic or vocational program , prospective students should research job-placement rates and learn how and how often the institution interacts with employers . 
Furthermore , they should gain a comprehensive understanding of how they can build and demonstrate applied skills in their chosen field . 
More generally , they should use existing labor-market data to make better-informed choices . 
If the world continues on its current course , labor-market imbalances will worsen significantly in the coming years . 
Indeed , the world faces a potential shortage of 30-40 million college-educated workers in 2020 , and a potential surplus of 95 million low-skilled workers . 
The economic benefits of rebalancing the global labor market are compelling ; the human costs of failing to do so are enormous . 
The imperative for businesses , educators , governments , and young people to take action could not be stronger .
