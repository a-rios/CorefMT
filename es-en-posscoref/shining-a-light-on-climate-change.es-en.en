Shining a Light on Climate Change 
NEW YORK - A light bulb may not be the first thing that springs to mind when thinking about revolutionary technology . Yet science and smart policy have the potential in today &apos;s world to transform an ordinary household object into a revolutionary innovation . 
Recently , I visited an ambitious project to promote energy-saving lighting in China . By phasing out old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs and introducing a new generation of lighting , China expects to cut national energy consumption by 8 % . 
This can have a profound global impact . Consider this : lighting accounts for 19 % of world energy consumption . 
Scientists say we can reduce that by a third or more merely by changing light bulbs . 
A breakthrough like this highlights one of the many ways in which ordinary people and businesses can reduce energy use and cut greenhouse gases . 
It underscores the essential role that governments can - and must - play in promoting the green economy . And it highlights the special responsibility of the government of China to lead in the global fight against climate change . 
China is one of the world &apos;s fast-growing economies . 
Last year it also became the leading emitter of greenhouse gases . 
It is clearly important for the world that China pursues 
The key is giving a priority to clean energy , which can create new jobs , spur innovation , and usher in a new era of global prosperity . 
Those who embark on this path early will reap rewards . They will be winners in the global marketplace . 
And assuming that prosperity is shared equitably , they will also strengthen stability at home . 
There can be no argument that China today is a global power . 
Without China , there can be no success this year on a new global climate framework . 
On September 22nd , I will convene a summit of world leaders to look at the challenges - and the opportunities - we face in the run-up to Copenhagen . 
At the G8 summit in Italy this summer , it was agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 80 % by 2050 . 
I applauded this . But I also said that was not enough . 
To be credible , we need to match ambitious long-term goals with ambitious mid-term targets , with clear baselines . I will repeat this call in September . 
I will also emphasize that major developing economies have a critical role in the negotiations : Brazil , India , Mexico , South Africa and , perhaps most important of all , China . 
Already China has devoted a sizable portion of its national stimulus spending to renewable energy and green economic growth . It has become a world leader in wind and solar technology . 
China &apos;s dynamic renewable energy sector is worth nearly $ 17 billion and employs close to 1 million workers . 
This is impressive , but it is just a beginning . 
China , for example , has enough wind resources to generate more electricity than it currently uses . 
Imagine the potential . 
Imagine if , thanks to wind and solar , China could wean itself from coal , which accounts for 85 % of its carbon emissions . 
And if China were to do it , so could much of the rest of the world . 
In so doing , China can serve as a model not only for developing nations , but for the whole world . 
We must also adapt to those climate impacts that are already wreaking havoc on communities , particularly in the least developed countries . 
Adaptation programs help strengthen climate resilience . 
Going forward , they should be part of how we do development differently . Mitigation and adaptation are equal partners : one without the other makes no sense . 
They must be priorities for every government . 
If we have learned anything from the crises of the past year , it is that our fates are interrelated . As Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier this year , &quot; Issues such as climate change bear on the very survival of mankind . No country can be insulated from these challenges or meet them on its own . The international community should intensify cooperation and respond together . &quot; 
As we move toward Copenhagen , I urge China to exercise still further the global responsibilities that come with global power . 
I ask China to act in the global public interest , as well as its national interest . 
For at the end of the day , as Premier Wen aptly put it , they are one and the same . 
By changing a light bulb , and changing our mindset , we can change the world .
