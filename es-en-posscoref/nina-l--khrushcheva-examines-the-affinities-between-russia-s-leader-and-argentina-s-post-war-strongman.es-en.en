Putin the Perónist 
MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin has been compared to many strongmen of the past - Joseph Stalin , Leonid Brezhnev , and Chile &apos;s Augusto Pinochet , to name a few . 
But , after nearly 14 years in power , perhaps the best comparison now may be a transgender cross between the former Argentine leader Juan Perón and his legendary wife , Eva ( &quot; Evita &quot; ) . 
In the early 1940 &quot; s , Colonel Perón , as Minister of Labor and Secretary of War , was a &quot; gray cardinal &quot; to Argentina &apos;s rulers . 
Before communism collapsed in 1989 , Colonel Putin , also memorably gray , was a devoted KGB operative , entrusted with spreading disinformation and recruiting Soviet and foreign agents in East Germany . 
At the labor ministry , Perón initiated social reforms , including welfare benefits for the poor . 
Although his motivation , at least in part , may have been a desire for social justice , Perón was , in effect , bribing the beneficiaries to support his own rise to power and wealth . 
With his beautiful and outspoken wife - a &quot; woman of the people &quot; - at his side , Perón was able to persuade voters in 1946 that , as President , he would fundamentally change the country . 
He was as good as his word . 
Perón &apos;s government nationalized banks and railroads , increased the minimum wage and improved living standards , reduced the national debt ( for a while at least ) , and revived the economy . 
Argentina became less reliant on foreign trade , though the move toward autarky eventually undermined growth , causing the country to lose its position among the world &apos;s richest . 
During this period , Perón also undermined freedom of speech , fair elections , and other essential aspects of democracy . 
He and his emotional wife spoke publicly against bourgeois injustices and luxury , while secretly amassing a private fortune . 
Finally , Perón was ousted in 1955 , three years after the death of Evita , his greatest propagandist . 
Like Perón a half-century before , Putin promised in 2000 to tame the unbridled capitalism that had run wild under his predecessor , Boris Yeltsin . 
He pledged to restore a sense of dignity to a country that had just lost its empire and suffered a severe economic contraction during the early years of the post-communist transition . 
Putin renationalized , or rather brought under Kremlin control , the oil , gas , and other industries that had been privatized in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Buoyed by high world energy prices , he was able to pay the back wages and pensions that Yeltsin &apos;s cash-strapped government still owed to miners , railroad workers , and teachers . 
As with Perón , citizens were bribed into backing the regime . 
But , with oil and gas revenues flowing into state coffers , Putin started to fill his own pockets . 
His personal wealth - including palaces , yachts , watches , and cars - has been estimated at $ 40-70 billion . 
Although he insists that his riches consist not of money and assets , but of the trust of his people , few Russians doubt that he is one of the world &apos;s wealthiest men . 
As with Perón &apos;s presidency , Putin &apos;s began well . 
The public adored the new strongman as he flexed Russia &apos;s political muscle abroad , punished the &quot; dishonest &quot; Yeltsin-era oligarchs , restricted the &quot; irresponsible &quot; media , and re-centralized power . 
Until recently , Putin &apos;s resemblance to Evita was not so obvious ( though his regular Botox treatments have given him the look that she took on after she was embalmed ) . 
But the similarities are becoming increasingly evident . 
Her passionate &quot; messages for the suffering &quot; resonated with Argentina &apos;s poor in the way that Putin &apos;s macho swagger appeals to a majority of Russians , mostly from the country &apos;s hinterland and provincial cities . 
Evita and Putin also share a streak of pettiness . 
Evita ruined the life of anyone who appeared to doubt her image as Argentina &apos;s &quot; godmother . &quot; 
Putin takes revenge on anyone - whether the oligarch-cum-political prisoner Mikhail Khodorkovsky , members of the rock band Pussy Riot , or ordinary citizens joining anti-Kremlin protests - who challenges his status as &quot; father of the nation . &quot; 
Perhaps not coincidentally , capital flight is on the rise , and around 300,000 Russians - including many of the best educated - leave the country every year . 
Now Ukraine , where President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s decision not to sign an association agreement with the European Union has mobilized millions of protesters , represents Russia &apos;s moment of truth . 
While many cheer the &quot; Euromaidan , &quot; many others insist that Ukraine must maintain close ties with Russia . 
Putin , who played the role of puppeteer in Yanukovych &apos;s decision to keep his country within the Russian orbit , hypocritically blames external forces for Ukraine &apos;s political crisis . 
Yet the more the world mocks Putin &apos;s exhibitionism , the more support he gains from Russians yearning for a return to superpower status . 
Likewise , when Evita was dying of cancer , graffiti appeared all over Buenos Aires , declaring , &quot; Long Live Cancer ! &quot; 
But many continued to idolize her for helping the poor , regardless of how self-serving she had become . 
The same strange brew of mockery and adoration characterizes Russia &apos;s Putin era as well . 
Perón &apos;s final years may offer a worrying parallel . 
He returned to power in 1973 , 18 years after his ouster , bringing back Evita &apos;s embalmed body for Argentines to adore once more . 
He died the following year , leaving the government in the hands of his third wife , Isabel , whose mismanagement of the economy incited guerrilla violence and a military coup within two years . 
Yet today , according to the Latin America scholar Michael Cohen , &quot; most of Argentine society is Perónist .... Perón delivered a welfare state from which the current middle class benefits . &quot; 
Similarly , the majority of Russians approve of Putin &apos;s version of state capitalism , and many appreciate his largesse . 
I once believed that Putin &apos;s demise might resemble the sudden and bloody fall of Lavrenti Beria , Stalin &apos;s all-powerful security chief , who was finished off by the arbitrary system of justice that he helped to create . 
What now seems more likely , due to the dependence of a majority of Russians on state handouts , is that when Russia &apos;s leader finally leaves the stage , Putinism , like Perónism , will survive , with a bizarre half-life lasting decades .
