MH370 &quot; s Beacon of Hope 
MELBOURNE - The harrowing mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard , may be at least partly resolved within a matter of days . 
Underwater search vehicles are homing in on an area just a few kilometers wide in the vastness of the southern Indian Ocean , some 2,000 kilometers northwest of Perth . 
This is where the Boeing 777-200 is likely to have run out of fuel and crashed , according to the analysis by the UK company Inmarsat and British aviation experts of hourly signals sent automatically from the aircraft to Inmarsat &apos;s orbiting space vehicle . 
More promising still , it is where signals , assumed to have come from the locator beacons attached to the aircraft &apos;s &quot; black box &quot; flight recorders , were picked up on April 5 and over the following days by an American &quot; pinger locator &quot; being towed by an Australian navy vessel , the Ocean Shield . 
The Australian defense authorities now coordinating the search still say that to discover wreckage probably lying 4.5 kilometers ( 2.8 miles ) deep , on so remote a seabed , will be like &quot; finding a needle in a haystack . &quot; 
And any subsequent recovery operation will obviously still be a huge challenge . 
But officials are confident that they have at least found the haystack . 
During the early days of the search , almost everything that could go wrong did - from overlooked or misunderstood data to poor communication and uncoordinated and misallocated resources - as attention remained focused on the aircraft &apos;s scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . 
And there were huge frustrations even when the search shifted to the Indian Ocean , as massive naval and air resources failed to find any trace of relevant surface debris . 
But , whatever the past frustrations , and possibly even bigger disappointments yet to come , the bigger and much more significant story of the search for MH370 is what has gone right . 
Simply put , it has been a magnificent demonstration of how response to human tragedy can unite rather than divide , reinforcing the impulse to cooperate rather than confront . 
And it has testified to the good sense of those who have been arguing for years , in a variety of Asian and wider global contexts , that maritime search , rescue , and disaster relief is an ideal place to start in creating confidence building mechanisms aimed at laying the foundations for conflict prevention and resolution . 
The search has involved unprecedented international cooperation , first in the South China Sea and then in the Indian Ocean , from a total of 26 countries . 
What is extraordinary is that many of these countries ( like China , Japan , the Philippines , Malaysia , South Korea , and Vietnam ) have been at one another &apos;s throats over territorial and other disputes , while others ( not least China and the US ) are abidingly suspicious of each other &apos;s geopolitical motives and intentions . 
Australia &apos;s close cooperation throughout the search with China - whose citizens comprised nearly two-thirds of those aboard the ill-fated flight , and whose naval and air resources have been unceasingly devoted to the common effort - has borne immediate fruit : a highly successful visit earlier this month by Prime Minister Tony Abbott . 
An important trade deal advanced , and no issue was made of the new Abbott government &apos;s embarrassingly fulsome embrace of US leadership in the region , and its rookie mistake in describing Japan as &quot; our best friend in Asia &quot; ( the right formula in these cases being &quot; We have no better friend than ... &quot; ) . 
It &apos;s a reach , but tempting , to suggest that Australia &apos;s long-term security might even be better guaranteed by spending a few million dollars on towed pinger locators and unmanned Bluefin-21 mini-submarines , with their sonars and cameras , and some serious naval infrastructure to support them , rather than the $ 20-40 billion currently being contemplated to renew and extend Australia &apos;s aging combat-submarine fleet . 
It is not quite as naive as it may seem to think that the peace and security of the whole Indo-Pacific region , not to mention other equally volatile parts of the world , might be better advanced by devoting far more resources and effort to common security strategies rather than traditional military ones . 
Finding security with others , rather than against them , and concentrating on cooperative approaches to achieving global and regional public goods , seems more productive than giving free rein to crude nationalist sentiment and planning ever more sophisticated and expensive ways to destroy one another . 
The search for MH370 has shown in microcosm how much there is to be gained through peaceful cooperation . 
It should also help focus our attention on just how much there is to be lost in today &apos;s world - a world that is far more interdependent than the one that exploded in 1914 - if we fail to apply these lessons to our broader international relationships . 
The world is a much safer and saner place when states search for and find common ground on which to work together .
