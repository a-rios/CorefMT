The Global Innovation Revolution 
BERKELEY - As countries around the world struggle to lay the foundations for stronger sustainable growth in the future , they would do well to focus on policies that encourage innovation . 
Empirical studies across time and countries confirm that innovation is the primary source of technological change and productivity growth . 
And investments in research and development , as well as in the scientific and engineering workforce on which they depend , are critical drivers of innovation and national competitiveness . 
A new study by the National Science Board , the governing body of the National Science Foundation in the United States , examines trends in such investments for both individual countries and regions . 
These trends indicate that the global landscape for innovation changed significantly during the last decade . 
That landscape is likely to change further as several Asian economies , particularly China and South Korea , increase their investments in R D and scientific and engineering education to secure their place as significant hubs of innovation . 
At the same time , crushing debt burdens may compel the US , Europe , and Japan to reduce their investments in these areas . 
The US remains the global leader in R D investment , spending an estimated $ 400 billion in 2009 - a total boosted by President Barack Obama &apos;s stimulus package , and higher than China , Japan , and Germany combined . 
But , in terms of R D spending as a share of GDP , the US ranked only eighth in 2009 ( at 2.9 % of GDP ) . 
The US share remained above the OECD average , but this was mainly the result of national differences in the amount of R D defense spending . 
Indeed , defense accounted for 52 % of US R D in 2009 , and for more than 50 % during the last 25 years . 
The defense share of R D in the European Union and Japan has been and remains markedly lower - less than 10 % in the EU and less than 5 % in Japan in 2009 ( no comparable data are available for China and South Korea ) . 
Over the next decade , sizeable cuts in defense spending as part of overall deficit reduction could mean a significant reduction in R D investment in the US . 
Between 1999 and 2009 , global R D spending grew at an average annual rate of 7 % , accelerating to 8 % during the last five years , despite the global recession . 
During the entire period , R D spending grew significantly faster than global output , reflecting both increasing government support and a rising share of technology-intensive industries in global production and trade . 
But these aggregate figures obscure differences among countries and regions . 
Over the decade , the US share of global R D fell from 38 % to 31 % , the EU share fell from 27 % to 23 % , and Asia &apos;s share rose from 24 % to 32 % . 
Within Asia , R D spending in China grew at an astounding 20 % annual pace - twice the country &apos;s GDP growth rate - and by 2009 China had surpassed Japan to become the world &apos;s second-largest investor in R D. Spending on R D also grew rapidly - about 10 % annually - in South Korea . 
By contrast , R D spending grew by 4 % in Japan , 5 % in the US , and roughly 6 % in Europe . 
Throughout the world , the business sector remains both the predominant performer and the predominant funder of R D investment . 
In 2009 , business accounted for 75 % of R D funding in Japan , 73 % in South Korea , 72 % in China , 67 % in Germany , and 60 % in the US , whose companies are the largest R D investors in terms of absolute purchasing power , spending more than twice as much as Japanese businesses . 
But business investment as a share of GDP has changed very little in the US over the last decade , while it has risen rapidly in many other countries , including China , Singapore , South Korea , and Israel . 
Global multinational companies are the largest business-sector R D investors in the US and other countries . 
For example , multinational companies , whether headquartered in the US or elsewhere , accounted for about 84 % of private ( non-bank ) R D investment in the US in 2009 , about the same as a decade earlier . 
And US multinationals still locate about 84 % of their R D activities in the US , often in innovation clusters around research universities . 
But this share has declined during the last decade , as US multinationals have shifted some of their R D from the US and Europe to Asia in response to rapidly growing markets , ample scientific and engineering talent , and generous subsidies . 
Global competition for multinational companies &quot; R D activity , and for the local benefits that it brings , is likely to intensify in the future , with many countries already offering sizeable tax credits and extended tax holidays . 
The Asian economies have been particularly aggressive in the use of such incentives . 
And , recognizing that the availability of a workforce with the necessary skills is a key determinant of where businesses locate their R D activities , many countries are increasing their investments in tertiary education and training in science , engineering , and technology . 
Engineering accounts for only 4 % of all bachelor &apos;s degrees in the US , compared to 19 % in Asia - which now accounts for half of all engineering degrees being awarded - and 33 % in China . 
Many countries are also changing their immigration laws to make it easier to attract highly skilled workers , especially scientists and engineers , who are increasingly mobile . 
Meanwhile , immigration policies in the US and Europe are making it more difficult to attract and retain such workers , compelling companies to shift R D abroad to find the talent that they need . 
As a result of these changes , the global landscape for innovation has been transformed over the last decade . 
Ours is now a world in which many emerging-market countries have made advancement in science and technology a top priority , and in which multinational companies &quot; R D investments have become much more mobile . 
As the US and other developed countries embark on austerity plans to contain their debt , they must heed these changes in the innovation landscape and boost their investments in R D - and in science and engineering education - even as they make painful cuts elsewhere .
