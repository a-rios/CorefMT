The Drug Industry &apos;s Poison Pills 
BOSTON - One does not need to spend a lifetime in the global health-care sector to appreciate that substandard or counterfeit drugs are a major public-health hazard . 
These bogus products have infiltrated pharmaceutical supply chains from Azerbaijan to Zambia , wrecking the most promising programs to control , manage , and eradicate deadly diseases . 
Yet little is being done to stop this criminal activity . 
Growing up in Pakistan , I realized how vital it was for my mother , like any educated parent , to know which drugs and pharmacies could be trusted . 
Little has changed since then . 
Local pharmacists from Lahore to Lusaka continue to sell a variety of brands of the same drug at different prices ; and shopkeepers are called upon to give a candid opinion of their benefits and shortcomings . 
Unfortunately , the problem runs a lot deeper than a few bad drugs sold at the corner pharmacy . 
Around $ 75 billion of substandard drugs are sold annually , causing an estimated 100,000 deaths worldwide , and making many more people seriously ill . 
The trade in inferior drugs also undermines fragile public-health systems in poor countries . 
Yet the fight against substandard drugs has never been taken as seriously as other global health crises such as malaria , HIV , or maternal and infant mortality . 
This may be because there is no obvious solution . 
But , in seeking answers , we must first acknowledge that the issue is larger than just counterfeit medicines . 
Many legitimate manufacturers worldwide , whether through complacency or incompetence , lack adequate quality controls . 
In some cases , deficient storage and refrigeration systems turn safe medicines into dangerous substances . 
Unfortunately , those drug makers then take advantage of developing countries &quot; weak or poorly implemented legislation and corrupt officials to pass their products through local supply chains and into shops . 
Public ignorance or apathy means that those responsible are able to avoid prosecution . 
The technical expertise and equipment needed to detect inferior products is usually beyond the financial reach of many developing countries . 
One approach , for example , would be to include on packaging a &quot; scratch code &quot; that includes a phone number for consumers to call in order to check that the batch number matches an authentic product . 
But , while this approach would certainly help to catch counterfeits , it would miss the substandard or degraded products made by legitimate firms , which are tested only by the consumer - and often at great cost in terms of health risks . 
It is therefore imperative to develop new detection technologies that will work in poorer countries , and that complement existing systems such as bar codes . 
Detection technology must be capable of analyzing all forms of a drug - whether powder , pill , capsule , or syrup - and of detecting several different grades of quality , not just the junk . 
It must be simple , affordable , adaptable , and scalable ; and it must work at all stages of distribution , whether at customs , in hospitals , or in remote villages . 
But technology alone will not be enough . 
Regulators , hospitals , and drug-safety authorities must take the lead , rather than placing the burden on often poor and uneducated citizens who are struggling to care for loved ones . 
The search for new , sustainable solutions , requires at least three initiatives . 
First , we must encourage innovation by offering research grants to support small initiatives or large-scale projects ( like campaigns to fight HIV , malaria , and maternal mortality ) . 
Ideally , an international group would coordinate and develop all of the ideas and products , and take them from the laboratory to the field . 
Second , we need to harness the creativity and commitment of young students , so that they understand the devastating impact of bad pharmaceuticals and become motivated to make a difference in people &apos;s lives . 
Third , we must make use of the media . 
Just as the world cries foul when an illegal shipment of ivory is uncovered , we must launch campaigns in the press , on television , and online to bring to account any trader , state official , or company caught selling or promoting low-quality drugs . 
In this way , we will remind those in the industry of a fundamental premise : their most precious commodity is not a blockbuster drug , but the public &apos;s trust . 
If drug makers and pharmacists cannot protect their customers &quot; health , they cannot protect their business .
