The Conflicted Bank of England 
OXFORD - Andrew Sentance , an outgoing member of the Bank of England &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee , has outlined a credibility-challenging scenario for the BOE . 
There are two contradictory forces that could keep inflation significantly above its 2 % target not only this year and next year , but even in 2013 . 
The dilemma is that any depreciation of sterling increases the level of imported inflation that is not offset by spare capacity in the economy . 
In other words , the United Kingdom has spare capacity - output fell by 6.4 % during the recession and has not fully recovered - but not enough of it . 
Thus , inflation has been above the BOE &apos;s target throughout the recovery from the financial crisis of 2008 . 
And , according to Sentance , it could stay above that target for the BOE &apos;s two-year medium-term forecast window . 
Indeed , the British government is counting on that . 
Its new Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts trade contributing as much as consumption to GDP growth in the coming years . 
Of course , that means closing the current account deficit , which has been about 1-3 % of GDP , and that , in turn , implies further weakening of sterling . 
Obviously , sterling can &apos;t appreciate and depreciate simultaneously . 
Theoretically , sterling could stay at the current rate of about $ 1.60 and improve the trade position if the increased volume of cheaper exports outweighed the value of more expensive imports - the so-called J-curve effect . 
In that case , the trade balance would improve over time , following an initial deterioration . 
Another problem is that British exports ( particularly services ) compete on quality rather than price . 
In other words , demand for imports and exports is not very price-elastic , and there is only limited scope for substituting domestically produced alternatives . 
So far , the trade deficit has improved ; but , with sterling down roughly 25 % on a trade-weighted basis for four years , the upward part of the J seems a little distant . 
Moreover , there is another dilemma : the output gap . 
Britain has recovered only one-third of its output lost from a deep recession . 
With the economy growing by only 1.5 % last year and unemployment at 7.8 % ( not far off a 17-year high ) , there should be idle factors of production ready to be put to work . 
But what if the economy &apos;s potential output has been damaged ? 
What if , as has happened in other financial crises , output growth remains sluggish for several years as the banks rebuild their balance sheets and de-leveraging takes place slowly ? 
In that case , the UK might no longer grow at 2.75 % annually , but say at closer to 2 % . 
If so , there is a smaller output gap : a lower level of potential output consistent with higher unemployment means that growth will be accompanied by inflation . 
Of course , the output gap is difficult to compute . 
On the other hand , annual wage growth of only 2 % means that there are still only minimal second-order effects even after 16 months of above-target inflation . 
The majority is voting to keep rates unchanged . 
But , there are two votes for a 0.25 % rate rise , one vote for a 0.50 % rate rise , and even one vote for more quantitative easing . 
This unusual four-way split on its nine-member MPC reflects differences in how the contradictory influences on price stability are assessed . 
Moreover , with a quarter of the economy contracting ( or stagnating when weather effects are discounted ) , it is not hard to see why the MPC &apos;s members cannot agree . 
But the BOE &apos;s inaction - even as the ECB raised interest rates in order to begin to normalize monetary policy - could send the wrong signal , according to Sentance .
