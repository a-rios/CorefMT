Ukraine &apos;s Own Goal 
KYIV - Politics and sports are often an incendiary mix , as the controversy now swirling around the Euro 2012 football championship , to be co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland , demonstrates . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso , and other European Union leaders have said that they will boycott matches held in Ukraine , owing to the imprisonment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and other opposition figures . 
Why , two decades after communism ended and Ukraine gained its independence , does the country remain mired in economic torpor and an authoritarian politics that has aroused such ire in Europe ? 
When a country like Ukraine develops slowly and remains poor , it is not because of natural disaster or resource constraints . 
Bad policies pursued by bad governments are to blame . 
Contrary to what many Western economists think , the worst economic breakdowns are not the result of free markets gone haywire , but of excessive concentration of political power . 
To insure against the worst human and economic catastrophes , limits to political power must be introduced and a system of checks and balances maintained . 
Witness the divergence in long-run economic growth between the Euro 2012 co-hosts . 
Poland &apos;s GDP has almost doubled over the last 20 years , while Ukraine is still barely maintaining the output level recorded during the last year of socialism . 
Generally speaking , Central and Eastern European countries have performed better economically than the ex-Soviet countries ( with the exception of the Baltic states ) . 
Economic growth is a matter not just of quality of life , but of quantity as well . 
Child mortality rates have declined in all Central European countries over the past 20 years , especially in Poland , where the rate fell from 17 per 10,000 live births to seven . 
In the Czech Republic and Slovenia , life expectancy has increased from 71 to 77 , similar to other Central European countries . 
In Ukraine , by contrast , under-five child mortality rates have fallen only slightly , from 25 per 10,000 live births to 24 , while life expectancy has declined from 70 years to 68 . 
The same stagnation applies to Russia . 
The post-communist record shows that the countries that reformed most successfully are also the most democratic - indeed , as democratic as any in the West . 
The worst economic outcomes in the region are found in countries that have diverged from democracy . 
Democracy is not a panacea , but non-democratic regimes usually pursue worse economic polices than democratic governments do . 
The former engage in predatory and unpredictable regulation , which produces a bad business environment . 
Another danger is heavy taxation . 
Official taxes are high when spending is high . 
When spending is high , it is usually social spending that is badly targeted , which means that only a small share of poor people really benefit . 
Moreover , corruption payments should be added to official taxation . 
It may turn out that most businesses are hit by heavy taxation of both varieties - so heavy that the economy cannot grow , as appears to be the case in Ukraine . 
Furthermore , uneven protection of property rights - crony capitalism - means that a small number of businessmen are politically favored . 
They may pay lower taxes , or their competitors may be subject to raids by the authorities . 
Because the state uses its apparatus to deter competition - both informally , through arbitrary enforcement of property rights , and formally , through trade restrictions - crony capitalism is not only unjust , but also inefficient . 
Individual businessmen may succeed , but the economy will not . 
Without competition , capitalism works only a little better than socialism did . 
A key ingredient of Poland &apos;s success in the last 20 years was a clear separation , from the very beginning of the post-communist transition , between politics and business . 
There were uniform rules and equal protection for everyone . 
Poland introduced massive competition by dismantling monopolies and opening its economy to the world . 
Moreover , Poland avoided extreme booms and the deep recessions that follow . 
Most booms are produced by bad monetary and fiscal policies . 
This is true of the recent boom-bust sequence in Spain , Ireland , the United States , the United Kingdom , Bulgaria , and the Baltics , among others . 
In Ukraine , too , a huge boom in 2004-2007 was followed by a contraction amounting to almost 15 % GDP in 2009 - a direct result of domestic policies . 
Ukraine &apos;s record over the past 20 years demonstrates that it is not enough to abolish socialism . 
The real challenge is to build free-market , rule-based capitalism . 
Ukraine &apos;s citizens can become more like their Central European neighbors , or they can allow the economy &apos;s many distortions from past bad policies to persist , in which case they will fall further behind .
