China &apos;s Monetary-Policy Choice 
SHANGHAI - China &apos;s economy has followed a remarkable course in recent years : from record-breaking powerhouse to major global risk , at least in the eyes of some . 
Indeed , with GDP growth this year almost certain not to reach the authorities &quot; 7 % target , the world is now watching closely for signs of crisis and a much sharper slowdown . 
How did China get here , and can it put its economic growth back on track ? 
China &apos;s growth has been unsustainable for a while . 
A stimulus package of less-than-prudent fixed-asset investment , adopted in response to the 2008 global financial crisis , sustained 9 % GDP growth for two years . 
But , after 2011 , stimulus turned to macroeconomic tightening , causing investment growth to plummet from a nominal rate of over 30 % to about 10 % recently . 
This prevents full utilization of production capacity and resources , and explains why GDP growth above 7 % is simply not possible . 
Excess capacity and falling growth are mutually reinforcing . 
Not only does excess capacity have a negative impact on growth ; perhaps more important , sharply declining growth also contributes to massive redundancy in some industries ( especially resources and the heavy and chemical industries ) . 
The question is why growth continues to slow . 
One popular line of thinking focuses on long-term structural factors , such as demographic transition . 
A more convincing answer lies in China &apos;s monetary-policy stance . 
Since assuming office in 2013 , Premier Li Keqiang &apos;s government has chosen not to loosen the previous government &apos;s rigorous macro policies , instead hoping that the resulting pressure on existing industries might help to stimulate the authorities &quot; sought-after structural shift toward household consumption and services . 
Economists welcomed this ostensibly reasonable approach , which would slow the expansion of credit that had enabled a massive debt build-up in 2008-2010 . 
China &apos;s lower growth trajectory was dubbed the &quot; new normal . &quot; 
But , for this approach to work , GDP growth would have had to remain steady , rather than decline sharply . 
Indeed , although structural adjustment continues in China , the economy is facing an increasingly serious contraction in demand and continued deflation . 
The consumer price index ( CPI ) has remained below 2 % , and the producer price index ( PPI ) has been negative , for 44 months . 
In a country with a huge amount of liquidity - M2 ( a common measure of the money supply ) amounts to double China &apos;s GDP - and still-rising borrowing costs , this makes little sense . 
The problem is that the government has maintained a PPI-adjusted benchmark interest rate that exceeds 11 % . 
Interest rates reach a ludicrous 20 % in the shadow banking sector , and run even higher for some private lending . 
The result is excessively high financing costs , which have made it impossible for firms in many manufacturing industries to maintain marginal profitability . 
Moreover , the closure of local-government financing platforms , together with the credit ceiling imposed by the central government , has caused local capital spending on investment in infrastructure to drop to a historic low . 
With local governments and companies struggling to make interest payments , they are forced into a vicious cycle , borrowing from the shadow banking sector to meet their obligations , thereby raising the risk-free interest rate further . 
If excessively high real interest rates are undermining the domestic demand that China needs to reverse the economic slowdown , one naturally wonders why the government does not take steps to lower them . 
The apparent answer is the government &apos;s overriding commitment to shifting the economy away from investment- and export-led growth . 
But it is doubtful that China can achieve the consumption-driven rebalancing that it seeks . 
After all , no high-performing East Asian economy has achieved such a rebalancing in the past , and China has a similar growth model . 
Given this , China &apos;s current deflation should motivate its policymakers to pursue monetary easing , reducing real interest rates to a much lower level , even zero . 
Such a move - for which China has plenty of room - would not only enable the reduction of existing debt burdens ; perhaps more important , it would also allow for the rollover of debt as the economy accelerates . 
Indeed , because most bank loans in China - unlike , say , in Europe - are now locked up in infrastructure and other physical assets , boosting demand is preferable to deleveraging . 
The key is to lower interest rates enough to mitigate the financial risks of high leverage and enable the restructuring of local-government debts . 
Lower borrowing costs would also boost China &apos;s capital market , which is critical to provide equity financing to innovative small and medium-size businesses . 
Of course , China needs to continue debt write-offs and swaps , and it must remain on the path of gradual structural reform . 
Monetary loosening is vital to prevent growth from slowing further , and thus to ensure economic stability at home and maintain the momentum of recovery worldwide .
