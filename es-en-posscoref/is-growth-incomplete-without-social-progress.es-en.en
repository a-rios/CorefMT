Is Growth Incomplete without Social Progress ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - The geography of poverty and social deprivation has changed dramatically over the last two decades . 
More than 70 % of the world &apos;s poor now live in middle-income countries . 
This pattern , likely to continue into the next decade , raises important questions . 
Have poverty reduction and human development kept up with income growth ? 
Is growth incomplete without social progress and gender-inclusiveness ? 
Consider South Asia , where the poverty rate fell from 60 % in 1981 to 40 % in 2005 - not fast enough , given population growth , to reduce the total number of poor people . 
In fact , the number of poor people ( defined as those living on less than $ 1.25 per capita per day at 2005 purchasing power parity ) in South Asia increased from 549 million in 1981 to 595 million in 2005 , and from 420 million to 455 million in India , where almost three-quarters of the region &apos;s poor reside . 
In other words , while South Asia &apos;s economies have not underperformed on poverty reduction , merely matching global trends may not be enough for the region with the world &apos;s largest concentration of poor people . 
India has experienced slower income growth than has China , which partly explains its higher poverty rate . 
But a country &apos;s poverty rate also depends on the degree of income inequality - a reduction in which makes growth more pro-poor - and inequality in China has , in fact , increased more rapidly than in India . 
So a rising tide really can lift all boats , with growth trumping inequality when it comes to poverty reduction . 
Moreover , income growth has contributed to improved education . 
Adult literacy rates in South Asia match the global norm . 
But education outcomes lag behind when it comes to secondary and tertiary education , which are becoming increasingly necessary to thrive in today &apos;s world . 
Nor have health indicators kept up with income growth . 
South Asia has the world &apos;s highest rates of malnutrition and the largest number of undernourished children , who have higher mortality rates , lower cognitive performance , and a greater likelihood of dropping out of school . 
More than 200,000 people in India die annually from malaria , mainly in poor regions . 
And , while much of the existing international health-care assistance is focused on sub-Saharan Africa , India , along with Bangladesh , Bhutan , Nepal , Pakistan , and Sri Lanka , are just as devastated by neglected tropical diseases . 
Indeed , India alone accounts for one-quarter of intestinal worm infections worldwide and more than one-half of all cases of elephantiasis , leprosy , and visceral leishmaniasis . 
Over the last 50 years , the most striking forms of inequality , including discrimination against women in access to education , health , employment , political participation , and household resources , have been largely reversed . 
But dramatic gender inequities persist in South Asia , more so than in other low-income countries . 
Although gender parity in primary education has improved , dropout rates for girls are higher than for boys . 
The dowry tradition puts pressure on girls &quot; families to marry them early , leading to a preference for sons - and thus to sex-specific abortions targeting female fetuses . 
Legislation , courts , and law-enforcement mechanisms have failed to address the high incidence of violence against women . 
Death rates for young girls are much higher than for boys . 
These indicators are symptomatic of a general pattern of discrimination . 
The expectation that girls will grow up to do little other than serve their husbands reduces parents &quot; incentives to invest in their daughters &quot; education . 
Uneducated women then have few alternatives , and the expectation becomes self-fulfilling , leaving women in a continuous cycle of powerlessness that has had significant adverse long-term effects . 
In 2008 , India &apos;s female labor-force participation rate averaged 35 % , while low-income countries averaged 58 % . 
Moreover , a large proportion of women in the region are employed in the informal sector . 
The paradox of South Asia is that growth has been instrumental in reducing poverty and improving social outcomes , but poverty rates and social outcomes have not improved fast enough to reduce the total number of people living in misery . 
As a result , policymakers should begin to consider direct policy interventions to accelerate social progress , with a particular focus on human development and gender inclusiveness . 
In today &apos;s uncertain world , social turmoil , gender deprivation , and rising conflict have tested countries &quot; abilities to create jobs , promote gender equity , equip young people with skills , and design effective social protection programs . 
Tackling these challenges requires a clear understanding of how economic opportunities can be broadened to ensure faster poverty reduction , promote human development , and stimulate gender-inclusive growth . 
Greater gender equality can contribute to economic growth and development , and major initiatives to increase opportunities for women can transform society . 
If more girls had gone to school a generation ago , millions of infant deaths could have been averted each year , and tens of millions of families could have been more educated , healthier , and happier . 
Deeper social disparities should never be viewed as the inevitable price of rapid growth , and more egalitarian outcomes in education , health , and gender should not be considered &quot; second-stage &quot; reforms . 
A development strategy that promotes growth first , and only then deals with human misery , is not sustainable . 
Policies designed to make redistribution more efficient need not hamper growth itself .
