Dreaming of a New Edo Era 
SEOUL - In mid-November , all eyes will shift to Seoul , when G-20 leaders convene for the first time in the South Korean capital . 
The choice is long overdue , as South Korea is a remarkable success story : in one generation , the South Koreans , formerly pummeled by civil war , under constant threat from their Northern communist brethren , long mired in poverty , and ruled by military dictators for 40 years , have built the world &apos;s 13th largest economy and Asia &apos;s most vibrant democracy . 
Historically squeezed between its two giant neighbors , China and Japan , South Korea had long been perceived as an underdog with a fuzzy cultural identity . 
In Asia , however , Japan &apos;s leaders are not waiting for the Seoul summit to take a closer look at South Korea . 
South Korea was formerly a Japanese colony ( 1910-1945 ) , and the natives were treated like an inferior race . 
Today , South Korean &apos;s economy has been growing annually by 5 % on average for ten years , whereas Japan grew by 0.42 % per year during the same period . 
One could argue that South Korea is not yet a mature economy and is only catching up with a more advanced Japan . 
This was the case in the 1970 &quot; s , but no more . 
Whereas China &apos;s growth is fueled by low-cost labor as millions of peasants enter the industrial economy , this is not the South Korean recipe for success , which has been driven by private entrepreneurship , innovation , and quality products : Samsung and Hyundai , not cheap wages , are South Korea &apos;s growth engines . 
Another key to South Korea &apos;s success story is the well-balanced relationship between stable governments and the private sector . 
This was clearly demonstrated late last year when a South Korean consortium won a contract to build four nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates late last year , beating out the French . 
The Japanese knew how to coordinate state and private-sector goals in the 1970 &quot; s , but then lost their way . 
&quot; We should now emulate the South Koreans , &quot; says Eisuke Sakakibara , a leading Japanese economist , who was one of the architects of the Japanese &quot; miracle &quot; of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Japanese in search of a miracle now travel to Seoul . 
&quot; In Japan , 1990 to 2000 was called the &quot; lost decade , &quot; &quot; says the free-market economist Fumio Hayashi . 
Now Japan is completing its second lost decade . 
Hayashi and Sakakibara - indeed , most Japanese economists - more or less agree on the fundamental reason for such spectacular stagnation : the Japanese have stopped working hard . 
Fewer hours worked , longer vacations , and a declining population ( since 2005 ) have , predictably , undermined Japanese growth . 
To turn this situation around , says Sakakibara , &quot; the Japanese should work more , have more children , and allow immigration . &quot; 
But the incentives to make any of this happen are just not there . 
The Japanese still live comfortably , better by one-third than the South Koreans , thanks to their past investments . 
Japanese companies abroad remain profitable and Japan is still the global leader in high-tech niches like electronics or carbon fibers . 
For example , Apple &apos;s iPhone and Boeing &apos;s latest airplane rely heavily on Japanese-patented innovations . 
These comparative advantages may keep Japan above water for a while , but only until China or South Korea catch up . 
One would thus expect Japan to be anxiety-ridden , but it is not . 
True , new forms of poverty and unemployment are rising , but they remain well hidden behind family solidarity or corporate customs . 
Companies reduce their superfluous employees &quot; annual bonuses , but do not get rid of them . 
Young Japanese tend not to work before their 30 &quot; s , and married women stay at home . 
Political parties that rely on an aging constituency are not tempted to call for change . The sort of shaky short-term political coalitions that rule Japan nowadays prefer to buy time through so-called public stimulus , or to preserve inefficient companies with subsidies . 
Twenty years of such shortsighted policies , whatever the party in power , have fueled government debt , hindering private investment . 
More strikingly , stagnation has found its promoters in Japan itself . 
A leading public intellectual Naoki Inose , who is also Tokyo &apos;s vice governor , has declared that &quot; the era of growth is over . &quot; 
When Japan was threatened by Western imperialism , he says , the country had to open up ( in 1868 ) and modernize . 
This process has been completed . 
Japan is now ready to reconnect with its own tradition of social harmony and zero growth . 
Referring to the 1600-1868 period , Inose calls this future the New Edo era : &quot; a smaller population will enjoy the sufficient wealth that has been accumulated , and , from now on , it will invest its creativity in refining the culture . &quot; 
The first Edo collapsed when the United States Navy opened up the Japanese market with the arrival of Commodore Perry &apos;s &quot; black ships &quot; in 1853 . 
Will the second Edo be able to resist Chinese ambitions ? 
&quot; The New Edo era needs a strong Japanese army , &quot; admits Inose . 
This second Edo era may sound like a poetic utopia , but it has some influence : Sakakibara observes that Japanese students do not study abroad anymore , and that &quot; nobody learns English . &quot; 
At a time when South Koreans are becoming more globalized , learning English , and welcoming a growing number of immigrants , Japan is entering a &quot; de-globalization process . &quot; 
That is a worrying trend , and not only for Japan : South Korea can hardly stand alone as the lone Asian democracy . 
If the Japanese do not wake up from their Edo dream , Asia might very well become a Chinese empire . 
Will this be debated at the G-20 ? 
Not openly , but certainly in the corridors .
