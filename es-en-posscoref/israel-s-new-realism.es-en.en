Israel &apos;s New Realism 
Kadima &apos;s victory in Israel &apos;s elections is the country &apos;s most important political turning point in 30 years , if not longer . 
The new party - barely six months old - has realigned Israeli politics by transforming the entire framework of ideological assumptions underpinning the country &apos;s security strategy . 
Everyone knew that Kadima would win and form a coalition with the moderate left Labor party , which managed a respectable second-place finish . 
As a result , some Kadima voters stayed home , while other potential supporters voted for Labor to strengthen its hand in pushing social and economic issues in Kadima-led coalition . 
On the right , the Likud party , which Sharon abandoned to establish Kadima , did very poorly , partly because many conservative voters also deserted it for religious , immigrant , and other parties . 
In fact , a wide variety of small political groups , including three Jewish religious parties , Arab parties , and a pensioners &quot; party won seats . 
Since Kadima and Labor will not have a majority even as coalition partners , they will have to bring in some of these groups . 
But the importance of the distribution of seats pales in comparison to that of the longer-term changes in Israeli politics implied by Kadima &apos;s victory . 
Indeed , having attracted leading figures from both Labor and Likud , Kadima is now established as the most successful centrist party in Israel &apos;s history . 
With few political stars left in either Labour or Likud , Kadima may become the country &apos;s dominant party for many years to come . 
Ehud Olmert , the party &apos;s leader and now elected prime minister , has been a maverick of the center since his student days - a fitting symbol for the rapprochement of left and right . 
But the rapprochement itself is , of course , mainly the work of Ariel Sharon , whose influence is by no means diminished because he is in a coma . 
Kadima is built on Sharon &apos;s charisma and program , which reversed the most basic Israeli strategic thinking of the last half-century . 
For 30 years after the 1967 war , Israelis agreed on the need to keep control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip unless or until there was a comprehensive peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Arab states . 
From a security standpoint , the occupied territories constituted critical terrain for defending Israel against an attack on its borders by Arab states &quot; armies . 
Moreover , from a diplomatic standpoint , the territories were regarded as bargaining chips ( &quot; land for peace &quot; ) to be used in achieving a negotiated solution . 
The Oslo agreement in 1993 and the ensuing peace process embodied that expectation . 
The strategy ran aground in 2000 , when Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered to give up almost all the occupied territories and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace . 
The Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat turned him down flat and instead returned to a massive campaign of terrorism against Israel . 
The entire Israeli political spectrum was thrown into confusion . 
The left had maintained that Arafat would make a deal and honor it ; the right claimed that Arafat would make a deal and violate it . 
Everyone was wrong : there would be no deal to honor or violate . 
With the collapse of the strategy &apos;s most basic premises , what should Israel do ? 
Sharon formulated the answer in 2004 , concluding that Israel did not need the territories . 
They were no good as bargaining chips , because there was no one with whom to bargain . 
Nor could they be annexed to Israel , owing to the demographic problem implied by continued control over so many Palestinians . 
Finally , with the USSR gone and the United States the world &apos;s sole superpower , the geostrategic situation had changed entirely . 
Arab states , preoccupied with other issues in the post-Cold War era , were less interested in the conflict , while the security situation in the territories themselves had become a problem . 
Sharon &apos;s solution was unilateral withdrawal and the idea that Israel would decide on its own interim boundaries with a view to what it would claim if there was ever a negotiated agreement . 
Moreover , Sharon now agreed that a security fence , which historically was favored by the Israeli left , would enhance Israel &apos;s defenses . 
The country would then focus on domestic issues such as economic development , improving its public institutions , and raising living standards . 
This approach appealed to the vast majority of Israelis , regardless of their political loyalties , and the victory in January &apos;s Palestinian election by Hamas , which extols terrorism and demands Israel &apos;s extinction , only reinforced the new strategic consensus . 
In fact , the new consensus is shared by most of Labour and the main opposition within Likud . 
The dream of peace , the nationalist fervor , and the purported religious redemption that animated Israel &apos;s political combatants for a half-century are gone , replaced by a resigned pragmatism . 
That may inspire little enthusiasm , but the Israel that Olmert has now won a firm mandate to lead is by no means demoralized . 
On the contrary , public opinion polls show that citizens remain highly patriotic and optimistic about their personal lives . 
They have merely concluded that politics will not bring miracles , and that the most they can expect is to keep external threats to a minimum . 
That is Sharon &apos;s legacy .
