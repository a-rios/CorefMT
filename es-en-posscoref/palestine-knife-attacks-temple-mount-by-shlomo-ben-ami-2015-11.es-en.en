Internet or Intifada ? 
TEL AVIV - According to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , the ongoing wave of knife attacks on Jews by young Palestinian &quot; lone wolves &quot; can be blamed entirely on incitement by Palestinian Authority and Islamist websites . 
Netanyahu evidently expects Israelis , and the world , to believe that if these sites were posting cat videos , the Palestinians would cease their agitation and submit quietly to occupation . 
Palestinians are indeed being provoked , but by Israeli actions - beginning with the perpetual encroachment on their rights that occupation entails . 
Beyond facing daily humiliation at checkpoints , Palestinians have seen Israeli settlers destroy their crops and olive groves , and even torch a West Bank home , burning three family members and killing a toddler . 
Add the Israeli military &apos;s frequent late-night house raids in search of &quot; terror suspects &quot; and the relentless expansion of Israeli settlements , and it becomes pretty clear that Palestinians don &apos;t need to scour the Internet for reasons to be angry . 
It is ironic that Netanyahu , of all people , is accusing anyone of incitement . 
Was it not incitement when , just days before Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995 for his efforts to achieve peace with the Palestinians , Netanyahu addressed a rally where posters depicted Rabin in a Nazi SS uniform ? 
Was it not incitement when he attempted to mobilize Jewish voters earlier this year by warning of &quot; Arabs voting in droves , bussed in by the left . &quot; 
Just this month , one of Netanyahu &apos;s shamelessly incendiary statements - the claim that Haj Amin al-Husseini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , gave Adolf Hitler the idea of annihilating Europe &apos;s Jews during World War II - sparked a media firestorm . 
When it comes to anti-Jewish zeal , Husseini &apos;s record hardly needs false footnotes - unless , apparently , one has an interest in presenting the Palestinians as co-perpetrators of the Holocaust . 
In this case , it seems that Netanyahu may have gone too far ; after more than a week of condemnation , including from Israeli historians , he was forced to retract the statement . 
For Netanyahu , incitement is a powerful political tool . 
He fuels Israeli fears and disillusionment , in order to preserve a status quo that , at least in the case of Palestine , benefits Israel . 
As Netanyahu put it last month in a closed meeting of the Knesset &apos;s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , Israel must continue &quot; controlling all the territory , &quot; adding that the country &quot; will forever live by the sword . &quot; 
Of course , this approach is not always successful ; for example , Netanyahu was unable to block the international nuclear deal with Iran , despite his best efforts . 
But , rather than rethink his approach , he has simply redirected it , in order to restore the Palestinians to their position as the principal existential threat to Israel . 
Today &apos;s emerging intifada demonstrates the profound danger implied by this approach . 
Fueling Israelis &quot; fear and resentment of Palestinians does not only undermine the chances of a political solution ; it also exacerbates Palestinians &quot; frustration and anger with Israelis . 
And that anger is already intense , especially among young Palestinians living under Israeli occupation . 
Consider what life is like in East Jerusalem , the epicenter of the decentralized rebellion , where some 77 % of Palestinians live below the poverty line . 
Not only are municipal services poor or non-existent ; 
Young Palestinians - the third generation to live under occupation - have run out of patience . 
Despite being a largely secular generation , they are using the narrative of jihad ( the knife is a conspicuous Islamic State symbol ) to defy their parents &quot; docility , challenge an incompetent Palestinian leadership , and , most of all , to resist the Israeli occupiers . 
That is why they have made Islam &apos;s holy shrines on Jerusalem &apos;s Temple Mount ( Haram al-Sharif to Muslims ) into icons of their rebellion . 
If iron-fisted authoritarian governments in countries like Egypt and Tunisia could not stop their populations from overthrowing them in the Arab Spring , how can one expect the crippled Palestinian Authority to stop this rebellion ? 
Indeed , at this point , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is more worried about avoiding the fate of Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak or Tunisia &apos;s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali than he is about stopping the violence . 
To preempt young Palestinians &quot; wrath , he has refused to condemn their terror campaign and indirectly fueled anger over Israel &apos;s supposed violation of the status quo on the Temple Mount . 
This approach will have far-reaching consequences , for a similarly dangerous vehemence regarding the Temple Mount , the holiest site in Judaism , has lately been gaining traction among Israelis . 
Though Jewish law explicitly forbids Jews from ascending the Temple Mount , lest they profane this most sanctified of Jewish shrines before the coming of the Messiah , a growing number of Israelis - from religious fanatics to members of Israel &apos;s ruling coalition - now support defying that prohibition . 
They claim that Jews must frequent the holy site , and even build a temple , to strengthen Israel &apos;s sovereignty there . 
The focus on the Temple Mount has given the current confrontation an apocalyptic quality . 
It is time for both sides - and especially the Israelis - to recognize just how dangerous the situation is . 
By blurring the borders between Israel and the Palestinian territories , Israel has created the conditions for permanent civil war . 
The two-state solution might not be particularly attractive to either party anymore ; but a binational solution , at least as it is unfolding these days , would be a living nightmare .
