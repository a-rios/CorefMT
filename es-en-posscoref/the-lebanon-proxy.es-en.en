The Lebanon Proxy 
Over the past few weeks , Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Christian Lebanese Forces have been meeting intermittently in what has been dubbed a &quot; National Dialogue . &quot; 
Their primary objective is to forge a consensus for Lebanon &apos;s future in the wake of the withdrawal of Syrian forces last year . 
But what their dialogue has exposed is how much Lebanese politics continues to be shaped by external forces . 
The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad retains huge influence over key levers of the Lebanese state , including the security and intelligence apparatus , the army , and the judiciary - not to mention an alliance with the militarily powerful Hezbollah . 
Though Syrian soldiers may have withdrawn a year ago , Assad &apos;s regime never got over its departure from Lebanon , and it seeks to re-impose some form of hegemony over the country . 
Syria &apos;s stance is complicated by an ongoing United Nations investigation that accuses it of involvement in the February 14 , 2005 , assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri . 
While Syria &apos;s Lebanese allies have called for improved ties between the two countries , the Hariri murder makes this doubtful . 
For the moment , the Lebanese parties have agreed not to allow their territory to be used as a base for any presumed threats to the Syrian regime . 
At the same time , Egypt and Saudi Arabia want desperately to avoid the downfall of Assad &apos;s regime . 
Publicly , they support the UN &apos;s investigation , but privately they have encouraged , even pressured , the Lebanese government to lower the heat on Syria . 
Lebanese adversaries of Syria have resisted such demands , but the Egyptian and Saudi stance highlights how , for reasons of self-interest , Arab regimes rarely like to see fellow despots fall . 
Indeed , the Egyptian and Saudi attitude contrasts starkly with that of two Western powers with extensive influence in Lebanon , the United States and France , which support the UN inquiry wherever it might go . 
Nevertheless , all four states agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be curbed , and all , in theory , approve of Hezbollah &apos;s disarmament - required by UN Security Council resolution 1559 - even if they differ over how to bring it about . 
Another regional issue shaping Lebanese domestic politics is the ongoing violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq . 
Lebanon &apos;s Sunnis and Shiites - the country &apos;s two most powerful communities , owing mostly to their demographic weight and the backing they enjoy from elsewhere in the region - are nowhere near the point of mutual violence , but there has been palpable political tension recently . 
Hariri was the leading Sunni politician , and after his murder both communities found themselves in opposing corners with respect to Syria . 
Within Lebanon , the Sunni-Shiite divide reflects broader regional frictions between the Sunni-majority Arab states , particularly Saudi Arabia , which backs Saad Hariri , the late prime minister &apos;s son , and Iran , which supports Hezbollah . 
The Saudis fear that Sunni-Shiite discord , spreading from Iraq across the Arab world , might harm the kingdom , whose Shiites are concentrated in the oil-rich eastern part of the country . 
That is why Riyadh has encouraged Hariri to keep lines open to Hezbollah , the leading Shiite force . 
Their sectarian anxieties aside , the Saudis and Egyptians fear that a nuclear Iran might secure Shiite dominance in the region . 
Grafted onto this is America-Iranian enmity , fed by the nuclear issue , but also by disagreement in Iraq . 
The Arab states have found themselves uncomfortably caught in the middle , as have the Lebanese , who are alarmed that they may pay the price for any American or Israeli attack against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , because in either case , Hezbollah may retaliate against Israel from South Lebanon . 
Inside Lebanon , Hezbollah has interpreted UN demands for its disarmament as a plot by the Bush administration to weaken the party , and as a means of affirming American supremacy in the region . 
Hezbollah has refused to disarm in the face of what it has called the Israeli threat , although its definition of this threat has shifted frequently enough to cast doubt on whether it would ever be willing to surrender its weapons . 
More recently , Hezbollah agreed to place the issue on the domestic negotiating agenda - perhaps because Iran doesn &apos;t want it to be a source of national dissension - but it is doubtful that genuine disarmament will ensue , at least for now . 
Finally , as they maneuver around the shoals of regional and international affairs , the Lebanese must also consider domestic American politics . 
A US administration in full withdrawal from Iraq would likely become indifferent to what happens in Lebanon . 
Who but Syria and Iran would benefit from that ? 
Such an outcome might satisfy some parts of Lebanese society , particularly Hezbollah . 
But most Lebanese remain committed to seeing their country living in peace , free from the isolation and militancy that are the hallmarks of Iran and Syria . 
Unfortunately , Lebanon has always been buffeted by its surroundings , and the country could once again become an arena for destructive regional conflicts , regardless of what the Lebanese prefer .
