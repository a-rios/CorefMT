The Decline of Renewable Energy 
PRAGUE - Many today believe that renewable energy will let us get off fossil fuels soon . 
Unfortunately , the facts say otherwise . 
According to International Energy Agency data , 13.12 % of the world &apos;s energy came from renewables in 1971 , the first year that the IEA reported global statistics . 
In 2011 , renewables &quot; share was actually lower , at 12.99 % . 
Yet a new survey shows that Americans believe that the share of renewables in 2035 will be 30.2 % . 
In reality , it will likely be 14.5 % . 
The vast majority comes from biomass , or wood and plant material - humanity &apos;s oldest energy source . 
While biomass is renewable , it is often neither good nor sustainable . 
Burning wood in pre-industrial Western Europe caused massive deforestation , as is occurring in much of the developing world today . 
The indoor air pollution that biomass produces kills more than three million people annually . 
Likewise , modern energy crops increase deforestation , displace agriculture , and push up food prices . 
The most renewables-intensive places in the world are also the poorest . 
Africa gets almost 50 % of its energy from renewables , compared to just 8 % for the OECD . 
Even the European OECD countries , at 11.8 % , are below the global average . 
The reality is that humanity has spent recent centuries getting away from renewables . 
In 1800 , the world obtained 94 % of its energy from renewable sources . 
That figure has been declining ever since . 
Compared to 250 years ago , the average person in the United Kingdom today has access to 50 times more power , travels 250 times farther , and has 37,500 times more light . 
Incomes have increased 20-fold . 
The switch to fossil fuels has also had tremendous environmental benefits . 
Kerosene saved the whales ( which had been hunted almost to extinction to provide supposedly &quot; renewable &quot; whale oil for lighting ) . 
Coal saved Europe &apos;s forests . 
With electrification , indoor air pollution , which is much more dangerous than outdoor air pollution , disappeared in most of the developed world . 
And there is one environmental benefit that is often overlooked : in 1910 , more than 30 % of farmland in the United States was used to produce fodder for horses and mules . 
Tractors and cars eradicated this huge demand on farmland ( while ridding cities of manure pollution ) . 
Of course , fossil fuels brought their own environmental problems . 
And , while technological innovations like scrubbers on smokestacks and catalytic converters on cars have reduced local air pollution substantially , the problem of CO â‚‚ emissions remains . 
Indeed , it is the main reason for the world &apos;s clamor for a return to renewables . 
To be sure , wind and solar have increased dramatically . 
Since 1990 , wind-generated power has grown 26 % per year and solar a phenomenal 48 % . 
But the growth has been from almost nothing to slightly more than almost nothing . 
In 1990 , wind produced 0.0038 % of the world &apos;s energy ; it is now producing 0.29 % . 
Solar-electric power has gone from essentially zero to 0.04 % . 
Yes , Denmark gets a record 34 % of its electricity from wind . 
But electricity accounts for only 18 % of its final energy use . 
Europe now gets 1 % of its energy from wind - less than before industrialization , when cozy windmills contributed about 2 % ( and ships &quot; sails provided another 1 % ) . 
The UK set its record for wind power in 1804 , when its share reached 2.5 % - almost three times its level today . 
Moreover , solar and wind will still contribute very little in the coming decades . 
In the IEA &apos;s optimistic scenario , which assumes that the world &apos;s governments will fulfill all of their green promises , wind will provide 1.34 % of global energy by 2035 , while solar will provide 0.42 % . 
Global renewables will most likely increase by roughly 1.5 percentage points , to 14.5 % by 2035 . 
Under unrealistically optimistic assumptions , the share could increase five percentage points , to 17.9 % . 
So we are nowhere near switching back to renewables anytime soon . 
In the US , renewables accounted for 9.3 % of energy production in 1949 . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration expects that number , almost a century later , to increase slightly , to 10.8 % by 2040 . 
In China , renewables &quot; share in energy production dropped from 40 % in 1971 to 11 % today ; in 2035 , it will likely be just 9 % . 
Yet we are paying through the nose for these renewables . 
In the last 12 years , the world has invested $ 1.6 trillion in clean energy . 
By 2020 , the effort to increase reliance on renewables will cost the European Union alone $ 250 billion annually . 
Spain now pays almost 1 % of its GDP in subsidies for renewables , which is more than it spends on higher education . 
At the end of the century , Spain &apos;s massive investment will have postponed global warming by 62 hours . 
Current green energy policies are failing for a simple reason : renewables are far too expensive . 
Sometimes people claim that renewables are actually cheaper . 
Former US Vice President Al Gore &apos;s climate adviser , Jim Hansen , put it bluntly : &quot; Suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States , China , India , or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and &#91; the &#93; Tooth Fairy . &quot; 
The solution is to innovate the price of renewables downward . 
We need a dramatic increase in funding for research and development to make the next generations of wind , solar , and biomass energy cheaper and more effective . 
Consider China . 
Despite the country &apos;s massive investment in solar and wind , it mostly sells solar panels to Western countries at subsidized prices . 
Wind makes up just 0.2 % of China &apos;s energy , and solar accounts for 0.01 % . 
Meanwhile , China has 68 % of the world &apos;s solar water heaters on rooftops , because it is a smart and cheap technology . 
When green renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels , they will take over the world . 
Instead of believing in the Tooth Fairy , we should start investing in green R &amp; D.
