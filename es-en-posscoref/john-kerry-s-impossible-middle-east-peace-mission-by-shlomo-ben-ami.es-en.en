Israel &apos;s Neglected Peace Dividend 
TEL AVIV - Twenty years after the Oslo Accords , the prospects for a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace deal are dimmer than ever . 
Indeed , roughly a half-million Israeli settlers in the occupied territories ( including East Jerusalem ) make the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state an almost impossible mission . 
So , is the renewed vigor of US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration in the quest for peace too little , too late ? 
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu claims that his government has no preconditions for resuming negotiations with the Palestinians . 
Meanwhile , his housing minister , Uri Ariel ( himself a settler and a member of the annexationist Jewish Home party ) , unleashes a new wave of settlement expansion that threatens to link the 1967 border with the Jordan Valley , thus bisecting Palestinian territory . 
Netanyahu &apos;s own insistence on &quot; ironclad &quot; security arrangements is a euphemism for an Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley - and no return to the &quot; Auschwitz borders &quot; of 1967 . 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is too weak and too burdened by his rivalry with the hard-line Islamist Hamas - which rules in Gaza - to allow himself the political luxury of departing from the core demands of Palestinian nationalism . 
Nor does Netanyahu , an ideologue who is visibly uncomfortable with his forced support of the two-state idea , truly have a governing coalition for peace . 
Thus , US Secretary of State John Kerry will require great deal of creativity to reconcile Netanyahu &apos;s position and the Palestinian precondition , recently reiterated by Abbas &apos;s close associate Nabil Shaath , that Israel must agree to negotiate on the basis of the 1967 borders . 
Mahmoud Al-Habbash , the Palestinian minister of religious affairs , even went so far as to demand &quot; assurances that the talks won &apos;t fail , &quot; because if they do , a new intifada would surely erupt . 
Moreover , Kerry &apos;s peace drive is taking place in a regional environment that is not amenable to a negotiated resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
The Arab Spring has turned bloody and unpredictably turbulent , further diminishing the odds for peace in Palestine . 
Nor does the election of Hassan Rowhani , a relative moderate , to Iran &apos;s presidency improve Kerry &apos;s chances . 
Rowhani &apos;s victory is certainly good news for Iranians , and it may lead to a more civilized dialogue between the Islamic Republic and the international community . 
Iran will continue its nuclear program , fight for the survival of Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime in Syria , seek to maintain its vital alliance with key regional proxies such as Hezbollah , and defend Palestine and al-Quds ( Jerusalem ) . 
If Assad defeats his opponents with the help of Hezbollah and Iran , his survival is bound to be perceived as a victory for the regional &quot; axis of resistance &quot; to Israel . 
Palestine would then be relegated to an obscure corner of the international agenda . 
Complicating matters further , America &apos;s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have limited its regional clout . 
The US now faces an unpredictable Middle East that is writing its own history as well - or as badly - as it can . 
Syria &apos;s internal conflict has now become a Sunni-Shia sectarian war that is spreading across the region . 
The Sunni clerics who have just declared a jihad against &quot; the Iranian regime , Hezbollah , and its sectarian allies &quot; are the voice of millions across the Muslim world . 
Furthermore , waves of Syrian refugees are threatening the sustainability of the Jordanian monarchy , already roiled by profound internal cleavages . 
Hezbollah has drawn Lebanon into the Syrian conflict , setting up a showdown between Shia and Sunni at home . 
A similar scenario is already unfolding in Iraq . 
Turkey , a responsible regional power , has so far resisted being drawn into the Syrian quagmire , but its effects can be seen in the rising tensions between the country &apos;s Sunni majority and the Shia Alevi sect . 
Inertia is not an adequate response in an era of revolutionary change . 
Unfortunately , Israel is missing a coherent regional strategy . 
Netanyahu , always on the defensive , does not view Middle East turmoil as a trigger for a proactive strategy that would use a solution to the Palestinian problem as leverage for broader positive change in the region . 
America , burdened by the cost of its Middle East troubles , eager to refocus on Asia , and no longer in need of Arab oil , can allow itself to leave the region to its destiny . 
Israel is part of the region and has a strong interest in helping to shape its future . 
Israel has traditionally strived to forge alliances with the region &apos;s minorities - Kurds , Persians , Maronites , and others . 
Now is the time for a major shift to an alliance with the region &apos;s overwhelming Sunni majority . 
Israel should follow Obama , whose recent decision to arm the Syrian rebels , though belated and still ill-defined , is a choice for the Sunni alliance . 
Israel should play an active role in the fall of Assad as a way to undermine the region &apos;s &quot; Shia crescent &quot; and isolate its leader , Iran . 
Assad &apos;s defeat would break the &quot; axis of resistance , &quot; choke off Hezbollah &apos;s arms supplies , and drive a permanent wedge between Turkey and Iran . 
A solution to the Palestinian problem would serve such a strategy . 
It would strengthen Israel &apos;s relations with Egypt , help to stabilize Jordan ( a vital and friendly buffer state ) , and remove a major source of tension with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan &apos;s Islamist government . 
Most important , it would undermine Iran &apos;s efforts to make inroads into the Arab world under the pretext of defending Palestine and Holy Jerusalem .
