Why Bomb Civilians ? 
NEW YORK - The time before last that Israel was fighting a war in Gaza , in 2009 , Avigdor Lieberman , the foreign minister at the time , compared the conflict to America &apos;s war with Japan . 
There was no need for a costly ground invasion ; the enemy could be bombed into submission from the air . 
The comparison , seemingly outrageous , was not entirely wrong . 
Inflicting maximum damage from the air was and remains Israel &apos;s strategy toward Hamas-ruled Gaza . 
Even if we accept that Israel has a legitimate reason to shut down tunnels that are used to infiltrate Palestinian commandos into Israel , this does not explain why it is necessary to bomb schools , power plants , hospitals , mosques , and densely packed civilian areas . 
The official explanation is that Palestinian missiles are hidden in civilian areas . 
This may well be true . 
At some point , they will have had enough and give up - and perhaps even turn against their rulers . 
This is what used to be called &quot; strategic bombing , &quot; or sometimes &quot; terror bombing , &quot; a method of warfare designed to break the will of a people by destroying its &quot; vital centers . &quot; 
The main advocates of the idea , developed in the 1920s , were the Italian Giulio Douhet , the American William Mitchell , and the Englishman Hugh Trenchard . 
The British first used this tactic in the mid-1920s in Mesopotamia , where they tried to break the will of Iraqi and Kurdish anti-colonial rebels by wiping out entire villages from the air , sometimes with bombs filled with mustard gas . 
The bloody high point came in August 1945 , when the United States used atomic bombs to obliterate Hiroshima and Nagasaki - which is what Lieberman may well have had in mind . 
There were many other instances of strategic bombing . 
Nazi Germany tried to break British morale by blitzing large areas of London , Birmingham , and Coventry , among other places . 
When the Japanese could not bring Chiang Kai-shek &apos;s China to its knees in the 1930s , bombers brought terror to Shanghai , Chongqing , and Hankow . 
In 1940 , the Germans destroyed the center of Rotterdam . 
From 1943 onward , Trenchard &apos;s proteg√© , Arthur &quot; Bomber &quot; Harris , used wave after wave of Royal Air Force attacks to demolish almost every city in Germany . 
The RAF bombed the Germans at night , and the US Army Air Force bombed them by day . 
Worse would be in store for Japan . 
Well before the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the USAAF , under the command of General Curtis LeMay , managed to burn every major Japanese city to a cinder with fire bombs . 
Strategic bombing is an application of the concept of &quot; total war , &quot; in which all civilians are considered to be combatants and thus legitimate targets . 
In 1965 , when the North Vietnamese were proving to be stubborn enemies , LeMay threatened that they would be &quot; bombed back into the stone age . &quot; 
The problem with strategic bombing is that it seems never to have worked , with the possible exception of Rotterdam ( but by then Holland had already been defeated ) . 
Rather than breaking popular morale in London , Berlin , Tokyo , or Hanoi , it usually strengthened it . 
Confronted by a common deadly threat , civilians rally around the only leaders who can do anything to protect them , even if those leaders are widely disliked . 
And so the Germans fought on , until the combined force of the invading Allied armies overwhelmed them in 1945 . 
The Japanese finally surrendered because they feared an invasion by the Soviet Union . 
And the Palestinians , whether they are ruled by Hamas or not , will not stop fighting Israel , especially in Gaza , where wholesale destruction has left them with nothing much more to lose . 
So why do governments persist in using this cruel but ineffective strategy ? 
Sheer bloodlust - the pleasure of inflicting pain on a hated enemy - may have something to do with it . 
Perhaps it motivated Harris to bomb German cities over and over again , even when there was no longer any conceivable military purpose . 
But violent passion and the desire to wreak vengeance cannot be the only , or perhaps even the main , reason . 
A more plausible explanation is that strategic bombing is indeed about morale , but not that of the enemy . 
It is the morale of the home front that must be boosted , when other methods appear to fail . 
Winston Churchill decided to unleash his bombers on German civilians when an Allied victory was still a long way off . 
He needed to build British morale with a demonstration of force against an enemy that had just spent several years bombing the United Kingdom . 
The other advantage of bombing campaigns , avidly promoted during World War II by men who were haunted by memories of the endless bloodshed of World War I , was that attacking the enemy did not require losing many of your own troops . 
Many British bomber pilots died , of course , but many more soldiers would have died in a ground invasion . 
Indeed , with supremacy in the air , as in Mesopotamia in the 1920s or Japan in 1945 , mass killing can be carried out at virtually no cost at all . 
There is another explanation , which also stems from the 1920s . 
Bombing was a way , as Churchill put it , to police an empire &quot; on the cheap . &quot; 
Rebellions could be stopped by killing enough people from a great height . 
US President Barack Obama &apos;s use of drones in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Yemen derives from the same principle . 
But these are always Pyrrhic victories , because every murder of civilians creates new rebels , who will rise again in time . 
If Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu does not know that , he is a fool . 
If he does , he is a cynic who has given up on any idea of lasting peace . 
It is difficult to know which is worse .
