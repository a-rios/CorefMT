Jobless Recoveries and Manic Policies 
CHICAGO - Monetary and fiscal policies in the United States , both in this recession and the recession of 2001 , have been among the most accommodating in the industrial world . As I write , Congress is working on yet another &quot; jobs &quot; bill . Indeed , John Taylor of Stanford University attributes the recent financial crisis to excessively stimulatory monetary policy towards the end of Alan Greenspan &apos;s tenure as head of the US Federal Reserve . 
Why is US policy so accommodating ? 
A central reason is that the nature of US economic recoveries has changed . 
From 1960 until 1991 , US recoveries were typically rapid . 
From the trough of recessions , recovery to pre-recession output levels took less than two quarters on average , and employment recovered within eight months . 
But the recoveries from the recessions of 1991 and 2001 were different . 
For example , in 2001 , it took just one quarter for output to recover , but 38 months for jobs to come back . 
The current recovery appears to be similarly slow in creating jobs . 
Some economists argue that , unlike past recoveries , when workers who were temporarily laid off were rehired , job losses starting in 1991 were more permanent . 
Unemployed workers had to find jobs in new industries , which took more time and training . 
Others suggest that the Internet has made it easier for firms to hire quickly . 
So , rather than hire in panic at the first sign of a recovery for fear that they will be unable to do so later and lose sales , firms would rather make sure that the recovery is well established before adding workers . 
Regardless of the true explanation , the US is singularly unprepared for jobless recoveries . 
Typically , unemployment benefits last only six months . 
Moreover , because health-care benefits are often tied to jobs , an unemployed worker also risks losing access to affordable health care . 
Short-duration benefits may have been appropriate when recoveries were fast and jobs plentiful , because the fear of losing benefits before finding a job may have given workers an incentive to look harder . 
But , with few jobs being created , a positive incentive has turned into a source of great anxiety . 
Even those who have jobs fear that they could lose them and be cast adrift . 
Politicians ignore popular anxiety at their peril . 
President George H.W. Bush is widely believed to have lost his re-election bid , despite winning a popular war in Iraq , because he seemed out of touch with public hardship following the 1991 recession . 
That lesson has been fully internalized . 
Economic recovery is all about jobs , not output , and politicians are willing to push for economic stimulus , both fiscal ( tax cuts or government spending ) and monetary ( lower short-term interest rates ) , until jobs start reappearing . 
In theory , this is what democracy is all about - policy responding to the needs of the people . 
In practice , though , public pressure to do something quickly enables politicians to run roughshod over the usual checks and balances on government policy making . 
Long-term spending and tax policies are enacted under the shadow of an emergency , with the party that happens to be in power at the time of the downturn getting to push its pet agenda . 
Much of what is enacted as stimulus has little immediate effect on job creation , but does have an adverse long-term effect on government finances . 
For example , the 2009 stimulus package enacted by the Obama administration had many billions of dollars devoted to cancer research , though such research employs few people directly and is spent over a long time horizon - far beyond that of even a prolonged recovery . 
Equally deleterious to economic health is the recent vogue of cutting interest rates to near zero and holding them there for a sustained period . 
It is far from clear that near-zero short-term interest rates ( as compared to just low interest rates ) have much additional effect in encouraging firms to create jobs when powerful economic forces make them reluctant to hire . 
But prolonged near-zero rates can foster the wrong kinds of activities . 
For example , households and investment managers , reluctant to keep money in safe money-market funds , instead seek to invest in securities with longer maturities and higher credit risk , so long as they offer extra yield . 
Likewise , money fleeing low US interest rates ( and , more generally , industrial countries ) has pushed up emerging-market equity and real-estate prices , setting them up for a fall ( as we witnessed recently with the flight to safety following Europe &apos;s financial turmoil ) . 
Moreover , even if corporations in the US are not hiring , corporations elsewhere are . 
Brazil &apos;s unemployment rate , for example , is at lows not seen for decades . 
If the Fed were to accept the responsibilities of its de facto role as the world &apos;s central banker , it would have to admit that its policy rates are not conducive to stable world growth . 
Policy would still be accommodative if the Fed maintained low interest rates rather than the zero level that was appropriate for a panic . 
And this would give savers less of an incentive to search for yield , thus avoiding financial instability . 
Politicians will not sit quietly , however , if the Fed attempts to raise rates . 
Their thinking - and the Fed &apos;s - follows the misguided calculus that if low rates are good for jobs , ultra-low rates must be even better . 
Emerging studies on the risk-taking and asset-price inflation engendered by ultra-low policy rates will eventually convince Fed policymakers to change their stance . 
But , if politicians are to become less anxious about jobs , perhaps we need to start discussing whether jobless recoveries are here to stay , and whether the US safety net , devised for a different era , needs to be modified .
