The Hydrogen Solution 
RHINECLIFF , NY - Around the world , governments and businesses are constantly being called upon to make big investments in solar , wind , and geothermal energy , as well as biofuels . 
But , in the United States , unlike in Europe and Asia , discussion of hydrogen energy and fuel cells as systemic , game-changing technologies is largely absent . 
That needs to change : these clean , renewable energy sources promise not only zero-emission baseload power , but also a zero-emission fuel for cars and trucks , the biggest polluters of them all . 
By now , many have heard about plans by big carmakers - including Honda , Toyota , and Hyundai - to launch hydrogen fuel-cell cars commercially around 2015 . 
Daimler , Ford , and Nissan plan to launch such cars around 2017 . 
Germany plans to build at least 50 hydrogen fueling stations by 2015 as the start of a countrywide network . 
Japan and Korea have announced similar plans . 
But a bigger , largely unreported , message is that some European countries , especially Germany , have launched projects that combine renewables like solar and wind with hydrogen for energy storage , implying clean , zero-emission , stable power grids that require no coal , oil , or nuclear power . 
Indeed , the bottom line of a new study by two American researchers , Willett Kempton and Cory Budischak , is that the combination of renewables and hydrogen storage could fully power a large electricity grid by 2030 at costs comparable to those today . 
Kempton and Budischak designed a computer model for wind , solar , and storage to meet demand for one-fifth of the US grid . 
The results buck &quot; the conventional wisdom that renewable energy is too unreliable and expensive , &quot; says Kempton . 
&quot; For example , &quot; according to Budischak , &quot; using hydrogen for storage , we can run an electric system that today would meet a need of 72 gigawatts , 99.9 % of the time , using 17 GW of solar , 68 GW of offshore wind , and 115 GW of inland wind . &quot; 
Their study lends scientific supportto several such projects underway in Europe aimed at proving that hydrogen gas , converted from water via electrolysis - think of it as natural gas minus the polluting carbon - and stored , for example , in subterranean salt caverns , can smooth out fluctuations inherent in solar and wind energy . 
It builds in part on two recent studies at Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution , which conclude that , as Carnegie atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira put it , &quot; there is more than enough energy available in winds to power all of civilization . &quot; 
The latest effort , scheduled to get underway outside Brussels this year , is the delightfully named &quot; Don Quichote &quot; project ( &quot; Demonstration of New Qualitative Innovative Concept of Hydrogen Out of wind Turbine Electricity &quot; ) , designed to highlight utility-scale energy storage and transport , and to provide power for fuel-cell forklift trucks . 
The project &apos;s partners are a Belgian grocery chain , the European Commission , and various European organizations and companies . 
Canada &apos;s Hydrogenics is providing the electrolyzer and a fuel cell . 
Meanwhile , near Berlin , five companies launched a € 10 million ( $ 13 million ) pilot project at Berlin &apos;s main airport in Schoenefeld in December , expanding and converting an existing hydrogen fueling station to CO2 neutrality by linking it to a nearby wind farm . 
Earlier last year , two German utilities , Thüga and E.ON , announced two gas demonstration plants . 
And the world &apos;s first renewable energy / hydrogen hybrid power plant , producing both electricity and hydrogen as car fuel , started production in the fall of 2011 . 
The previous year , German Chancellor Angela Merkel laid the plant &apos;s cornerstone herself , sending a strong signal of her seriousness about Germany &apos;s shift to clean , renewable energy . 
Indeed , the much-noted Energiewende , or energy turnaround , that she announced in 2010 is arguably one of the most audacious acts of environmental statesmanship yet . 
According to the author and environmentalist Bill McKibben , Germany is in the international forefront of fighting climate change : &quot; The clear alternative and the best news from 2012 came from Germany , the one big country that &apos;s taken climate change seriously .... There were days last summer when &#91; Germans &#93; generated more than half the power that they used from solar panels . &quot; 
In fact , hydrogen technology will be an integral part of Germany &apos;s evolving renewable / alternative energy-based system . 
Germany &apos;s move toward renewable energy is likely to have a much broader positive impact . 
A six-article series , &quot; The German Nuclear Exit , &quot; in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist argues that the move away from nuclear energy is already &quot; yielding measurable economic and environmental benefits . &quot; 
More broadly , Lutz Mez , a political scientist at Berlin &apos;s Free University , argues that the country &apos;s shift has &quot; observably decoupled energy supply from economic growth , &quot; and that the &quot; evolving Energiewende , rather than the nuclear phase-out &quot; implies &quot; continuing reforms of social , economic , technological , and cultural policy in Germany . &quot; 
What , one wonders , are lagging nations waiting for ?
