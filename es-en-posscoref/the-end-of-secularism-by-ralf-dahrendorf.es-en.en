The End of Secularism ? 
When the end of ideology was celebrated - first in the 1950 &quot; s and then , more emphatically still , in the 1990 &quot; s - no one foresaw that religion , the bane of politics in the first half of the twentieth century , would return to that role with a vengeance . 
Daniel Bell and Raymond Aron wrote about the end of fascist and communist ideology in the hope that we would enter an age of pragmatism in which politics would be a subject of argument and debate , not belief and total worldviews . 
Karl Popper &apos;s approach to politics , one of reason and critical discourse , had come to prevail . 
And when , after the collapse of communism , the end of history seemed near , ideological politics was thought to have vanished forever . 
But history does not end , and it is forever full of surprises . 
Francis Fukuyama &apos;s End of History and Samuel Huntington &apos;s Clash of Civilisations appeared within a mere three years of each other in the 1990 &quot; s , and a decade later the return of religion to politics is visible for all to see - and for many to suffer . 
Those books are not just academic discourse , but mirror real developments . 
By the time the false religions of totalitarian ideologies were defeated , real religions - so it seemed - had long passed from the political scene . 
In some countries , formal allegiance to religious faith was symbolized by gestures and rites . 
Yet no one thought much about it when American presidents of different faiths swore their oath of office to God and country . 
In Westminster , every parliamentary sitting begins with Christian prayers presided over by Speakers who could be Christians or Jews or non-believers . 
Not all democracies were as strict as France in their formal secularism but all were secular : the law is made by the sovereign people and not by some superhuman being or agency . 
Suddenly , however , this secular commitment is no longer so clear . 
Religious fundamentalists claim that the law must be anchored in the belief in a supreme being , or even be based on revelation . 
Christian fundamentalism in the United States has come to dominate large segments of the Republican Party . 
In Europe , the Vatican lobbied for acknowledgement of God in the preamble to the proposed European Constitutional Treaty . 
Israel has long avoided drafting a constitution , because its secular citizens fear that orthodox Jews would impose their values on them . 
Likewise , the sharia , Islamic law , entered political life in its least enlightened version in hopeful democracies like Nigeria , to say nothing of Iran . 
Islamic fundamentalism - Islamism - has spread to all countries in which there are significant numbers of Muslims . 
Why has religion returned to secular and democratic politics ? 
The main reason is probably that the enlightened countries of the world have become unsure of their values , even of the Enlightenment itself . 
A moral relativism has spread , leading many to accept the taboos of all religious groups in the name of tolerance and multiculturalism . 
Cartoons of Mohammed are not published , and Mozart &apos;s opera Idomeneo is not performed in order to avoid offending religious sensitivities ; and when , in the end , the publication and the performance take place , they become a demonstration almost intended to offend . 
One can understand that enlightened believers in Islam ( of whom there are many ) find it upsetting that the world in which they want to live is in fact frail and vulnerable . 
The return of religion to politics - and to public life in general - is a serious challenge to the rule of democratically enacted law and the civil liberties that go with it . 
The response by enlightened communities is therefore important . 
Perhaps it is right that the use of religious symbols has become the subject of public debate , though I think that wearing headscarves and even veils is as much a part of individual freedom as is the wearing of Jewish skullcaps and Christian crosses . 
But there are far more important issues - above all , freedom of speech , including the freedom to say and write things that annoy , even upset , many . 
In the interest of enlightened discourse , the limits of free speech should be drawn as widely as possible . 
In the free world , people are not forced to read a newspaper or listen to a speech that they do not like , and they can oppose without fear what is said by those in positions of authority . 
Today &apos;s counter-Enlightenment fashion can easily get out of hand . 
Those who are committed to liberty must learn to appreciate and defend it now , lest they someday have to fight to get it back .
