The Right Health Investments 
COPENHAGEN - West Africa &apos;s Ebola epidemic has dominated headlines for much of the last year . 
But , as devastating as that outbreak has been , its death toll of less than 20,000 people is dwarfed by that of preventable diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria , which together caused more than three million deaths in 2013 , hitting the world &apos;s poorest people the hardest . 
This need not be the case ; indeed , addressing these diseases would be an extraordinarily good investment . 
The truth is that we lack the resources - both human and capital - to solve every problem the world faces , so we must focus on the areas where we can do the most good . 
That is what 193 national governments are currently attempting to do as they create a set of development objectives to be achieved by 2030 . 
To help guide these efforts , my think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus Center , has asked 60 teams of top economists to assess some of the key targets , and to make an economic case for which of them should be on the final list . 
Health is a big topic , so it was addressed by six expert groups and eight commentaries - which , taken together , cover a lot of analytical ground . 
But one objective stood out as particularly cost-effective : tackling deadly preventable diseases . 
Consider tuberculosis , which kills about 1.4 million people each year . 
Two billion people worldwide carry the bacterium that causes TB , one in ten of whom will develop the disease . 
To be sure , significant progress has been made in the fight against TB , which killed about 100 million people during the twentieth century . 
Antibiotics have practically wiped out the disease in rich countries , and have helped to reduce TB &apos;s mortality rate by more than one-third over the last two decades , saving an estimated 37 million lives since 1995 . 
But TB remains pervasive among the poor , and progress toward eliminating it has been hampered by weak health systems , poverty , and multi-resistant strains of TB . 
Despite the toll it takes , TB treatment receives just 4 % of total development assistance spent on health , compared with 25 % for HIV . 
One of the problems is that TB can be difficult to detect , particularly in countries with weak health systems . 
That is why the World Health Organization recommends a preventative course of drugs , costing just $ 21 per person , for high-risk populations . 
Treatment is highly effective and , on average , can extend productive life by 20 years . 
For about $ 8 billion annually , nearly everyone infected with TB worldwide could receive treatment - an effort that would bring almost $ 350 billion worth of benefits . 
In other words , every dollar spent on treating TB would generate $ 43 in returns , making it a phenomenally good investment . 
Another killer disease that disproportionately affects the poor and vulnerable is malaria . 
As it stands , 90 % of malaria deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa , and 77 % are children under five . 
Here , too , there is a cost-effective solution . 
While artemisinin is the most effective antimalarial medication , its widespread use risks fueling the emergence of resistance among the parasites that cause the disease . 
Administering artemisinin in combination with one or more other antimalarials , however , can delay the development of resistance , while helping to save almost a half-million lives each year . 
A half-billion dollar investment in fighting malaria would bring nearly $ 20 billion in returns ( or , more precisely , $ 36 for each dollar spent ) . 
The third major killer disease , HIV / AIDS , arose much more recently than TB and malaria , which have been around for millennia . 
While treatment with anti-retroviral drugs has made an enormous difference to people infected with HIV , it is not cheap . 
Saving 200,000 lives in the worst-affected countries would require about $ 1 billion annually , with every dollar spent producing about $ 10 in benefits . 
But there is a more efficient option . 
Male circumcision is a one-off treatment that can reduce the transmission of HIV to men during intercourse by 60 % , and , with some delay , also reduce transmission to women . 
Though this approach would not be as effective as widespread drug treatment , it would cost a miniscule $ 30 million annually - and bring almost $ 1 billion in benefits . 
That is a $ 28 return for each dollar spent . 
Given the strong case for tackling a few specific preventable or curable diseases , one might assume that improving general health coverage to help protect populations from all of the diseases they face would bring even greater benefits . 
For example , one economist working on the project argued that focusing on a handful of key diseases creates islands of excellence in a sea of dysfunction . 
But , in reality , an omnibus approach would be far more expensive - and far less efficient . 
Improving general health care for the entire developing world would cost more than $ 400 billion annually , and bring only $ 4 in benefits for every dollar spent . 
Health-related initiatives have the potential not only to save people &apos;s lives , but also to transform them , and thus should feature in the new global development agenda . 
The challenge lies in identifying the specific initiatives that will make the most of limited resources . 
It is up to world leaders to examine the evidence and make smart choices . 
Millions of lives depend on it .
