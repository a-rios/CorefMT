Palestine &apos;s War of Generations 
Yasir Arafat may be dead , but his Machiavellian strategies linger . 
Ever protective of his position as sole leader of the Palestinian people , Arafat sought to block any means by which a potential rival could challenge him . 
But in protecting his position , Arafat also blocked the appointment of a successor in his lifetime . 
In the first weeks after Arafat &apos;s death , that seemed not to matter . 
Mahmoud Abbas , Arafat &apos;s longtime deputy and the architect of the Oslo accords , quickly secured the backing of Fatah , the PLO &apos;s core body . 
A seamless transition appeared possible . 
But now Marwan Barghouti , Fatah &apos;s leader in the West Bank during the current Intifada , has decided to contest Abbas for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) from his Israeli jail cell . 
Facing economic stagnation and what Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei calls &quot; the anarchy of weapons , &quot; a succession struggle is the last thing Palestinians need . 
Any new leader must spur the economy , enforce the rule of law , fight corruption , unify the PA &apos;s security agencies , and preserve public safety - and he must do so quickly or lose authority . 
Abbas ( also known as Abu Mazen ) represents the Old Guard of Palestinian politics . 
Abbas will thus need to find support within this rising generation of nationalist leaders if he is to succeed . 
Resolving this generational struggle peacefully will require democratic elections within Fatah for membership of both the Revolutionary Council and the Central Committee . 
The Sixth Fatah Congress , the first in sixteen years , will take place in August 2005 and will seek to reconcile the conflict between the Old and Young Guard . 
Unlike Arafat and his fellow exiles , Barghouti , the most prominent leader among the Young Guard , grew up under Israeli occupation , and was arrested and detained several times . 
Barghouti &apos;s popularity also stems from his refusal from the beginning to take any office in Arafat &apos;s corrupt PA and its institutions . 
Although he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996 , Barghouti &apos;s reputation soared when the current Intifada began in September 2000 . 
His support for attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied territories , which he argues is legitimate under international law , has earned him immense popularity among Palestinians , but also a sentence of five life terms plus 40 years in an Israeli prison . 
Whether he can be released from prison is now a source of intense speculation . 
His decision to challenge Abbas means that the &quot; secular &quot; forces within the Palestinian movement may be divided at a time when rivals with a robust Islamic agenda - principally Hamas and Islamic Jihad - are challenging them . 
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are highly disciplined organizations , exercising tight control over their political and military wings . 
Although Hamas has been weakened by Israel &apos;s targeted assassinations of Sheik Ahmad Yassin and Abdel-Aziz Rantisi , it retains strong military capabilities and popular support ranging between 25-30 % , making it the second leading faction in the West Bank and Gaza . 
Hamas has declared that it will not nominate its own candidate for the PA presidency . 
Hassan Yusuf , a Hamas leader who was recently released from an Israeli jail after 28 months of administrative internment , explained to Al-Jazeera that &quot; if Hamas assumed the leadership at this time , it would be vilified and isolated by the international community , and then the people would suffer . &quot; 
Although Hamas is boycotting the election , many Hamas sympathizers will vote for the candidate most committed to defending the Palestinians &quot; core demands . 
Here Hamas members are simply reiterating Arafat &apos;s views , which will continue to limit the concessions any new leader can make . 
Arafat set forth a blueprint including an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , with East Jerusalem as its capital , and a fair and just solution to the refugee problem . 
Changing leaders will in no way alter these conditions for making peace . 
So the question is this : who will Palestinians , in particular the Hamas constituency , think is better able to secure these goals , Abbas or Barghouti ? 
That answer will most likely determine who will be the PA &apos;s next leader . 
But in the end , Israel will also have to make a choice , because peace will require Israeli concessions , not just compromises from the Palestinians . 
Israel must freeze its settlement activity in the West Bank and stop constructing its barrier wall on Palestinian territories . 
Israel must also free Palestinian prisoners , remove all checkpoints between Palestinian villages and town , and redeploy its forces to positions held prior to September 28 , 2000 , in accordance with phase I of the Road Map . 
Either Abbas or Barghouti would certainly meet such a demonstration of good faith with good faith of his own .
