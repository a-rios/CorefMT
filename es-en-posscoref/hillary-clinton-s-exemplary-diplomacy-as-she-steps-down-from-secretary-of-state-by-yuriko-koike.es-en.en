Farewell Hillary , For Now 
TOKYO - F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said that &quot; there are no second acts in American lives . &quot; 
Hillary Clinton &apos;s stunning ( and , I trust , unfinished ) career - from First Lady to United States Senator to presidential candidate to US Secretary of State in the administration of the man who defeated her - proves that Fitzgerald could not have been more wrong . 
Today , as Clinton prepares to leave office , there is widespread speculation that she will seek to succeed President Barack Obama in 2016 . 
She has had not only a second act , but a third as well - and millions of Americans want her to write a fourth . 
Clinton &apos;s four years as America &apos;s top diplomat have given her iconic status around the world - and deservedly so . 
On her watch , two of the longest wars in US history have been wound down , America &apos;s alliances have been reinvigorated , and young women everywhere have been encouraged to pursue their dreams - whether in academia , business , or politics . 
Hers is a record that ranks her among the great postwar US secretaries of state - Dean Acheson , Henry Kissinger , and James Baker . 
The position of secretary of state is truly global in scope . 
It demands not only a coherent conception of how the world works and the place of US national interests within the international order , but also extraordinary political skill , stamina , timing , and , above all , courage . 
Clinton used all of these virtues to their highest possible effect . 
In the midst of two wars and Asia &apos;s rise , Clinton confronted the three great tasks that any US secretary of state must face : pinpointing the challenges at hand ; developing a viable strategy that attracts the support of the entire US government and public opinion ; and managing the actual practice of US diplomacy . 
Obama &apos;s decision attests not only to his judgment , but also to her character . 
Clinton &apos;s primary challenge as secretary of state was to recast the very nature of US involvement in global affairs . 
The go-it-alone America of the years of the war on terror had alienated its closest allies , and had proven insufficient both to resolving the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and to creating a structure of peace for an Asia struggling to cope with China &apos;s new power and assertiveness . 
With Clinton at the diplomatic helm , the US once again made its alliances - in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia - both a core principle and the key operational mechanism of its foreign policy . 
This renewed trust in allies has been particularly important in Asia and the Middle East , where the US has used cooperation with old partners like Turkey , Japan , and South Korea , and new near-alliances with India and Indonesia , to deter aggression . 
Indeed , American foreign policy &apos;s &quot; pivot to the Pacific &quot; could not be undertaken without the US having first reinvigorated its relationships with Asia &apos;s democracies . 
As a result , China is being given the opportunity to preserve its dignity while receiving incentives to integrate into a stable regional - and ultimately global - order that welcomes it as an integral player , so long as it abides by multilateral rules . 
Of course , Clinton &apos;s efforts to revitalize America &apos;s alliances made restoring confidence in US leadership an overriding priority , which she achieved without seeking to militarize every international problem . 
Her approach implicitly assumed that creating conditions of cooperative strength can make the search for lasting peace self-reinforcing . 
Moreover , even as she emphasized the importance of alliances , she did not neglect diplomatic engagement with adversaries , though never - particularly with respect to Iran and North Korea - as simply an exercise in splitting the difference . 
Clinton , the one-time legislator and practicing politician , understood that a stateswoman &apos;s real legacy is not found in today &apos;s headlines and opinion polls , but in lasting policies and institutions . 
This effort , she knew , requires a willingness to achieve one &apos;s goals in stages , however imperfect . 
In her own words , &quot; The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible , possible . &quot; 
Finally , less noted but of real long-term consequence , Clinton made the cause of gender equality - and not only in the halls of power - a special focus of her diplomacy . 
&quot; In too many instances , &quot; she noted , &quot; the march to globalization has also meant the marginalization of women and girls . 
And that must change . &quot; 
Clinton has helped to bring about such change , not only for women like her ( and me ) , but , more important , for the world &apos;s poor , disenfranchised , and silenced women .
