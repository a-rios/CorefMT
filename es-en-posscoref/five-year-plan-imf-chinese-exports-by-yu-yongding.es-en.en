China &apos;s Rebalancing Act 
BEIJING - China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan calls for a shift in the country &apos;s economic model from export-led growth toward greater reliance on domestic demand , particularly household consumption . 
Since the Plan &apos;s introduction , China &apos;s current-account surplus as a share of GDP has indeed fallen . 
According to the IMF , the fall in China &apos;s current-account surplus / GDP ratio has largely been the result of very high levels of investment , a weak global environment , and an increase in prices for commodity imports that has outpaced the rise in prices for Chinese manufactured goods . 
So the fall in China &apos;s external surplus / GDP ratio does not represent economic &quot; rebalancing &quot; ; on the contrary , the Fund predicts that the ratio will rebound in 2013 and approach its pre-crisis level thereafter . 
The IMF &apos;s explanation of the recent fall in China &apos;s current-account surplus / GDP ratio is broadly correct . 
Experience suggests that China &apos;s external position is highly sensitive to global conditions , with the surplus / GDP ratio rising during boom times for the world economy and falling during slumps . 
Europe &apos;s malaise has hit China &apos;s exports badly , and undoubtedly is the most important factor underlying the current decline in the ratio . 
By definition , without a change in the saving gap , there will be no change in the trade surplus , and vice versa . 
Furthermore , the saving gap and the trade balance interact with each other constantly , making them always equal . 
In response to the global financial crisis in 2008 , China introduced a RMB4 trillion ( $ 634 billion ) stimulus package . 
While the increase in investment reduced the saving / GDP ratio , the resulting increase in imports lowered the trade surplus / GDP ratio . 
As a result , China &apos;s external surplus / GDP ratio fell significantly in 2009 . 
In 2010 , China &apos;s government adjusted its economic policy . 
In order to control inflation and real-estate bubbles , the central bank tightened monetary policy and the government refrained from another round of fiscal stimulus . 
China &apos;s real-estate investment accounted for 10 % of GDP , and slower investment growth in the sector necessarily reduces import demand , directly and indirectly . 
This situation is likely to change in 2012 . 
The negative impact of the fall in real-estate investment since 2010 has been deeper and longer than expected ; indeed , almost all categories of imports that fell by 10 % or more in August were related to real-estate investment . 
As a result , it is possible that the fall in investment growth will reverse the declining external surplus / GDP ratio in 2012 , unless the global economy deteriorates further and / or the Chinese government launches a new stimulus package . 
Perhaps most important , China must now export more manufactured goods to finance imports of energy and mineral products . 
The worsening terms of trade have been a major factor contributing to the decline in the current-account surplus in recent years . 
Nevertheless , despite the merits of its analysis , the IMF underestimates China &apos;s progress in rebalancing . 
In my view , China &apos;s rebalancing is more genuine - and more fundamental - than the Fund recognizes , and the prediction of an eventual rebound in China &apos;s external surplus / GDP ratio will most likely turn out to be wrong . 
First , the roughly 30 % real exchange-rate appreciation since 2005 must have had a serious impact on exporters , reflected in the bankruptcy - as well as the upgrading - of many enterprises in coastal areas . 
Though the market shares of Chinese exports seem to have held up quite well , this is attributable to price-cutting in foreign markets , which is not sustainable . 
Over time , real exchange-rate appreciation will cause a shift in expenditure , making China &apos;s rebalancing more apparent . 
Second , China &apos;s wage levels are rising rapidly . 
According to the 12th Five-Year Plan , the minimum wage should grow by 13 % per year . 
Together with real appreciation , the increase in labor costs is bound to weaken the competitiveness of China &apos;s labor-intensive export sector , which will be reflected in the trade balance more clearly in the coming years . 
Third , China has made significant progress in building its social-security system . 
The number of people covered by basic old-age insurance , unemployment insurance , workers &quot; compensation , and maternity insurance has risen substantially . 
Moreover , universal medical insurance is emerging , and a comprehensive system for providing aid to students from poor families has been established . 
As a result , the motivation for precautionary saving has been weakened somewhat , while some researchers have found statistical evidence that the consumption rate is rising , which is supported by China &apos;s emergence as the world &apos;s fourth-largest importer of luxury goods . 
Finally , the worsening of China &apos;s terms of trade will play an even more fundamental role in reducing its trade surplus in the future . 
Given weak demand , which may be prolonged , Chinese exporters must accept increasingly thin profit margins to maintain market share . 
However , China &apos;s large size and low per capita income and capital stock imply continued rapid growth in its demand for commodities . 
Thanks to supply constraints , China &apos;s import bill for commodities and metals is likely to offset its processing-trade surplus in the near future . 
In short , as long as China &apos;s government is not so unnerved by the slowdown in output growth that it changes its current policy stance , the current-account surplus is more likely to continue to fall relative to GDP than it is to rebound in 2013 and thereafter . 
In fact , such an outcome is not only likely , but also desirable . 
After all , faced with &quot; infinite quantitative easing , &quot; being a large net creditor means being in the worst position in today &apos;s global economy .
