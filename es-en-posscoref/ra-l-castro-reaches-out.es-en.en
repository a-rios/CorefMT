Raúl Castro Reaches Out 
BRASILIA - Raúl Castro has begun a gradual process of changing Cuba &apos;s economy and international relations . 
Within Cuba , he hopes to legitimize his government by improving standards of living . 
Outside of Cuba , he does not want to be held captive by Cuba &apos;s one international supporter : Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . 
Castro believes in giving farm workers greater incentives . 
He has authorized the sale of farm machinery and tools - centralized until now - directly to farmers , as well as handing over idle land to private cooperatives and other organizations that request them . 
He also cancelled the debts of some small producers and raised the prices paid by the state for milk and meat . 
In another measure intended to improve the lives of ordinary Cubans , he has removed restrictions on acquiring computers , microwave ovens , and other appliances . 
Cuban officials stress that the purpose of these changes is to increase efficiency , &quot; not to alter the socialist model . &quot; 
But , like China and Vietnam , the government will have to embrace the market more openly if it is really to improve living conditions . 
Only with foreign investment and economic liberalization - a process that has already begun in some measure - can Cuba hope to offer its 11.2 million people more consumer goods and comfort , improve the social welfare system , and rehabilitate the country &apos;s infrastructure . 
This is essential not only in order to build a &quot; better socialism , &quot; as Castro has promised , but , especially , to legitimize the continuity of the regime established by his brother Fidel &apos;s revolution . 
For now , Cuba is politically stable . 
The evolution of its internal situation leaves no doubt about the consolidation of Raúl Castro &apos;s authority . 
There is somewhat greater freedom of expression , with debates and criticism of several aspects of Cuba &apos;s socialist model , such as low salaries and the dual monetary system , which has caused income inequality by favoring those who work in tourism and for foreign companies . 
But greater political liberalization is unlikely in the short or medium term . 
Cuba &apos;s government argues that America &apos;s financial and political support for the opposition impedes that . 
Nevertheless , with Felipe Pérez Roque as Minister of Foreign Affairs , Cuba continues to conduct a pragmatic foreign policy . 
Venezuela and China have become Cuba &apos;s main economic and commercial partners , and may continue to be so . 
But Raúl Castro wants to avoid dependence on one or two countries alone . 
His objective is to diversify Cuba &apos;s foreign relations and prevent problems that any change in these countries could cause his regime - a constant imperative since the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
As a result , relations with Latin America &apos;s giants , Brazil and Mexico , are being put on a more normal footing , relations with Spain are being improved . 
Moreover , negotiations with the European Union have been resumed , greater understanding with the Vatican is being fostered , and Castro himself has publicly suggested the possibility of dialogue with the United States . 
Although Venezuela provides between $ 1.5 and $ 2 billion annually to Cuba , Castro regards Chávez as something of a headache , owing to his rhetoric and his confrontational attitude with several countries . 
Chávez is simply not the right person to help Cuba normalize its international relations . 
Moreover , Venezuela has its own economic problems , despite its enormous dollar reserves . 
Shortages of medicines and basic foodstuffs such as milk , sugar , eggs , beef , and chicken abound as a consequence of price controls and mounting inflation . 
This reminds Castro of the economic dislocations that led the Soviet Union to slash its aid to Cuba in the years before it collapsed . 
Venezuela &apos;s problems make collaboration and support from Brazil - the southern hemisphere &apos;s largest industrial power - even more important . 
During President Luís Ignacio da Silva Lula &apos;s visit to Havana in January 2008 , Brazil and Cuba signed several economic and commercial agreements . 
Indeed , Brazil doubled its loan to Cuba for the purchase of foodstuffs and medicines , to $ 200 million , and has arranged projects to rehabilitate Cuba &apos;s infrastructure with the participation of Brazilian companies . 
Other agreements include a project in which Brazil &apos;s state energy company , Petrobrás , and Cuba &apos;s Cupet will extract oil in the Gulf of Mexico , and another that involves technological aid from the Brazilian Company Pessquisa Agropecuária for the development of soya production in Cuba . 
Indeed , as these initiatives suggest , rapprochement with Brazil and Mercosur appears to be Cuba &apos;s best international alternative as Raúl Castro seeks to avoid falling into America &apos;s economic orbit .
