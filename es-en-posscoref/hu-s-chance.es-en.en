Hu &apos;s Chance 
Chinese President Hu Jintao &apos;s upcoming visit to the United States , postponed following hurricane Katrina , will be different from previous bilateral meetings . 
This time , the countries &quot; presidents will meet at a time of intensive American attention to the US-China trade balance and other economic issues , such as protection of intellectual property rights . 
With China &apos;s US trade surplus reaching $ 200 billion last year , American sentiment is growing to take strong measures . 
Some have suggested that the trade imbalance is related to China &apos;s currency peg to the US dollar . 
In fact , the trade imbalance is more complicated than the currency issue per se . 
Globalization has strengthened the ability of capital to flow to wherever investment promises the highest returns ; likewise , competitive manufactured products from low-wage economies will flow in the other direction . 
That is why China fascinates American investors , among others , and why US customers buy Chinese products . 
To be sure , the exchange rate has an impact on investment and trade . 
Nevertheless , for China &apos;s part , now seems to be a good time to reflect on how to increase its exports &quot; value-added , as well as focusing on environmental protection and sustainability . 
Thus , there is scope for a compromise that recognizes both sides &quot; legitimate concerns . 
The Chinese government is hastening its shopping spree in America these days , pushing up the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate slowly but steadily . 
A sensible US policy on China may be to accept gradual currency appreciation , rather than a large revaluation , as America &apos;s economic vitality stems from its own innovation rather than from concessions by the Chinese government . 
A more difficult issue for Hu could be intellectual property rights . 
China &apos;s recent campaign to crackdown on pirating needs to be encouraged , but far more needs to be done . 
However , while the US government and American companies question whether the Chinese are willing and able to enforce such rights , one must put this issue into historical perspective . 
Intellectual property protection is related to economic development , so the question should be whether China has reached the stage at which effective protection is possible . 
There is a positive side to such problems , however , namely that their very emergence reflects the deepening and broadening of bilateral relations . 
Indeed , Sino-US interaction has been so strong that the two presidents met five times last year . 
While those meetings also highlighted trade disputes , they also yielded heightened cooperation and significant accomplishments . 
For example , the two states share a common interest in anti-terrorism efforts , and they have been collaborating to ensure container security and combat human trafficking . 
Their coordinated efforts to divert North Korea peacefully from its nuclear course have also vindicated bilateral cooperation when both sides can define a common security stake . 
Similarly , the two countries have a common interest in stabilizing mainland China &apos;s relations with Taiwan . 
The current formula , maintaining the status quo , offers the highest common denominator . 
With this strategic understanding , there is good reason to expect that Hu &apos;s talks with Bush on Taiwan &apos;s recent termination of the National Unification Council will serve to reduce tensions . 
China and the US both have much to gain by thwarting Taiwan &apos;s move toward independence . 
Nevertheless , to American eyes , other contentious issues are now emerging in relations with China . 
The recently released National Security Strategy outlines three , in particular : China &apos;s global trade expansion , its military transparency , and its relations with &quot; misruling &quot; states . 
The political cost of a serious compromise on these matters would be too high for China , but it does no harm to analyze them and find ways to enhance dialogue . 
Among the three issues , military transparency seems to be the most sensitive and difficult to address . 
Nevertheless , given the large size of China &apos;s armed forces , which currently stands at 2.3 million , a rough calculation would indicate that monthly spending per soldier is at most 2,500 yuan on average - too low to recruit and retain competitive staff . 
But if China wants to raise the military budget to improve the quality of its army , the conflict with the demands of fiscal stability could make military transparency important for domestic reasons , and China might no longer view it as being off limits in its relations with the US . 
Above all , we must bear in mind the maturation of Sino-US relations in recent years . 
A mature bilateral relationship is one in which even difficult issues can be discussed routinely and promptly . 
There is no question that such a framework has already been established in relations with the US . 
We will now see how Hu uses that framework - and thus what imprint he leaves on the bilateral relationship - in meeting the current challenges .
