Stumbling in the Dark 
SAO PAULO - As well-intentioned gestures go , Earth Hour is hard to beat . 
At the stroke of 8 : 30 p.m. on Saturday , March 27 , nearly a billion people in more than 120 countries demonstrated their desire to do something about global warming by switching off their lights for an hour . 
In a show of official solidarity , the lights also went out at many of the planet &apos;s most iconic landmarks , from the Opera House in Sydney to the Great Pyramid at Giza , not to mention Beijing &apos;s Forbidden City , New York &apos;s Empire State Building , London &apos;s Big Ben , Paris &apos;s Eiffel Tower , and the skylines of both Hong Kong and Las Vegas . 
What ever else it may be , Earth Hour is surely one of the most successful publicity stunts ever dreamed up . 
First organized in Sydney , Australia , in 2007 by the local chapter of the World Wildlife Fund , its popularity and the level of participation ( both individual and official ) that generates has exploded in recent years - to the point that there is barely a corner of the earth that the campaign hasn &apos;t touched . 
As Greg Bourne , CEO of World Wildlife Fund in Australia , put it : &quot; We have everyone from Casablanca to the safari camps of Namibia and Tanzania taking part . &quot; 
But has Earth Hour actually done anything to halt - or even slow - global warming ? 
Not so much . 
The event &apos;s popularity is not hard to fathom . 
Who but the most die-hard global-warming denier could resist the notion , as Earth Hour &apos;s American website phrased it this year , that merely &quot; by flipping off your lights on March 27 at 8 : 30 p.m. local time you will be making the switch to a cleaner , more secure nation &quot; ? 
Needless to say , this was not quite the case . 
The main thing that anyone accomplished by turning off the lights at nighttime for an hour was to make it harder to see . 
The environmental impact was negligible . 
Indeed , even if everyone in the world had participated the requisite hour , the result would have been the equivalent of turning off China &apos;s carbon emissions for roughly 45 seconds . 
Of course , this wildly optimistic calculation assumes that nobody used more power afterwards . 
Recent research by two Canadian psychologists found that people who spent money on green products were , immediately afterwards , less likely to be generous and more likely to steal than those who bought non-green stuff . 
Apparently doing something virtuous - like turning off the lights- makes us feel entitled to act badly afterwards . 
The Earth Hour organizers acknowledged the symbolic nature of the exercise . 
Turning off the lights is just a &quot; call to action , &quot; they noted . 
As WWF Director-General James Leape explained , it provides &quot; a global platform for millions of people to voice their concern about the devastating effects of climate change . &quot; 
Added another WWF official , &quot; It &apos;s saying to our politicians , you can &apos;t give up on climate change . &quot; 
All well and good . 
In addition to being the guy who first came up with the idea for the event over drinks with friends in a Sydney pub several years ago , Ridley is also the executive director of Earth Hour Global , so he presumably speaks with some authority on the subject . 
&quot; What we &apos;re still looking for in this coming year , &quot; he told the Associated Press last week , &quot; is a global deal that encourages all countries to lower their emissions . &quot; 
Therein lies the big problem with Earth Hour . 
As much as we would like to believe otherwise , the fact is that carbon emissions won &apos;t be lowered by a deal . 
If that were politically possible , it would have been done a long time ago - if not at the 1992 &quot; Earth Summit &quot; in Rio de Janeiro , then in Kyoto 12 years later ; and if not in Kyoto , then in Copenhagen last December . 
But it wasn &apos;t . 
Surely , there is a lesson here . 
Alas , the organizers of Earth Hour prefer to ignore this inconvenient reality . 
If we are serious about wanting to solve global warming , we need to take action that actually does good - as opposed to wasting valuable resources on empty agreements and moral posturing that merely make us feel good . 
Switching off our lights and promising to cut carbon emissions may make us feel momentarily virtuous , but that &apos;s all it does . 
A meaningful solution to global warming needs to focus on clean-energy research and development , instead of fixating on empty promises of reductions in carbon emissions . 
For just 0.2 % of global GDP , or $ 100 billion a year , we could bring about the game-changing technological breakthroughs that will be required to make green energy cheap enough to fuel a carbon-free future . 
So let &apos;s stop stumbling around in the dark and do something meaningful for a brighter future .
