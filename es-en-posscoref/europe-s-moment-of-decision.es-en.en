Europe &apos;s Moment of Decision 
BRUSSELS  -  
When it comes to the treaty to reform the Union &apos;s institutions , which will be finalized in November , recent events suggest that amnesia does play a central role . 
Let &apos;s examine the &quot; illness &quot; that leads certain EU leaders with questionable scruples to forget even the recent past . 
Busy with domestic political affairs , they do not hesitate to use Europe as a scapegoat to avoid breaking bad news to their fellow citizens . 
Some display separatist tendencies that worry , and frustrate , their electorates . 
No surprise , then , that many EU citizens refuse , or at least hesitate , to embrace the European cause . 
This form of political racketeering may win elections , but it sabotages any opportunity to experience , or to perceive , politics as a process that can contribute to global development . 
Consider Gordon Brown , Britain &apos;s new prime minister , according to whom globalization strips the European project of any meaning , a form of political autism that in fact will prevent the EU from adapting to change and from being able to find solutions to globalization &apos;s challenges . 
Fortunately , openly anti-European political programs are not the norm , at least not yet . 
In fact , if , on the eve of the 2009 European Parliament elections , the new Reform Treaty enters into force , each member country will be forced to clarify and justify its position . 
The Treaty will be essential not only to the proper functioning of Europe &apos;s institutions , but also to their further &quot; deepening &quot; - something that many call for without necessarily really wanting to achieve . 
Thanks to &quot; reinforced cooperation , &quot; recalcitrant states will no longer hinder those seeking to make progress , and could even resort to an &quot; opt-out &quot; process and &quot; liberate &quot; themselves from the EU , perhaps by means of a referendum . 
Then there are those who believe that EU enlargement has prevented greater &quot; deepening , &quot; and who , with scant regard for the past or the future , argue that pursuing the latter requires abandoning the former . 
But who can reasonably claim to know what shape the EU will need to take to meet the challenges of the next 50 or 100 years ? 
Already , issues like climate change and energy supply demonstrate the futility of isolated national action and the critical importance of both deepening and enlarging the EU . 
Having suffered from disruptions in oil and gas supplies following disputes between Russia and Ukraine and then Belarus , the EU &apos;s members have finally understood that their survival depends on their capacity to diversify their energy sources . 
Further EU enlargement is undoubtedly in Turkey &apos;s interest , and in Europe &apos;s , too . 
In addition to the constructive role that Turkey could play , especially in the Middle East , its membership is vitally important in terms of energy . 
Moreover , admitting Turkey would demonstrate the EU &apos;s political consistency , while representing a qualitative step forward in the European project . 
For politicians like French President Nicolas Sarkozy , such considerations may be meaningless . 
But what if Turkey were to abandon its European ambitions and align itself strategically with Russia or even Iran ? 
The consequences for European security would be severe . 
Then there is Britain &apos;s political leadership , for whom enlargement is a way to avoid deepening , and , indeed , to dissolve political Europe . 
While such ideas are not for everyone , certain Continental countries secretly prefer Britain &apos;s disjointed scenarios , with some heads of governments even considering their countries &quot; commitments reversible . 
What , for example , should we make of Poland &apos;s governing Kaczynski brothers ? 
The quick-tempered twins took issue with the reform treaty &apos;s proposed voting system for the Council of Ministers , and then stole the limelight from papacy with their own homophobic declarations , proclamations that seem to exclude any possibility of integrating the EU &apos;s Charter of Rights into Poland &apos;s domestic law . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin may be the only one who welcomes this desertion from Europe &apos;s community of values . 
In this climate , Dutch Prime Minister Peter Balkenende , still bogged down in his country &apos;s &quot; no &quot; vote on the EU &apos;s draft constitutional treaty in 2005 , has been seeking to win British , Czech , and Polish support for measures to make it possible to diminish the EU &apos;s areas of responsibility . 
Indeed , he may not even object to ruining the EU &apos;s entire legislative engine by granting national parliaments a veto . 
What we Europeans now need most of all is to embark on precisely the opposite course . 
Only by enlarging the scope of EU decision-making , backed by the commitment of equally responsible partners , can Europe meet the shared challenges of a common future .
