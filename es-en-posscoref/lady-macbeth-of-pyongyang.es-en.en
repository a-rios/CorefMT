Lady Macbeth of Pyongyang 
TOKYO - North Korea &apos;s communist regime is , by most accounts , set to complete its second dynastic transfer of power , this time from Kim Jong-il , who has ruled since 1994 , to his youngest son , Kim Jong-eun . 
The general assembly of North Korea &apos;s Workers &quot; Party , now underway for the first time in 44 years , is the clearest sign yet that &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim , who is seriously ill , is passing the crown in the hermit kingdom founded by his father , Kim Il-sung . 
One reason why a dynastic succession is taking place is that Kim Il-sung created a national ideology , Juche , which mixes communism and autarky with a heavy dose of Confucian values . 
Confucianism exalts an idealized bond between father and son as the model for all human relations , including between ruler and ruled . 
So , just as a Confucian son &apos;s absolute duty is to revere his father , the absolute duty of a Confucian subject is to revere the ruler . 
Moreover , Kim Jong-il , like his father , has consistently appointed members of his family to positions of power . 
Indeed , Kim Jong-eun , the third son of Kim Jong-il and his late consort Ko Young-hee , was mooted as his father &apos;s successor almost a year ago . 
North Korean propagandists proclaim Kim Jong-eun &quot; the Young General , &quot; but whether he will exercise the same absolutist authority as his father is an open question . 
Not only is he young and inexperienced , but his aunt , Kim Kyong-hui , Kim Jong-il &apos;s sister and the wife of the second-ranking figure in North Korea &apos;s hierarchy , Chang Song-taek , may balk at power slipping through her fingers . 
Although rarely seen or heard , Kim Kyong-hui , born on May 30 , 1946 to Kim Il-sung and his first wife Kim Jong-suk , has served in a range of key Workers &quot; Party positions , including deputy director of the International Department and director of the Light Industry Department . 
She became a member of the all-powerful Central Committee in 1988 - a post she retains to this day . 
Kim Kyong-hui &apos;s birth mother died when she was four . 
After her father , Kim Il-sung , remarried , she was raised by various surrogates away from the family . 
Observing the relationship between her father and stepmother , and their affection toward her half brothers , she is said to have become embittered and developed a fierce personality . 
Indeed , Kim Jong-il is quoted as saying : &quot; When my sister turns violent , no one can stop her . 
Even I can do nothing . &quot; 
When Kim Jong-il started living with his second wife , Kim Kyong-hui sought to incite trouble , driven by a sense of rivalry . 
After marrying Chang Song-taek , she began living something of a hedonistic life herself , but she scrutinized her husband &apos;s conduct minutely , flying into a jealous rage over the slightest signs of infidelity . 
Kim Jong-il has described his sister as &quot; my only blood family whom I was asked to take care of by my mother till the moment she died . &quot; 
Their mother , Kim Jong-suk , is said to have died from hemorrhaging while giving premature birth caused by her distress over Kim Il-sung &apos;s love affair with Kim Song-ae . 
Kim Il-sung reportedly rushed to the hospital , but the door to her room was locked . 
When she died , her doctor and Kim Jong-il were the only people present . 
But Chan Giryok , who was Kim Jong-suk &apos;s primary doctor and is now a doctor at Nagoya University in Japan , tells a different story . 
According to Chan , Kim Jong-suk was at Kim Il-sung &apos;s Pyongyang home near the Soviet Embassy , quarreling with him . 
Watching from afar , the doctor saw Kim Il-sung holding a pistol . 
The doctor , who was a surgeon , not an obstetrician , questioned the wisdom of summoning him to treat excessive bleeding from a premature delivery . 
He believes that he was summoned to treat bleeding caused by something else . 
Kim Jong-il , who is known to have had a powerful attachment to his birth mother , cannot help but have been psychologically affected by witnessing his mother &apos;s killing . 
From the moment of his mother &apos;s death , he kept his young sister close to him at all times . 
Indeed , in a country where trust rarely exists , Kim Kyong-hui is the only blood relation whom Kim Jong-il has ever fully trusted . 
Moreover , the two share the same lineage of the Great Leader , or Suryong , linked to Kim Jong-suk on the maternal side , and are fully devoted to the absolute supremacy of the Suryong and hereditary succession . 
Speaking before the Central Committee after Kim Il-sung &apos;s death , Kim Jong-il said , &quot; Kim Kyong-hui is myself , the words of Kim Kyong-hui are my words , and instructions issued by Kim Kyong-hui are my instructions . &quot; 
Kim Kyong-hui &apos;s intent to exercise power after her brother &apos;s passing is supported by rumors that she helped arrange a traffic accident in June that killed Ri Je-gang , a senior party official and perceived guardian of Kim Jong-eun who reportedly attempted to oust Kim Kyong-hui and her close allies from power . 
Whether true or not , such rumors indicate the magnitude of her influence . 
There is , indeed , a growing belief that Kim Jong-il might , at any moment , designate Kim Kyong-hui to serve as a caretaker for the third-generation successor after his death . 
The threat from North Korea has always been that it might start another war , whether by miscalculation or design . 
Whether Kim Jong-eun or Kim Kyong-hui intend to soldier on in desperate isolation , or to bring in economic change , they lack the revolutionary credentials and grip on power needed to do so . 
So when Kim Jong-il passes from the scene , and political instability meets economic blight , the regime could fall apart . 
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has wisely begun to prepare for that contingency by proposing a special &quot; Unification Tax &quot; to help pay the costs of the Kim dynasty &apos;s eventual disintegration . 
Japan and the rest of Asia should prepare for that day as well .
