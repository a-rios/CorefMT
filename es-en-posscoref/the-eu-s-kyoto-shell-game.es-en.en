The EU &apos;s Kyoto Shell Game 
RIGA - With each passing year , the impending crisis of global warming looms closer and closer . 
Time is running out for preventative action to be taken . 
The European Union &apos;s &quot; 20-20-20 &quot; mantra aims to cut greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions by 20 % relative to their level in 1990 and to increase the share of renewable resources to 20 % by the year 2020 . 
Is it really viable ? 
The EU seemingly has a long-term record of championing action to prevent climate change . 
In 1994 , the EU committed itself to the GHG reductions set forth by the Kyoto Protocol and ratified it in 2002 . 
The EU-15 promised an 8 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2010 . 
Every the industrial nation that has not ratified the Kyoto protocol , first and foremost the United States , has been criticized for being &quot; environmentally irresponsible . &quot; 
Only five of the EU-15 countries are on track to meet their targets . 
The EU-15 could , under the best of circumstances , reduce its emissions by 4.6 % by 2010 . 
The failure of the EU-15 to meet its Kyoto target does not come as a big surprise . 
However , what is surprising is that the EU-15 have managed to market their failure as a success . 
When the 20-20-20 commitment was adopted in March 2007 , the decision was much trumpeted and sold to the public as another success for EU climate change policy . 
Then EU Council President Angela Merkel called it &quot; a breakthrough , &quot; and European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso proclaimed it &quot; the most ambitious package ever . &quot; 
However , when it came to sharing the burden of emissions reduction among EU member states , the European Commission proposed in January 2008 to change the base year from 1990 to 2005 . 
This approach - endorsed as a basis for negotiation in the recent EU Council - amounted to allowing some member states not to fulfill their supposedly binding Kyoto burden-sharing targets . 
The reason was simple : The EU-12 - the new members admitted in 2004 - have been outperforming the EU-15 . 
The new members have not agreed to a collective Kyoto goal , but as a group they are projected to reduce emissions relative to 1990 by around 20 % by 2010 . 
Latvia , Lithuania , and Estonia have , for example , managed to more than halve their 1990 emissions by 2005 . 
This can partly be attributed to the collapse of heavily polluting Soviet-style industry . 
By sacrificing the needs of growing economies that have met their goals to those of more established markets , the Commission is rewarding inefficiency and reducing the effectiveness of the European Union &apos;s climate change policy and its common market . 
With the EU-15 comprising around 80 % of all EU GHG emissions , these countries should be the ones taking a leading role in EU climate change policy . It is past time that they step up their efforts .
