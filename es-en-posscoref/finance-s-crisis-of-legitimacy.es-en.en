Finance &apos;s Crisis of Legitimacy 
WASHINGTON , DC - The recent departure of Robert Diamond from Barclays marks a watershed . 
To be sure , CEOs of major banks have been forced out before . 
Chuck Prince lost his job at Citigroup over excessive risk-taking in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 , and , more recently , Oswald Grübel of UBS was pushed out for failing to prevent unauthorized trading to the tune of $ 2.3 billion . 
But Diamond was a banker supposedly at the top of his game . 
Barclays , it was claimed , had come through the 2008-2009 crisis without benefiting from government support . 
Press reports indicate that regulators were willing to give Diamond a free pass - right up to the moment when a serious political backlash took hold . 
Diamond started to fight back , pointing an accusatory finger at the Bank of England . 
At that point , he had to go . 
There are three broader lessons of Diamond &apos;s demise at Barclays . 
First , the political backlash was not from backbenchers or uninformed spectators on the margins of the mainstream . 
Top politicians from all parties in the United Kingdom were united in condemning Barclays &quot; actions , particularly with regard to its systemic cheating on the reporting of interest rates , exposed in the Libor scandal . 
( The London Interbank Offered Rate is a key benchmark for borrowing and lending around the world , including for the pricing of derivatives ) . 
Indeed , Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne went so far as to say , &quot; Fraud is a crime in ordinary business ; why shouldn &apos;t it be so in banking ? &quot; 
His clear implication is that fraud was committed at Barclays - a serious allegation from Britain &apos;s finance minister . 
After five years of global financial-sector scandals on a grand scale , patience is wearing thin . 
As Eduardo Porter of The New York Times put it , 
&quot; Bigger markets allow bigger frauds . 
Bigger companies , with more complex balance sheets , have more places to hide them . 
Second , Diamond apparently thought that he could take on the British establishment . 
His staff leaked the contents of a conversation he claimed to have had with Paul Tucker , a senior Bank of England official , suggesting that the BoE had told Barclays to report inaccurate interest-rate numbers . 
Diamond apparently forgot that the continued existence of any bank with a balance sheet that is large relative to its home economy - and its ability to earn a return for shareholders - depends entirely on maintaining a good relationship with regulators . 
Barclays has total assets of around $ 2.5 trillion - roughly the size of the UK &apos;s annual GDP - and is either the fifth- or eighth-largest bank in the world , depending on how one measures balance sheets . 
Banks at this scale benefit from huge implicit government guarantees ; this is what it means to be &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
Diamond apparently believed his own rhetoric - that he and his bank are critical to economic prosperity in the UK . 
The regulators called his bluff and forced him to resign . 
Barclays &quot; stock price rose slightly on the news . 
The final lesson is that the big showdowns between democracy and big bankers are still to come - both in the United States and in continental Europe . 
On the surface , the banks remain powerful , yet their legitimacy continues to crumble . 
Jamie Dimon , CEO of JP Morgan Chase , presided this year over reckless risk-taking to the tune of nearly $ 6 billion ( we might call it a &quot; three Grübel &quot; debacle ) , yet his job apparently remains secure . 
Dimon even remains on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , despite the fact that the New York Fed is deeply involved in the investigation not only of JP Morgan Chase &apos;s trading losses , but also of its potential involvement in the broadening Libor scandal . 
As Dennis Kelleher , the president of the advocacy group Better Markets , documented in recent congressional testimony , two years after the passage of the Dodd-Frank legislation , the US banking system continues to fight hard - and effectively - to undermine meaningful reform . 
( Kelleher &apos;s testimony is a must-read assessment , as is his opening statement to the hearing ) . 
But progress is nonetheless being made . 
Dimon is the public face of megabanks &quot; resistance to reform ; repeated and public egg on this particular face strengthens those who want to rein in these banks &quot; excessive and irresponsible risk-taking . 
Meanwhile , the European situation looks explosive . 
The European Union &apos;s approach to bank regulation encouraged financial institutions to load up on government debt - supposedly a &quot; risk-free &quot; asset . 
Now , given the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery , government defaults threaten to take down the big banks . 
The European Central Bank has provided a great deal of emergency &quot; liquidity &quot; funding to banks , which they use to buy even more government debt . 
Banks and politics are deeply intertwined in all advanced economies . 
Diamond discovered that , ultimately , politicians trump bankers - at least in the UK . 
But what really matters is legitimacy and informed public opinion . 
Do you really believe the increasingly dubious notion that megabanks , as currently constituted , are good for the rest of the private sector , and thus for economic growth and job creation ? 
Or do you begin to consider more seriously the increasingly mainstream proposition that global megabanks and their leaders have simply become too powerful and dangerous ?
