Historical Memory and Engineering Failures 
George Santayana , the Spanish-American poet and philosopher , once warned that &quot; Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . &quot; 
This is especially true in the field of bridge building , where over the past 150 years dramatic failures have occurred at surprisingly regular intervals . 
In 1847 , the first major structural failure on Britain &apos;s expanding railway network occurred at Chester , England . 
The Dee Bridge , whose cast- and wrought-iron design followed common practice for the period , collapsed under a passing train , killing everyone aboard . 
Subsequent investigation revealed that the structure , the longest of its kind , simply pushed the limits of railroad-bridge engineering too far . 
In 1879 , the longest bridge in the world spanned the River Tay at Dundee , Scotland . 
Composed of many modest spans , the structure involved no radically new design concepts and seemed to be a mere application of proven technology . 
However , the force of the wind was grossly underestimated and worksmanship was inferior . 
As a result , the Tay Bridge , vulnerable in a gale , was blown off its supports . 
In 1907 , the longest span in the world was being constructed over the St. Lawrence River near Quebec , Canada . 
The bridge was of a relatively new type , known as a cantilever , which had become quite fashionable . 
Although it was only slightly longer than the highly successful cantilever bridge over the Forth River near Edinburgh , Scotland , the Quebec Bridge was so inadequately designed that it collapsed before it was completed . 
In 1940 , the third longest suspension bridge in the world was opened in Washington State . 
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was designed as state of the art , which included a strong aesthetic preference for slender structures . 
Within four months of its opening , the bridge was destroyed by winds in a manner totally unanticipated by its engineers . 
In 1970 , steel box-girder bridges in Milford Haven , Wales , and in Melbourne , Australia , failed spontaneously while under construction . 
Both were among the longest structures of their kind and were thought to be just natural applications of existing technology . 
In 2000 , the much-anticipated opening of London &apos;s Millennium Bridge over the River Thames was followed only three days later by its closure . 
The sleek footbridge swayed unexpectedly and excessively under the feet of pedestrians , and it was deemed too dangerous to use . 
What should have been a mere extension of the millennia-old art of building pedestrian bridges , proved to be a modern engineering embarrassment . 
The thirty-year interval between historic bridge failures was first highlighted by the work of Paul Sibly , who wrote a thesis on the subject , and his University of London advisor , A. C. Walker . 
They noted the cyclical regularity of such occurrences and speculated that it represented a gap in communications between generations of engineers . 
Although each of the notable failures involved a different type of bridge , in no case was the structure radically new . 
Each used technology that engineers had been confidently employing for bridges , and for which the assumed loads and methods of analysis were well established . 
In every case , engineers believed that they were just building incrementally on successful practice . 
In fact , designing in a climate of success can be dangerous for an engineer . 
Successful experience teaches us only that what has been accomplished in the past has worked . 
But things that work on a small scale do not necessarily work when slightly larger . 
This was known to Vitruvius , who wrote about Greek and Roman engineering more than 2,000 years ago . 
It was also known to Galileo , who noted that Renaissance engineers who followed successful methods of building ships and moving obelisks were often surprised by the spontaneous failures when tried with larger ships and obelisks . 
Failures always reveal weaknesses and provide incontrovertible evidence of our incomplete understanding of how things work . 
When the failures described above occurred , engineers were sensitized to their own limitations and so approached subsequent designs - no matter of what kind of bridge - with renewed respect for the laws and forces of nature . 
Unfortunately , human memory fades with time , and new generations of engineers with no vivid experience of past failures can proceed with hubris to design again beyond wise limits . 
The history of engineering is no mere adjunct to technical know-how . 
A historical perspective on bridge building or any other engineering specialty provides a caveat about how our humanity affects our thinking . 
Building a new bridge following a familiar model can lead to complacency . 
Building a novel bridge , especially in the wake of a spectacular failure , forces engineers to think from scratch and also to think more deeply and critically . 
Hence , the paradox that success leads to failure , and failure leads to success . 
The cable-stayed bridge is a form that is currently being pushed to limits and beyond those originally imagined to apply to it . 
Widespread successes with cable-stayed structures have made the type almost commonplace . 
As such , its development into ever longer spans is following the historic pattern that in the past has led to failures . 
Whether there will be a major cable-stayed bridge failure soon - or around the year 2030 - will most likely depend not so much on computer analyses as on how well engineers know their history and are determined not to repeat it .
