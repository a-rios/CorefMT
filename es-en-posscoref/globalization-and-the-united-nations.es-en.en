Globalization and the United Nations 
After the disastrous month of September , when terrorist attacks and retaliation contributed to storm clouds over the global economy , November demonstrated the resilience of globalization . 
The global economic downturn has led most of the world to rally together , not only in the hunt for the terrorists , but in reinforcing global cooperation . 
Several events in November give hope for a stronger international community , with consequent economic benefits . 
First , more than 100 countries assembled in Marrakech , Morocco , to complete a unique UN agreement to limit global climate change . 
These countries agreed to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases in order to slow the process of global warming . 
Yes , the US is not yet a party to the agreement - even though America is the world &apos;s biggest single contributor to greenhouse gas emissions . 
Yet the fact that the world could agree despite the absence of the US may prove promising . 
No single country , even the largest economy in the world , can stop the cooperation of others . 
Sometime soon , the US is likely to rejoin these international discussions . 
Second , the world community welcomed China as a member of the World Trade Organization . 
For hundreds of years , China held itself aloof from the world economy . 
Then , in the middle of the 19 th century , China suffered at the hands of European imperial powers , which gained technological and industrial superiority over China , using this to force trading concessions from the Ching Dynasty . 
For more than a century after that , China was in turmoil . 
Only 20 years ago did China decide to rejoin the world trading system . 
This month &apos;s entry of China into the WTO is a major step in that process . 
China has now rejoined the world community as a cooperative , stable , and powerful sovereign nation , which will be one of the leading trading countries in the years ahead . 
Third , more than 140 nations agreed in Doha , Qatar to launch a new round of trade negotiations . 
After years of global protests about free trade , the world &apos;s nations chose trade over protectionism . 
Importantly , developing countries achieved several breakthroughs in the new trade agenda . 
Poor countries won concessions on access to essential medicines ; and they pressed for , and received , promises that rich countries would address protectionist policies in several areas . 
Fourth , the war in Afghanistan has not only proceeded rapidly on the ground , but has led to a diplomatic breakthrough as well . 
The UN will play a central role in the reconstruction of a working government in that country , and in coordinating humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people . 
The growing role of the UN in this process puts the seal of international law and diplomacy over the global struggle against terrorism , and helps to reassure many countries that this is a true international effort , not just the US acting alone . 
While these seem to be a grab-bag of achievements , they point to a single message : the world community is finding new ways to cooperate , even against a backdrop of terrorism and global recession . 
The growing role of international institutions under the UN umbrella provides greater confidence that disputes can be addressed peacefully and even sensibly , with significant inputs of scientific expertise as in the Climate Change treaty . 
No country wants to be outside of this global process . 
China &apos;s membership in the WTO is sure to be followed by Russia &apos;s membership in the coming years . 
Academic scholars and political observers debate whether globalization is a real phenomenon or a slogan ; whether globalization is beneficial or harmful ; and whether globalization is a fragile process that could be reversed or a robust process likely to gather force in the coming years . 
My view is that globalization is a powerful and generally positive force . 
It offers countries the gains from increased international trade , faster diffusion of technologies to mutual benefit , and hopes for less cross-country violence and conflict . 
The agreements in November suggest that most of the world shares such hopes , and is ready to commit political resources into the success of the process . 
Of course globalization requires international governance and rules . 
It cannot be a game of rich against poor . 
It cannot function without international law and international institutions . 
Therefore the preeminence of UN institutions in so many events in November is notable . 
The UN has shown its value in global environmental management , international trade , state building and reconstruction , and humanitarian assistance . 
UN agencies will have a critical role to play in future years in helping Africa &apos;s impoverished countries ( and those elsewhere ) to derive larger benefits from globalization . 
This month , in short , has been a fitting prelude to the happy occasion on December 13 th when UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the United Nations organization itself share this year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , Norway . 
The prize is a fitting measure of the role that the UN now plays and must continue to play in promoting a successful and peaceful globalization .
