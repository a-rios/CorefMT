Obama &apos;s Recovery ? 
CAMBRIDGE - With November &apos;s election in the United States fast approaching , the Republican candidates seeking to challenge President Barack Obama claim that his policies have done nothing to support recovery from the recession that he inherited in January 2009 . 
Obama &apos;s Democratic defenders counter that his policies staved off a second Great Depression , and that the US economy has been steadily working its way out of a deep hole ever since . 
Middle-ground observers , meanwhile , typically conclude that one cannot settle the debate , because one cannot know what would have happened otherwise . 
There is a good case to be made that government policies - while not strong enough to return the economy rapidly to health - did halt an accelerating economic decline . 
But the middle-ground observers are right that one cannot prove what would have happened otherwise . 
It is also true that it is rare for a government &apos;s policies to have a major impact on the economy immediately . 
But here is the remarkable thing : whether one listens to the Republicans , the Democrats , or the middle-ground observers , one gets the impression that economic statistics show no discernible improvement around the time that Obama took office . 
In fact , the reality could hardly be more different . 
This is especially true if one looks at revised data , which show the US economy to have been in far worse shape in January 2009 than was reported at the time . 
In January 2009 , the annualized growth rate in the second half of 2008 was officially estimated to have been -2.2 % ; but current figures reveal the contraction to have been much sharper - a horrendous -6.3 % . 
This is the main reason why economic activity in 2009 and 2010 was so much lower than had been forecast - and why unemployment was so much higher . 
The maximum rate of economic contraction - a veritable freefall - came in the last quarter of 2008 . 
More specifically , according to the monthly GDP estimates from the highly respected forecaster Macroeconomic Advisers , it came in December - the month before Obama was inaugurated . 
As the graphs below plainly show , the growth trajectory miraculously reversed as soon as Obama &apos;s term began , yielding a clear &quot; V &quot; pattern in 2008-09 . 
The full force of the fiscal stimulus package began to go into effect in the second quarter of 2009 , with the US National Bureau of Economic Research officially designating the end of the recession as having come in June of that year . 
Real GDP growth turned positive in the third quarter , but slowed again in late 2010 and early 2011 , which coincides with the beginning of the withdrawal of the Obama administration &apos;s fiscal stimulus . 
Other economic indicators , such as interest-rate spreads and the rate of job loss , also turned around in early 2009 . 
Labor-market recovery normally lags behind that of GDP - hence the &quot; jobless recoveries &quot; of recent decades . 
But official data on monthly job losses and gains reveal an obvious V-shape here , too : as the graph below shows , the end of the free-fall for private-sector employment came precisely when Obama was inaugurated . 
Again , such data do not demonstrate that Obama &apos;s policies yielded an immediate payoff . 
In addition to the lags in policies &quot; effects , many other factors influence the economy every month , making it difficult to disentangle the true causes underlying particular outcomes . 
Given that difficulty , the right way to assess whether the fiscal stimulus enacted in January 2009 had a positive impact is to start with common sense . 
When the government spends $ 800 billion on such things as highway construction , salaries for teachers and policemen who were about to be laid off , and so on , it has an effect . 
Workers who otherwise would not have a job now have one , and may spend some of their income on goods and services produced by other people , creating a multiplier effect . 
Those who claim that this spending does not boost income and employment ( or that it causes harm ) apparently believe that as soon as a teacher is laid off , a new job is created somewhere else in the economy , or even that the same teacher finds a new job right away . 
Neither can be true , not with unemployment so high and the average spell of unemployment much longer than usual . 
They also believe that the government deficit drives up inflation and interest rates , thereby crowding out other spending by consumers and firms . 
But interest rates are at rock-bottom levels - even lower than in January 2009 - while core inflation has slowed to a pace unseen since the early 1960 &quot; s . 
The conditions of the last four years - high unemployment , depressed output , low inflation , and low interest rates - are precisely those for which traditional &quot; Keynesian &quot; remedies were designed . 
Economists &quot; more sophisticated forecasting models also show that the fiscal stimulus had an important positive effect , for much the same reasons as the common-sense approach . 
The non-partisan US Congressional Budget Office reports that the 2009 spending increase and tax cuts gave a positive boost to the economy , and indeed had the extra multiplier effects predicted by traditional Keynesian models . 
Allowing for a wide range of uncertainty , the CBO estimates that the stimulus added 1.5-3.5 % to GDP by the fourth quarter , relative to where it otherwise would have been . 
The boost to 2010 GDP , when the peak effect of the stimulus kicked in , was roughly twice as great . 
Of course , econometric models do not much interest most of the public . 
A turnaround needs to be visible to the naked eye to impress voters . 
Given this , one can only wonder why basic charts , such as the 2008-2009 &quot; V &quot; shape in growth and employment , have not been used - and reused - to make the case .
