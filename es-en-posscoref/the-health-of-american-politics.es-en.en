The Health of American Politics 
CAMBRIDGE - When the United States Congress approved President Barack Obama &apos;s plan to extend health-care coverage to nearly all Americans , it marked the most important social legislation the country had seen since the 1960 &quot; s . 
While Republican opposition remains strong , the law was a major domestic political victory for Obama . 
Its enactment also has broader implications , because , like Obama &apos;s election in 2008 , it addresses questions about the health of America &apos;s political system . 
After all , it was once widely asserted that an African-American without a political machine could not become president . 
Recently , many observers argued that America &apos;s gridlocked political system would prevent the country from translating its abundant power resources into leadership . 
As one perceptive journalist recently argued , &quot; America still has the means to address nearly any of its structural weaknesses ... energy use , medical costs , the right educational and occupational mix to rebuild a robust middle class . 
That is the American tragedy of the early 21st century : a vital and self-renewing culture that attracts the world &apos;s talent and a governing system that increasingly looks like a joke . &quot; 
Power conversion - translating power resources into effective influence - is a long-standing problem for the US . 
In foreign policy , the US Constitution has always invited the president and Congress to struggle for control . 
Strong economic and ethnic pressure groups fight for their self-interested definitions of the national interest . 
Congress always pays attention to squeaky wheels , and special interests press it to legislate foreign-policy tactics , codes of conduct , and sanctions for other countries . 
As Henry Kissinger once noted , &quot; what is presented by foreign critics as America &apos;s quest for domination is very frequently a response to domestic pressure groups . &quot; 
The cumulative effect , Kissinger continued , &quot; drives American foreign policy toward unilateral and bullying conduct . 
There is also a concern about the decline of public confidence in US institutions . 
As former Clinton administration official William Galston put it , &quot; trust is never more important than when citizens are asked to make sacrifices for a brighter future . 
Mistrust of the government making this request could be the harbinger - even the cause - of national decline . &quot; 
The US was founded in part on mistrust of government , and a long tradition traceable to Thomas Jefferson holds that Americans should not worry too much about low levels of confidence in government . 
When asked not about day-to-day governance but about the underlying constitutional framework , the public is positive . 
Indeed , if you ask Americans where the best place to live is , 80 % say the US . 
Few people believe that the system is rotten and must be overthrown . 
Some aspects of the current mood are probably cyclical , while others represent discontent with political bickering and deadlock . 
True , when compared to the recent past , party politics has become more polarized . 
Moreover , the sharpest decline occurred more than four decades ago , in the late 1960 &quot; s and early 1970 &quot; s . 
This does not imply that expressions of declining confidence in government are not problematic . 
Whatever the reasons for the decline , if the public becomes unwilling to provide such crucial resources as tax dollars , or to comply voluntarily with laws , or if bright young people refuse to go into government service , governmental capacity will be impaired and people will become more dissatisfied with it . 
A climate of distrust can also trigger extreme actions by deviant members of the population , such as the bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City in 1995 . 
So far , such behavioral results do not seem to have materialized . 
The Internal Revenue Service sees no increase in tax cheating . 
By many accounts , government officials have become less corrupt than in earlier decades , and the World Bank gives the US a high score ( above the 90th percentile ) on &quot; control of corruption . &quot; 
Moreover , after a 40-year drop in voting rates in presidential elections , from 62 % to 50 % , the decline stopped in 2000 , and returned to 58 % in 2008 . 
Citizens &quot; behavior does not seem to have changed as dramatically as have their responses to poll questions . 
Three-quarters of Americans feel connected to their communities , and say the quality of life there is excellent or good ; 40 % say working with others in their community is the most important thing that they can do . 
In recent years , American politics and political institutions have become more polarized than the distribution of opinions in the American public would suggest . 
The situation was exacerbated by the economic downturn after 2008 . 
As an editorial in The Economist recently concluded , &quot; America &apos;s political system was designed to make legislation at the federal level difficult , not easy . 
Its founders believed that a country the size of America is best governed locally , not nationally .... So the basic system works ; but that is no excuse for ignoring areas where it could be reformed , &quot; such as the gerrymandered safe seats in the House of Representatives and the blocking procedures of Senate rules and filibusters . 
Whether the American political system can reform itself and cope with such problems remains to be seen . 
Obama &apos;s health-care victory , like his 2008 election , suggests that America &apos;s political system is not as broken as critics who draw analogies to the fall of Rome or other empires would have us believe .
