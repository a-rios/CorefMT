Is Democracy Possible in the Arab World ? 
With Iraq rapidly descending into bloody chaos , the prospects for holding successful democratic elections in January , as the US and the Iraqi interim government have promised , look bleak . 
Some skeptics go further , arguing that the Iraq debacle proves that prospects for democracy throughout the Arab world are dim . 
Are they right ? 
Half the world &apos;s countries are democracies , yet none of the 22 Arab countries is among them . 
The United Nations &apos; Arab Human Development Report is frank in its criticism of the region &apos;s economic and social progress . 
Economic growth has been slow , approximately half of women are illiterate , and the region is not well integrated into the world economy . 
Indeed , with a population of more than 300 million , Arab countries export less to the world , excluding oil and gas , than Finland . 
An enormous &quot; youth bulge &quot; in the Arab world &apos;s demographic tables looms , with 45 % of the population now under the age of 14 , and the population as a whole set to double over the next quarter-century . 
Yet the region has inadequate opportunities for young people to find meaningful work . 
Unemployment hovers at 20 % . 
At the same time , the Middle East is awash with modern communications , much of it with an anti-Western slant . 
During the Cold War , America &apos;s approach to the Middle East was to foster stability in order to prevent the spread of Soviet influence , ensure the supply of oil , and provide security for Israel . 
The American strategy was management through autocratic leaders , and a &quot; don &apos;t rock the boat &quot; approach . 
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Bush administration launched an ambitious new policy to encourage a democratic transformation of the Middle East . 
Saddam Hussein &apos;s removal was intended as only the first step . 
In August 2003 , US National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice argued that &quot; much as a democratic Germany became a linchpin of a new Europe that is today whole , free , and at peace , so a transformed Iraq can become a key element in a very different Middle East in which the ideologies of hate will not flourish . &quot; 
Germany and Japan were , indeed , postwar success stories . 
But both were relatively homogeneous societies with significant middle classes and no organized resistance to American occupation . 
Yet both transitions still took nearly a decade . 
Moreover , Iraq &apos;s possession of oil is a mixed blessing , because few oil-based economies have proven hospitable to liberal democracy . 
Moreover , cultural differences between the US and Germany were not as great as those between the US and the Middle East . 
Of course , cultural barriers are not insurmountable : democracy has taken root in Japan , South Korea , and in other Muslim countries , such as Turkey , Indonesia , and Bangladesh . 
But the time horizons required for a fundamental makeover are measured in decades , not years . 
Democracy is , after all , more than mere voting . 
Since the Middle East &apos;s autocratic regimes destroyed their liberal oppositions , in many countries radical Islamists represent the only dissent , feeding on widespread resentment of corrupt regimes , opposition to American policies , and popular fears of modernization and globalization . 
At the same time , the global economy and modernization can also promise better education , more jobs and opportunities , and improved health care , and opinion polls indicate that a majority of the region &apos;s population desires these benefits . 
Given ambivalence among Arab moderates , there remains a chance to isolate the extremists and gradually build stable polities with broader participation . 
To achieve this will require policies that open up economies , reduce bureaucratic controls , speed economic growth , improve educational systems , and encourage the types of gradual political changes now seen in small countries like Bahrain , Oman , Jordan , Kuwait , and Morocco . 
Japan and Korea demonstrated that democracy could be combined with indigenous values in Asia . 
The Arab world , too , can develop intellectuals , social groups , and eventually countries with liberal economies and societies that are consistent with local cultures . 
But this will take time and patience - and it will need to be accompanied by policy changes on Iraq , Palestine-Israel , and the regional economy . 
Equally important will be whether Western countries cooperate to create a long-term strategy of cultural and educational exchanges that can help develop a richer and more open civil society in Middle Eastern countries . 
The most effective advocates for democratic change are not American or European officials , but citizens of the region who understand Western virtues as well as flaws - and can adapt them to indigenous conditions to press for social change . 
Corporations , foundations , universities , and other non-profit organizations can promote much of this work . 
Companies and foundations can offer technology to help modernize Arab educational systems and take them beyond rote learning . 
Western universities can host more students and faculty . 
Other organizations can support specific institutions in Arab countries , or programs that enhance the professionalism of journalists . 
But governments also have an important role to play . 
By supporting the teaching of foreign languages and financing student exchanges , they can help people in the region accomplish their own goals as spelled out in the Arab Human Development Report . 
There are many strands to an effective long-term strategy to promote conditions for stability and broader political participation in the Arab world . 
This is America &apos;s declared goal .
