The Quest for Investment 
The Hong Kong meeting of the Doha Round of trade negotiations has left a palpable sense of frustration in the developing world over the slow pace of agricultural liberalization agreed to by the rich countries . 
It may thus appear naive and counterproductive to raise the bar and suggest that we need to go beyond trade and move investment to the top of our priority list . 
Yet can any &quot; development round &quot; worthy of its name ignore this challenge ? 
It had originally been intended that the Doha Round would address investment , but the developing countries chose to downgrade the issue and concentrate on agriculture instead . 
This tactic has proven to be a two-edged sword . 
In China , Brazil , Malaysia , and Mexico , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) accounts for 8 % to 12 % of gross fixed capital formation - without generating debt . 
Although the least developed countries attract less than 3 % of north-south investments , these flows account for more than 3 % of their GDP , a level higher than the average for developing countries . 
In hopes of stimulating FDI , bilateral agreements have multiplied , but they rarely lead to balanced commitments . 
Competition among countries to attract investors is intense , and only a few , such as China or India , are able to negotiate on equal terms with the industrialized world . 
The developing countries , therefore , have an interest in calling for multilateral dialogue on investment conditions in order to obtain certain collective guarantees . 
Indeed , without returning to the illusion of economic planning , these countries need to be able to set conditions for foreign investors that aim to maximize the local impact on employment , technological diffusion , strategic partnerships , and so forth . 
At the same time , developing countries may need to promote local private sectors and &quot; infant industries &quot; through temporary protectionist measures , which would help them to upgrade their output on the road to liberalization . 
There is nothing heretical about such proposals . 
After all , the developed countries have done much the same thing . 
In the nineteenth century , the United States restricted foreign investment in several sectors , including finance . 
Today , both the US and the European Union keep a close watch on international acquisitions . 
The emerging countries of Asia similarly depart from the pure liberal model . 
Even Ireland , the champion of economic liberalization , has now turned to a more selective approach . 
Refusal to recognize the legitimacy of such strategies caused the collapse of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment in 1998 , after three years of negotiations between the OECD countries . 
The project was perceived - rightly so - as amounting to a surrender of sovereignty , because it introduced a rigid principle of non-discrimination between foreign and local companies that would eliminate the host country &apos;s room for maneuver without offering anything in return . 
Such a prospect would be even less acceptable to developing countries . 
Under what conditions can one reasonably hope to restart a multilateral agreement on investment ? 
To be viable , such an agreement must recognize the legitimate need for some regulation . 
It would also need to help poor countries cope with the quasi-generalization of &quot; social and environmental responsibility &quot; standards that are increasingly shaping corporate practices and consumer demand . 
It should incorporate an investor code of ethics , as well as a formula for sharing the costs of implementing such standards among the state , foreign operators , and local sub-contractors . 
Of course , imposing the same investment conditions in all countries could take away the incentive to invest in the least attractive of them . 
But an agreement could be reached to establish categories of countries , the most important aim being to prevent dumping between countries that are at the same stage of development . 
To succeed , a multilateral negotiation would also need to address the expectations of foreign operators , who want assurances that their investments are safe . 
An agreement should contain provisions to improve the business environment - its transparency and predictability - by setting a framework for state intervention without stripping government of its prerogatives . 
This would reduce the probability of crises while putting in place mechanisms for cost-sharing should they occur . 
No multilateral investment agreement will be able to address all of the institutional problems and market failures that prevent capital from flowing to developing countries . 
Some economists point to imperfect information , which precludes companies from considering the higher returns on investment available in the developing world . 
If this view is correct , an agreement could create new instruments for disseminating information , while signaling poor countries &quot; commitment to welcoming FDI . 
Other analysts point to the increasing returns that accompany greater concentration of investment - a force that works to the disadvantage of poor countries . 
At the very least , a multilateral negotiation would provide an occasion to recognize the existence of the problem , reflect on how best to coordinate investments , and help move development assistance accordingly . 
Despite the complexity involved and the need for technical assistance to the weakest nations in the negotiation , a multilateral investment agreement should be among the top priorities on the international agenda . 
Indeed , whereas agricultural trade issues put rich and poor countries &quot; national interests on a collision course , promoting investment flows to the developing world could unify all countries around a shared objective .
