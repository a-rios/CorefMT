A Fair Deal on Climate Change 
The agreement on climate change reached at Heiligendamm by the G8 leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come : how will we divide up the diminishing capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases ? 
The G8 leaders agreed to seek &quot; substantial &quot; cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give &quot; serious consideration &quot; to the goal of halving such emissions by 2050 - an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair . 
Yet the agreement commits no one to any specific targets , least of all the United States , whose president , George W. Bush , will no longer be in office in 2009 , when the tough decisions have to be made . 
One could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a vague agreement is any kind of advance at all . 
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , 189 countries , including the US , China , India , and all the European nations , signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , thereby agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases &quot; at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . &quot; 
Fifteen years later , no country has done that . 
US per capita greenhouse gas emissions , already the highest of any major nation when Bush took office , have continued to rise . 
In March , a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade . 
Now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do 15 years ago . 
That &apos;s a triumph ? 
If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails , that will be easy enough . 
In justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol , Bush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit China and India to mandatory emission limits . 
Now , in response to suggestions by Bush and other G8 leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change , Ma Kai , the head of China &apos;s National Development and Reform Commission , has said that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets . 
Likewise , the spokesman of India &apos;s foreign minister , Navtej Sarna , has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions . 
Are China and India being unreasonable ? 
Their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emitted by the industrialized nations over the past century . 
That is true : most of those gases are still in the atmosphere , and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is . 
China and India claim the right to proceed with industrialization and development as the developed nations did , unhampered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions . 
China , India , and other developing nations , have a point - or rather , three points . 
First , if we apply the principle &quot; You broke it , you fix it , &quot; then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our &quot; broken &quot; atmosphere , which can no longer absorb more greenhouse gases without the world &apos;s climate changing . 
Second , even if we wipe the slate clean and forget about who caused the problem , it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese , and as much as 18 times more than the average Indian . 
Third , the richer nations are better able than less well-off nations to absorb the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations . 
But it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases , they will eventually undo all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industrialized nations . 
This year or next , China will overtake the US as the world &apos;s biggest greenhouse gas emitter - on a national , rather than a per capita basis , of course . 
In 25 years , according to Fatih Birol , chief economist at the International Energy Agency , China &apos;s emissions could be double those of the US , Europe , and Japan combined . 
But there is a solution that is both fair and practical : 
Establish the total amount of greenhouse gases that we can allow to be emitted without causing the earth &apos;s average temperature to rise more than two degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the point beyond which climate change could become extremely dangerous . 
Divide that total by the world &apos;s population , thus calculating what each person &apos;s share of the total is . 
Allocate to each country a greenhouse gas emissions quota equal to the country &apos;s population , multiplied by the per person share . 
Finally , allow countries that need a higher quota to buy it from those that emit less than their quota . 
The fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere &apos;s capacity to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny . 
Why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth &apos;s atmosphere ? 
But , in addition to being fair , this scheme also has practical benefits . 
It would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas , because if they can keep their per capita emissions low , they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industrialized nations . 
The rich countries will benefit , too , because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations .
