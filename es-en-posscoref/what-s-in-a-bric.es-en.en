What &apos;s in a BRIC ? 
SAO PAULO - Brazil , Russia , India , and China recently held their second annual summit in Brasilia . 
Journalists continue to lavish attention on these so-called &quot; BRIC &quot; countries , but I remain skeptical of the concept . 
Goldman Sachs coined the term in 2001 to call attention to profitable opportunities in what it considered &quot; emerging markets . &quot; 
The BRICs &quot; share of world GDP rose from 16 % in 2000 to 22 % in 2008 . 
Collectively they did better than average in the subsequent global recession . 
Together , they account for 42 % of world population and one-third of global economic growth in the past ten years . 
Putting aside the United States ( which ranks third in population ) , annual economic growth in the other four most populous countries - China , India , Indonesia , and Brazil - was above 5-6 % in 2000-2009 . 
Obviously , that is good news for the world economy , but an economic term has taken on a political life of its own , despite the fact that Russia fits poorly in the category . 
As the Beijing Review commented , &quot; when Goldman Sachs created the acronym BRIC in 2001 , neither the economists nor the rest of the world imagined that Brazil , Russia , India , and China would finally sit together to build up a substantial platform one day . &quot; 
In June 2009 , the foreign ministers of the four countries met for the first time in Yekaterinburg , Russia , to transform a catchy acronym into an international political force . 
The BRICs hold $ 2.8 trillion or 42 % of global foreign reserves ( though most of that is Chinese . ) 
So , in Yekaterinburg , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev declared that &quot; there can be no successful global currency system if the financial instruments that are used are denominated in only one currency . &quot; 
After China eclipsed the US as Brazil &apos;s largest trading partner , China and Brazil announced plans to settle trade in their national currencies rather than dollars . 
Although Russia accounts for only 5 % of China &apos;s trade , the two countries announced a similar agreement . 
After the recent financial crisis , Goldman Sachs upped the ante and projected that the combined GDP of the BRICs might exceed that of the G-7 countries by 2027 , about 10 years sooner than initially believed . 
Such simple extrapolations of current economic growth rates often turn out to be mistaken because of unforeseen events . 
While a BRICs meeting may be convenient for coordinating some short-term diplomatic tactics , the term lumps together disparate countries that have deep divisions . 
It makes little sense to include Russia , a former superpower , with three developing economies . 
Of the four members , Russia has the smallest and most literate population and a much higher per capita income , but , more importantly , many observers believe that Russia is declining while the other three are rising in power resources . 
Russia today not only suffers more from the aftermath of the global recession , but it faces severe long-term liabilities : a lack of diversified exports , severe demographic and health problems , and , in Medvedev &apos;s own words , an urgent need for &quot; modernization . &quot; 
As The Financial Times recently pointed out , just two decades ago &quot; Russia was a scientific superpower , carrying out more research than China , India and Brazil combined . 
Since then it has been left behind not only by the world-beating growth of Chinese science but also by India and Brazil . &quot; 
When one looks closely at the numbers , the heart of the BRIC acronym is the rise in China &apos;s resources , but the role of Brazil is a pleasant surprise . 
When the BRIC acronym was first invented , The Economist objected that &quot; a country with a growth rate as skimpy as its swimsuits , prey to any financial crisis that was around , a place of chronic political instability , whose infinite capacity to squander its obvious potential was as legendary as its talent for football and carnivals , did not seem to belong with those emerging titans . &quot; 
Now , as The Economist notes , &quot; in some ways , Brazil outclasses the other BRICs . 
Unlike China , it is a democracy . 
Unlike India , it has no insurgents , no ethnic and religious conflicts nor hostile neighbors . 
Unlike Russia , it exports more than oil and arms and treats foreign investors with respect . &quot; 
Since curbing inflation and instituting market reforms in the 1990 &quot; s , Brazil has shown an impressive rate of economic growth in the range of 5 % . 
With a territory nearly three times the size of India &apos;s , 90 % of its 200 million people literate , a $ 2 trillion GDP equivalent to Russia &apos;s and per capita income of $ 10,000 ( three times India &apos;s and nearly twice China &apos;s ) , Brazil has impressive power resources . 
In 2007 , the discovery of massive offshore oil reserves promised to make Brazil a significant power in the energy arena as well . 
Brazil , like the other BRICs , also faces a serious number of problems . 
It ranks 75th out of 180 countries on Transparency International &apos;s corruption perceptions index ( compared to 79th for China , 84th for India , and 146th for Russia ) . 
The World Economic Forum ranks Brazil 56th among 133 countries in terms of economic competitiveness ( compared to 29th for China , 49th for India , and 63rd for Russia ) . 
Poverty and inequality remain serious problems . 
Brazil &apos;s Gini coefficient is .57 ( 1.0 is perfect inequality , with one person receiving all income ) , compared to .45 for the United States , .42 for China , .37 for India and .42 for Russia . 
So , how seriously should analysts take the term BRIC ? 
As an indicator of economic opportunity , they should welcome it , though it would make more sense if Indonesia replaced Russia . 
In political terms , China , India , and Russia are competitors for power in Asia , and Brazil and India have been hurt by China &apos;s undervalued currency . 
Thus , BRIC is not likely to become a serious political organization of like-minded states .
