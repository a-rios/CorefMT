Europe &apos;s Financial Alchemy 
CHICAGO - It is universally recognized that a key factor underlying the 2007-2008 financial crisis was the diffusion of collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , the infamous special-purpose vehicles that transformed lower-rated debt into highly rated debt . 
As these structures lost popularity on Wall Street , however , they gained popularity on the other side of the Atlantic . 
After all , the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , created by the eurozone countries last May , is the largest CDO ever created . 
As with CDOs , the EFSF was marketed as a way to reduce risk . 
Unfortunately , the outcome could be similar : the entire banking system sent into a tailspin . 
CDOs are a form of financial alchemy : special-purpose vehicles that buy the financial equivalent of lead ( low-rated mortgaged-backed securities ) and finance themselves mostly with the financial equivalent of gold ( highly sought-after AAA bonds ) . 
This transformation is based on one sound principle and two shaky ones . 
The sound principle is excess collateral . 
If there is $ 120 of collateral guaranteeing a $ 100 bond , the bond is safer , no doubt . 
How much safer , however , depends upon the returns on the pool of bonds that compose the CDO . 
The first shaky principle is that if the return on these bonds is highly correlated , so that they all default at the same time , overcollateralization is not much help . 
By contrast , if the returns are uncorrelated , it is extremely unlikely that they will all default at the same time , making overcollateralization sufficient to guarantee a safer return . 
Unfortunately , no precise mathematical model can determine correlation across securities , which is always an educated guess based mostly ( sometimes entirely ) on past behavior . 
Thus , the explosion of CDOs in the United States during the housing boom was predicated upon the shaky assumption that house prices never fall nationwide . 
The second shaky principle is that , in order to validate these instruments , issuers of CDOs relied on credit-rating agencies . 
Historically , these agencies had been reliable in predicting the risk of corporate defaults . 
Much of their credibility , however , depended on a fragile balance of power . 
Since each issuer represented a small fraction of their revenues , rating agencies were unwilling to compromise their reputation for the sake of any single issuer . 
The CDO market , however , was concentrated : six or seven issuers controlled most of the market , and this market ended up representing 50 % of the entire revenues to be gained through ratings . 
All of a sudden , issuers had much more influence on the rating agencies , which , like any good seller , were ready to bend a little not to alienate important customers . 
As a result , the CDO market did not so much spread risk as it shifted and hid it . 
When the US housing market started to turn south , the biggest underwriters ( such as Countrywide ) did not go bankrupt right away , because they had sold the vast majority of their loans to the CDO market . 
Eventually , however , the uncertainty created by these CDOs nearly brought down the entire US banking system . 
Europe is following a similar path . 
The EFSF , created to assist countries facing &quot; illiquidity , &quot; is designed exactly like a CDO . 
The EFSF buys the bonds of the countries which find it difficult to finance themselves in the marketplace ( for example , Ireland ) and issues bonds that are AAA rated . 
How is this alchemy possible ? 
Once again , it relies on overcollateralization , an assumption on the joint distribution of possible outcomes , and the inevitable seal of approval of the three major credit rating agencies . 
With the EFSF , the overcollateralization takes the form of guarantees by other eurozone countries . 
Among the major countries , however , only France and Germany have an AAA rating . 
How can a bond guaranteed in large part by countries such as Italy and Spain ( likely candidates for a fiscal crisis ) provide AAA status to Irish bonds ? 
According to Standard and Poor &apos;s , for example , &quot; The rating on EFSF reflects our view that guarantees by &quot; AAA &quot; rated sovereigns and freely available liquidity reserves invested in &quot; AAA &quot; securities will , between them , cover all of EFSF &apos;s liabilities . &quot; 
But the value of the guarantees depends on the situation . 
As long as the only country to be rescued is Ireland , there is no problem . 
But if the EFSF has to guarantee Spain , would Germany really be willing to step in and use its taxpayers &quot; money to cover Spanish banks &quot; losses ? 
And how compromised might French and German banks become - and thus how much more fiscal strain is in store for France and Germany ? 
Here , too , no mathematical formula can help , because what we need to test is the reasonableness of our assumptions . 
This is why rating agencies &quot; opinions are so valuable . 
Unfortunately , one must wonder to what extent these ratings are distorted by the eurozone countries &quot; political power . 
Since the crisis , rating agencies have been under attack , and major regulation , which could severely affect their business , has been discussed on both sides of the Atlantic . 
Given this , how free are credit rating agencies to express their opinion on the very institutions that will regulate them ? 
We will have to await the pricing of the credit-default swaps on EFSF debt , which will be issued in January , to see whether markets believe the ratings . 
Independent of this test , however , Germany seems to have squared the circle : it helped the countries in trouble , without coughing up ( for the moment ) any euros . 
As with CDOs , however , this might be a Pyrrhic victory . 
The EFSF has bought short-term gain in exchange for much larger losses if the situation deteriorates : a fiscal crisis in Spain could bring down the entire edifice . 
After the sub-prime mortgage crisis , politicians alleged that the market was short-sighted and irrational , and rushed to propose new regulations . 
While some of the criticism might have merit , what gives politicians the moral authority to criticize ? 
After all , as the EFSF shows , their orientation can be more short term and irrational than the market &apos;s , repeating the same mistakes because they seem not to have learned from them . 
The market &apos;s verdict is likely to be uncompromising . 
As Oscar Wilde said : &quot; Fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me . &quot;
