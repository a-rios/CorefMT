The Economics of Violence 
COPENHAGEN - What is the biggest source of violence in our world ? 
With the brutal conflicts in Syria , Ukraine , and elsewhere constantly in the news , many people would probably say war . 
But that turns out to be spectacularly wrong . 
Getting it right matters if we are to find cost-effective solutions to this and other global problems . 
Obviously , everyone would like to stop wars and violence , just as we would like to end poverty , hunger , and global warming , while providing education to all . 
But , given limited resources , the international community can only do so much . 
We have to prioritize , which is what an economic analysis of costs and benefits can do . 
The international community is working on new development goals for the next 15 years , and the Copenhagen Consensus has asked some of the world &apos;s leading economists to give their assessment of the smartest targets they can choose . 
Is reducing violence a goal worthy of resources that would otherwise be spent on , say , reducing hunger ? 
And , if so , which forms of violence should be targeted ? 
A study by James Fearon of Stanford University and Anke Hoeffler of Oxford University &apos;s Center for the Study of African Economies argues that societal violence - homicides and especially violence against women and children - is a much bigger problem than civil wars . 
Nine people are killed in interpersonal violence for every battlefield death in a civil war , and one child is killed for every two combatants who die . 
In 2008 , there were 418,000 homicides around the world , with far too many countries recording a murder rate of more than 10 per 100,000 , which the World Health Organization regards as an epidemic . 
A single homicide in America costs the individual and society $ 9.1 million . 
If we scale this by national income across the world , this single category of violent crime costs 1.7 % of global GDP . 
Of course , this is not a direct financial loss to the global economy , but a way of expressing the impact . 
If murders could be eliminated , societies around the world would be better off in ways that can be valued at 1.7 % of GDP . 
Compare this to the much lower cost of civil wars , which are equivalent to about 0.2 % of global GDP . 
But this is still much less than the biggest source of violence of all : violence against women in the home . 
Based on studies published in Science , 28 % of all women in Sub-Saharan Africa reported experiencing violence in the past year at the hands of their partners or family . 
This includes women subjected to beatings , forced marriage at an early age , sexual assault , &quot; honor &quot; crimes , and female genital mutilation . 
A conservative estimate puts the welfare cost of intimate partner violence alone at $ 4.4 trillion , or 5.2 % of global GDP . 
The second-largest source of violence is the abuse of children , 80 % of which is inflicted by parents . 
The definition of what constitutes child abuse varies by culture ; but about 15 % of children suffer each month from what the UN calls severe physical punishment . 
This includes being slapped on the face , head , or ears , and a quarter of these children are beaten with some kind of implement repeatedly and as hard as possible . 
Every month , some 290 million children endure such suffering . 
The welfare cost is $ 3.6 trillion , or 4.2 % of global GDP . 
A tiny fraction of international aid funding currently goes toward reducing societal violence and improving criminal justice systems . 
The enormous cost borne by society and individuals seems to cry out for action . 
All we can say is that the money spent to reduce violence might be better targeted . 
Considerable amounts of aid are directed toward &quot; fragile states &quot; to help stop or prevent civil war , but only 0.27 % of international aid goes to projects with a &quot; crime prevention &quot; component . 
Other programs may help in indirect ways , but there obviously is much room for improvement . 
Some solutions , it is clear , do work very well . 
Stronger social services can reduce violence against children . 
Studies in Washington State show that home visits from trained staff can reduce child abuse , improve children &apos;s quality of life and physical and mental health , and reduce child-welfare and litigation costs . 
A dollar spent on this program produces benefits of $ 14 , making it a highly cost-effective policy . 
In many cases , changes in social attitudes are needed . 
To reduce violence against women and girls , one program in Uganda , called SASA ! 
( Kiswahili for &quot; Now ! &quot; ) promotes the view that partner violence is unacceptable , and has helped to halve the rate of it . 
This is a fantastic outcome , of course , though there has been no analysis of how cost-effective it is . 
There are other examples of countries taking effective action . 
In 1993 , Bogota suffered 80 murders per 100,000 people . 
By taking an integrated approach - limiting the hours during which alcohol can be sold , reclaiming public space , and improving the police and justice systems - the homicide rate was reduced to 21 per 100,000 in 2004 . 
That is still high , but it is far below the rate of 55 per 100,000 in Detroit . 
Alcohol is a factor in many assaults , and controlling its availability could have a significant part to play , as the findings in Bogota suggest . 
In the United Kingdom , a pilot study on stronger enforcement of existing rules showed that assaults could be reduced in a very cost-effective way , with the benefits outweighing the costs by 17 to one . 
While we still don &apos;t know enough , two points are certain . 
First , domestic violence against women and children imposes a social cost of $ 8 trillion each year , making it a huge - and vastly underreported - global issue . 
Second , there are solutions that can help to tackle some of these problems very cost-effectively . 
That is why reducing domestic violence belongs on the short-list for the world &apos;s next set of development goals .
