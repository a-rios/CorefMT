Death-Defying Europe 
As the European Union prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome later this month , the EU is widely perceived to be on its knees . 
European integration , is felt to have , somehow met its Waterloo in 2005 , when Dutch and French referendums unexpectedly torpedoed the draft EU constitution . 
Media stories have focused on the paralysis that is said to have gripped EU decision-making , but the reality is different . 
Far from suffering an irreversible decline in its fortunes , the EU has been has been conducting business as usual , quietly getting on with the job of constructing new policies and projects . 
Take a look at some recent headlines . 
The EU is putting together an energy and environment strategy that aims to end the self-defeating competition within Europe for oil and gas , while also establishing Europe as global leader in the effort to halt climate change . 
The Union &apos;s common foreign and security policy may not yet mean that Europe speaks to the world with one voice , but it is taking shape and has already healed some of the wounds inflicted by disagreements over the war in Iraq . 
Of equal importance , Europe &apos;s economic integration continues to move ahead , with the euro buoyant and a single marketplace for financial services now coming into sight . 
The starting point for the EU &apos;s unhappy bid to create a shared constitution had been fears that its decision-making mechanisms were being overloaded by the accession of so many new members , first in May 2004 and again at the beginning of this year . 
The constitutional treaty was originally designed to streamline the system , and it was only later that it was over-enthusiastically expanded into the lengthy and pompous document that is now a dead letter . 
Yet there are signs that the EU machine has so far been coping rather well without the constitution . 
The volume of EU rule-making last year was almost exactly the same as 10 years ago . 
During 2005 and 2006 , the flow of EU directives , regulations , and associated reports , green papers , and communications continued at the same rate as the 2,800 a year chalked up in 1996 , when Jacques Delors was at the helm of the European Commission and the EU project was being widely hailed as unstoppable . 
Brussels is nowadays a government town akin to Washington , D.C , even if it is also a place where complex negotiations among the Union &apos;s 27 members grind forward only slowly . 
On top of all this , the European economy is looking brighter . 
In Germany , the EU &apos;s economic locomotive , unemployment is down and business confidence is up . 
And throughout the EU , the positive effects of the enlargement strategy that has brought in 10 ex-communist countries over the past three years looks to be generating a new self-confidence . 
None of this should be surprising . 
It would take a good deal more than a hiccup in the EU &apos;s delicate political process to bring integration to a standstill , let alone put it into reverse . 
The global pressures pushing European nations closer together are as strong as ever , so the impasse over the EU &apos;s constitutional treaty was never going to push Europe off course for very long . 
The path ahead is far from clear , of course . 
But a consensus does seem to be emerging on how the EU &apos;s future will pan out . 
Diplomats and policy analysts are generally agreed that key elements of the failed constitution will be rescued from the wreckage and turned into something along the lines of the &quot; mini-treaty &quot; that Nicolas Sarkozy , the front-runner in the French presidential race , proposed last autumn at a Friends of Europe meeting in Brussels . 
The details are still anyone &apos;s guess , but the consensus view is that the EU will have many of the constitution &apos;s most important procedural mechanisms by sometime next year . 
The EU is far from being out of the woods . 
Creating coherent policies is unremittingly difficult when there are so many nations , each with a different political culture . 
But the idea that the constitutional crisis is holding everything back is mistaken . 
The much greater problem has been that EU governments have been concentrating so hard on the details of &quot; building Europe &quot; that they have neglected broader strategic questions . 
There is little or no discussion of where Europe is heading and what sort of Europe its people want . 
It is strange but true that even American unilateralism under President George W. Bush has not provoked a genuine debate over Europe &apos;s future role in the world . 
The EU &apos;s problem is not its so-called &quot; constitutional crisis , &quot; but rather its lack of a recognizable political identity .
