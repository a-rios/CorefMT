The ECB &apos;s Faulty Weapon 
BRUSSELS - With inflation in the eurozone stubbornly remaining on a downward trajectory , pressure on the European Central Bank to do &quot; something &quot; to prevent outright deflation is growing . 
This &quot; something &quot; is usually understood to be massive asset purchases , or quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
But would QE actually do the trick ? 
The discussion has so far followed easily predictable national patterns : Creditor countries do not object to deflation , because it increases the real value of their investment , whereas debtor countries &quot; repayment burdens would grow heavier . 
In a closed economy , to every credit there must a corresponding debt . 
But consider individual countries : some run a large foreign debt , while others maintain a large creditor position . 
The United States and Germany are at opposite extremes of the creditor-debtor scale . 
The US , benefiting from the &quot; exorbitant privilege &quot; of issuing debt denominated in its own currency , has run current-account deficits for more than 30 years . 
The total foreign debt of US residents ( most of which is in US dollars ) is above $ 7 trillion . 
This implies that any reduction in US interest rates would benefit the country as whole , relative to creditor countries , like Germany , where interest income would fall . 
Within the eurozone , where until recently external accounts were nearly balanced , a similar creditor / debtor spectrum has emerged , with Germany and the Netherlands at one end , and much of the eurozone south at the other . 
This partly explains both the hostile stance toward QE adopted in the German financial press and the over-indebted periphery countries &quot; increasingly desperate calls for more action by the ECB . 
In the eurozone , however , QE is a questionable response to such calls . 
QE is a special instrument used when a central bank &apos;s short- and medium-term policy rates are already at zero and it wants to lower long-term interest rates . 
This implies that QE can be effective only in economies in which changes in long-term ( market ) interest rates play an important role in the private sector . 
But this is not the case in Europe , where most investment is financed via bank loans that typically do not have long-term maturities - often less than five years - because banks themselves have little secure long-term financing . 
Moreover , the interests rates charged on these loans are not linked to market rates , but rather to the bank &apos;s refinancing cost , which is already close to zero . 
In the eurozone , lower long-term rates for government bonds are thus unlikely to improve the corporate sector &apos;s financing conditions and boost investment demand . 
By contrast , in the US , a much larger proportion of investment is financed by issuing bonds , which can have a longer maturity than bank loans . 
Moreover , these bonds are priced as spreads on the government-bond yield curve , implying that QE will have an immediate impact on enterprises &quot; financing costs . 
For households , the main impact of lower interest rates is felt through mortgages . 
But most of southern Europe relies mainly on floating rates . 
This implies that QE would not reach , say , Spanish households , whose mortgages are indexed to short-term rates , which are already close to zero . 
In the US , households have a prepayment option on their mortgages should interest rates fall . 
Moreover , mortgages are usually securitized . 
This implies that a fall in the rate at which bundles of mortgages can be sold on the market can have a strong impact on household spending , because lower long-term rates typically lead to waves of mortgage refinancing , leaving households with lower monthly payments - and thus higher disposable income . 
When the central bank buys large amounts of bonds , all asset prices , including housing , tend to increase . 
Here , too , the US , where higher house prices stimulate consumption , is a misleading example for Europe . 
Owner occupancy rates are high in the US , and the financial system allows households to extract the equity in their homes relatively cheaply , either by second liens or by refinancing the entire mortgage . 
This is not possible in most of Europe , and especially not in Germany , where loan-to-value limits remain conservative , refinancing is costly , and most banks would frown on any attempt to cash in on &quot; home equity &quot; to finance a vacation or a new car . 
Moreover , higher house prices and rents distribute income from poorer households ( which typically rent ) to richer households ( which own the houses ) . 
But the poor have a much higher propensity to spend than the rich . 
A housing boom in a nation of renters might actually lead to lower aggregate consumption . 
Differences in financial structure thus matter profoundly in the effort to prevent deflation . 
Though QE might work in a debtor economy with a flexible financial system like the US , it could backfire in a creditor economy with a conservative financial system . 
This , rather than the fear that the ECB might end up buying the bonds of untrustworthy governments , is the real argument against QE in the eurozone .
