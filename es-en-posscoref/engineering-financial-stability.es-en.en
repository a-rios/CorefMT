Engineering Financial Stability 
NEW HAVEN - The severity of the global financial crisis that we have seen over the last two years has to do with a fundamental source of instability in the banking system , one that we can and must design out of existence . 
To do that , we must advance the state of our financial technology . 
In a serious financial crisis , banks find that the declining market value of many of their assets leaves them short of capital . 
They cannot raise much more capital during the crisis , so , in order to restore capital adequacy , they stop making new loans and call in their outstanding loans , thereby throwing the entire economy - if not the entire global economy - into a tailspin . 
This problem is rather technical in nature , as are its solutions . 
It is a sort of plumbing problem for the banking system , but we need to fix the plumbing by changing the structure of the banking system itself . 
Many finance experts - including Alon Raviv , Mark Flannery , Anil Kashyap , Raghuram Rajan , Jeremy Stein , Ricardo Caballero , Pablo Kurlat , Dennis Snower , and the Squam Lake Working Group - have been making proposals along the lines of &quot; contingent capital . &quot; 
The proposal by the Squam Lake Working Group - named for the scenic site in New Hampshire where a group of finance professors first met to devise ideas for responding to the current economic crisis - seems particularly appealing . 
To me , the group &apos;s work has exemplified the creative application of financial theory to find solutions to the crisis . 
( I am a member , but I am not the source of its important contingent-capital idea . ) 
The group calls their version of contingent capital &quot; regulatory hybrid securities . &quot; 
The idea is simple : banks should be pressured to issue a new kind of debt that automatically converts into equity if the regulators determine that there is a systemic national financial crisis , and if the bank is simultaneously in violation of capital-adequacy covenants in the hybrid-security contract . 
The regulatory hybrid securities would have all the advantages of debt in normal times . 
But in bad times , when it is important to keep banks lending , bank capital would automatically be increased by the debt-to-equity conversion . 
The regulatory hybrid securities are thus designed to deal with the very source of systemic instability that the current crisis highlighted . 
The proposal also specifies a distinct role for the government in encouraging the issuance of regulatory hybrid securities , because banks would not issue them otherwise . 
Regulatory hybrid securities would raise the cost of capital to banks ( because creditors would have to be compensated for the conversion feature ) , whereas the banks would rather rely on their &quot; too big to fail &quot; status and future government bailouts . 
Some kind of penalty or subsidy thus has to be applied to encourage banks to issue them . 
The theory of &quot; debt overhang &quot; - the intellectual origin of the proposal - explains why troubled banks are reluctant to issue new equity : the benefits accrue mostly to the bank &apos;s bondholders and dilute existing shareholders . 
But the proposal does not follow directly from modern finance theory . 
It is a real innovation , with no prior precedent . 
Why wasn &apos;t the idea of contingent capital seized upon in earlier crises ? 
Wasn &apos;t the same problem of debt overhang prominent in the banking crises of the Great Depression , for example ? 
I think that part of the reason must be that the problem was poorly understood then , so that contingent capital could not be well articulated and lacked the force of argument that would allow it to be impressed upon government policy makers . 
Moreover , there is a fundamentally creative element to innovation : it results from an intellectual process that takes time , and that in retrospect always seem inexplicably slow or episodic . 
The Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) , headed by Mario Draghi , publicly stated in its September 2009 report to the G-20 that it was studying contingent capital proposals . 
The FSB was created in April 2009 at the G-20 &quot; s London summit as the successor to the Financial Stability Forum . 
Its member organizations are the G-20 &quot; s central banks and top regulatory agencies . 
The G-20 &quot; s member states are committed by the G-20 statement that they signed to implement the FSB &apos;s conclusions on a worldwide basis . 
As a result , the FSB is in a unique position to make innovation happen . 
In its recent reports , the FSB has concentrated on capital requirements , on closing legal loopholes that allow banks to evade them , and on improving accounting standards . 
The FSB has already facilitated a number of proposals that would help make our financial system more secure . 
Contingent capital , a device that grew from financial engineering , is a major new idea that might fix the problem of banking instability , thereby stabilizing the economy - just as devices invented by mechanical engineers help stabilize the paths of automobiles and airplanes . 
If a contingent-capital proposal is adopted , this could be the last major worldwide banking crisis - at least until some new source of instability emerges and sends financial technicians back to work to invent our way of it .
