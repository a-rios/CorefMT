Putin the Poker Player 
Perhaps it takes an ex-KGB spy for a Kremlin ruler to play diplomatic poker with skill . 
Indeed , President Vladimir Putin shows as much mastery at international diplomacy as he does in handling Russian domestic affairs . 
Not since Gustav Stresemann , Weimar Germany &apos;s foreign minister , played the Soviet Union and the West off against each other , has a leader with so weak a hand played his cards so effectively . 
Putin &apos;s latest moves in North Korea , and his careful tap-dance over Iraq , are just the latest examples . 
Diplomacy , in its traditional form , was never Russia &apos;s strong suit . 
Under the Tsars , Russia was often isolated . 
Even when part of alliances - the Triple Alliance with Bismarck &apos;s Germany and the Habsburg Empire , or the Entente with France before the First World War - Russia was kept at a distance . 
Russian leaders typically dealt with their fear of isolation - and encirclement - by going out of their way to appear threatening . 
In the Soviet era , the distances between Russia and its neighbors became unbridgeable chasms , with the USSR ringed either by hostile states or weak , servile ones . 
Stalin wasted no time in antagonizing Communist China after Mao &apos;s revolution of 1949 . 
Not until Boris Yeltsin did Russia make its first steps to bridge these divides . 
But Yeltsin could never get over Russia &apos;s lost superpower status ; his periodic growls to assert Russia &apos;s wounded pride ultimately made him seem unreliable . 
True , his democratic Russia was permitted some role in global diplomacy . 
In Yugoslavia , former Premier Victor Chernomyrdin joined Finnish President Matti Ahtissari in resolving the Kosovo crisis of 1999 . 
But this hardly amounted to recognition of Russia &apos;s indispensability ; after all , NATO troops entered Kosovo without Russian consent . 
A realist in his bones , Putin recognizes Russia &apos;s changed status . 
But this recognition is not a confession of weakness ; instead , it reflects his clear-sighted analysis of Russia &apos;s current predicament , and of the country &apos;s need to create , recreate , and sustain friendly relations among all of its neighbors if lost influence is to be regained . 
Since Putin took the reigns of power in 2000 he has become almost everybody &apos;s best friend - Belarus &apos;s lunatic strongman Aleksander Lukashenko , US President George W. Bush , Germany &apos;s Gerhard Schroeder , Japan &apos;s Junichiro Koizumi , and China &apos;s Jiang Zemin . 
Even North Korea &apos;s erratic leader , the hermit Kim Jong Il , who never travels outside his country , has visited Putin twice in recent years . 
In fact , North Korea provides a textbook example of Putin &apos;s diplomatic method . 
Putin cultivated Kim when other leaders neglected him . 
In the summer of 2002 , the North Korean leader visited Russia to learn about &quot; non-intrusive &quot;  - that is , not entirely Western - capitalism , while riding in an armored train on the Trans-Siberian railway . 
Kim seemed to reason that , while Russia was no longer Soviet , it retained enough socialist overtones to work with his country . 
The benefit of this &quot; educational experiment &quot; was that Putin became one of the few people to whom Kim Jong Il listens . 
But Putin &apos;s method is to maintain warm relations with everyone . 
Even as he hosted Kim in Moscow , Russian diplomats in Pyongyang were helping to protect an American spy in North Korea . 
Previously spurned by America in its attempts to use its longstanding contacts in Asia , this assistance appears to have convinced America that Russia can be of real help in its diplomacy with North Korea . 
Final negotiations over North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions will undoubtedly need to take place between the US and Kim Jong Il . 
What Putin may be able to provide is the diplomatic cover the US president needs to maintain his pose of not negotiating directly with the North Koreans . 
This will allow President Bush to avoid seeming to surrender to the threat of nuclear blackmail . 
As a diplomatic practitioner , Putin has learned history &apos;s lessons and is determined not to see his country ringed by enmity . 
Instead of Russia &apos;s borders draining his country &apos;s economy , he envisions Russia as a transit point between east and west , and also as an engine of growth for countries in search of the heavy industrial equipment Russia makes . 
A rail link between South Korea and Siberia , to carry Korean and Japanese goods west and Russian resource exports east , may be but one positive result of any successful deal he may broker on the Korean peninsula . 
Of course , some of the old suspicions about Russian motives linger in the West , most particularly over Iraq ( where Lukoil , Russia &apos;s biggest oil company , recently signed a new deal to develop Iraqi oil fields ) . 
But Putin &apos;s interventions in the UN Security Council over Iraq have been far more moderate than , say , those of France and Germany , two of America &apos;s historic allies . 
This is so even though Russia has vital national interests to protect in Iraq , including real fears about regional instability spreading into Russia &apos;s south , with its millions of Muslim citizens . 
For too long Russia practiced either the diplomacy of the thug or that of the Byzantine . 
The first made potential partners recoil in fear , the second made them shrink in confusion . 
But a spy &apos;s stock-in-trade is recruiting and nurturing collaborators . 
Those skills are now being put on display by Russia &apos;s spymaster president . 
No one is complaining .
