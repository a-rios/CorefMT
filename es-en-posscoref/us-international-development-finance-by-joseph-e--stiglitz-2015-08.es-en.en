America in the Way 
NEW YORK - The Third International Conference on Financing for Development recently convened in Ethiopia &apos;s capital , Addis Ababa . 
The conference came at a time when developing countries and emerging markets have demonstrated their ability to absorb huge amounts of money productively . 
Indeed , the tasks that these countries are undertaking - investing in infrastructure ( roads , electricity , ports , and much else ) , building cities that will one day be home to billions , and moving toward a green economy - are truly enormous . 
At the same time , there is no shortage of money waiting to be put to productive use . 
Just a few years ago , Ben Bernanke , then the chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board , talked about a global savings glut . 
And yet investment projects with high social returns were being starved of funds . 
That remains true today . 
The problem , then as now , is that the world &apos;s financial markets , meant to intermediate efficiently between savings and investment opportunities , instead misallocate capital and create risk . 
There is another irony . 
Most of the investment projects that the emerging world needs are long term , as are much of the available savings - the trillions in retirement accounts , pension funds , and sovereign wealth funds . 
But our increasingly shortsighted financial markets stand between the two . 
Much has changed in the 13 years since the first International Conference on Financing for Development was held in Monterrey , Mexico , in 2002 . 
Back then , the G-7 dominated global economic policymaking ; today , China is the world &apos;s largest economy ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) , with savings some 50 % larger than that of the US . 
Gone are the calls for the developed countries to live up to their commitment to give at least 0.7 % of their GNI in development aid . 
A few northern European countries - Denmark , Luxembourg , Norway , Sweden and , most surprisingly , the United Kingdom - in the midst of its self-inflicted austerity - fulfilled their pledges in 2014 . 
But the United States ( which gave 0.19 % of GNI in 2014 ) lags far , far behind . 
Today , developing countries and emerging markets say to the US and others : If you will not live up to your promises , at least get out of the way and let us create an international architecture for a global economy that works for the poor , too . 
Not surprisingly , the existing hegemons , led by the US , are doing whatever they can to thwart such efforts . 
When China proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to help recycle some of the surfeit of global savings to where financing is badly needed , the US sought to torpedo the effort . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration suffered a stinging ( and highly embarrassing ) defeat . 
The US is also blocking the world &apos;s path toward an international rule of law for debt and finance . 
If bond markets , for example , are to work well , an orderly way of resolving cases of sovereign insolvency must be found . 
But today , there is no such way . 
Ukraine , Greece , and Argentina are all examples of the failure of existing international arrangements . 
The vast majority of countries have called for the creation of a framework for sovereign-debt restructuring . 
The US remains the major obstacle . 
Private investment is important , too . 
But the new investment provisions embedded in the trade agreements that the Obama administration is negotiating across both oceans imply that accompanying any such foreign direct investment comes a marked reduction in governments &quot; abilities to regulate the environment , health , working conditions , and even the economy . 
The US stance concerning the most disputed part of the Addis Ababa conference was particularly disappointing . 
As developing countries and emerging markets open themselves to multinationals , it becomes increasingly important that they can tax these behemoths on the profits generated by the business that occurs within their borders . 
Apple , Google , and General Electric have demonstrated a genius for avoiding taxes that exceeds what they employed in creating innovative products . 
All countries - both developed and developing - have been losing billions of dollars in tax revenues . 
Last year , the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released information about Luxembourg &apos;s tax rulings that exposed the scale of tax avoidance and evasion . 
While a rich country like the US arguably can afford the behavior described in the so-called Luxembourg Leaks , the poor cannot . 
I was a member of an international commission , the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation , examining ways to reform the current tax system . 
In a report presented to the International Conference on Financing for Development , we unanimously agreed that the current system is broken , and that minor tweaks will not fix it . 
We proposed an alternative - similar to the way corporations are taxed within the US , with profits allocated to each state on the basis of the economic activity occurring within state borders . 
The US and other advanced countries have been pushing for much smaller changes , to be recommended by the OECD , the advanced countries &quot; club . 
In other words , the countries from which the politically powerful tax evaders and avoiders come are supposed to design a system to reduce tax evasion . 
Our Commission explains why the OECD reforms were at best tweaks in a fundamentally flawed system and were simply inadequate . 
Developing countries and emerging markets , led by India , argued that the proper forum for discussing such global issues was an already established group within the United Nations , the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters , whose status and funding needed to be elevated . 
The US strongly opposed : it wanted to keep things the same as in the past , with global governance by and for the advanced countries . 
New geopolitical realities demand new forms of global governance , with a greater voice for developing and emerging countries . 
The US prevailed in Addis , but it also showed itself to be on the wrong side of history .
