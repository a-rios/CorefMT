National Drift or Global Mastery 
LONDON - As world business leaders gather in Davos , a long-overdue paradigm shift in monetary policy - subordinating the targeting of inflation to the targeting of growth - is slowly taking shape . 
In what some call a &quot; reverse Volcker moment , &quot; US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has specified a target of 6.5 % unemployment alongside his inflation target ; 
Meanwhile , China has pledged to double average domestic per capita income by 2020 . 
Sadly , it has taken four years of gross underestimation of the impact of fiscal austerity and a chronic shortage of demand ( with the economy &apos;s supply potential beginning to decline accordingly ) for us to agree to target growth - which the G-20 called for in 2009 . 
So why , with change materializing , is there so little optimism about growth as we enter 2013 , and why is there so much talk of a &quot; lost decade &quot; ? 
The answer is that the problem of low growth requires more than a shift in national monetary policies : it also requires an agreement to coordinate global growth - a solution that has not been forthcoming . 
Of course , some of the pessimism arises from the weakness of Europe , which has agreed only that the European Central Bank be lender of last resort ; and some stems from recognition of the limits of quantitative easing . 
In part , we are victims of a self-fulfilling pessimism - the view that a debt overhang dooms us to unemployment and stagnation , with nothing to be gained by attempting to use fiscal expansion or monetary innovation to counter it . 
But I believe that we have failed to grow faster for a more fundamental reason . 
Put simply , ten years ago , America could deliver a global recovery . 
Perhaps ten years from now , Asian consumer spending will fill this void . 
For 150 years , until 2010 , the West ( America and Europe ) was responsible for the majority of global output , manufacturing , trade , investment , and consumption . 
Now we are in a transitional era , with the rest of the world out-producing , out-manufacturing , out-trading , and out-investing Europe and America - but not yet out-consuming them . 
This imbalance means that producers of most goods and services are outside the West , but rely on Western consumers to absorb their output . 
Until the transition is complete , we depend on each other : no one can succeed alone . 
Nominal-GDP targets may be a necessary way forward , but they are not a sufficient response to slow global growth . 
Even the boldest of national initiatives may fail - not because targeting economic growth is the wrong approach , but because there is no way to sustain the higher levels of growth that we need without better global coordination . 
In the absence of a favorable global context , any change in economic policy that is purely national , like employment targeting , will have limited benefits ( and may discredit the pursuit of a national employment goal ) . 
So today &apos;s fundamental policy void - yet to be addressed - lies in national governments &quot; unwillingness to contemplate global leadership . 
Cynics might argue that this is dysfunctional national decision-making replicated at a global level . 
Of course , economic nationalism is obvious in America , with its nervousness about China and hostility to global agreements ; but Europe , too , is now witnessing both a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment and rising resistance to helping poorer countries . 
Indeed , it is safer for politicians to offer the opposite of a global vision : to renationalize every economic problem and attribute all of them to the mistakes of domestic opponents . 
So , for four years , budget deficits - which do , of course , have to be addressed by long-term debt-reduction plans - have virtually monopolized economic-policy debate in Europe and America , at the expense of sensible discussions about growth , employment , and trade . 
Put crudely , it is more beneficial politically for an opposition politician to claim that his country &apos;s problems are self-induced , caused by domestic profligacy , and have little to do with global financial failures . 
Citizens would be excused for concluding that the 2008 global financial crisis had nothing to do with a global banking collapse and was entirely caused by a few spendthrift national governments racking up deficits . 
As a result , millions of people are unemployed unnecessarily , and millions more face reductions in their living standards . 
Economics is now global , but politics remains local . 
Global challenges grow , while the agendas of international summits contract , reinforcing the myth that they are mere talking shops . 
But , even as protectionist sentiment frustrates cooperation , there is a global growth deal waiting to be done . 
It starts from the recognition that large surplus savings and much unused capacity are waiting to be mobilized , and that expanding consumer demand among Asia &apos;s rising middle class holds the key to expansion . 
Yet China , whose consumers are perfectly able to absorb imports from the West , will remain wary of boosting middle-class demand while it is in fear of losing some of its Western export markets . 
India &apos;s government wants to open up its economy to Western imports , but the rest of the world is not addressing its fears of over-exposure to global volatility . 
Only a coordinated policy response covering all of the G-20 economies can break this vicious cycle of low confidence and slow trade growth . 
If China could be confident that its export markets will not falter , it could expand domestic consumer demand and take in Western goods . 
Likewise , if America were confident that it could sell in Asia , Western consumer confidence would rise . 
Three years ago , the International Monetary Fund showed that by coordinating the expansion of Asian demand and investment in Western infrastructure , we could mobilize private funds for big private-public partnership projects . 
Global output would rise 3 % , employment would grow by 25-30 million , and 100 million people would escape poverty . 
Global economic coordination is no longer a luxury . 
Winston Churchill &apos;s gibe about the policies of the 1930 &quot; s haunts us as well . 
Governments , Churchill said then , were &quot; resolved to be irresolute , adamant for drift , solid for fluidity , and all-powerful for impotence . &quot; 
In 2013 , it is irresolution , drift , and the resulting impotence that we , too , must address .
