Seeking Sovereignty in Europe and Iraq 
Two very different efforts at &quot; nation building &quot; are galvanizing world attention : America &apos;s struggle to construct a viable polity in Iraq and the EU &apos;s ambitious project of making Europe into a true &quot; Union . &quot; 
While many issues involved are distinct , a &quot; democratic deficit &quot; looms large in both undertakings . 
Why and what will it take to overcome it ? 
Sovereign regimes require a political identity . 
To understand this , lets reflect on a few considerations with a Rousseauian flavour . 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the conflicted genius who first articulated many basic themes of modernity , from democracy through authenticity , with all their contradictory demands . 
He is a great thinker , whose advice is always disastrous to follow . 
The first modern , democratic revolutions transferred power from monarchs to the &quot; nation &quot; or the &quot; people . &quot; 
But this required inventing a new kind of collective agency that could decide and act together , to which one could attribute - a la Rousseau  -  a &quot; will . &quot; 
This new entity requires strong cohesion , because popular sovereignty means more than simply the will of the majority . 
After all , many sorts of bodies , even the loosest aggregations , can adopt majority decision-making . 
Suppose that during a public lecture , some people feel hot and ask that the windows be opened ; others disagree . 
One might decide the matter by a show of hands , with the minority accepting the outcome favored by the majority as legitimate . 
Yet the audience might be comprised of individuals unknown to one another , without mutual concern , brought together only by the lecture . 
Democratic societies , by contrast , need to be bonded more powerfully than some chance grouping . 
Popular sovereignty entails certain types of decision procedures - grounded ultimately on the will of the majority ( restricted by respect for liberty and individual rights )  - and offers a particular justification for collective decision-making . 
Under a regime of popular sovereignty , we are free in a way that we are not under an absolute monarch or an entrenched aristocracy . 
To see why , consider such a regime from an individual &apos;s standpoint . 
Say that I am outvoted on some important issue . 
I must abide by an outcome I oppose . 
My will is thwarted , so why should I consider myself free ? 
Why does it matter that it is the majority of my fellow citizens , rather than the decisions of a monarch , that is overriding my will ? 
Indeed , we can even imagine that a potential monarch , waiting to return to power in a coup , agrees with me on the issue in question . 
Wouldn &apos;t I be freer after a counter-revolution , when my will - at least on this matter - would then be put into effect ? 
This question is not merely theoretical . 
It is rarely put on behalf of individuals , but it regularly arises for sub-groups , such as national minorities , who see themselves as oppressed by majorities . 
Perhaps no answer can satisfy them . 
Whatever one says or does , they may be unable to see themselves as part of a larger sovereign people . 
They therefore see its rule over them as illegitimate , which is precisely the point : the logic of popular sovereignty requires an idea of collective agency based on a sense of individual belonging that is much stronger than in our lecture audience . 
Of course , some extreme philosophical individualists believe that appealing to a greater collective is pure humbug , concocted to get voters to accept voluntary servitude . 
But without deciding this philosophical issue , we can ask : what feature of our &quot; imagined communities &quot; persuades people to accept that they are free under a democratic regime , even when their will is overridden on important issues ? 
The answer that we as individuals accept is that we are free because we rule ourselves in common , rather than being ruled by some agency that need not take account of us . 
Our freedom consists in having a guaranteed voice in the sovereign , in being heard and participating in making decisions . 
We enjoy this freedom because of a law that enfranchises all of us , so that we enjoy this freedom together . 
Our freedom is realized and defended by this law , whether or not we win or lose any particular decision . 
This law also defines the community whose freedom it realizes and defends-a collective agency , a people , whose acting together by the law preserves their freedom . 
Such is the answer , valid or not , that people accept in democratic societies . 
Insofar as this freedom is crucial to their identity , they identify strongly with this ongoing collective agency - the &quot; nation &quot; or the &quot; people &quot;  - and hence feel a bond with their co-participants in it . 
Only an appeal to this kind of membership can rebut the challenge of those considering support for a monarch &apos;s or general &apos;s or provisional government &apos;s coup in the name of their freedom . 
The crucial point is that regardless of who is right philosophically , it is only insofar as people accept some such appeal that the legitimacy principle underlying popular sovereignty can work to secure their consent . 
If identification with the community is rejected , the government will be illegitimate in the eyes of the rejecters . 
In short , there can be no democracy without a shared identity as participants in a common agency . 
This notion - which boils down to citizenship  - underscores the central challenge now posed by both the Iraqi and European projects . 
Simply put , are Iraqis too divided , too long oppressed , to develop anything like the sense of common identity and collective agency that popular sovereignty requires ? 
In some ways , much less is at stake in building a new democratic community out of the already free and prosperous European countries . 
But whether the &quot; democratic deficit &quot; on the European level be remedied also depends on whether a shared European identity can be forged out of the 25 nations that will soon make up the European Union . 
Both projects are audacious .
