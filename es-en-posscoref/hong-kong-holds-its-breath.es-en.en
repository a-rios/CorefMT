Hong Kong Holds its Breath 
Hong Kong &apos;s residents used to be branded as &quot; apolitical . &quot; 
But that description hardly seems appropriate nowadays . 
Since turning out to rally in record numbers on the anniversary of the handover to China in 2003 , hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens have taken peacefully to the streets on various occasions to protest government decisions and demand political reform . 
But China &apos;s government clings to the belief that Hong Kong &apos;s people are not ready for democracy . 
In April 2004 , China &apos;s legislators ruled out universal suffrage in Hong Kong &apos;s 2007 election of its chief executive , as well as for its 2008 Legislative Council election . 
They acknowledged that under the city &apos;s special constitution , the Basic Law , these elections could be the first opportunities for the territory to choose its representatives according to the principle of &quot; one person , one vote . &quot; 
But they expressed concern that major reform could undermine political stability and economic development . 
Currently , all eyes in China are on Hong Kong &apos;s upcoming legislative election on September 12 , which will indicate to Hong Kong &apos;s government and to China &apos;s leaders what people think about the pace and direction of reform . 
A high turnout in favor of pro-democracy candidates is expected , although this won &apos;t guarantee them a majority in the legislature because of Hong Kong &apos;s unusual political structure . 
For this month &apos;s election , Hong Kong &apos;s 3.2 million registered voters can elect only 30 of the 60 seats . 
The pro-democracy camp is likely to win 22 seats of those 30 seats , which are based on five large geographical constituencies . 
The other 30 seats , however , are chosen through functional constituencies , which represent specific interests , such as banks , insurance companies , stockbrokers , chambers of commerce , and transport operators . 
Only 199,000 voters , some of them representatives from corporations , elect the legislators who fill these seats . 
Some of these constituencies have only a few hundred voters and are easily controlled by a small number of vested interests . 
Indeed , at the close of nomination on August 4 , eleven functional candidates were chosen without opposition , including those representing banks and the Chinese chamber of commerce . 
The British and Chinese governments in the 1980 &apos;s designed Hong Kong &apos;s awkward political system during their negotiations over the eventual transfer of sovereignty . 
Its purpose was to ensure that the will of the public could not be fully expressed through the ballot box . 
After 1997 , Hong Kong &apos;s government made doubly sure that legislators &apos; already limited powers to initiate debates , legislation , and amendments to laws were further restricted . 
It imposed rules requiring majority support from members of functional constituencies as well as geographic constituencies to take such steps . 
So resistance to change is built into the system . 
If the government can influence 16 of the 30 functional votes , it can thwart proposals from the directly elected legislators . 
This has happened with controversial issues concerning political reform and government accountability over the past few years . 
Yet no one should forget that on July 1 , 2003 , over 500,000 people protested because the government refused to allow more time to discuss proposed national security legislation . 
Hong Kong &apos;s government felt it could ignore public opinion and push the bill through with a large majority of the functional members , plus a handful of directly elected pro-government legislators . 
It only backed down when the pro-government Liberal Party , which held a number of functional seats , broke ranks as a result of intense public pressure . 
The Civic Exchange-Hong Kong Transition Project &apos;s latest survey results , from early August , recorded a sharp upturn in public protests over the past year . 
It noted that people increasingly adopted informal means of expressing unhappiness with Hong Kong &apos;s government , because they did not think that formal channels were sufficient . 
People began taking matters into their own hands by attending rallies , signing petitions , and donating to political parties and activist groups in unprecedented numbers . 
The survey also showed that although China &apos;s government ruled out universal suffrage in the 2007 and 2008 elections , over 40 % of respondents still wanted democracy by then , with nearly 20 % more wanting it by the next round of elections in 2011 and 2012 . 
Furthermore , the majority did not think democratization would hurt the economy , although there were clear concerns that political instability could arise from China &apos;s intervention in Hong Kong affairs . 
China &apos;s government may well adopt a new Hong Kong policy after the election . 
The best case would be if China agreed to universal suffrage no later than the 2011 and 2012 elections , gaining legitimacy in Hong Kong by backing reform of the political system . 
While China &apos;s rulers may fear losing control , they also need to recognize that the current system is causing intense discontent . 
The worst case would be if China disregarded a decisive pro-democracy win in 2007 and 2008 and continued to insist that Hong Kong &apos;s people were unready for democracy or to allege foreign manipulation of the pro-democracy camp . 
Hong Kong &apos;s people may well conclude that they have no alternative but to use every occasion to protest chief executive Tung Chee-hwa &apos;s unpopular government , making it even harder for him to govern .
