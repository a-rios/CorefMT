America &apos;s Other 30 % 
NEW HAVEN - The American consumer is but a shadow of its former almighty self . 
Personal consumption in the United States expanded at only a 1.5 % annual rate in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms in the second quarter of 2012 - and that was no aberration . 
Unfortunately , it continues a pattern of weakness that has been evident since early 2008 . 
Over the last 18 quarters , annualized growth in real consumer demand has averaged a mere 0.7 % , compared to a 3.6 % growth trend in the decade before the crisis erupted . 
Never before has the American consumer been this weak for this long . 
The cause is no secret . 
Consumers made huge bets on two bubbles - housing and credit . 
Reckless monetary and regulatory policies turned the humble abode into an ATM , allowing families to extract dollars from bubbles and live beyond their means . Both bubbles have long since burst , and US households are now dealing with post-bubble financial devastation - namely , underwater assets , record-high debt , and profound shortages of savings . 
At the same time , sharply elevated unemployment and subpar income growth have combined to tighten the noose on over-extended consumers . 
Consumers are diverting what little income they earn away from spending toward paying down debt and rebuilding savings . 
That is both logical and rational - and thus not something that the US Federal Reserve can offset with unconventional monetary easing . 
American consumers &quot; unprecedented retrenchment has turned the US economy &apos;s growth calculus inside out . 
Consumption typically accounts for 70 % of GDP ( 71 % in the second quarter , to be precise ) . 
But the 70 % is barely growing , and is unlikely to expand strongly at any point in the foreseeable future . 
In fact , the other 30 % has not done a bad job , especially considering the severe headwinds coming from consumers &quot; 70 % . 
The 30 % mainly consists of four components - capital spending by firms , net exports ( exports less imports ) , residential construction , and government purchases . 
( Technically , the pace of inventory investment should be included , but this is a cyclical buffer between production and sales rather than a source of final demand . ) 
Given the 0.7 % trend in real consumption growth over the past four and a half years , the US economy &apos;s anemic 2.2 % annualized recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession is almost miraculous . 
Credit that mainly to the other 30 % , especially to strong exports and a rebound in business capital spending . 
By contrast , the government sector has been moving in the opposite direction , as state and local governments retrench and federal purchases top out after post-crisis deficit explosions . 
The housing sector has started to recover over the past five quarters , but from such a severely depressed level that its growth has had little impact on the overall economy . 
Given the strong likelihood that consumers will remain weak for years to come , America &apos;s growth agenda needs to focus on getting more out of the other 30 % . 
Of the four growth components that fall into this category , two have the greatest potential to make a difference - capital spending and exports . 
Prospects for these two sources of growth will not only influence the vigor , or lack thereof , of any recovery ; they could well be decisive in bringing about an important shift in the US growth model . 
Capital spending and exports , which together account for about 24 % of GDP , hold the key to this shift . 
At just over 10 % of GDP , the share of capital spending is well below the peak of nearly 13 % in 2000 . 
Only then could export growth , impressive since mid-2009 , sustain further increases . 
The other 30 % is also emblematic of a deeper strategic issue that America faces - a profound competitive challenge . 
A shift to external demand is not there for the asking . 
It must be earned by hard work , sheer determination , and a long overdue competitive revival . 
On that front , too , America has been falling behind . 
According to the World Economic Forum &apos;s Global Competitiveness Index , the US slipped to fifth place in 2011-2012 , from fourth place the previous year , continuing a general downward trend evident since 2005 . 
The erosion is traceable to several factors , including deficiencies in primary and secondary education as well as poor macroeconomic management . 
Improvement on all counts is vital for America &apos;s competitive revival . 
With the American consumer likely to remain on ice , the same 30 % must also continue to shoulder the burden of a sluggish economic recovery . 
None of this can occur in a vacuum . 
The investment required for competitive revival and sustained recovery cannot be funded without a long-overdue improvement in US saving .
