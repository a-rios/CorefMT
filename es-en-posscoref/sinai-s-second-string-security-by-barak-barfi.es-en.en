Sinai &apos;s Second-String Security 
SHARM EL-SHEIKH - In the wake of an attack that killed 16 security officers in the Sinai Peninsula in August , the Egyptian military has ratcheted up the pressure against jihadis there . 
Generals have promised an extended campaign to extinguish the terrorist threat , bringing in heavy armor and firing missiles at training camps to back up their pledge . 
The armed forces have never shown much interest in stabilizing Sinai , and previous operations to clear out jihadis have not prevented them from returning . 
Egyptians blame the strictures of the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty for their military &apos;s inability to police Sinai . 
The bilateral accord stipulates that Egypt can station only 22,000 troops in the western part of the peninsula , known as Zone A. In the eastern section bordering Israel , known as Zone C , the Egyptian presence is restricted to Central Security Forces personnel . 
Composed of poorly trained cadets , the CSF is limited to carrying out &quot; normal police functions , &quot; according to the agreement &apos;s security annex . 
Jihadis have exploited the security void created by last year &apos;s revolution to reinforce their presence in Sinai . 
As the threat has mounted , Israel has allowed Egypt to increase troop levels in the peninsula beyond those stipulated in the peace accords . 
Last August , the Israelis permitted an additional seven battalions and 20 tanks in Zone C. But the Egyptian armed forces never brought in the full number of additional troops , and did not even bother to transport the tanks across the Suez Canal . 
Egypt &apos;s approach toward Sinai troop deployments reflects its traditional neglect of the peninsula . 
Historically , it has deployed only 70-80 % of the 22,000 soldiers that the treaty allows in Zone A. And the military has never established a regional command in Sinai , preferring to allow units temporarily stationed there to report to their superiors scattered around Cairo and its environs . 
Egypt &apos;s new Islamist leaders may want to restore &quot; full sovereignty &quot; over the peninsula , as President Mohamed Morsi &apos;s legal adviser , Mohamed Fouad Gadalla , recently noted . 
Such saber-rattling comments vis-Ã -vis Israel are currently popular in the country . 
Egypt &apos;s indifference toward Sinai stems from its view of Israel . 
When the guns fell silent following the two countries &quot; 1973 war , Egypt stopped viewing Israel as a threat . 
In the cease-fire talks that followed , the two sides made so much progress that US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , fearing that he would have nothing to negotiate when he arrived in the region weeks later , asked the Israelis to halt them . 
Since then , Egypt has fought a war with Libya and sporadically clashed with Sudan . 
Employing CSF troops in the sensitive border region where jihadis have established their strongholds is similarly indicative of Sinai &apos;s insignificance in Egyptian military thought . 
Created to absorb army rejects who must still complete their mandatory national service , the CSF is a lower-rung security organization in a country whose armed forces are subpar to begin with . 
Its members are uneducated rural men , some of whom are illiterate . 
Their most crucial tasks include guarding banks and hotels . 
These forces are poorly trained and badly equipped to take on fighters with experience in international jihadist campaigns . 
When it was deployed as part of the battle against the Islamist uprising of the 1990 &quot; s , insurgents penetrated a number of units . 
The government &apos;s counter-terrorism policies also work against an enhanced military role in quashing the Sinai jihadis . 
Historically , Egypt has used its intelligence services , supplemented by the police and the CSF , to fight Islamist militants . 
As a result , the army has neither the training nor the experience to grapple with Sinai insurgents . 
The military &apos;s recent offensive reflects this , relying on air strikes that imperiled civilians rather than a ground offensive that would have been more precise in achieving its objectives . 
But , beyond such theoretical objectives , lay the operation &apos;s practical realities . 
Sinai residents claim that there were no funerals following the missile strikes . 
The lack of evidence of casualties has left many Egyptian analysts believing that the military &apos;s aim was not to target jihadis , but rather to silence its domestic and international critics . 
If so , it is a tactic that can work only until the next attack .
