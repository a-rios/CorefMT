Health Care &apos;s Frequent Flyers 
NEW YORK - For those of you who have seen the ( American ) movie &quot; Up in the Air , &quot; think of the scene where George Clooney meets Vera Farmiga . 
He &apos;s an outsourced human-resources executive who flies around the country firing people on behalf of timid managers ; she &apos;s a counterpart female road warrior . 
Their courtship ritual revolves around loyalty cards : he pulls out his American Airlines Executive Platinum card ; she matches . 
Next , his Diamond VIP Hilton HHonors card ; she calmly slaps hers on the rickety table where they are sharing drinks . 
The unspoken message : points make you sexy . 
Airlines and hotels have known this for a long time . 
Dean Margolis , who long ago consulted for major airlines and is now applying the same techniques to healthy behavior , recalls wondering how to get executives to fly just a little more . It &apos;s not by offering discounts , which benefit an executive &apos;s company rather than the executive . 
Margolis asks : &quot; When the boss says &quot; Who wants to come to Philadelphia with me ? , &quot; what &apos;s going to get two people instead of one to say yes ? 
To abandon their families , stand in line , and perhaps take a middle seat ... &quot; 
Points , of course , will do the trick . 
The promise of being recognized at the airline counter , ushered to the front of the line , and , yes , looking like a big shot at the airport bar . 
Margolis &apos;s new company , MedRewards , plans to give people points for healthy behavior - everything from taking their medications regularly to signing in at the gym more than five times a week . 
As in the airline business , the actual customers won &apos;t be the users , but rather the vendors who want to influence users &quot; behavior : pharmaceutical companies who want patients to buy their drugs , along with insurers and employers who want to lower long-term costs . 
( Employers , bless them , even have an interest in keeping people healthy ! ) 
How do you translate healthy behavior into status ? 
First , of course , you can have cards identifying your compliance behavior - e.g. , not how many drugs you take , but how regularly you take them . 
As for the rewards , they could be everything from discounts on energy-saving appliances and posture-enhancing furniture to vouchers from suppliers of &quot; healthy &quot; foods . 
With the right partner , such a scheme could also include better treatment from the medical establishment : perhaps a separate phone line to call your care provider , free WiFi while you sit in the waiting room ( others have to pay ) , and even room upgrades if you &apos;re unlucky enough to need surgery . 
Just as with flying , which most people ( George Clooney &apos;s character excepted ) don &apos;t particularly like , users may eagerly sign up in order to collect points . 
MedRewards is not alone . 
A variety of other companies are taking different approaches , but all of them have the same goal - to motivate people to engage in healthy behavior . 
And all of them avoid simply paying them , which is counterproductive over the long run , and may lead to cheating . 
While some may think it worth cheating to get money , most people don &apos;t want a gold card that they know in their heart is a fraud . 
Yet many people will do all they can to game the system , a challenge that each company must confront . 
Contagion Health , in which I am an investor , uses multi-person game mechanics to turn healthy behavior into status and rewards . 
Its initial service , at http : / / imoveyou.com , allows you to challenge someone else by filling in a form , which is then published on the person &apos;s Facebook wall or on Twitter . 
For example , Alice could fill in the blanks : &quot; I will walk three extra miles if @ JuanTigar spends 30 minutes on the elliptical machine . &quot; 
Of course , people use imoveyou for other purposes - everything from challenging a roommate to make his bed to encouraging a colleague to beat a sales record . 
So much the better . 
Getting people engaged in general is healthy , too - though the corporations and health providers that sponsor subscriptions will probably put some restrictions on subject matter . 
Then there &apos;s HealthRally , which uses insights from behavioral economics to motivate people to achieve their own health and wellness goals . 
The basic insight is that owing something to your friends is a far more powerful incentive than getting something for yourself . 
The user signs up and recruits friends and family to sponsor a reward of their choice for a specified goal . 
( We can imagine a wish-list revenue opportunity here , where vendors can offer specific motivational products or services . ) 
From then on , the sponsors have an implicit right to check on the user &apos;s progress , offering support or criticism far more compelling than any stranger could . 
It &apos;s relatively easy to fail on your own , but if your friends have put up real money , it &apos;s much harder . 
While the service is currently designed for individuals , companies could also use HealthRally to enhance their corporate wellness programs . 
By providing matching financial rewards , for example , a company could leverage its employees &quot; natural support networks and provide a valuable boost to the pot . 
All three of these companies let us use our own quirks and psychology to motivate ourselves . 
Over time , MedRewards , Contagion Health , HealthRally , and others will have to prove their worth with data . 
If people who use their services actually stay healthy , work harder , and cost less , the evidence will be hard to ignore . 
And people who might not have adopted these tools on their own will be encouraged to do so by others with evidence and incentives on their side . 
Disclosure : I am an investor in Contagion Health , and am considering investments in MedRewards and HealthRally .
