Rebalancing the Eurozone 
WASHINGTON , DC - The eurozone crisis unfolded primarily as a sovereign-debt crisis mostly on its southern periphery , with interest rates on sovereign bonds at times reaching 6-7 % for Italy and Spain , and even higher for other countries . 
And , because eurozone banks hold a substantial part of their assets in the form of eurozone sovereign bonds , the sovereign-debt crisis became a potential banking crisis , worsened by banks &quot; other losses , owing , for example , to the collapse of housing prices in Spain . 
So a key challenge in resolving the eurozone crisis is to reduce the southern countries &quot; debt burdens . 
The change in a country &apos;s debt burden reflects the size of its primary budget balance ( the balance minus interest payments ) as a share of GDP , as well as the difference between its borrowing costs and its GDP growth rate . 
When the difference between borrowing costs and growth becomes too large , the primary budget surpluses required to stop debt from increasing become impossible to achieve . 
Indeed , growth in southern Europe is expected to be close to zero or negative for the next two years , and is not expected to exceed 2-3 % even in the longer term . 
While not always evident from the headlines , an underlying cause of the eurozone crisis - and now an obstacle for growth in the south - has been the divergence in production costs that developed between the peripheral countries , notably the &quot; south &quot; ( specifically , Greece , Spain , Italy , and Portugal ) and the &quot; north &quot; ( for simplicity , Germany ) during the first decade after the introduction of the euro . 
Unit labor costs in the four southern countries increased by 36 % , 28 % , 30 % , and 25 % , respectively , from 2000 to 2010 , compared to less than 5 % in Germany , resulting in an end-2010 cumulative divergence above 30 % in Greece and more than 20 % in Portugal , Italy , and Spain . 
Unit labor costs reflect compensation levels and productivity : gains in productivity can offset the effect of wage growth . 
Productivity performance did not vary dramatically between northern and southern European countries from 2000 to 2010 - in fact , average annual productivity growth was faster in Greece than in Germany ( 1 % versus 0.7 % ) . 
But labor costs increased much faster in the south , resulting in differential cost increases that cannot be addressed by devaluation as long as the monetary union endures . 
As long as this internal divergence persists , the euro crisis cannot be fully resolved , because current-account deficits and / or slow growth will continue to stalk the southern European countries , perpetuating worries about sovereign debt and commercial banks . 
In this context , productivity growth - whether through technical progress , better allocation of resources , or productive investment - is as important a variable for the southern economies as wage restraint is . 
Indeed , excessive wage deflation is likely to have negative effects on productivity . 
Skilled labor is likely to emigrate faster , and extreme austerity , falling prices , and high unemployment - and the resulting likelihood of social tension - are not exactly conducive to investment , innovation , or labor mobility . 
Likewise , while reducing employment is one way to boost productivity , it implies high macroeconomic costs in terms of lost revenues and higher social spending . 
Perhaps even more importantly , economic policy should not break a society &apos;s confidence in itself ; what economists call &quot; animal spirits &quot; must be able to reflect hope for the future . 
For all of these reasons , excessive austerity and deflation could defeat its own purpose and make the &quot; reforms &quot; to improve the southern European countries &quot; competitiveness impossible to implement . 
The right approach must combine reasonable wage restraint and low ( but not negative ) inflation with microeconomic policy measures aimed at encouraging productivity increases . 
Moreover , it is clear that northern European countries could help to close the competitiveness gap more rapidly by encouraging faster wage growth . 
Indeed , Western policy-makers &quot; strong focus on persuading the Chinese authorities to permit greater appreciation of their currency is puzzling when one considers that Germany &apos;s current-account surplus , as a share of GDP , is now much larger than China &apos;s . 
Reversing the large differential in unit labor costs that has emerged in the euro &apos;s first decade thus requires not only wage restraint and productivity-enhancing reforms in the south , but also higher wage gains in the north . 
A simulation shows that if German wages grew at 4 % annually instead of the 1.5 % of the last decade , and if annual productivity growth in Spain accelerated to 2 % ( it was close to 0.7 % in both countries ) , Spain could reverse the unit-labor-cost differential that emerged with Germany since 2000 in five years , with Spanish wages growing at about 1.7 % per annum . 
This should not be an impossible scenario . 
It would require restraint in Spain , where wages grew at an average annual rate of 3.4 % in 2000-2010 , as well as a serious effort to accelerate productivity growth . 
But it would not require falling wages or significant price deflation : annual wage growth of 1.7 % and productivity growth of 2 % would be compatible with inflation close to zero . 
Productivity growth at the historical rate of 0.7 % in Germany , with wage growth of 4 % , would be compatible with an inflation rate a little above 3 % . 
In short , internal adjustment in the eurozone is achievable without serious deflation in the south , provided that productivity growth there accelerates , and that the north does its part by encouraging modestly faster wage gains . 
The smaller current-account surplus in northern Europe that might result from this should itself be welcome . 
If the north insists on maintaining the low wage growth of the 2000-2010 period , internal adjustment would require significant unemployment and deflation in the south , making it more difficult and perhaps politically impossible to achieve .
