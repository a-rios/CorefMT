The New New Thing in Economics 
The Great Depression brought John Maynard Keynes to the forefront of economic thought . 
The key &quot; Keynesian &quot; insight was that private investment spending is inherently unstable - due to fads and fashions among investors , or because of shifts in the &quot; animal spirits &quot; of businessmen , or because falling prices disrupt the financial system . 
Keynesians thought that prudent monetary policy - central banks raising and lowering interest rates to diminish fluctuations in private investment spending - could go part of the way toward stabilizing the economy . 
But they also believed that government had to be willing to step in directly , through expansive fiscal policy , to keep the overall level of spending in an economy stable . 
Such a policy , they believed , would forever banish the specter of large-scale mass unemployment , as in the Great Depression . 
Moreover , near-full employment might effectively be guaranteed . 
The Keynesians foresaw that near-full employment raised the threat of inflation . 
After all , why should workers and unions moderate wage demands if governments will boost spending whenever high unemployment looms ? 
One big curb on high wage demands - fear of being let go when unemployment rises - was gone . 
What would replace it ? 
For the first post-1945 generation , the predominant answer was that corporatist social democracy would replace it . 
Unions would bow to government requests to moderate their demands for wage increases , and governments would bow to union demands for public spending and social insurance . 
Keynesian thinking guaranteed that nothing like the Great Depression would ever return . 
But its solution to the problem of creeping inflation was jury-rigged , and broke down completely in the 1970 &apos;s . 
In the aftermath of the main industrial countries &apos; burst of inflation in the 1970 &apos;s , mainstream economic thought in the world &apos;s industrial core shifted into a &quot; semi-Monetarist &quot; channel . 
Milton Friedman &apos;s victory was never as complete as the Keynesians &apos; had been . 
But by the mid-1980 &apos;s policymakers throughout the world were assenting to the following propositions : 
Central banks must make their commitments to long-run price stability credible ; 
Central banks must accept that the average level of unemployment is determined not by cyclical factors , but by &quot; structural &quot; factors , which they have no business trying to address ; 
Announcing and trying to maintain a money-supply growth target is an easy way for a central bank to communicate its principal intentions , gain credibility , and give outsiders a way to check whether sound policies are really being followed . 
Monetarism was the mirror image of Keynesianism . 
It seemingly guaranteed that nothing like the inflation of the 1970 &apos;s would ever return . 
But it offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment that arose in western Europe . 
The past decade and a half demonstrated that monetarism is as ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of falling prices in the context of highly-leveraged firms and banks as the Keynesian prescription was ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of inflation . 
Back in the 1970 &apos;s and at the start of the 1980 &apos;s , many ( I was one ) blamed bad decisions for the breakdown of the social-democratic systems &apos; ability to control inflation . 
Politicians did not understand that expanding social insurance was the inevitable price of wage restraint , while union leaders did not understand that if corporatist social democracy did not restrain inflation , political power would shift to the right and high unemployment would be used to restrain it . 
Today , many blame today &apos;s alarming economic conditions in the world &apos;s industrial core - more than a decade of stagnation in Japan , deflation there and in Germany , recession in Germany - on other bad decisions . 
Japanese and European central bankers did not lower interest rates far enough fast enough , banking-sector regulators shied at the jump in speculative lending , and politicians were unwilling to expand fiscal policy sufficiently . 
But politicians and central bank governors cannot always be expected to make good decisions : good policies must be designed to function even when rulers are short-sighted and badly advised . 
The inflation of the 1970 &apos;s was a natural failure of Keynesian political economy . 
The deflation that threatens Japan , Europe , and perhaps the US with the prospect of a long period of large gaps between potential and actual output is a natural failure of the semi-Monetarist orthodoxy that governed macroeconomic policy in the world &apos;s industrial core since the early 1980 &apos;s . 
Round and round we go . 
But it &apos;s not quite a circle : no government would allow a repeat of the liquidity collapse seen in the 1930 &apos;s , or the failure of banks and companies on a scale that puts the entire financial system at hazard . 
It is an upward spiral . 
The world &apos;s macroeconomic problems are real , but they will not lead to another Great Depression - in large part because policymakers remember that there once was a Great Depression . 
We need another policy-making revolution like the Keynesian and semi-Monetarist ones , a revolution that will not ( wholly ) lose sight of its predecessor &apos;s achievements , but will eliminate its natural failures . 
Where might that revolution come from ? 
Perhaps the next revolution in economics will grow out of US Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke &apos;s career-long concern with asset prices , the role of adverse selection in credit markets , and the need for central banks in difficult situations to do more than conduct short-term open-market operations . 
He believes that banks should try things like putting a floor beneath key long-term bond prices . 
Bernankeism , anyone ?
