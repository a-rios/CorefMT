How to Fail to Recover 
NEW YORK - Some people thought that Barack Obama &apos;s election would turn everything around for America . 
Because it has not , even after the passage of a huge stimulus bill , the presentation of a new program to deal with the underlying housing problem , and several plans to stabilize the financial system , some are even beginning to blame Obama and his team . 
Obama , however , inherited an economy in freefall , and could not possibly have turned things around in the short time since his inauguration . 
President Bush seemed like a deer caught in the headlights - � paralyzed , unable to do almost anything - for months before he left office . 
It is a relief that the US finally has a president who can act , and what he has been doing will make a big difference . 
Unfortunately , what he is doing is not enough . 
The stimulus package appears big - more than 2 % of GDP per year - but one-third of it goes to tax cuts . 
And , with Americans facing a debt overhang , rapidly increasing unemployment ( and the worst unemployment compensation system among major industrial countries ) , and falling asset prices , they are likely to save much of the tax cut . 
Almost half of the stimulus simply offsets the contractionary effect of cutbacks at the state level . 
America &apos;s 50 states must maintain balanced budgets . 
The total shortfalls were estimated at $ 150 billion a few months ago ; now the number must be much larger - indeed , California alone faces a shortfall of $ 40 billion . 
Household savings are finally beginning to rise , which is good for the long-run health of household finances , but disastrous for economic growth . 
Meanwhile , investment and exports are plummeting as well . 
America &apos;s automatic stabilizers - � the progressivity of our tax systems , the strength of our welfare system - have been greatly weakened , but they will provide some stimulus , as the expected fiscal deficit soars to 10 % of GDP . 
In short , the stimulus will strengthen America &apos;s economy , but it is probably not enough to restore robust growth . 
This is bad news for the rest of the world , too , for a strong global recovery requires a strong American economy . 
The real failings in the Obama recovery program , however , lie not in the stimulus package but in its efforts to revive financial markets . 
America &apos;s failures provide important lessons to countries around the world , which are or will be facing increasing problems with their banks : 
- Delaying bank restructuring is costly , in terms of both the eventual bailout costs and the damage to the overall economy in the interim . 
- Governments do not like to admit the full costs of the problem , so they give the banking system just enough to survive , but not enough to return it to health . 
- Confidence is important , but it must rest on sound fundamentals . 
Policies must not be based on the fiction that good loans were made , and that the business acumen of financial-market leaders and regulators will be validated once confidence is restored . 
- Bankers can be expected to act in their self-interest on the basis of incentives . 
Perverse incentives fueled excessive risk-taking , and banks that are near collapse but are too big to fail will engage in even more of it . 
Knowing that the government will pick up the pieces if necessary , they will postpone resolving mortgages and pay out billions in bonuses and dividends . 
- Socializing losses while privatizing gains is more worrisome than the consequences of nationalizing banks . 
American taxpayers are getting an increasingly bad deal . 
In the first round of cash infusions , they got about $ 0.67 in assets for every dollar they gave ( though the assets were almost surely overvalued , and quickly fell in value ) . 
But in the recent cash infusions , it is estimated that Americans are getting $ 0.25 , or less , for every dollar . 
Bad terms mean a large national debt in the future . 
One reason we may be getting bad terms is that if we got fair value for our money , we would by now be the dominant shareholder in at least one of the major banks . 
- Don &apos;t confuse saving bankers and shareholders with saving banks . 
America could have saved its banks , but let the shareholders go , for far less than it has spent . 
- Trickle-down economics almost never works . 
Throwing money at banks hasn &apos;t helped homeowners : foreclosures continue to increase . 
Letting AIG fail might have hurt some systemically important institutions , but dealing with that would have been better than to gamble upwards of $ 150 billion and hope that some of it might stick where it is important . 
- Lack of transparency got the US financial system into this trouble . 
Lack of transparency will not get it out . 
The Obama administration is promising to pick up losses to persuade hedge funds and other private investors to buy out banks &quot; bad assets . 
But this will not establish &quot; market prices , &quot; as the administration claims . 
With the government bearing losses , these are distorted prices . Bank losses have already occurred , and their gains must now come at taxpayers &quot; expense . 
Bringing in hedge funds as third parties will simply increase the cost . 
- Better to be forward looking than backward looking , focusing on reducing the risk of new loans and ensuring that funds create new lending capacity . 
Bygone are bygones . 
As a point of reference , $ 700 billion provided to a new bank , leveraged 10 to 1 , could have financed $ 7 trillion of new loans . 
The era of believing that something can be created out of nothing should be over . 
Short-sighted responses by politicians - who hope to get by with a deal that is small enough to please taxpayers and large enough to please the banks - will only prolong the problem . 
An impasse is looming . 
More money will be needed , but Americans are in no mood to provide it - certainly not on the terms that have been seen so far . 
The well of money may be running dry , and so , too , may be America &apos;s legendary optimism and hope .
