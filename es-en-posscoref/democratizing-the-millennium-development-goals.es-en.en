Democratizing the Millennium Development Goals 
PARIS - On September 20-22 , world leaders gather in New York to encourage progress towards meeting the United Nations &quot; Millennium Development Goals - a set of eight objectives , ranging from eradicating extreme poverty and hunger to reducing child mortality and achieving universal primary education , that are to be achieved by 2015 . 
The summit &apos;s purpose is to take stock of successes and failures , and to move towards &quot; concrete strategies for action . &quot; 
The MDGs , as they are currently conceived , address the symptoms of poverty and underdevelopment , but mostly ignore the deeper causes . 
They draw attention to 18 targets in total - those for which data are most easily compiled . 
But the result is that the MDGs may divert attention from the mechanisms that produce underdevelopment - rather like the drunken man searching for his keys under the lone streetlamp because the light is better there . 
Instead of vowing to support humanitarian objectives and throwing money at poverty &apos;s symptoms , the rich countries must recognize the urgency of removing the obstacles to development that they have the power to address . 
Each year , for example , developing countries miss out on $ 124 billion in revenue from offshore assets held in tax havens . By not closing down such tax havens , we actively encourage corrupt elites in these countries to continue cheating their populations . 
Moreover , the current system of international trade is deeply inequitable : it exposes developing countries to unfair competition , and discourages diversification of their economies . 
These countries face a burden of foreign debt - estimated at $ 500 billion for poor countries - that is simply incompatible with the pursuit of development goals . 
Addressing these issues is vital for development objectives to have any chance to succeed . 
Yet , although Goal 8 is to achieve a global partnership for development , and although some progress has been made on the debt issue , too little in fact has been done to give this initiative concrete meaning . 
Another major deficiency of the MDGs is their failure to recognize human rights as essential to any sustainable development strategy . 
They are valuable because they are operational . 
The world &apos;s one billion hungry people do not deserve charity : they have a human right to adequate food , and governments have corresponding duties , which are enshrined in international human rights law . 
Governments that are serious about making progress on development objectives should be asked to adopt a legislative framework for the realization of economic and social rights such as the right to food or the right to health care . 
That framework should be designed through a participatory process involving civil society . 
The intended beneficiaries of these actions should be defined as rights-holders . 
Accountability mechanisms should be established , allowing victims to hold governments responsible for their failure to take action . 
This removes the stigma of charity , and it is empowering for victims . 
Instead of being helped because they have unsatisfied needs , they are granted remedies because their rights are being violated . 
The framework also should include a non-discrimination requirement , ensuring that we focus our attention on the most vulnerable groups - not just the well-connected , the literate , and the favorites of the regime , and not just groups for which quick wins can be achieved . 
Because participation should be ensured in the process , the people whom we seek to support will co-design and co-improve the systems that are meant to serve them . 
They become actors rather than passive recipients of aid , and aid is more effective as a result . 
All democratic revolutions begin with human rights . 
The MDG summit is missing an opportunity to begin this much-needed revolution in our understanding of economic development as well .
