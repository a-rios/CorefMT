China &apos;s One-Child Calamity 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - The abolition of China &apos;s 35-year-old one-child policy closes one of the darkest chapters in the country &apos;s history . 
In the late 1970s , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , determined to boost economic growth , decided that population control was the answer . 
Millions of abortions , sterilizations , and infanticides later , its chickens are coming home to roost . 
In raw numbers , the one-child policy &apos;s human toll has been even greater than that of Mao &apos;s Great Leap Forward , which caused a famine that killed around 36 million people from 1959 to 1961 . 
And it exceeded that of the Cultural Revolution , in which large-scale political violence likely caused as many as another ten million deaths from 1966 to 1976 . 
As for the one-child policy , data released by China &apos;s health ministry in 2013 indicate that from 1971 to 2012 , 336 million abortions - more than the entire US population - were carried out in registered facilities alone . 
( Though the one-child policy was not introduced until about 1979 , other family-planning policies were already in place at the time . ) 
The National Health and Family Planning Commission , the government agency responsible for enforcing the one-child policy , reports an even higher figure : more than 13 million surgical abortions each year - a figure that does not include abortions induced by drugs or carried out in unregistered private clinics . 
Of course , it is impossible to know precisely what share of those abortions can be attributed to enforcement of the one-child policy . 
But in , say , India , where abortion is legal and no comparable family-planning policy exists , the figure is significantly lower - though probably not as low as the 630,000 annual figure provided by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare . 
Indeed , it is probably closer to six million per year . 
Although there is undoubtedly an economic disparity between India and China , their populations are roughly equal . 
So it is reasonable to estimate that as many as half of China &apos;s abortions - some 6.5 million registered surgical abortions , plus untold numbers of drug-induced or unregistered abortions , per year - are attributable to the one-child policy . 
This implies that there were upwards of 200 million abortions over the policy &apos;s 35 years . 
But forced abortions are only the beginning . 
Indeed , these figures - however shocking - do not capture the human suffering or the harsh economic consequences brought about by the one-child policy . 
Media often reported stories of unspeakable brutality by local officials against pregnant women and families who violated the policy - a unique savagery captured in Ma Jian &apos;s novel The Dark Road . 
In a much-publicized 2012 case , local officials in Shaanxi province forced a woman to undergo an abortion seven months into her pregnancy . 
Beyond physical and emotional trauma , violators of the one-child policy - who are most often among the country &apos;s poorest - face serious economic penalties . 
Provincial sampling suggests that the Chinese government collects about CN Â¥ 20 billion ( $ 3 billion ) per year in family-planning fines . 
And local officials in many localities explicitly threaten violators with other harsh punishments , including destruction of their houses and confiscation of their farm animals . 
The one-child policy &apos;s long-term demographic consequences have been devastating as well . 
According to official data , China &apos;s old-age dependency ratio - the ratio of those aged 65 and up to working-age people ( aged 15-64 ) - currently stands at 13 % . 
As the one-child generation ages - adding some ten million retirees annually - this ratio will skyrocket , with the labor surplus that supported China &apos;s economic miracle giving way to a severe shortage that depresses growth . 
Equally problematic is China &apos;s alarming gender imbalance . 
Families &quot; preference that their one child be male led to innumerable sex-selective abortions , as well as female infanticide and abandonment . 
As of 2013 , boys aged 0-24 outnumbered girls by 23 million , implying that more than 20 million young men will not be able to find marriage partners in the coming decades . 
The most sobering lesson from this tally of the one-child policy &apos;s toll on China lies in the simple fact that the authorities were able to enforce it for so long . 
In fact , China is the only country in history where a government has actually succeeded in using coercion to limit its people &apos;s reproductive choices . 
The key is its unconstrained one-party regime , underpinned by a huge and powerful bureaucracy . 
Outside observers often marvel at the CCP &apos;s capacity to get things done - at least when those things are the construction of super-modern cities and a high-speed rail network . 
Seldom do they note the disastrous consequences when the Party applies its power in stubborn pursuit of a brutal and destructive objective . 
Now is the time to recognize those consequences , particularly given that China &apos;s leaders are not done limiting their citizens &quot; reproductive choices . 
On the contrary , they are simply moving from a one-child policy to a two-child policy . 
Outsiders and Chinese alike must emphasize the senseless cruelty that such measures imply and work to ensure that they are never seen again - in China or anywhere else .
