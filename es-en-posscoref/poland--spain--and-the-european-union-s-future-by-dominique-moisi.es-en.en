Europe Moves East 
PARIS - Madrid and Warsaw recently looked very similar : both were the sites of massive demonstrations . 
But the crowds gathered at Europe &apos;s western and eastern extremities had very different agendas in mind . 
In Spain , citizens were united by economic and social despair . 
They took to the streets to express their rejection of a European Union-imposed austerity policy that they believe is leading them into an abyss . 
They want jobs and the dignity and salaries that go with them . 
The indignation of some had a clear anti-capitalist and anti-globalization tone . 
In the Polish capital , Catholic and conservative parties , together with the &quot; Solidarity &quot; Trade Union , inspired by a reactionary Christian radio network , &quot; Radio Maria , &quot; gathered for political and cultural , rather than economic , reasons . 
In the name of the defense of media freedom , they were denouncing a government that they found too &quot; centrist &quot; and insufficiently &quot; Polish . &quot; 
Ten years ago , then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously distinguished between &quot; Old &quot; and &quot; New &quot; Europe on the basis of their attitudes toward the United States and the war in Iraq . 
New Europe ( at least its governments ) , understanding the need to exercise power , was from Mars , whereas Old Europe ( with the main exception of Great Britain ) , having decayed into a culture of weakness , was from Venus . 
The differences between the demonstrations in Madrid and Warsaw suggest that the distinction between Old and New Europe remains valid , though not in the way that Rumsfeld meant . 
Of course , it would be inaccurate to oppose a thriving Poland to a collapsing Spain . 
Given the overall European crisis , even Poland &apos;s economy is no longer booming . 
Unemployment is around 10 % ( still less than half the Spanish rate ) , and annual GDP growth is around 1 % ( Spain &apos;s growth rate is negative ) . 
But the moods in the two countries , as well as their perceptions of Europe and their role in it , contrast starkly . 
Poland , which is not yet part of the eurozone , sees no alternative to the EU . 
The country has fully reconciled itself with America &apos;s strategic shift away from the European continent , even though Poles are as obsessively fearful of Russia as ever . 
And can one blame them , given that Russia seems more nostalgic for its imperial tradition than ever ? 
But , given the political evolution of Ukraine , not to mention Belarus , Poland can no longer dream of an Eastern future . 
Poland &apos;s only way is West - but the European West more than the American one . 
Poland is benefiting from economic growth and prosperity in Germany , its immediate western neighbor and closest ally . 
Reconciliation between the two countries has been one of their greatest achievements , and Poland may , for the first time in its history , be in the right place - close to Berlin - at the right time . 
By contrast , Spain seems to be moving south , figuratively if not literally ( witness the desertification affecting some parts of Andalusia ) . 
But Spain adamantly - and legitimately - refuses to be compared with Greece . 
Consider its modern infrastructure , the dynamism of its young entrepreneurs , and the internationally recognized quality of its cultural goods . 
The Spaniards are right . 
It is not so much that its people want to leave the eurozone ( or , for that matter , that many want their regions to leave Spain ) ; rather , the country wants to remain itself - that is , to maintain a lifestyle that is largely the product of climate . 
For Poles , the EU is still a tool for modernization , whereas Spaniards increasingly consider it synonymous with an attack on their dignity , if not on their essence . 
How can one unite member countries with such different emotional calendars ? 
And how can Europe move ahead with such vivid pecking orders ? 
Spaniards are offended when they are compared to Greeks , Poles are shocked when they are compared with Spaniards , the French refuse to be compared to Italians , and so on , in an infernal spiral . 
Yet not long ago - after the fall of Franco - Poles looked with envy at Spain . 
Here I am reminded of a conversation with the Polish historian , statesman , and politician Bronis≈Çaw Geremek in 1978 , when we shared an office in Washington , DC . 
Both were unable to integrate modernity into their institutions , and both had fallen into decline after a brilliant historical period between the late fifteenth and early eighteenth centuries . 
Poland had even disappeared from the map of Europe - the victim of its immediate neighbors &quot; virulent greed . 
Democracy returned to Spain in 1975 , and the country soon recovered its place within Europe , just when Poland seemed trapped in its tragic history . 
But , 11 years after my conversation with Geremek , communism collapsed in Poland , and in 2004 the country &apos;s &quot; return &quot; to Europe was complete . 
Today &apos;s Poles do not believe that Europe has cheated them . 
Nearly everywhere , you can see tangible signs of the EU &apos;s support : a bridge here , a school there . 
In Spain , by contrast , disillusion with the Union has replaced the early enthusiasm of the &quot; movida &quot; period . 
Whether that remains true will most likely determine the future of Europe .
