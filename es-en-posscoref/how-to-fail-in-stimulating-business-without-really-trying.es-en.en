How to Fail in Stimulating Business Without Really Trying 
CAMBRIDGE : Debates about supply side reform often come down to slogans : flexible labor markets , deregulation , and more competition . 
Even when everyone agrees about what to do , however , nothing much usually happens . 
Suppose you are an economics minister serious about improving the supply side of your economy but short on specific ideas about what to do . 
One interesting answer comes from a research group at Harvard University organized by Andrei Shleifer , a distinguished economist who focuses on how governments make economic life harder than it need be . 
Shleifer &apos;s research looks at 75 countries and asks how many formal steps it takes to establish ( legally and without bribes ) a new company , how long it takes to do so , and what is the cost . 
For if a country makes it hard to create companies , don &apos;t be surprised if new companies are few and far between . 
And if companies are not created , where will growth and employment come from ? 
The table ( see at the bottom of the text ) gives a flavor of the odyssey involved in setting up a business : an average for 75 countries shows more than 10 separate steps of getting various certificates and a cumulative time of 63 days spent in getting the paperwork done ( assuming no bureaucratic delays ) and total payments to government as high as one third of a year &apos;s income . 
The numbers are stunning , particularly when you ask what does the state really do other than register a name and give out a tax number ? 
Who has time to spend a 110 days , as in the Slovak Republic , running around government offices ? 
What struggling entrepreneur has the money to spend a $ 1,000 , as in Poland , on paper work ? 
Canada wins this contest of bureaucracies : government interventions are minimal , user friendly and come at low cost ; 
Who is worst ? 
Bolivia . 
In between sits the rest of the 75 , including Western Europe . 
Italy , to cite just one example , is a bureaucratic embarrassment where it takes 4 months for an entrepreneur to set up a business . 
Brazil , your typical Latin American country looks pretty awful in this competition ; so do most Eastern European economies . 
Go beyond North America , the Nordic countries , Australia and New Zealand - the world supply side leaders - indeed , and conditions become awful real fast . 
Harvard &apos;s researchers ask : is this red tape strictly necessary ? 
Attempts to show the benefits of entry regulation on business fail miserably . 
Bureaucracies , Shleifer concludes , impose hurdles mostly to set themselves up for rip-offs , bribes or safe , comfortable jobs . 
Not only does an economy suffer by having fewer jobs than it might with more user-friendly entry conditions , it also suffers the burden of paying for and enduring a bureaucracy . 
Because excessive entry regulation serves no other purpose , reforming governments should act : eliminate the obstacle course . 
An argument is made , of course , that these hurdles mean nothing in practice : if obstacles to operating in the formal economy are too cumbersome , businesses simply go underground . 
They work just as well , the argument goes , so where is the damage ? 
Nonsense . 
Not only is it bad economic strategy to criminalize business formation and operation by pushing it underground , the fact is that a lot of businesses simply won &apos;t come into existence , not even in the informal sector . 
Suppose , once again , that you a minister in charge . 
You despise corruption and bureaucratic excess ; you demand change . 
What to do ? 
Brazil once experimented with a minister of de-bureaucratization . 
The new minister went around the country , looked at every single form to be filled out in the various interfaces with the government . 
He eliminated perhaps a third of them . 
This was a real triumph in a country where officials love to stamp papers for just about anything . 
What happened next ? 
Nobody remembers : its job supposedly finished , the ministry went out of existence . 
Bureaucracy , however , is harder to kill . 
Today , Brazil &apos;s paper maze is stronger than ever . 
This confirms a rule that Shleifer and his colleagues intuit : the only way to control bureaucrats is to get rid of as many as you can , permanently . 
So long as they squat in their offices , bureaucrats will find something to do and , unfortunately , it usually comes down to &quot; protecting the public from business &quot; or , in other words , impeding business from working .
