McCain , Obama , and Hot Air 
WASHINGTON , DC - Whatever the outcome of the United States &quot; presidential election , climate change policy will be transformed . 
Both candidates have placed great importance on global warming . 
Republican John McCain believes that it presents &quot; a test of foresight , of political courage , and of the unselfish concern that one generation owes to the next , &quot; while Democrat Barack Obama calls it &quot; one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation . &quot; 
It remains far from clear , however , whether the shift in rhetoric and policy will move the planet any closer to embracing the best response . 
Both McCain and Obama could leave future generations lumbered with the costs of major cuts in carbon emissions - without major cuts in temperatures . 
Both politicians are keen to tap into voters &quot; concerns about global warming . 
McCain launched a television commercial declaring that he had &quot; stood up to President George Bush &quot; on global warming . 
If elected , Obama plans to count on former vice president and passionate campaigner Al Gore to help &quot; lead the fight &quot; against warming . 
Each would introduce aggressive targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions . 
Obama &apos;s plan would reduce emissions by 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 , while McCain aims to ensure that emissions are 60 % lower by then . 
Both would achieve these ambitious cuts by the same method : a cap-and-trade system that imposes limits on industry emissions and forces businesses to buy rights to any additional emissions . 
A cap-and-trade system can seem like a neat market solution . 
In fact , it is worse than a straightforward carbon tax . 
With a tax , the costs are obvious . 
With a cap-and-trade system , the costs - in terms of jobs , household consumption , and economic growth - are hidden , shifted around , and not easy to estimate , though models indicate they will run into trillions of dollars . 
Not everybody would lose . 
Some big businesses in privileged positions would make a fortune from exploiting this rather rigged market . 
And politicians would have an opportunity to control the number and distribution of emission permits and the flow of billions of dollars in subsidies and sweeteners . 
This is a very expensive , unwieldy way to achieve a very small reduction in temperatures . 
The Warner-Lieberman bill on climate change - a piece of legislation which was recently abandoned in the US Senate but is seen as a precursor of future policy - would have postponed the temperature increase in 2050 by about two years . 
Recently , the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered eight of the world &apos;s top economists - including five Nobel laureates - to examine research on the best ways to tackle 10 global challenges : air pollution , conflict , disease , global warming , hunger and malnutrition , lack of education , gender inequity , lack of water and sanitation , terrorism , and trade barriers . 
Their goal was to create a prioritized list showing how money could best be spent combating these problems . 
The panel concluded that the least-effective use of resources would come from simply cutting CO2 emissions . 
A lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the group that shared last year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize with Gore - told the experts that spending $ 800 billion over 100 years solely on mitigating emissions would reduce inevitable temperature increases by just 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century . 
Even accounting for the key environmental damage from warming , we would lose money , with avoided damages of just $ 685 billion for our $ 800 billion investment . 
The expert panel concluded that investing in research and development into low-carbon energy would be a much sounder , more effective option - an effort that both McCain and Obama support . 
But this , not carbon emissions , should be the core of their climate change policy . 
Currently , low-carbon energy solutions are prohibitively expensive . 
The typical cost of cutting a ton of CO2 is now about $ 20 , but the damage from a ton of carbon in the atmosphere is about $ 2 . 
So we need to reduce by roughly ten-fold the cost of cutting emissions . 
We can achieve this by spending dramatically more researching and developing low-carbon energy . 
The US could provide leadership by committing to spending 0.05 % of its GDP exploring non-carbon-emitting energy technologies - wind , wave , or solar power - or capturing CO2 emissions from power plants . 
It would then have the moral authority to demand that other nations do the same . By focusing more on research and development , and less in carbon cuts , both candidates could embrace a solution that encourages the best of the American innovative spirit and leaves the best possible legacy to future generations : a high-income , low-carbon energy world .
