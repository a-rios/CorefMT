France &apos;s Presidential Reality Show 
The Socialists &quot; anointment of Ségolène Royal &apos;s as their presidential candidate is an important step on the road to the Fifth Republic &apos;s eighth presidential election , which is set for April 22 , 2007 , with a second-round runoff two weeks later . 
All candidates should be known by the end of January - the deadline for printing the ballots . 
So , by that point , France &apos;s four main political parties , two on the left and two on the right , must prepare their party manifestoes and choose candidates . 
That , at least , is how the system is supposed to work in theory . 
In practice , while the official campaign is supposed to last only two months ( long enough in a democracy , in which candidates have to endure an unrelenting media barrage ) , the jockeying of potential candidates , together with the media &apos;s appetite for a horse race , helped kick off the real campaign nearly a year and a half ago . 
So today &apos;s public debates have a somewhat surreal character , because the programs on which the candidates will stake their campaigns are still not developed . 
In their absence , personality and style , not political programs , have proven decisive . 
I am not sure this is good for democracy , but that &apos;s the way it is . 
Two such stylish personalities have so far commandeered the public opinion polls , and appear destined to meet in the second round . 
On the right is Nicolas Sarkozy , the interior minister ( and briefly the economy minister ) , whose political rise took place within the grab-bag framework of the Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) . 
The UMP is the political heir of Gaullism , but its ideological inconsistency is legendary - and reflected in party name changes every eight to ten years . 
Sarkozy is philosophically a conservative , but an ultra-liberal on economic issues , making him totally foreign to the Gaullist tradition . 
Preaching privatization and social repression , he has placed himself to the right of the right , hoping to take back the votes that the mainstream right has been losing to Jean-Marie Le Pen &apos;s &quot; fascistoid &quot; National Front for the past 20 years . 
Sarkozy imposed himself on the Gaullist movement against the will of President Jacques Chirac ; indeed , he snatched the presidency of the UMP despite Chirac &apos;s active opposition . 
Much of the public likes his raw language and harsh criticism of the rest of the right , notably of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , but above all of Chirac . 
He knows nothing about international affairs , but no one seems to hold it against him . 
On the left , Royal , the Socialist president of the region of Poitou-Charentes , has scant government experience , serving brief stints as environment minister , family minister , and education minister . 
The anger of the Socialist Party &apos;s barons at Royal &apos;s rise was amusing to observe . 
She has yet to deal with the major problems of the day - financial instability , Europe &apos;s sluggish growth , the Middle East - and she cannot avoid them during her campaign . 
But , full of elegance and charm , and treating social problems with good sense and energy , she has topped public opinion polls for over a year . 
So Sarkozy and Royal are universally expected to be the two leading candidates heading into the &quot; High Noon &quot; encounter of the second round . 
But , judging from the past , this is not how French politics works . 
Ever since de Gaulle , all candidates for the French presidency who started too early have lost . 
Poher , Chaban-Delmas , Barre , Balladur , and I were picked out by the media and treated as candidates for more than two years before the election , whether declared or not , and we were all eventually beaten . 
My own feeling is that the bombardment by the media is of such violence that the credibility of a candidate cannot endure for more than a few weeks . 
Overexposure hurts . 
So in this bizarre dance , where the big parties and important candidates know that it is better to start later , the real beneficiaries of today &apos;s media circus are the candidates without any real chance of winning : a fascist , another extreme rightist , a communist , two Trotskyites , and a few other marginal personalities . 
They are candidates only in order to benefit from two years of free publicity . 
But those minor candidates underscore a deeper problem . 
To be elected President of France , one needs more than charisma , a good program , and a strong political party . 
One also must avoid the fragmentation that doomed the left in 2002 , when none of its six candidates qualified for the second round , leaving Jacques Chirac , who had received 19 % of the vote in the first round - a record low for a final winner ­ - to defeat Jean-Marie Le Pen in the runoff with 82 % of the vote . 
The most openly conservative French government of the past decade was essentially elected by the left . 
A repeat of this scenario seems possible : on the left , outside of the Socialist Party , there are already four announced candidates , and a fifth is likely . 
On the right , Chirac &apos;s antagonism toward Sarkozy makes it that another candidate will appear at some point , either Michele Alliot-Marie , the defense minister , or Chirac himself . 
At this point , the main point to remember is that all of France &apos;s last seven presidential elections have sprung a surprise . 
The final result was never discernible in the polls more than six weeks in advance . 
So , for the moment , the election is too far off to know or predict anything with certainty . 
What we hear is idle speculation . 
But at least the media are doing brisk business , and we are being entertained .
