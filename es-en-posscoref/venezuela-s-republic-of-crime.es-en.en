Venezuela &apos;s Republic of Crime 
WASHINGTON , DC - The recent kidnapping of Carlos Pujalte , Mexico &apos;s ambassador to Venezuela , has cast an unflattering light on the latter country &apos;s declining public safety . 
Over the past year , several diplomats have suffered a similar fate in Caracas , Venezuela &apos;s capital . 
In recent years , Venezuela &apos;s crime rates have increased more than those of any other Latin American country . 
In 1998 , when President Hugo Chávez was first elected , 4,550 murders were recorded . 
By 2011 , that number had skyrocketed to 19,336 - an astonishing figure that exceeds the total number of murders in the United States and the European Union combined . 
Today , with a homicide rate of 67 per 100,000 people , Venezuela trails only Honduras and El Salvador . 
The situation is especially bad in Caracas , which has likely become the world &apos;s most dangerous city . 
At approximately 210 murders per 100,000 inhabitants , the city &apos;s murder rate has now surpassed that of Mexico &apos;s Ciudad Juárez - the front line in Latin America &apos;s drug wars . 
The Venezuelan security debacle is as enlightening as it is tragic . 
It offers a cautionary tale about the limits of easy explanations , prescriptions , and predictions when it comes to crime . 
Standard narratives about high crime in Latin America put income inequality at the heart of the problem , and higher human-development levels at the core of the solution . 
Such assessments are not concocted out of thin air : there is a strong and positive empirical relationship between inequality and crime almost everywhere in the world . 
Yet income inequality in Venezuela has fallen dramatically in recent years . 
The country &apos;s Gini coefficient - a 0-1 scale used to measure dispersions of income and wealth - shows that inequality fell from 0.498 in 1998 to 0.412 in 2008 , a drop unparalleled in Latin America . 
Meanwhile , human-development levels have improved consistently in the country ; the United Nations &quot; Human Development Index showed a 1 % increase every year during the past decade . 
No one would guess Venezuela &apos;s crime crisis from looking at these figures . 
In fact , even factors that are related to crime in general may have limited predictive power in certain circumstances . 
Crime tends to be idiosyncratic and linked to complex social dynamics that do not lend themselves to easy or uniform solutions . 
Criminal violence is a syndrome in which many factors converge and reinforce each other in ways that generate problems greater than the sum of their parts . 
In Venezuela , some of these factors are attributable to Chávez &apos;s policy failures , including the collapse of law-enforcement institutions , the systematic weakening of local governments , and the country &apos;s increased role in the narcotics trade ( owing in part to the Venezuelan government &apos;s semi-official policy of sheltering the FARC , the Colombian narco-guerilla army ) . 
But , while these factors may help to explain high crime rates , they are not the full story . 
Indeed , Venezuela shows that there simply are no easy explanations and blanket prescriptions for Latin America &apos;s crime riddle . 
The situation is irreducibly messy . 
Similar reservations apply to predicting the political ramifications of high crime levels . 
Perhaps the most vexing question in Venezuela is why Chávez has been largely spared citizens &quot; wrath . 
Crime was already the most important concern , by a large margin , for Venezuelans just before Chávez was comfortably reelected in 2006 . 
Today , his approval rate hovers around 60 % , despite the country &apos;s horrific public-safety conditions . 
Venezuelans , it appears , care deeply about crime , but ultimately define their political preferences around other concerns , mostly related to economic welfare and ideological leanings . 
Perhaps the deterioration of citizen security is less politically explosive than is often assumed . 
After all , there is scant support for the notion that violence-related issues are sufficient to move people to throw political incumbents out . 
It is difficult to think of a single instance in which the deterioration of public security sealed a governing party &apos;s fate in Latin America . 
Venezuela &apos;s crime problem , rampant as it is , will most likely not prove to be Chávez &apos;s undoing . 
Such political apathy points to a depressing conclusion : when it comes to crime , people adapt . 
They change their behavior , accept greater encroachment on their civil liberties , and embrace an increasingly cavalier attitude towards the rule of law . 
The real political implications of crime are to be found more in these beliefs than in potential support for coups , or electoral results . 
According to the 2010 AmericasBarometer ( a survey that focuses on democratic values and the economy in Latin America ) , 40 % of Latin Americans support the idea that the authorities should be entitled to violate the law in prosecuting offenders , while 27 % approve of individuals punishing criminals with their own hands . 
More than 100 million people in the region are thus reluctant to accept basic principles underpinning the rule of law and the state &apos;s monopoly over the legitimate means of violence . 
Such sentiments are the real threat - not to Chávez &apos;s rule , but to the quality of democratic coexistence in Latin America . 
The fact that the threat is not readily apparent makes these attitudes &quot; corrosive effects all the more difficult to prevent or address .
