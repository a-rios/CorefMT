The Next Welfare State 
A market economy is efficient , but it is not just . 
Because wages are determined by the law of scarcity , some people cannot earn enough money to live a decent life . 
In Western Europe , the welfare state helps these people . 
It guarantees a socio-cultural subsistence minimum by paying replacement incomes in the form of social aid , unemployment benefits , or early retirement benefits . 
If the market does not provide you with a sufficient income from your labor , the state will provide an income without requiring you to work . 
But , as humane as this policy is meant to be , it is largely responsible for the mass unemployment from which Europe suffers . 
The reason is simple . 
Replacement incomes are wages for doing nothing . 
They establish &quot; reservations wages &quot; or minimum wage demands against the private economy that employers are increasingly unwilling or unable to satisfy . 
Employers are not altruists . 
They employ a worker only if there is a surplus of his contribution over his cost and if this surplus is not smaller than the respective surplus that a rival worker in another country or a robot could generate . 
And workers are not stupid . 
They accept a job only if they earn more than the public replacement income . 
Thus , workers who are not productive enough to justify a wage above the replacement income are bound to become unemployed . 
While this is an old problem in Western Europe , it has been dramatically exacerbated by the fall of the Iron Curtain , which , together with China &apos;s opening , suddenly brought 28 % of mankind into the western market system . 
The integration of the Asian Tigers in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s was difficult enough . 
The addition of the ex-communist countries and China will remain the world &apos;s biggest challenge in the first half of this century . 
While the integration of these economies may yield gains from trade for most countries , it created huge problems in the West , stemming from more intense downward pressure on the wages of the unskilled . 
Financial capital and direct investment will flow from West to East , the Western economies will be forced to specialize in highly skilled , capital-intensive production that creates fewer jobs , and unskilled immigrants will move to the West . 
All of these forces increase the excess supply of unskilled labor in the West , thereby reducing the equilibrium wage rate . 
Movement towards a new equilibrium will last decades . 
Most readers of this article will be dead before it is reached . 
The process will be enduring and persistent . 
If Western labor markets were flexible and gave way to the increasing pressure , employment could be maintained because the wages for unskilled workers would fall . 
Germany , for example , plans to impose a legal minimum wage , as other countries have done in the past . 
But such measures will merely worsen the situation : specialization in activities in which unskilled workers are not needed intensifies , even more capital will leave the country , and even more people will be attracted from abroad , driving more domestic residents into the welfare system . 
Mass unemployment in the West will be higher , not lower . 
Europe &apos;s welfare system based on replacement incomes and minimum wages will not survive globalization . 
It may take another decade or two for politicians to understand this , but in the end they will understand . 
There is no way to turn back the tide of history . 
The real question , then , is whether the European welfare state must die altogether . 
A new welfare system that could preserve Europe &apos;s social values would have to be based on wage supplements rather than replacement incomes . 
Everyone would have to work , at whatever wage he finds employment , and the government would then pay a supplemental income to ensure a socially acceptable standard of living . 
When governments pay people while they work , rather than for them not to work , as is the case today , welfare benefits imply no minimum wage demands . 
Income from labor freely adjusts to forge an equilibrium between supply and demand . 
With lower wages , more jobs are created , because employers find it profitable to realize a larger fraction of the blueprints on their tables and the ideas in their heads . 
Poverty will be avoided because unskilled workers will have two incomes : one earned by themselves and one provided by the government . 
Such a system is expensive , but so is the current system , which pays millions of people 100 % of their incomes while they are not working . 
In the new system , the state pays even more people , but the payments per head are much smaller as they represent a supplementary rather than a full income . 
It is a matter of algebra and econometrics to determine which system is cheaper . 
According to reasonable estimates for Germany by the Ifo Institute , a welfare system based on wage supplements will , indeed , be cheaper . 
In any case , substituting replacement incomes with wage supplements will not only lead to more employment and higher GDP , but ensure that fewer people are deprived of the dignity that only a responsible working life can offer .
