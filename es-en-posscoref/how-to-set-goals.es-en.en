How to Set Goals 
COPENHAGEN - At this century &apos;s start , leaders from every country agreed to pursue the United Nations &quot; Millennium Development Goals . 
The ambition was to improve significantly the lot of the planet &apos;s most disadvantaged citizens before 2015 . 
The intention was laudable , but 11 years on , progress in achieving the MDGs has been uneven . 
As decision-makers start to consider what our aspirations should be after the deadline has expired , it is worth looking back at what worked , what didn &apos;t , and how we could do better . 
The targets set by the MDGs basically amounted to a list of &quot; things that would be good to achieve . &quot; 
We have made progress on almost all of them , but not nearly enough on most . 
We have done reasonably well at ensuring that a child born in 2015 is likely to face fewer material burdens than his or her parents . 
But significant challenges and massive inequalities remain . 
As always , we should ask ourselves how we could ensure faster progress . 
The MDGs comprised eight sweeping statements of ambition : the world decided to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger ; achieve universal primary education ; promote gender equality and empower women ; reduce child mortality rates ; improve maternal health ; combat HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other diseases ; ensure environmental sustainability ; and develop a global partnership for development . 
These goals were underpinned by concrete targets . 
We aimed , for example , to halve the proportion of people living on less than $ 1 a day ; to achieve decent employment for women , men , and young people ; to reduce by three-quarters the maternal mortality rate ; and to reduce by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate . 
Nobody could argue with any of these goals . 
But their formulation is inconsistent . 
Why aim to reduce poverty by half , maternal mortality by three-quarters , and under-five mortality by two-thirds ? 
Why set specific reduction targets in these areas , and yet remain vague on our desire to &quot; achieve decent employment &quot; ? 
And why these particular goals ? 
Why aspire to improve access to information technology ( the Internet , mobile phones ) but not to basic energy ? 
Today , 1.6 billion people do not have electricity ; when the sun sets , their lives are literally beset by darkness . 
And why no target to reduce the 1.4 million deaths each year from indoor air pollution , largely caused by the use of poor fuels like wood , cardboard , and dung for cooking and heating ? 
The MDGs have been helpful in focusing attention on some areas of need . 
Clean water and sanitation , deforestation , and gender inequality in education are not topics that receive much media attention or focus in developed countries . 
The MDGs helped to ensure that these issues did not disappear from the policy agenda , and , partly as a result , there has been progress in at least the first two areas . 
But we could have gone a step further and paid closer attention to the areas where we could achieve the most good . 
We actually knew back in 2000 that we were unlikely to achieve the goals : the World Bank estimated that in addition to policy and service-delivery reform in many countries , annual overseas development aid would need to increase by $ 50 billion . 
Instead of agreeing to broad aspirations , it would have been more worthwhile to use the goals to highlight specific , more achievable investments . 
According to an analysis by Nobel laureates and other prestigious economists for the Copenhagen Consensus Center , these investments include expanded immunization for children , efforts to lower the price of schooling , and initiatives to end the &quot; silent hunger &quot; of micronutrient deficiency . 
Despite the MDGs &quot; breadth , one issue received the most attention by far over the past decade : global warming . 
Indeed , among world leaders and policymakers , no other development-related issue came close . 
The European Union &apos;s climate policy is costing $ 250 billion a year , enough to have achieved all of the Millennium Development Goals . 
Yet its impact on global temperature in a hundred years will be immeasurable . 
When it comes to &quot; doing good &quot; in the world , there is a big difference between focusing on problems and focusing on solutions . 
Global warming highlights this contrast . 
We understandably focus on the problem , and then take for granted that a global carbon-reduction deal is the only logical solution . 
But such a comprehensive deal appears to be politically impossible , and has been shown to be incredibly ineffective . 
While global warming is a serious challenge ( and will exacerbate other problems ) , cutting carbon emissions is a poor solution - and a poor use of funds compared to the alternatives . 
Finding the smartest solutions to problems requires prioritizing - an effort that the MDGs do not explicitly make , and which many people find distasteful . 
But if we do not explicitly choose between policies based on their effectiveness , often the decision is made for us by other factors , including which issue attracts the most media attention or has self-interested corporations and activists pushing for a specific investment . 
An overarching theme of the MDGs was to reduce poverty . 
We will succeed , by 2015 , in halving the proportion of people whose income is less than $ 1 a day . 
But this is thanks almost entirely to the massive economic strides taken by China and India , which show how effectively trade can reduce poverty . 
Yet developed countries have rendered politically impossible reforms that would reduce trade barriers for developing countries . 
While we have spent all of our time writing a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol , we have all but forgotten the Doha Round of trade talks . 
Overall , the Millennium Development Goals improved the planet . 
But when we set new goals in 2015 , we will need to be much more honest about focusing on areas where we can achieve the most good .
