Money , Politics , and Opposition to Bush 
Money and its role in American politics is a subject of constant debate . 
Despite many attempts at reform , the funds spent on US national elections grow every time voters go to the polls . 
Many believe that essentially unlimited private money favors the Republicans . 
Billionaire and philanthropist George Soros , a proponent of reform , has been accused of hypocrisy because of his large financial contributions in connection with the upcoming presidential election . 
In this article , Soros explains his reasons , and his views on the subject of money in politics . 
I and a number of other wealthy Americans are contributing millions of dollars to grass-roots organizations engaged in the 2004 presidential election . 
We are deeply concerned with the direction in which the Bush administration is taking the United States and the world . 
If Americans reject the president &apos;s policies at the polls , America can write off the Bush Doctrine as a temporary aberration and resume its rightful place in the world . 
If American voters endorse those policies , the US shall have to live with the hostility of the world and endure a vicious cycle of escalating violence . 
In this effort , I have committed $ 10 million to &apos; America Coming Together , ( ACT ) &apos; a grass-roots get-out-the-vote operation , and $ 2.5 million to the &apos; MoveOn.org Voter Fund , &apos; a popular Internet advocacy group that is airing advertisements to highlight the administration &apos;s misdeeds . 
This is a pittance in comparison with money raised and spent by US conservative groups . 
Rather than a debate on the issues , there &apos;s been a lot of name-calling about my donations by such groups as the Republican National Committee and the National Rifle Association . 
In an attempt to taint the groups I support and intimidate other donors , they imply that my contributions are illegitimate or that I have somehow broken the law . 
In fact , I have scrupulously abided by both the letter and the spirit of the law . 
Both &apos; America Coming Together &apos; and the &apos; MoveOn.org Voter Fund &apos; are organizations that , according to a specific reference in the US tax code are entitled to receive unlimited contributions from individuals . 
Both groups are fully transparent about their motives and activities . 
Both file detailed and frequent reports with government regulators . 
America &apos;s most recent campaign finance law attempts to limit the influence that special interests can gain by financing candidates and so level the playing field between the Republican and Democratic parties . 
My contributions are made in that spirit . 
President Bush has a huge fundraising advantage because he has figured out a clever way to raise money . 
He relies on donors he calls &quot; Pioneers , &quot; who collect $ 100,000 apiece in campaign contributions in increments that fall within the legal limit of $ 2,000 that any individual can give , and on those he calls &quot; Rangers , &quot; who collect at least $ 200,000 . 
Many of these Pioneers and Rangers are corporate officials who are well situated to raise funds from their business associates , bundle them together and pass them along with tracking numbers to ensure proper &quot; credit &quot; to each individual donor of $ 2,000 . 
Thus they are buying the same level of access and influence for their corporate interests that they previously obtained with their own and corporate funds . 
With the help of these Pioneers and Rangers , President Bush is on track to collect $ 200 million . 
To counter the fundraising advantage obtained by this strategy , I have contributed to independent organizations that by law are forbidden to coordinate their activities with the political parties or candidates . 
That law minimizes or eliminates the ability to purchase influence in exchange for my contribution . 
Moreover , I don &apos;t seek such influence . 
My contributions are made in what I believe to be the common interest . 
ACT is working to register voters , and MoveOn is getting more people engaged in the national debate over Bush &apos;s policies . 
I recognize that the system is imperfect , and I wish there were a different way to level the playing field . 
Making contributions to ACT and the MoveOn.org Voter Fund is the best approach I have found . 
I have been an advocate of campaign finance reform for almost a decade , including the legal defense of the current legislation . 
I recognize that every new regulation has unintended adverse consequences , but this does not mean reform should be abandoned . 
Clearly , the rules need to be updated in the light of the 2004 experience . 
Some good proposals have already surfaced , including one from the major sponsors of the current campaign finance legislation . 
This bill should be supported . 
Among other measures , it calls for an increase in the federal match for small contributions and would raise the spending limit for candidates who accept public funding to $ 75 million  -  changes that would reduce the bias toward big-money donors . 
Free airtime for candidates is also important . 
This would reduce the cost of campaigns and the distorting effect of commercials . 
Full disclosure and transparency are clearly beneficial . 
It is important that people know where financial support is coming from . 
I have been open about my contributions , and I welcome the debate they have sparked . 
In the meantime , as the debate continues , my contributions help to ensure that the money spent by those trying to reelect President Bush doesn &apos;t overwhelm the process .
