The Indispensable UN 
The United Nations &quot; sixtieth anniversary summit in September reflected its strengths and importance in the many areas in which the international community must work together . 
Unfortunately , the summit also exposed the UN &apos;s weaknesses and limitations . 
Founded at the end of World War II to prevent another major disaster of that kind , the UN has now vastly expanded its mandate beyond peacekeeping , as important as that is . For instance , the Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) , adopted at the UN Millennium summit five years ago , proclaimed the international community &apos;s resolve to reduce poverty in all of its manifestations and set concrete goals to be achieved by 2015 . 
Reaching political consensus on such complex issues is never easy , given the diversity of interests that must be addressed . 
Success requires diplomacy and patience , and the UN &apos;s latest summit continued the march forward in the creation of a community of nations responsible for the well being of all . 
To be sure , the attempt by America &apos;s new UN ambassador , John Bolton , to introduce hundreds of last-minute changes to the summit &apos;s concluding declaration doomed the agreement - perhaps deliberately - to being less comprehensive and forceful than had been hoped . 
Indeed , Bolton even wanted to eliminate any reference to the MDG . 
Nevertheless , even the United States had to give way in the end to this moral imperative . 
The summit &apos;s declaration also enunciated , in refined diplomatic language , new rights and obligations concerning international intervention in a country &apos;s internal matters , as in Darfur . 
We are , it seems , at last becoming a world in which each of us is our brother &apos;s keeper . 
Some have suggested that the Iraq war proved the UN &apos;s irrelevance . 
On the contrary , I believe that the Iraq debacle underscores the value of the UN , and the need to strengthen it further . 
Let &apos;s not forget that , within the limits of its powers , the UN worked . 
It was asked to judge whether there was an imminent threat to world peace requiring pre-emptive military action . 
After reviewing the evidence , it concluded that the case for going to war had not been made , while the risk of turmoil - about which most experts in the region warned - almost certainly weighed on the deliberations . 
Since then , evidence has mounted not only that there were no weapons of mass destruction , but that the American and British governments provided deceptive , distorted , and misleading information . 
Similarly , the evidence is overwhelming that there was little if any link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda - at least before the war . 
In other words , deliberative democracy ­ ­ - perhaps our most important safeguard against headstrong and reckless action - worked at the UN , but not in the US . 
Unfortunately , the UN could not prevent the US and other countries from taking actions that almost surely contravene international law . 
The story since then is well known . 
When weapons of mass destruction were not found , the US and its small ( and dwindling ) &quot; coalition of the willing &quot; conjured up a new rationale - the struggle for democracy . 
But if that were the objective , clearly a long list of countries should have been drawn up , and it is hardly certain that Iraq would have come out on top . 
Replacing repressive dictatorships would , in fact , represent a vast expansion of the UN &apos;s mandate , one that I suspect the US would not support . 
More to the point , it did not bode well for a supposedly democratizing project to reject democratic processes at the UN . 
The US had made it clear that it would abide by only one outcome at the UN - a principle under which no democratic body can operate , for to insist that a decision must accord with the wishes of one member is dictatorship . Subsequent events have shown how difficult it is - even for the strongest country in the world - to impose a stable democratic regime . 
Iraq thus showed both the strength and the limitations of the UN . 
Inevitably , its major source of strength is moral suasion . 
Even most Americans were reluctant to enter Iraq without the UN &apos;s blessing . 
The democratic deliberative process worked , and it yielded the right answer . 
This should enhance confidence in the UN . 
But the UN needs to be strengthened , by , for example , funding a permanent peacekeeping force . 
Too often , UN peacekeeping missions require passing the hat among the advanced industrial countries , giving them virtual veto power over when , where , and how the UN acts . 
At the same time , a strengthened economic and social security council would enable the UN to shape more effectively debates about reforming the global economic and financial system . 
Today , by contrast , such debates are too often centered at the IMF , where the financial interests of the advanced industrial countries predominate . 
These reforms will eventually come . 
Globalization has meant closer international integration , and that in turn has meant a greater need for collective action . 
The UN is the international institution created for that purpose , and as the world changes , the UN must change with it . 
But meaningful reform will almost surely have to await an American administration that is committed to global democracy in deed as well as rhetoric .
