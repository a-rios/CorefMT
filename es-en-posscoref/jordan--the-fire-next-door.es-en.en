Jordan : The Fire Next Door 
Jordanians are facing sleepless nights as the siege of Baghdad proceeds . 
The images coming to us from next door are horrifying , and Jordanians have taken to the street in protest . 
Yet while contemplating the collapse of Saddam &apos;s regime , Jordanians are also now recognizing how closely our own society is tied to Iraq &apos;s , and how difficult it will be for Jordan to set out on a new course if the Americans end the rule of Saddam Hussein . 
At the economic level , Jordan &apos;s ties with Iraq are very close . 
Nearly all of our oil comes from Iraq at highly subsidized rates . 
Replacing this oil at market prices could cost more than $ 600 million a year . 
Former Minister of Trade and Industry Mohammad al-Samadi estimates that Iraqis buy more than $ 500 million of Jordanian goods annually . 
Our trucking industry - 5000 mostly family-owned trucks - is largely dependent on this trade . 
How much of it will be lost , particularly if a new regime in Baghdad punishes Jordan for its close ties with the Iraqi government , is a worrying question . 
Fahed al-Fanek , a leading Jordanian economist , estimates that the war could cost Jordan as much as 25 % of its GDP , about $ 2 billion . 
Such losses could be devastating . 
Increased debt and budget deficits are one likely result , putting at risk the accomplishments of more than a decade of effort to reform the economy . 
Already , we are expecting the tough conditions of the IMF &apos;s reform program to be extended from five years to six . 
But economic closeness is merely the tip of the Iraqi-Jordanian relationship . 
Through business dealings , the Iraqi regime insinuated itself into the Jordanian elite , coloring our own political culture . 
Many prominent Jordanians believe that our reliance on Iraqi markets and oil ought to be the basis of a priority alliance . 
Indeed , the complicated networks of commercial relationships help shape the views of political groups , the media , bankers and contractors . 
Not only are Jordanians largely silent about the practices of the Iraqi regime , but also they are sceptical about efforts to bring reform or greater openness to Jordan . 
Maintaining the status quo is their priority , despite the international cost to Jordan &apos;s reputation or the consequences for the Iraqi people . 
They cast any criticism of Saddam as a willingness to accept American aggression . 
For example , a recent Jordanian decision to freeze all Iraqi government funds held in Jordanian banks produced accusations by the Jordanian opposition that Jordan had stabbed Iraq in the back . 
Likewise , there was criticism of the government &apos;s recent decision to expel three Iraqi diplomats for activities threatening Jordan &apos;s security . 
Within Jordan , however , there is another perspective on the future , one that welcomes reduced dependence on Iraq . 
Former Foreign Minister Abdullah al-Khatib argues that Jordan should have begun distancing itself from Iraq years ago . 
Rejecting the idea of a holy alliance between the two countries , al-Khatib said , &quot; This relationship was not a strategic alliance between the two countries , but a relationship of mutual interests and benefits . &quot; 
While Jordan &apos;s access to discounted Iraqi oil was clear for all to see , the benefits to Iraq have not been as visible . 
Observers interpret al-Khatib &apos;s comments as a reference to the passage of vast amounts of luxury goods through Jordan into Iraq , one of the means by which Saddam has been able to reward his followers . 
Others note the presence of numerous Iraqi businesses in Jordan , conducting activities whose purposes have not always been clear . 
Although Jordan is at a turning point in its relations with Iraq , there remains little public support for American policy . 
More than 80 % of Jordanians oppose the war . 
Speculation about America &apos;s motives , with press commentators highlighting the role of the Christian right-wing in formulating American policy , is increasing . 
Links between US Christians and American support for the expansionist Sharon government in Israel are heard frequently . 
Within the Arab world , moderate and liberal groups are losing ground to radical Islamic movements . 
Confronting the West , particularly the US , has become the common theme of opposition to the war . 
Advocates of more democracy in the Arab world now risk being accused of cooperation with the American design for re-making the Middle East . 
The only way to begin to turn this tide is for the US to reverse its primarily unilateral approach to the region &apos;s problems . 
To many Arabs across the region , American reliance on overwhelming military force to achieve its stated goal of spreading democracy is an inherent contradiction . 
A critical test awaits in how the US handles post-war Iraq . 
If it chooses to take the predominant role in transforming the Iraqi government , instead of relying on the UN , Arab doubts will grow . 
A second test lies in American handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
The US now has an opportunity to address the Palestinians &apos; need to be free from military occupation . 
If America misses these opportunities and continues on its current course , it risks exacerbating the issues and conflicts in the region and destabilizing friends like Jordan .
