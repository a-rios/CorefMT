The Bonus Risk 
CHICAGO - In its July session , the European parliament approved some of the strictest rules in the world on the bonuses paid to bankers . 
The aim is to curb risk-taking by financial institutions . 
The new rules require that no more than 30 % of bankers &quot; bonuses be paid in cash , that between 40 % and 60 % be deferred for at least three years , and that at least 50 % be invested in &quot; contingent capital , &quot; a new form of debt that converts to equity when a financial company is in distress . 
The most innovative aspect of these new rules is that the limits do not apply only to financial institutions &quot; chief executive officers , but to all the top managers ( though the definition of top managers is delegated to national parliaments ) . 
The alleged justification for this major interference in private contracting is the systemic effect that these bonuses can have . 
High pay in the banking sector , so the argument goes , rewards success but does not penalize failure . 
Managers can easily move from firm to firm when things go badly , avoiding any punishment . 
This system rewards managers for taking risks , even when the risk is excessive . 
This distortion is perceived to be one of the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis . 
The problem with this argument is that there is no evidence supporting the first crucial link in its logic . 
Much research has tried to establish a connection between bankers &quot; compensation schemes and risk-taking , but has failed to find one . 
At most , such research has found that more highly paid executives took greater risks , but it is unclear whether this is a cause or an effect . 
Executives in highly leveraged institutions should be paid more , because they bear more risk . 
To be sure , these investigations are limited to the top five executives , for which data is publicly available . 
Unfortunately , there is no publicly available data to establish a causal relationship between bonuses &quot; pay-for-performance sensitivity and risk-taking for lower-level managers . 
In this respect , the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ( FCIC ) , established by the United States government , has a unique opportunity . 
Thanks to its subpoena powers , the FCIC can collect and analyze such data . 
It is to be hoped that when its report is published in December , we will be able to answer this question . 
If we assume that a causal relationship exists , the European directive seems to be fairly well designed , with one main shortcoming . 
It is well designed because it interferes not with the level of compensation ( as many have demanded ) , but with the form that this compensation takes . 
It requires that most of an annual bonus not only be deferred for three years , but also that it be put at risk . 
If the company performs poorly in the three years , the manager will lose part or all of his or her accumulated bonus . 
The main shortcoming is that these restrictions can be circumvented easily , since they apply only to bonuses , whereas banks maintain discretion over the mix between salary and bonus . 
Currently , bank managers receive their bonuses at the beginning of each year , with the level based on their individual performance during the previous year . 
It would be very easy to transform last year &apos;s bonus , based on last year &apos;s performance , into this year &apos;s salary . 
The salary , which can be paid entirely in cash , will be renegotiated every year , thereby skirting all the regulatory restrictions . 
Without direct government intervention , it would be difficult to fix the problem . 
In large financial institutions , however , the incentive to gamble at taxpayers &quot; expense does not apply only to managers ; it extends to bondholders , who are de facto protected by the government . 
Having access to insured credit , banks &quot; shareholders find it irresistible to borrow excessively . 
Restricting managers &quot; incentive pay without changing shareholders &quot; incentives will only force shareholders to be more actively involved in the company and choose other ways to increase the level of risk-taking . 
If the problem is the moral hazard implied by being too big to fail , the solution is not to restrict pay , but to eliminate the hazard by forcing shareholders to issue more equity or lose their stock when banks &quot; debt starts to become risky . 
As Oliver Hart and I explained in a recent paper , this can be done easily , with a regulator intervening every time the credit-default swaps on the financial institutions &quot; debt becomes too high . 
If we want to intervene on pay in addition to ( not instead of ) reforming capital requirements , the most effective way is a variation of the tax imposed by former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown : a special tax on all compensation above a certain threshold that is not paid in stock . 
This tax would have two positive effects : it would induce banks to recapitalize , thereby reducing their excessive leverage , while forcing managers to have more skin in the game . 
If the solution is so simple , why has no elected body implemented it ? 
My fear is that politicians want to be perceived as tough on bankers , but have no interest in really fixing the problem .
