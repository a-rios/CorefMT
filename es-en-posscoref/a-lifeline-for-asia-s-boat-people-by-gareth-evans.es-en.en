A Lifeline for Asia &apos;s Boat People 
CANBERRA - Sometimes countries arrive at good policy only after exhausting all available alternatives . 
So it has been with Australia &apos;s belated embrace this month , after years of political wrangling , of a new &quot; hard-headed but not hard-hearted &quot; approach to handling seaborne asylum seekers . 
The core of the problem - and what has made it an international issue rather than just a domestic Australian problem - is that the would-be refugees ( mainly from Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq , Iran , and Sri Lanka ) have been dying in harrowing numbers . 
In the last three years alone , more than 600 men , women , and children have drowned - and these are just the documented cases - while attempting the long and hazardous journey to Australian shores in often-ramshackle boats run by smugglers operating from Southeast Asia . 
The overall number of unauthorized sea arrivals - more than 7,000 a year - remains small relative to other target destinations ; the annual figure for such arrivals in Europe from North Africa is close to 60,000 . 
But the moral , legal , and diplomatic issues that arise in confronting Australia &apos;s irregular migration problem are as complex - and the domestic politics as toxic - as anywhere else . 
So how Australia &apos;s government handles these challenges is being closely watched . Face-off : Read former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser &apos;s counterargument , &quot; Australia &apos;s Abdication on the High Seas . &quot; 
Internationally , Australia long had a well-earned reputation for decency on refugee issues . 
It accepted 135,000 Vietnamese refugees in the 1970 &quot; s - a much higher total on a per capita basis than any other country , including the US - and ever since has maintained its status as one of the top two or three recipient countries for resettlement generally . 
But huge damage was done in 2001 , when then-Prime Minister John Howard &apos;s government refused to allow the Norwegian freighter MV Tampa , carrying 438 rescued Afghans from a distressed fishing vessel , to enter Australian waters . 
As a former foreign minister , based at the time in Europe , I never felt more ashamed of my country . 
Unfortunately , hard hearts proved to make for good domestic politics . 
&quot; Turning back the boats , &quot; the &quot; Pacific solution &quot; of offshore processing in neighboring Nauru and Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) , and draconian conditions for those who are allowed to stay pending status determination were - and are - popular positions for Australia &apos;s conservative parties to take . 
By contrast , the Labor Party &apos;s reversal of these policies after 2007 , for the best of humanitarian reasons , was seen as offering softheaded encouragement to &quot; queue jumpers . &quot; 
This perceived weakness is a key explanation for why former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ( much admired by G-20 and other world leaders ) was overthrown by his Labor Party colleagues , and why his successor , Julia Gillard ( whose government is much admired for its economic management ) , remains deeply unpopular . 
With a flood of recent boat arrivals , fear of more drownings , and national politics becoming even more of a blood sport than usual , Australia &apos;s government finally found a circuit-breaker : a report by a panel of experts comprising a former defense chief , a foreign affairs department head , and a refugee advocate . 
The panel recommended a new , fully integrated policy package aimed at reducing both &quot; push &quot; and &quot; pull &quot; factors driving refugee flows , and its report enabled government and opposition to find some common ground at last . 
Incentives to make regular migration pathways work better will include immediately increasing Australia &apos;s annual humanitarian intake , and doubling it over five years ( to 27,000 ) , while also doubling financial support for regional immigration capacity-building . 
At the same time , asylum seekers will be specifically deterred from making dangerous sea voyages by getting no advantage from doing so : they will , at least pending the negotiation of better Southeast Asian regional arrangements , be sent to Nauru or PNG to wait their turn there . 
That means putting flesh on the bones of the Bali Process cooperation framework , which was agreed in 2011 by ministers representing all of the relevant source , transit , and target countries in the region and beyond , including - crucially - Indonesia and Malaysia ( the key transit countries en route to Australia ) . 
Whether parties to the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or not , these states agreed to work with each other and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on all of the key issues . 
They will seek to eliminate people smuggling ; give asylum seekers access to consistent assessment processes and arrangements ( which might include regional processing centers ) ; find durable settlement solutions for those granted refugee status ; and provide properly for the return to their home countries of those found not to need protection . 
Professional skeptics in Australia have argued that it is inconceivable that any of our Southeast Asian neighbors , including Indonesia and Malaysia , would stir themselves to help solve Australia &apos;s refugee problem , even with Australia &apos;s government covering most of the costs . 
The skeptics also ignore the reality that no government will want to put its international reputation at risk - as Australia did with the Tampa affair - by being indifferent to the horrifying toll of deaths at sea .
