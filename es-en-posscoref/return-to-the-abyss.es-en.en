Return to the Abyss 
NEW YORK - One interpretation of financial crises is that they are , in Nassim Taleb &apos;s phrase , &quot; black swan &quot; events - unplanned and unpredictable occurrences that change the course of history . 
But , in my new book on financial crises , Crisis Economics - which covers not only the recent crisis , but also dozens of others throughout history and across both advanced economies and emerging markets - I show that financial crises are , instead , predictable &quot; white swan &quot; events . 
What is happening now - the second stage of the global financial crisis - was no less predictable . 
Crises are the inevitable result of a build-up of macroeconomic , financial , and policy risks and vulnerabilities : assets bubbles , excessive risk-taking and leverage , credit booms , loose money , lack of proper supervision and regulation of the financial system , greed , and risky investments by banks and other financial institutions . 
History also suggests that financial crises tend to morph over time . 
Crises like those we have recently endured were initially driven by excessive debt and leverage among private-sector agents - households , banks and financial institutions , corporate firms . 
While such fiscal stimulus and bailouts may have been necessary to prevent the Great Recession from turning into Great Depression II , piling public debt on top of private debt carries a high cost . 
Eventually those large deficits and debts need to be reduced through higher taxes and lower spending , and such austerity - necessary to avoid a fiscal crisis - tends to slow economic recovery in the short run . 
If fiscal imbalances are not addressed through spending cuts and revenue increases , only two options remain : inflation for countries that borrow in their own currency and can monetize their deficits ; or default for countries that borrow in a foreign currency or can &apos;t print their own . 
Thus , the recent events in Greece , Portugal , Ireland , Italy , and Spain are but the second stage of the recent global financial crisis . 
The socialization of private losses and fiscal laxity aimed at stimulating economies in a slump have led to a dangerous build-up of public budget deficits and debt . 
So the recent global financial crisis is not over ; it has , instead , reached a new and more dangerous stage . 
Indeed , a practical definition of a financial crisis is an event that forces policy officials to spend a long weekend trying desperately to announce a new bailout package in order to avoid national and global panic before the markets open on Monday . 
In the past years , such weekend all-nighters dealt with the needed bailouts of private firms - Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers , AIG , bank rescues , etc . 
And , of course , such weekend dramas are still with us , as EU and eurozone policymakers recently spent a desperate weekend developing a rescue package not only for Greece , but also for other weak eurozone members . 
The progression is clear : first came rescue of private firms , and now comes the rescue of the rescuers - i.e. , governments . 
The scale of these bailouts is mushrooming . 
During the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 , South Korea - a relatively large emerging-market economy - received what was then considered a very large IMF rescue package - $ 10 billion . 
But , after the rescues of Bear Sterns ( $ 40 billion ) , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( $ 200 billion ) , AIG ( up to $ 250 billion ) , the Troubled Asset Relief Program for banks ( $ 700 billion ) , we now have the mother of all bailouts : the $ 1 trillion European Union-International Monetary Fund rescue of troubled eurozone members . 
A billion dollars used to be a lot of money ; now one trillion is the &quot; new normal &quot; or - to paraphrase the novel and film The Devil Wears Prada - a trillion is the new ten billion ! 
Governments that bailed out private firms now are in need of bailouts themselves . 
Who will then bail out governments that bailed out private banks and financial institutions ? 
Our global debt mechanics are looking increasingly like a Ponzi scheme . 
While the right medicine needed to avoid fiscal train wrecks is well known , the main constraint to fiscal consolidation and discipline is that weak governments around the world lack the political power and willingness to implement austerity . 
Political gridlock in Washington and in the United States Congress demonstrates the absence of the bipartisanship needed to address America &apos;s fiscal issues . 
In the United Kingdom , a &quot; hung &quot; parliament has resulted in a coalition government that will have a hard time implementing fiscal discipline . 
In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel lost a key state election after the rescue of Greece , and Japan has a weak and ineffectual government that seems in denial of the scale of the problem that it faces . 
In Greece itself , there are riots in the streets and strikes in the factories ; in the rest of the PIIGS ( Portugal , Ireland , Italy , and Spain ) , fiscal discipline will be politically and socially painful . 
So political constraints may prevent fiscal austerity and structural reforms from being implemented . 
As a result , &quot; crisis economics &quot; is likely to be with us for a long time . 
Indeed , the recent financial crisis is not over , and , worse , the medicine used to treat may have been partly toxic . 
It seems to have made the patient weaker and more addicted to dangerous drugs , as well as more susceptible to new strains of the virus that may , in some cases , eventually prove fatal .
