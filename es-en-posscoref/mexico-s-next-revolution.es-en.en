Mexico &apos;s Next Revolution 
While it might take days or even weeks before Mexico &apos;s cliff-hanger presidential election is officially settled , it seems almost certain that right-of-center , liberal candidate Felipe Calderón will be the country &apos;s next president . 
He may not have won by more than a percentage point and his 36 % of the vote is hardly a mandate . 
His opponents will challenge the results in the streets , the courts and the political arena , and he will face a strong , though divided , opposition in Congress . 
Still , winning is better than losing , and Mexico is better off today than it was yesterday , when many thought the left-of-center populist contender , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , would receive a thumping endorsement from the electorate . 
Calderón means continuity ; that &apos;s probably why he won , and that is what Mexico needs . 
In the end , Mexico &apos;s voters did not fall for López Obrador &apos;s stratagem . 
His case was simple : Mexico is a basket case today , let &apos;s throw out the rascals responsible for it and replace them with leaders who will represent and help the poor - still half of Mexico &apos;s population . 
Regardless of the fact that this description is largely , though not entirely , inaccurate , the voters decided that the last people they wanted to fix the mess were ... those who created it in the first place . 
López Obrador surrounded himself with former high-level officials of the Echeverría ( 1970-1976 ) , López Portillo ( 1976-1982 ) , De la Madrid ( 1982-1988 ) , and Salinas de Gortari administrations . 
It simply didn &apos;t fly with the electorate . 
Conversely , Calderón &apos;s argument did . 
He basically argued that over the past ten years , Mexico , while hardly a paradise , was on something of a roll : inflation came under control , growth began to pick up , poverty was being reduced , and lower interest rates made credit available to the lower middle class . 
And all of this came about without repression , human rights violations , uprisings , political assassinations , or runaway corruption . 
According to exit polls , 60 % of Mexico &apos;s voters who thought that things had improved over the past year voted for Calderón ; 60 % of those who approve of President Vicente Fox ( who in turn has a 65 % approval rate ) , chose Calderón as well . 
Calderón ran on Fox &apos;s coat-tails , but without any Fox entourage , and he won ... big-time . 
Nonetheless the challenges he faces are enormous . 
Mexico today is victim of a gaping ideological divide that most other countries in Latin America have put behind them . 
The election was not over policies , simplistic or not , such as war or peace , lower or higher taxes , more or less public spending , how to combat poverty or create jobs , to permit or prohibit capital punishment , abortion , gay marriage , or whatever . 
The campaign was over Mexico &apos;s soul , over the highly abstract , partly imaginary , broad ideological themes of nationalism , separation of church and state , the market versus the state , law enforcement versus eradicating privilege and poverty , belonging to Latin America or to North America , poor versus rich . 
Viewed from afar , such campaign themes might not have been a bad thing : after all , countries need these types of discussion every now and then . 
But in fact , the discussion was largely meaningless , because the policies that theoretically would have sprung from the electorate favoring one world-view or the other were either unviable or already in place . 
Calderón cannot hand education over to the Church , privatize Pemex ( the state owned oil company ) or abolish social anti-poverty programs , as his adversaries falsely claimed he would do . 
And López Obrador would not have been able to move Mexico away from the United States , revise NAFTA , massively and overnight re-orient public spending , eliminate poverty , and create millions of jobs through unfunded infrastructure programs , as he said , and truly seemed to believe , he would do . 
As in most cases , Byzantine ideological debates such as these lead nowhere , but they do crowd out meaningful policy discussions . 
Since debates over those policies did not take place , they will have to begin now , and inevitably they will further polarize a society that is already deeply divided . 
Calderón will not only be plagued by this artificial ideological divide ; he will also have to confront the same paralysis that Fox and his predecessor , Ernesto Zedillo , have encountered since 1997 . 
Mexico &apos;s current institutions were designed and built for an authoritarian rule , not for democracy , and they worked while Mexico was governed by a single party , the PRI . 
When democracy came , everyone - Zedillo , Fox , this writer , and many more - thought that the same institutions would remain functional , despite a radically different context . 
We were all wrong , and the new president must face the same challenge : not how to govern with these dysfunctional institutions , but how to replace them with something that works . 
This is the single most important challenge facing Calderón ; designing and building new institutions should be his first priority . 
Achieving , at long last , re-election of parliamentary representatives ; calling a referendum to amend the Constitution ; creating a hybrid , semi-presidential , semi-parliamentary system that will encourage the formation of legislative majorities in a three-party environment ; allowing independent candidates to run for office , thus forcing party realignment ; and abolishing the US-style campaign-financing , where air time is purchased instead of allotted , and which led to Sunday &apos;s election probably being , dollar for vote , the most expensive in the world . 
These are the most important and urgent reforms . 
With these reforms , Mexico can finally begin to harvest the fruits of ten years of stability and continuity  -  not a mean feat for a country which had previously had major crises in every decade since the 1960s . 
With the reforms , the urgently needed substantive decisions that will directly affect the lives of the Mexicans  -  energy , tax , and labor reform , the improvement of education , and poverty reduction  -  can be made . 
Without the reforms , the country will continue to plod along and , no matter how intensely people may feel about it , real change will remain impossible .
