Breivik &apos;s Call to Arms 
NEW YORK - Let us assume , for the sake of argument , that Geert Wilders , the Dutch politician who is convinced that Europe is &quot; in the final stages of Islamization , &quot; is right : Anders Breivik , the Norwegian mass murderer , is mad . 
Wilders tweeted : &quot; That a psychopath has abused the battle against Islamization is disgusting and a slap in the face of the worldwide anti-Islam movement . &quot; 
This assumption is not so far-fetched . 
Murdering more than 60 innocent young people at a summer camp with an assault rifle , after bombing a chunk of central Oslo , is , to put it mildly , morally eccentric - something most sane people would never dream of doing . 
The same is true , naturally , of a group of young men who decide to commit suicide and mass murder by flying commercial airliners into large public buildings in New York and Washington . 
Islamists view their acts of random mass murder not as a personal publicity stunt , but as a tactic in a holy war against the decadent , sinful West . 
Breivik is , in his own mind , a warrior for the other side . 
His aim was to protect the West from Islamization . 
His enemies are not just Muslims , but the liberal Western elites , and their children , who were destroying Europe from within through &quot; multiculturalism &quot; and &quot; cultural Marxism . &quot; 
In fact , what Breivik wrote in his rambling manifesto , entitled A European Declaration of Independence , is more or less what populists , such as Geert Wilders , have been saying . 
Of course , there was much else in the manifesto - fantasies about reviving the medieval Knights Templar , for example - that suggests a more bizarre disposition , and Wilders was quick to distance himself from Breivik &apos;s violent methods . 
Indeed , only one right-wing European politician , Francesco Speroni of the Italian Northern League , which is part of Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s government , was prepared to defend Breivik . 
Speroni claimed that Breivik &apos;s &quot; ideas are in defense of western civilization . &quot; 
So , how seriously must we take the ideological reasons that killers like Breivik and the September 11 terrorists invoke to justify their murders ? 
A few years ago , the German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger wrote a fascinating essay about the &quot; radical loser . &quot; 
Radical losers are mostly young men who are so enraged by their own lack of social , economic , and sexual self-esteem and the indifference of the world around them , that they long for a suicidal act of mass destruction . 
Anything can trigger such an act : rejection by a girl , being fired from a job , failing an examination . 
And sometimes the killers reach for ideological justifications : building pure Islam , struggling for communism or fascism , or saving the West . 
The particular ideals might be unimportant - simply those that happen to be available , owing to fashion or other historical circumstances . 
Once a radical loser is in the mood to kill , any reason will do . 
But does this mean that there is no link at all between the stated views of radical clerics or politicians and the acts committed in the name of those opinions ? 
For all the finger pointing at Wilders , just because Breivik professed to admire him , the acts of a deranged killer , others caution , should not be used to discredit what he stands for . 
After all , there is nothing irrational , or murderous , about claiming that multiculturalism is a flawed ideal , or that Islam conflicts with modern Western European views of gender equality or gay rights , or that mass immigration will cause serious social conflicts . 
These claims began to be made by respectable conservatives , and even some social democrats , in the 1990 &quot; s . 
They reacted against a rather smug liberal establishment that tended to dismiss all critical thought about immigration or non-Western faiths and traditions as racism and bigotry . 
But , while there was nothing intrinsically wrong with discussing the social consequences of large-scale immigration from Muslim countries , some populists in Holland , Denmark , France , Germany , Belgium , Britain , and other countries , went much further . 
Wilders , in particular , likes to speak in apocalyptic terms of &quot; the lights going out over Europe , &quot; and &quot; the sheer survival of the West . &quot; 
And the problem is not just a particular strain of violent revolutionary Islam , but Islam itself : &quot; If you want to compare Islam to anything , compare it to communism or national socialism - a totalitarian ideology . &quot; 
This is the language of existential war , the most dangerous kind . 
Indeed , the terminology of World War II is being deliberately revived . 
Those who oppose radical hostility to all forms of Islam are &quot; appeasers &quot; of , or &quot; collaborators &quot; with , &quot; Islamofascism . &quot; 
For some , September 11 , 2001 , was analogous to 1938 , or even 1940 . 
The very survival of Western civilization is at stake . 
Is it really so surprising that certain people might mistake this rhetoric for a call to arms ? 
To be sure , neither Geert Wilders , nor even rabidly anti-Islamic bloggers in the United States , such as Scott Spencer and Pamela Geller ( both of whom were quoted extensively in Breivik &apos;s manifesto ) , have called for physical violence . 
Indeed , Breivik &apos;s interpretation of their words is , in an odd way , more rational than the idea that a war for our very survival can be fought with words alone .
