Bush &apos;s Intellectual Torturers 
Paris - The top-secret memoranda released by the Obama administration concerning torture practices in CIA prisons shed new light on a fundamental question : how is it that people acting in the name of the United States government could so easily accept the idea of torturing the detainees in their charge ? 
The newly published documents do not disclose the very facts of torture , which were already well known by whomever wanted to know them . 
What is most striking is the discovery of niggling little rules , outlined in CIA manuals and co-opted by the government &apos;s legal executives . 
One would have thought that torture was the result of blunders or unintentional excesses committed on the spur of the moment . 
On the contrary , these memos make clear that torture was a tactic formulated in minute detail . 
In the Bush administration &apos;s &quot; guidelines , &quot; torture can be divided into three categories , of varying levels of intensity : &quot; baseline &quot; ( nudity , dietary manipulation , sleep deprivation ) ; &quot; corrective &quot; ( hitting ) ; and &quot; coercive &quot; ( water-dousing , box confinement , water-boarding ) . 
For a facial slap , the interrogator was supposed to hit with fingers slightly spread , at equal length between the tip of the chin and the bottom of the corresponding earlobe . 
Dousing a naked detainee with water was to last 20 minutes if the water &apos;s temperature measured 5 ° C , 40 minutes at 10 ° C , and up to 60 minutes at 15 ° C. Sleep deprivation could not exceed 180 hours , but could start over again after eight hours rest . 
Water immersion in a tub could last up to 12 seconds , no more than two hours a day , for up to thirty days in a row . 
Waterboarding could last 40 seconds at most , though two prisoners were subjected to this torment a combined total of 286 times in a single month . 
Confinement in a small box could not exceed two hours , but if the prisoner could stand in the box , it could continue up to eight hours at a time , 18 hours a day . 
If an insect was introduced into the box , rules governed that , too . 
How the torturers were trained is also disclosed . 
Most methods were reverse-engineered from the training given to US soldiers preparing to face &quot; long and extreme &quot; situations ( which somehow enabled executives to conclude that these ordeals are perfectly bearable ) . 
In other words , the torturers had been tortured themselves . 
The Bush lawyers were the torturers &quot; necessary partners , whose work was intended to ensure legal impunity . 
This was also a novelty : torture does not appear as a breach of a common standard , unfortunate but justifiable . 
Instead , it has a legal standard . 
Here , lawyers fell back on another series of techniques . 
In order to circumvent the law , interrogation had to be conducted outside the US , even if that place was an overseas American military base . 
The legal definition of torture implies the intentional infliction of severe suffering . 
Torturers are thus advised to deny such an intention . 
As a result , the goal of a facial slap is not to inflict physical pain , but to induce surprise and humiliation . 
The purpose of confinement in a box is not to disorient someone , but to give the detainee a feeling of discomfort . 
The torturer must always emphasize his &quot; good faith , &quot; &quot; honest beliefs , &quot; and the reasonable premise for them . 
So euphemisms were systematically used : &quot; enhanced techniques &quot; for torture , &quot; interrogation expert &quot; for torturer . 
Leaving material imprints is contra-indicated . 
To that end , mental damage is preferable to physical injury . 
Any video recordings of these sessions , not surprisingly , would be destroyed afterwards . 
Various professional groups were involved with torture practices . 
Thus , the contagion went well beyond the torturers &quot; limited circle . 
Besides the lawyers legitimating the deeds , psychologists , psychiatrists , doctors ( whose presence was mandatory at any session ) , and scholars also regularly provided moral , legal , or philosophical justifications . 
And , while males inflicted torture , degradation in the presence of women enhanced the humiliation . 
Who is to be held legally liable for this perversion of the law and basic moral principles ? The volunteer who carries out the task of torture is less liable than the high-ranking civil servant who justified and nurtured it . 
Friendly foreign governments , especially in Europe , can also be held responsible : although they knew about the torture , and took advantage of the information thus obtained , at no point have they expressed the slightest protest , or even signal their disapproval . 
Their silence was tantamount to consent . 
Should we therefore prosecute them ? 
The best democratic punishment for politicians is not to re-elect them . 
As for unelected collaborators and enablers , we can hope that they will be sanctioned by their peers : who would like to study with a professor who advocated torture ? 
Who wants justice done by a judge who authorized brutality ? 
Who wants to be treated by a doctor who oversaw it ? 
If we are to understand why some Americans accepted administering torture so easily , we need not look for some ancestral hatred or fear of Muslims and Arabs . 
No , the cause is far worse . 
The memos that the Obama administration has disclosed teach us that anyone who complies with seemingly noble principles dictated by a &quot; sense of duty &quot; or by the necessary &quot; defense of the homeland , &quot; or who is urged by a basic fear for his own life and welfare , or the lives and welfare of his kin , can become a torturer .
