India &apos;s Historical Hijacker 
NEW DELHI - As the political temperature heats up in India , with five state assembly elections this month and a general election due to be held by April , one might expect Indian leaders to be dueling over visions of the future . 
Instead , they have been engaged for weeks in an unseemly brawl about the past . 
The main opposition leader , Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , has moved aggressively to lay claim to the legacy of one of India &apos;s most respected founders , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel . 
As independent India &apos;s first deputy prime minister and home minister , Patel is credited with the integration of roughly 600 princely states , sometimes by persuasion and sometimes by force . 
A firm , tough , and effective administrator , Patel , who died in 1950 at the age of 75 , is revered as the &quot; Iron Man &quot; of India . 
In the normal course of events , Patel &apos;s illustrious life might have been left to the history books . 
When finished , it will be by far the world &apos;s largest statue , dwarfing New York City &apos;s Statue of Liberty and Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Christ the Redeemer . 
Modi &apos;s identification with Patel is an effort at character-building by association . 
His own image has been tarnished by his inaction ( or worse ) during the massacre of more than a thousand Gujarati Muslims in a pogrom on his watch in 2002 . 
Modi would rather be perceived as embodying Patel &apos;s decisiveness than as the destructive bigot his enemies decry . 
To hear Modi tell it , India would have been better off with Patel - who forged national unity , defended the country &apos;s Hindus during the horrors of Partition , and stood firm on issues like Kashmir - instead of the allegedly pussyfooting Jawaharlal Nehru , as its first prime minister . 
The implication is clear - a vote for Modi is a vote for a latter-day Patel . 
That message resonates with many Gujaratis , who are proud to be reminded of a nationally admired native son , and with much of India &apos;s urban middle class , whose members yearn for a strong leader to cut through the confusion and indecision of a sprawling country &apos;s messy democracy . 
But the ruling Congress Party is not about to relinquish one of its greatest leaders . 
Congress politicians have reacted with robust indignation to Modi &apos;s attempt to appropriate Patel &apos;s legacy . 
Both men were faced with a serious breakdown of law and order in their respective domains , involving violence and rioting against Muslims . 
In Delhi in 1947 , Patel immediately and effectively moved to protect Muslims , moving 10,000 in the most vulnerable areas to the security of Delhi &apos;s historic Red Fort . 
Because he feared that communal passions might have infected the local security forces , he moved army troops from Madras and Pune to Delhi to ensure calm . 
He attended prayers at the famous Nizamuddin Dargah to convey to Muslims that they and their faith were unquestionably part of India . 
He even went to the border town of Amritsar and pleaded with Hindu and Sikh mobs to stop victimizing Muslim refugees fleeing to the new Islamic state of Pakistan . 
In each case , Patel succeeded . 
Tens of thousands of people are alive today because of his interventions . 
The contrast with what happened in Gujarat in 2002 is painful . 
Whether or not Modi bears direct responsibility for the pogrom , he certainly cannot claim to have acted as Patel did . 
He took no direct and immediate action , as the state &apos;s chief executive , to protect Muslims . 
Nor did he publicly condemn the attacks , let alone visit a masjid or a Muslim neighborhood as a sign of reassurance . 
On the contrary , many believe that he provided protection and comfort to the rioters . 
There is a particular irony to a self-proclaimed &quot; Hindu nationalist &quot; like Modi , whose speeches reveal a thinly veiled contempt for Muslims , laying claim to the legacy of a Gandhian leader who would never have qualified his Indian nationalism with a religious label . 
Patel would have been outraged not only by Modi &apos;s conduct in office , but by the kind of remarks that Modi has repeatedly made against minorities . 
History has often been contested terrain in India . 
The Gujarat riots in 2002 were , after all , directly linked to the destruction in 1992 of the sixteenth-century Babri Mosque , which was allegedly built on the site of an ancient Hindu temple . 
Modi is of course well aware that the past retains a powerful hold over India &apos;s present . 
How Indian voters judge his attempt to reinvent himself as a latter-day Patel could have a major impact on the country &apos;s future .
