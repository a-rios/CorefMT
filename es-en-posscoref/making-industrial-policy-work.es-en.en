Making Industrial Policy Work 
GENEVA - Industrial policy ( IP ) is back - or rather , back in fashion . 
Of course , it never really went away , even in countries formally adhering to free-market principles . 
But the post-crisis world - in which government intervention in the economy has gained greater legitimacy - will see more of it . 
Likewise , China &apos;s success , and the temptation to bandwagon on its development model , has reinvigorated IP &apos;s appeal , as have better policy tools and greater experience of what works and what doesn &apos;t - a point well argued by Justin Lin of the World Bank . 
Indeed , a debate in The Economist last year , led by professors Josh Lerner and Dani Rodrik of Harvard University , ended with 72 % of voters expressing faith in the merits of IP . 
Policymakers seem to be of the same opinion , and not just in developing countries , judging by the EU &apos;s launch of its 2020 flagship last year and the United States &quot; green energy policy . 
But , for developing countries , the old dangers of IP continue to apply . 
First , policymakers often get it wrong , both when picking which industries to support and in implementing support mechanisms . 
Second , policymakers are prone to &quot; capture &quot; by vested interests , especially in relatively weak policy environments , leading to favoritism , inefficiency , and waste . 
Moreover , compared to IP &apos;s previous Golden Age , there are several new risks nowadays . 
The first concerns the temptation to follow China &apos;s lead unquestioningly . 
Policymakers must recognize that the Chinese model includes features peculiar to its gradual introduction of market mechanisms - which , compared to IP &apos;s new converts , represents a move in the opposite ideological direction . 
Indeed , China &apos;s growth rate has been boosted over the last two decades by the country &apos;s demographic and land-resource &quot; bonuses , &quot; which enabled it to maximize the benefits of globalization . 
Many other developing countries simply cannot emulate this success in all respects ; they must formulate plans specific to their own natural endowments , institutions , and business environments . 
The second risk stems from the globalized character of virtually every industry commonly considered a candidate for support . 
Whereas the original concept of IP involved shielding industries from international competition , today &apos;s world requires integrating local productive capacity in global value chains . 
That implies the need for policies based on exposing industries to international competition . 
The third risk is that industrial policies run afoul of international commitments and obligations . 
These include not only World Trade Organization rules , but also proliferating regional and bilateral trade and investment agreements - all of which have sharply reduced the scope for IP formulation by limiting options for protecting and supporting industries and businesses selectively . 
Despite these additional dangers , none of the major multilateral development institutions could easily argue today that developing countries should not formulate a development strategy that envisions sector-specific sources of economic growth , priorities for industrial development , and government support of such development with fiscal , financial , and regulatory measures . 
So , how should developing-country policymakers go about it ? 
Pick the right winners . 
Industrial policies must be based on a country &apos;s factor endowments , and should build on concrete opportunities to integrate industries and firms in global value chains - for example , by deepening existing linkages with international production networks and export markets - while avoiding overinvestment in international growth laggards . 
Moreover , policymakers should consider which industries deliver the biggest development bang for the buck : export-generating industries do not always have the greatest impact on employment and value added . 
Domestic industries , including services , which often account for more than half of value added even in developing economies , should not be neglected . 
Be prepared to let losers go . 
Even the most obvious choices for IP support , seemingly sure winners , will sometimes disappoint in today &apos;s uncertain economic environment . 
Governments should recognize mistakes and withdraw support before it becomes entrenched or too costly . 
Investment policies should extend to both domestic and foreign direct investment . 
In particular , this means nurturing international competitiveness by focusing on industry productivity , not just on support for domestic players . 
Similarly , technology policies should encompass both domestic development and technology transfer . 
And enterprise development policies should address linkages with multinational firms . 
In today &apos;s world , development objectives can realistically be met by supporting industrial growth , not only domestic industrial growth . 
Because international trade and investment regimes ensure access to foreign markets and investors , they are a prerequisite for industrial policy . 
Even so , developing-country policymakers can build some measure of freedom into new trade and investment agreements . 
At the same time , they should focus on those IP measures that run the least risk of clashing with international obligations : regulatory facilitation rather than restrictions , investment in infrastructure rather than in specific economic activities , and fiscal incentives that are accessible to all . 
Finally , policymakers in developing and developed countries alike must recognize that global economic governance discussions cannot focus exclusively on monetary and exchange-rate issues . 
As more countries embrace IP , competition and conflict is bound to intensify . 
Avoiding a global race to the bottom in regulatory standards , a race to the top in incentives , or a return to protectionism , will require better global coordination .
