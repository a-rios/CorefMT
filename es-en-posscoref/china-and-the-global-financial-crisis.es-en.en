China and the Global Financial Crisis 
GENEVA - Is China an island of stability in the midst of the gathering global financial storm , or will it , too , soon be sucked into the vortex ? 
Chinese officials have said that the crisis that began in the United States will not slow down long-planned reforms in China &apos;s financial markets . 
They insist that China will go ahead with plans to introduce margin trading , short selling , and futures contracts on share prices . 
But China slowed capital-account liberalization after the Asian financial crisis ten years ago , so it is possible that America &apos;s troubles could make China more cautious . 
China has played an important role in financing the US budget deficit in recent years , thanks to its effort to manage the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate against the dollar . 
China does not want its large current-account surplus to cause the currency to overshoot on the upside , and it may now want to slow the renminbi &apos;s appreciation because of concern about the global economic slowdown . 
If so , China would have to expand its foreign exchange reserves by another $ 300-400 billion , which would allow it to finance the large expansion in the US fiscal deficit . Recent slight declines in the value of the renminbi suggest that China &apos;s exchange rate policy may be changing following its 20 % appreciation of the currency since July 2005 . 
Germany &apos;s finance minister , Peer Steinbrück , has said that the crisis will reduce US financial hegemony and create a more multipolar world . 
The September 26 edition of The China Daily carried an article asking , &quot; Is the Sun Setting on US Economic Supremacy ? &quot; 
The article reviewed examples of how foreign investors have lost money in the US market and concluded , &quot; The outbreak of the latest crisis shows that the neo-conservative revolution launched in the 1980 &quot; s has already come to an end . &quot; 
The article attributed the crisis to policies that &quot; called on market forces to be given full play with the scrapping of government controls , especially on the financial market . &quot; 
Chinese officials have not yet echoed Steinbrück &apos;s comments , but the US experience will naturally make them more suspicious of Western investment bankers and US-style regulation . 
China has so far lost money on two of its major investments in Western financial firms ( Morgan Stanley and Blackstone ) . 
It could have helped to contain the current crisis if it had accepted invitations to invest in Lehman Brothers , but , given its previous losses on Wall Street , it declined . 
As a result of concern about the global economy , the People &apos;s Bank reduced interest rates two weeks ago and joined the coordinated global interest rate cut on October 8 - the first time that China ever participated in a global monetary policy move . 
The government also announced plans earlier this month to increase infrastructure spending by $ 586 billion during 2009 and 2010 . 
The projected spending increases are equal to 15 % of GDP , and are the largest that any country has undertaken so far in response to the financial crisis . 
They demonstrate clearly that China is prepared to compensate for export weakness by stimulating domestic demand . 
China must now take further action to bolster consumer spending , which slumped to only 36 % of GDP in 2007 , from over 50 % during the 1980 &quot; s , owing to the economy &apos;s heavy dependence on exports and capital spending since the late 1990 &quot; s . 
The Chinese government &apos;s goal will be to keep annual growth above 8 % in order to generate sufficient employment to maintain social stability . 
It is currently also more sensitive to employment risks than usual , because several thousand small factories in the textile and toy sectors have closed this year as a result of the impact of rising labor costs and the appreciating renminbi on profit margins . 
China wants to shift from low value-added , labor-intensive industries such as textiles to higher value-added sectors such as electronics and capital goods . 
China has the resources to cope with the current financial crisis . 
Foreign exchange reserves are an immense $ 1.9 trillion . 
Booming tax receipts have provided the government with a fiscal surplus . 
The critical issue has been policymakers &quot; willingness to act promptly , before there is clear evidence of an economic downturn . 
The government &apos;s stimulus package demonstrates that it is aware of the risks in the global economy and is prepared to act decisively . 
The current crisis marks an important step in China &apos;s evolution as a great economic power . 
China has been pursuing a policy of extreme Keynesianism at a time when Europe and the US are also undertaking massive interventions in their financial systems to prevent the current crisis from leading to a global financial collapse . 
Thus , there is a growing convergence between Chinese and G-7 economic policy , born of the need to compensate for massive failures in US financial regulation and monetary policy . 
The US has been lobbying China for some time for economic policy changes aimed at stimulating domestic demand and open markets . 
The irony is that , to compensate for a crisis that America &apos;s own policies have created in global financial markets , the US is now getting what it has long sought from China .
