The False Promise of Crisis-Resolution Funds 
ROME - Ever since financial markets began to stabilize late last year , the idea of making the financial sector pay for the costs incurred by taxpayers to keep it afloat has gained increasing support among policymakers and the wider public . 
France and the United Kingdom have introduced a temporary tax on financial-sector bonuses , and the United States government has proposed legislation envisaging a &quot; financial crisis responsibility fee &quot; to recover the costs of America &apos;s Troubled Asset Relief Program . 
There is also a discussion about how best to reform taxation of the financial sector , which is on average lighter relative to other corporate income and unduly favors borrowing over equity financing . 
But a lump-sum charge to recover past costs will not change the financial sector &apos;s incentives concerning excessive risk-taking . 
Furthermore , it is unclear what , precisely , the costs are that are to be recovered . 
While the direct fiscal costs of supporting the financial sector were 2.5-3 % of GDP in developed countries ( with peaks around 4.5 % ) , the total fiscal impact of the crisis is much larger , amounting to the total expected increase in public debt - an estimated 40 % of GDP . 
And even larger yet is the total cost suffered by the economy - including output and job losses , and the attendant destruction of material and immaterial capital , which , according to the Bank of England &apos;s Andrew Haldane and others , could rise to a multiple of annual GDP . 
More recently , the debate has changed tack : taxing the financial sector is now seen as a convenient way to set aside sufficient resources to pay for the next financial crisis . 
The idea of a tax on the financial sector has become closely associated with that of a crisis-resolution fund . 
This would pay for the residual costs of a large institution &apos;s failure after its capital has fallen to zero and , presumably , creditors &quot; claims have been wiped out ( though some proposals are ambiguous , leaving room for at least some relief for creditors ) . 
The IMF presented one such proposal to the leaders of the G-20 when they met in Washington in April . 
Other versions were recently put forth by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament and the European Commission . 
To me , these proposals seem poorly conceived , for two reasons . 
The first is obvious : any bailout fund for financial institutions creates an implicit promise of a bailout . 
Sooner or later , someone will call upon that promise . 
If the fund is public , it will encourage private beneficiaries to free ride on taxpayers . 
If it is privately financed , swindlers will be encouraged to free-ride on honest bankers . 
The only way to avoid this undesirable result is credibly to exclude all support for shareholders and creditors of a financial institution heading toward bankruptcy . 
They must realize that government will not ride to their rescue . 
Only in this manner will shareholders and creditors have a sufficiently strong incentive to monitor management and keep a tight lid on risk-taking by banks or other financial intermediaries . 
Once it is accepted that shareholders and creditors deserve no relief , the resolution fund simply becomes deposit insurance . 
Retail depositors are the only creditors in the financial system that deserve ample , if not full , protection against the mistakes of their bankers . 
After all , the main source of systemic instability in financial systems is excessive leverage - and the reckless lending that it enables - by deposit-taking institutions . 
Deposit-insurance fees are the appropriate instrument by which to make banks pay both for their intrinsic riskiness and the risks they impose on the rest of the system . 
Regulation then must ensure that bankers don &apos;t abuse their charter by taking excessive risks with their depositors &quot; money - which is precisely where regulators failed most notably in recent years , opening the way to the financial crisis . 
This brings me to the second , often less readily recognized , objection to a resolution fund : banking ( and quasi-banking ) losses were huge in the recent financial crisis because regulators closed their eyes to misdeeds in order to ensure bankers &quot; international competitiveness or , more simply , because they had been &quot; captured &quot; by them . 
If supervisors behave as they should , large residual losses from bank failures become unlikely . 
So , in order to keep residual losses small , supervisors must be obliged to undertake early corrective action when a bank &apos;s capital weakens , which is how the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation operates . 
If a bank cannot be recapitalized , it should be resolved and liquidated . 
This is where effective resolution procedures become important . 
But the key point is that no reckless exposure would be possible in a system where shareholders and creditors knew that they would not be bailed out , and supervisors were not allowed to gamble on resurrection of their supervised entities , but rather were obliged to call them to account as soon as they started misbehaving . 
In the effort to build a strong and coherent regulatory system for financial markets , the idea of a resolution fund is at best a distraction - and at worst a harbinger of further financial instability .
