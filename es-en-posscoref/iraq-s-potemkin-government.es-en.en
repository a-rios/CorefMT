Iraq &apos;s Potemkin Government 
With the votes in Iraq &apos;s election in December now counted , attempts to form a new government are set to move into high gear . 
Encouragingly , all sides appear to accept the results . 
In the short term , there are good reasons to believe that the most powerful among Iraq &apos;s three main groups will do so . 
The answer to that question is likely to be no , which is why Iraq probably will be a much less stable place a year from now . 
The new Iraqi government , when it is formed , will have at least the appearance of viability for the immediate future . Shia have an interest in supporting the central government because they believe that their demographic weight ( 60 % of Iraq &apos;s population ) means that representative democracy will guarantee them the right to rule and protect them from Sunni demands and attacks . Sunnis also will support the government , at least initially , because it represents their only opportunity to win what they consider their share of power , resources , and revenues . 
Kurds will accept the arrangement because they believe that the new constitution guarantees their right to control most of the oil wealth that lies beneath their territory , and because they don &apos;t want the blame should Baghdad descend into chaos . 
There is another reason Shia , Sunnis , and Kurds won &apos;t move immediately to undermine federal authority : the central government in Baghdad won &apos;t have the legal or economic means to challenge their local power . 
In essence , while all of Iraq &apos;s factions have a strong interest in promoting a central government that appears fully functional , that government &apos;s powers will in fact be limited . 
But , in the longer term , those limits on federal power will push Iraq toward a sectarian scramble for power and revenue . 
Article 11 of the new constitution declares that &quot; All that is not written in the exclusive powers of the federal authorities is in the authority of the regions . &quot; 
That formulation all but pits the central government and regions against one another in a battle for political supremacy . 
Similarly , under current law , soldiers will answer not to Baghdad but to regional powerbrokers , while the Iraqi constitution guarantees local governments the right to pocket the revenue that flows from new oil fields within their jurisdiction . 
In fact , although the central government has the authority to collect the revenues generated by existing fields , there is no law to prevent local officials from modernizing old sites and claiming that they are new . 
The impact of this state of affairs can hardly be overestimated . 
Oil accounts for about 98 % of Iraq &apos;s current export revenue . 
It is the lifeblood of Iraq &apos;s economy and the source of the money that the central government will need to build durable institutions . 
Although inflows of international financial assistance remain substantial , reconstruction money from abroad will begin to dry up as Iraq puts its central government in place . 
In sum , the national government will lack both the authority and the means to govern Iraq . 
Indeed , with Shiite-Sunni violence already intensifying , the Iraqi government may not be able to maintain even the appearance of effectiveness for very long . 
Moreover , the Kurds are the proverbial dog that hasn &apos;t yet barked . 
They enjoy relative economic prosperity , and their political institutions are growing more effective and efficient . 
Thus , for the moment , they have no reason to challenge the status quo . 
Gubernatorial elections this November will force Kurdish political contenders to offer opposing programs , and some candidates will seek electoral advantage via populist calls for independence . 
At the same time , cooler heads will struggle to postpone a potentially divisive 2007 referendum on the final status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk . 
In fact , the friction generated by electoral politics is likely to stoke resentments within Shia and Sunni communities as well . 
There is a great danger that the new Iraq &apos;s sectarian politics will benefit those who promise their constituents the most - at the expense of the central government and the country &apos;s other factions . 
Debates over possible constitutional amendments intended to pacify angry Sunnis and to de-fang the insurgency are likely to incite factional hostility as well . 
More worryingly , when Shia , Sunnis , and / or Kurds decide that their elected officials are not delivering the promised perks and protections , they are likely to look beyond politics to advance their individual interests . 
Some Shia may turn to militia leaders , Sunnis to insurgents , and Kurds to leaders demanding independence . 
At that point , the future of an independent Iraq itself will be called into question . 
Any separatist moves by Kurdish leaders would bring Turkey into Iraqi politics . 
At the same time , the protection that American forces offer Iraqi officials will diminish as troops are gradually withdrawn , and Iran will race to fill the security vacuum . 
In sum , the Iraqi government may appear effective for much of 2006 , but it will be committed to trying to serve the competing interests of sharply divided constituencies . 
The central government &apos;s weakness , continued insurgent violence , growing Iranian influence in Baghdad and with Shiite powerbrokers in the south , and the natural progression of sectarian politics suggest that the new Iraq will be markedly less stable as the year draws to a close .
