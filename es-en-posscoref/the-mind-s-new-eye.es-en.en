The Mind &apos;s New Eye 
CAMBRIDGE - Modern physics and cosmology suggest that basic truths about how nature operates , and how our universe arose , are visible only to those who can see events that occur faster than the time it takes for light to cross a proton , and whose vision can resolve sub-nuclear distances . 
Fortunately , that does not rule out humans , for we can augment the eyes we were born with . 
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) rises to the opportunity . 
By smashing protons together with unprecedented energy , monitoring the many particles that emerge from the collisions , and reconstructing the primary events that produced them , physicists will in effect have constructed the fastest , highest-resolution microscope ever , with each proton taking a snapshot of the other &apos;s interior . 
The LHC is a magnificent engineering project , whose many &quot; gee-whiz &quot; &quot; features have been widely reported . 
I will forego all that , and skip to the chase : what can we hope to see ? 
We will see what the universe was like when it was a thousandth of a second old , in the earliest moments of the Big Bang . 
The primary events at the LHC are in effect Little Bangs , tiny fireballs that reproduce Big Bang conditions , albeit over very small volumes . 
This re-creation of the early universe opens up an exciting possibility . 
We know that the universe today contains a form of matter , the so-called dark matter , that is different from anything we have ever observed . 
The dark matter is actually not dark in the usual sense , but utterly transparent . 
It neither emits nor absorbs light significantly , which is why astronomers failed to notice it for millennia , even though dark matter contributes five times as much to the total mass of the universe as normal matter . 
It was only in the late twentieth century that careful study of the motion of normal , visible matter revealed the gravitational influence of lots of otherwise invisible stuff . 
Because the original Big Bang produced dark matter , the LHC &apos;s Little Bangs might produce some more . 
There is a good chance , then , that we will learn what that ubiquitous , abundant , yet elusive substance is . 
Imagine a race of intelligent fish that start to think deeply about the world . 
For millennia , their ancestors took their watery environment for granted ; to them , it was &quot; emptiness &quot; as empty as they could conceive . 
But , after studying some mechanics and using their imaginations , the physicist-fish realize that they could deduce much simpler laws of motion by supposing that they are surrounded by a medium ( water ! ) that complicates the appearance of things . 
We are those fish . 
We have discovered that we can get a much simpler set of equations for fundamental physics by supposing that what we ordinarily perceive as empty space is actually a medium . 
We have observed the effects of the &quot; water &quot; that we use to simplify our equations - it slows down particles , and makes them heavy - but we do not know what it is made out of . 
The LHC will allow us to discern the microscopic structure of the universal medium . 
The simplest idea is that it is made out of one new kind of particle , the so-called &quot; Higgs particle , &quot; but I suspect that there is more to it . 
( One gets prettier equations with five new particles , and there might be even more . ) 
In the 1860 &quot; s , James Clerk Maxwell assembled the equations for electricity and magnetism , as they were then known , and discovered an inconsistency . 
He repaired the inconsistency by adding new terms to the equations . 
The augmented equations , today known as the Maxwell equations , described a unified theory of electricity and magnetism . 
The new equations showed that light is a moving , self-renewing disturbance in electrical and magnetic fields , and they predicted that new kinds of disturbances are possible . 
Today we call those disturbances radio waves , microwaves , infrared and ultraviolet radiation , x-rays , and gamma rays . 
We use them to communicate , cook , and diagnose and cure disease . 
The unified theory of electromagnetism has led to profound advances across all physical science , from atomic physics ( where lasers and masers are essential tools ) to cosmology ( where the microwave background radiation is our window on the Big Bang ) . 
Our current understanding of physics is powerful and accurate , as far as it goes , but it is not as beautiful and coherent as it should be . 
We have separate equations for four forces : strong , weak , electromagnetic , and gravitational . 
This jumble recalls the piecemeal equations of electricity and magnetism before Maxwell . 
Some of us have proposed expanded equations that unify the different forces . 
A couple of the predicted effects have already been observed ( for experts : tiny neutrino masses and unification of couplings ) . 
But , as Carl Sagan observed , &quot; extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence , &quot; while here the existing evidence is still circumstantial . 
Fortunately , these ideas for a new unification predict that extraordinary things will be seen at the LHC . 
If so , a whole new world of particles will be discovered : each currently known particle will have a heavier relative - its superpartner - with different , but predictable , properties . 
Such are my hopes and expectations for the LHC . 
Other speculations for what might be seen abound ; they include extra dimensions of space , strings instead of particles , and mini-black holes . 
Very likely , reality will outrun apprehension .
