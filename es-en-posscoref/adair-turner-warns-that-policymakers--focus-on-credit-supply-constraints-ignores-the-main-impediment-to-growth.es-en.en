The Great Credit Mistake 
LONDON - Before the financial crisis erupted in 2008 , private credit in most developed economies grew faster than GDP . 
Whether that fall reflected low demand for credit or constrained supply may seem like a technical issue . 
And the official answer is probably wrong . 
An impaired banking system , it is argued , starves businesses , particularly small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) , of the funds they need to expand . 
In September 2008 , US President George W. Bush wanted to &quot; free up banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses . &quot; 
The stress tests and recapitalizations of US banks in 2009 were subsequently hailed as crucial to the recovery of both the banking system and the economy . 
By contrast , the European Central Bank &apos;s inadequately tough stress tests in 2010 were widely panned for leaving eurozone banks too weak to provide adequate credit . 
In the United Kingdom , banks have been criticized for not lending the reserves created by quantitative easing to the real economy , leading the Bank of England to introduce its &quot; funding for lending &quot; scheme in 2012 . 
In the eurozone , it is hoped that this year &apos;s asset quality review ( AQR ) and stress tests will finally dispel concerns about bank solvency and free up credit supply . 
A &quot; credit crunch &quot; - particularly in trade finance - was certainly a key reason why the financial crisis generated a real economy recession . 
Taxpayer-funded bank rescues , higher bank capital requirements , and ultra-easy monetary policy have all been vital to overcome credit supply constraints . 
That argument is persuasively made by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi in House of Debt , an important new book that analyzes US data on a county-by-county basis . 
Mian and Sufi show that the recession was caused by a collapse of household consumption , and that consumption fell most in those counties where pre-crisis borrowing and post-crisis real-estate prices left households facing the largest relative losses in net wealth . 
It was in those US counties , too , that local businesses cut employment most aggressively . 
For SMEs , a shortage of customers , not a shortage of credit , constrained borrowing , employment , and output . 
And the customers were absent because the pre-crisis credit boom had left them over-leveraged . 
In the UK , many business surveys from 2009-2012 told the same story . 
Poor customer demand was ranked well ahead of credit availability as a constraint on growth . 
Economic growth can indeed continue to be severely depressed by a debt overhang even when credit supply is unrestricted and cheap . 
Many Japanese companies were left overleveraged by the boom and bust in credit and real estate in the 1980s and early 1990s . 
By the late 1990s , the Japanese banking system was offering companies loans at near-zero interest rates . 
Since 2011 , the ECB &apos;s analysis of weak eurozone growth has stressed the negative impact of an impaired and fragmented financial system , with high sovereign-bond yields and funding costs for banks resulting in prohibitive lending terms in the peripheral countries . 
Major progress in fixing these problems has already been achieved . 
The ECB &apos;s latest Monthly Bulletin documents this , citing multiple indicators of improved credit availability and pricing . 
Nonetheless , the rate of decline in private-sector loans has accelerated over the last year - from -0.6 % to -2 % - and low demand is acknowledged to be the main driver of depressed credit growth . 
Simultaneous private deleveraging and fiscal consolidation are restricting eurozone growth far more than remaining restrictions on credit supply . 
Despite the ECB &apos;s own evidence , however , the policy focus remains on fixing the credit-supply problem , through the AQR and stress tests , and through the ECB &apos;s own version of a funding for lending scheme , announced on June 5 . 
Fixing impaired banking systems after a crisis is both essential and achievable . 
Moreover , even when public rescue costs are inevitable , they are typically small change compared to the economic harm wrought by the financial crisis and post-crisis recession . 
By contrast , a large debt overhang may be intractable unless policy orthodoxies are challenged . 
Japan offset private deleveraging in the 1990s by running massive public deficits . 
The US has pulled out of recession faster than the eurozone , not only - or even primarily - because it fixed its banking system faster , but because it pursued more stimulative fiscal policies . 
But fiscal stimulus is constrained within the eurozone , where member countries no longer issue their own currency and &quot; sovereign &quot; debt therefore carries a default risk . 
Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy . 
To survive and thrive , the eurozone will need to become more centralized , with some common fiscal revenues , expenditures , and debts . 
Of course , this scenario implies immensely difficult political choices . 
If eurozone policy assumes that fixing the banks will fix the economy , the next ten years in Europe could look like the 1990s in Japan .
