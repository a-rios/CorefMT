After the Dollar 
NEW YORK - It is symbolic that the recent BRICS summit in Fortaleza , Brazil , took place exactly seven decades after the Bretton Woods Conference that created the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
The upshot of the BRICS meeting was the announcement of the New Development Bank , which will mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects , and a Contingent Reserve Arrangement to provide liquidity through currency swaps . 
The Bretton Woods Conference marked one of history &apos;s greatest examples of international economic cooperation . 
Rethinking the role of the US dollar in the international monetary system is a case in point . 
One key feature of the Bretton Woods system was that countries would tie their exchange rates to the US dollar . 
While the system was effectively eliminated in 1971 , the US dollar &apos;s central role in the international monetary system has remained intact - a reality that many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept . 
Dissatisfaction with the dollar &apos;s role as the dominant global reserve currency is not new . 
The issue is not merely one of fairness . 
According to the Belgian economist Robert Triffin , an international monetary system based on a national currency is inherently unstable , owing to the resulting tensions among the inevitably divergent interests of the issuing country and the international system as a whole . 
Triffin issued his warning more than 50 years ago , but it has recently gained traction , as China &apos;s rise has made the world increasingly disinclined to tolerate the instability caused by a dollar-denominated system . 
The solution , however , lies not in replacing the dollar with the renminbi , but in strengthening the role of the world &apos;s only truly global currency : the IMF &apos;s Special Drawing Rights . 
Following the creation of SDRs in 1969 , IMF members committed to make them &quot; the principle reserve asset in the international monetary system , &quot; as stated in the Articles of Agreement . 
But the peculiar way in which SDRs were adopted limited their usefulness . 
For starters , the separation of the IMF &apos;s SDR account from its general account made it impossible to use SDRs to finance IMF lending . 
Furthermore , though countries accrue interest on their holdings of SDRs , they have to pay interest on the allocations they receive . 
In other words , SDRs are both an asset and a liability , functioning like a guaranteed credit line for the holder - a sort of unconditional overdraft facility . 
Nonetheless , SDRs have proved to be useful . 
After initial allocations in 1970-1972 , more were issued to increase global liquidity during major international crises : in 1979-1981 , in 1997 , and , in particular , in 2009 , when the largest issue - the equivalent of $ 250 billion - was made . 
While developed countries , including the US and the United Kingdom , have drawn on their allocations , the major users have been developing and , in particular , low-income countries . 
In fact , this is the only way in which developing countries ( China aside ) share in the creation of international money . 
Several estimates indicate that , given the additional demand for reserves , the world could absorb annual allocations of $ 200-300 billion or even more . 
This has prompted many - including People &apos;s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan ; the United Nations-backed Stiglitz Commission ; the Palais-Royal Initiative , led by former IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus ; and the Triffin International Foundation - to call for changes to the international monetary system . 
In 1979 , the IMF economist Jacques Polak , who had been part of the Dutch delegation at the Bretton Woods conference , outlined a plan for doing just that . 
His recommendations include , first and foremost , making all of the IMF &apos;s operations in SDRs , which would require ending the separation of the IMF &apos;s SDR and general accounts . 
The simplest way to fulfill this vision would be to allocate SDRs as a full reserve asset , which countries could either use or deposit in their IMF accounts . 
The IMF would use those deposits to finance its lending operations , rather than having to rely on quota allocations or &quot; arrangements to borrow &quot; from members . 
Other provisions could be added . 
To address developing countries &quot; high currency demands , while enhancing their role in the creation of international money , a formula could be created to give them a larger share in SDR allocations than they now receive . 
The private use of SDRs could also be encouraged , though that would likely be met with strong opposition from countries currently issuing international reserve currencies , especially the US . 
Keeping SDRs as pure &quot; central-bank money &quot; would eliminate such opposition , enabling them to complement and stabilize the current system , rather than upend it . 
Just as the Bretton Woods framework restored order to the global economy after WWII , a new monetary framework , underpinned by a truly international currency , could strengthen much-needed economic and financial stability . 
Everyone - even the US - would benefit from that .
