Bank Regulation &apos;s Capital Mistake 
MEDFORD , MASSACHUSETTS - Imagine that the arguments triggered by the Hindenberg disaster were about the fire extinguishers and parachutes that airships should carry , rather than about the design flaws that might cause them to ignite . 
Unfortunately , today &apos;s debates about banking reform have just this character . 
Reversing the robotic gigantism of banking ought to be the top priority for reform . 
Bankers were once supposed to know every borrower , and to make case-by-case lending decisions . 
Now , however , banks use models conjured up by faraway financial wizards to mass-produce credit and a range of derivative products . 
Mass-production favors the growth of mega-banks , so , unlike the misjudgments of lending officers , these behemoths &quot; defective models have had disastrous consequences . 
Radical proposals that would help restore a more resilient system , offered by the likes of Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King , have been smothered by noisy discussion of measures that do nothing to address modern banking &apos;s fundamental defects . 
Consider the seemingly heated debate over how much capital banks should hold . 
Regulators have proposed steep hikes : a Bank of England study , for example , suggested a more than three-fold increase . 
Bankers , who may really be worried about their own bonuses , warn that higher capital requirements will force them to curtail lending , thus impeding economic growth . 
In fact , this is all a pointless charade . 
Yes , the principle of regulating bank capital seems sensible . 
Borrowing increases risk in any business : you can &apos;t go bankrupt if you have no debt . 
Heavy borrowing also encourages owners and managers to go for broke , because it &apos;s the creditors who bear most of the downside risk . 
Prudent lenders therefore try to limit both how much a business can borrow and the other risks it can take . 
But creditors don &apos;t have an incentive to place tough limits on banks . 
Because runs on banks can trigger widespread distress , governments explicitly guarantee insured deposits and implicitly guarantee all the other debts of mega-banks . 
Governments that guarantee bank liabilities , however , must then also demand that bankers exercise more prudence than they might on their own . 
Yet focusing mainly on how much banks borrow while ignoring other , more serious recklessness is a bad regulatory bet . 
Bank regulation , like lending , was once decentralized and judgment-based . 
Regulators relied mainly on examination of individual loans rather than capital-to-asset ratios . 
A typical bank exam would include scrutiny of every single business loan and a large proportion of consumer loans . 
Capital adequacy was a matter of judgment : examiners would figure out how large a buffer a bank ought to have , taking into account its specific risks . 
Regulators then shifted to edicts requiring banks to maintain a specified capital cushion , thick enough to cover potential losses . 
This approach presupposes that bank assets and exposures can be accurately measured . 
In fact , the financial statements of mega-banks are impenetrable works of fiction or wishful thinking . 
The problem goes beyond deliberate obfuscation . 
J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank have paid substantial sums to settle charges ranging from bribery to illegal foreclosures to abetting tax evasion . 
Ruling out the connivance of top executives raises an alarming question : Does Jamie Dimon , J.P. Morgan &apos;s highly regarded CEO , have as little grasp of the exposures embedded in his bank &apos;s nearly $ 80 billion derivatives book as Tony Hayward , the hapless ex-CEO of BP , had of the hazards of his company &apos;s ill-fated rig in the Gulf of Mexico ? 
Indeed , ignorance about what is actually at risk makes debates about the right formula for capital buffers surreal . 
Moreover , the use of mechanistic rules to determine capital adequacy has also inadvertently encouraged systemic imprudence . 
Limits on borrowing that make it difficult to earn an adequate return on equity encourage banks to load up on riskier , high-profit-margin loans - and requiring banks to hold more capital for supposedly riskier categories of assets exacerbates the problem . 
For example , under the internationally-agreed Basel Committee rules that were in place before the 2008 crash , capital requirements for business loans were five times higher than for mortgage-backed securities that had AA or AAA ratings . 
Banks naturally avoided traditional business loans ( which would have to be backed by more capital ) , and instead loaded up on the highest-yielding - and thus riskiest - AA or AAA mortgage- backed securities that they could find . 
The global banking system and economy was thus vulnerable to the mistakes of the three main rating agencies and their flawed risk models . 
Encouraging banks to turn loans kept on their books into securities also helped reduce the overall level of caution in the extension of credit . 
Additionally , strategies to circumvent the Basel rules made banks more complex and difficult to manage and supervise . 
Smarter capital requirements - better Basel rules - aren &apos;t the answer . 
Rigid , top-down uniformity is essential in the specification of weights and measures and the issuance of currency and coin . 
Bank lending and regulation , by contrast , must incorporate local knowledge , because , in a dynamic , unregimented economy , each borrower , loan , and bank is different ( though some general guidelines can help ) . 
The seemingly objective top-down approach ignores the idiosyncratic nature of risk and assumes that one mortgage loan is like the next . 
We can no longer afford to rely on old-fashioned examination for mega-banks loaded with mass-produced risks . 
And because stockholders or raiders can &apos;t force streamlining , governments must require these banks to shed activities that no one can manage or regulate and stick to hands-on case-by-case lending . 
With huge profits and bonuses at stake , mega-banks won &apos;t readily abandon their model-based businesses ; but , unless that happens , placing most of our bets on top-down rules would be reckless folly .
