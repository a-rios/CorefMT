Divided Europe Stands 
In coming meetings of the G8 ( the world &apos;s club of rich industrial countries plus Russia ) , four members - Germany , France , Italy , and the UK - will participate both individually and as members of the European Union , whose President also attends to represent the EU as a whole . 
But shouldn &apos;t the EU have only a single representative ? 
Regardless of whether these meetings are productive , unitary EU participation would be of supreme symbolic value : it would affirm a common European stance in international relations and international economic policy . 
The main argument in favor of such a change is that joint participation by the EU would increase Europe &apos;s weight in international relations , especially vis-a-vis the US . 
After all , a key reason for European integration in the first place was precisely to provide a more powerful voice for Europe in the international arena . 
The EU &apos;s member countries share strict rules on fiscal policy , a common currency ( except , for the moment , the UK , Sweden , and Denmark ) , a common trade policy , a common antitrust policy , and common market polices , just to name a few . 
So why not having a single representative at the G8 meetings . 
Indeed , Germany , France , Italy , and the UK basically share a common stance on international economic policy , so why not present a united front to the world where these issues are concerned ? 
There are two possible answers . 
One is that despite occasional shows of unity , European countries retain very different views on foreign policy and do not want to delegate this prerogative . 
Consider , for example , the recent strained relationship with the US . 
Although the UK remains very close to its transatlantic ally , France is extremely critical , regardless of the color of its government . 
Italy &apos;s position , on the other hand , pivots 180 degrees depending on who is in power . 
Germany has recently taken a more anti-American stance ( perhaps for electoral reasons ) , but it is beginning to like flexing its independent foreign-policy muscles . 
The risk is that agreeing on a common foreign policy would either be impossible or would lead to the adoption of a minimum common denominator that would leave Europe ineffective and weak . 
Alternatively , taking a strong position based on , say , majority voting within the EU may lead to very strained relations between member states . 
The European Union may soon have 25 , or more , members . 
Agreeing upon a united foreign policy will become even more difficult , if not downright impossible . 
Reaching a consensus on relatively small diplomatic and international issues may be feasible , but suppose that America pushes forward militarily against Iraq , after consultation with the European allies seeking their approval . 
It is very plausible that , even here , agreement on how to respond to the US request would be impossible . 
In fact , profound disagreements on foreign policy among EU members represent one of the main reasons why the EU can not and should not become a federal state in the traditional sense . 
Indeed , perhaps foreign policy should not be one of the policy areas delegated and agreed upon by all EU members . 
In a more general sense , can such a united policy ever be &quot; fair &quot; in global terms . 
Estonia once it joins the EU will be represented at the G8 meeting , while , say Korea will have no voice simply because it is not a member of the common market and single currency union ? 
Obviously the role of Estonia in deciding the position of the EU representative at G8 meeting would be small , but , again , its participation would be a matter of symbols more than substance . 
The second answer is more cynical . 
Perhaps the heads of states of the four European countries would lose a major photo opportunity and have no inclination to delegate it to a representative of the EU . 
The different preferences and policy choices among existing members in some areas , especially foreign policy , are very deep and in all likelihood will remain so . 
These differences are also likely to multiply and become more pronounced in an enlarged Europe . 
There is , indeed , a trade-off between EU enlargement and deepening of policy coordination . 
This is an important point that seems to be missed in the current European debate about institution building and constitution writing . 
The cynical answer about photo opportunities may or may not be correct . 
These are some of the key questions that the European constitutional convention has to address . 
So far it has offered precious few answers .
