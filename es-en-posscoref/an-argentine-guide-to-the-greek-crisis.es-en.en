An Argentine Guide to the Greek Crisis 
SANTIAGO - Policymakers in Europe seem to be surprised at the ongoing bank run in Greece ( and the nascent run in Spain ) . 
They should not be . 
Anyone familiar with emerging-market meltdowns knows that a financial crisis nearly always follows a fiscal crisis . 
Argentina &apos;s default in 2001 is but one useful example . 
In the Argentine crisis , the economy contracted by 18 % and unemployment soared to 22 % of the labor force . 
Greece is already close to these levels . 
Argentina went through a complete and chaotic default on its public debt . 
In Greece , the &quot; haircut &quot; imposed on creditors so far has been managed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund . 
But , with debt still unsustainable , the next round of Greek default could well make Argentina &apos;s look positively Teutonic in its orderliness . 
In Argentina , the banking system came close to collapse , causing the government to ban bank withdrawals - introducing the so-called corralito , or bullpen , for deposits - and establishing capital controls . 
That could be the stage that Greece is entering now . 
So , if the precedent of the Argentine and other emerging-market crises is a useful guide , what could be in store for Greece next ? 
To answer that question , it helps to recall the feedback loops that link fiscal and financial crises . 
Banks hold government and corporate loans as assets . 
Fiscal crisis and default reduce the value of the former , while the ensuing recession undermines the value of the latter . 
That is the link running from budget to bank problems . 
But there is a link going in the opposite direction as well : as banks deleverage to offset losses , they cut credit and the economy slows , causing government revenue to fall . 
If and when banks require a capital injection from public sources , the additional expenditure - which can be large - weakens public finances still further . 
These mutually reinforcing forces can work themselves out in a lengthy process of recession and deleveraging . 
Or they can prompt a sudden run on the banks , causing the financial system to implode . 
The outcome depends on confidence . 
Economists have long understood that , in the absence of a credible lender of last resort , banks are vulnerable to self-fulfilling confidence crises . 
That lender can be monetary or fiscal , and in Greece both types are in doubt . 
If Greece &apos;s agreement with the EU and the IMF unravels , the European Central Bank will no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral . 
And the Greek state does not have the wherewithal to stand behind its banks . 
In these circumstances , it would be more surprising if depositors were not rushing to pull their funds out of Greek banks . 
The Argentine experience suggests that , after the run on bank deposits , the saga &apos;s next installment is monetary collapse . 
With revenues plummeting and credit cut off , the Argentine provinces had to resort to printing scrip to pay salaries and pensions . 
At one point , more than a dozen quasi-currencies were in circulation . 
What happens if Greece is cut off from EU and IMF credit ? 
Optimists point out that the country is supposed to eliminate its primary deficit ( the budget balance minus interest payments ) by 2013 , which implies that it could pay its non debt-related bills with its own resources after a default . 
But that view overestimates the state &apos;s capacity to collect revenues in the midst of a panic . 
With the economy in free fall and uncertainty pervasive , many households and firms simply stop paying taxes . 
So , even if the Greek government defaults on all of its debt , it might have no option but to print pieces of paper in order to meet its obligations . 
That would not constitute official abandonment of the euro , but , over time , the difference could become more formal than real . 
The newly issued scrip - call it the neo-drachma - would be tradable and highly liquid . 
Even if it traded at a deep discount , as it surely would , sooner rather than later it would likely be used for settling all kinds of transactions . 
Here , the Argentine story suggests , the mechanism loops back to the banks : firms soon start complaining that their income is now denominated in neo-drachmas while their loans remain in euros . 
They begin to demand loudly that the loans be neo-drachmatized ( &quot; pesified &quot; in Argentine parlance ) . 
A parliament anxious for public approval is eager to meet these demands . 
Paying public sector workers with depreciated neo-drachmas implies a cut in the real wages that they receive . 
The final step in the process comes with the neo-drachmatization of private-sector wages . 
Firms again demand it , claiming that otherwise they cannot export . 
Unions initially oppose it , but eventually give in , spooked by the specter of even greater unemployment . 
The promise of selective price controls sweetens the deal . 
How large will the devaluation of the neo-drachma be ? 
In Argentina , the number of pesos needed to buy one dollar rose by more than 300 % . 
Greece posted a current-account deficit of nearly 10 % of GDP in 2011 , despite the domestic depression . 
The real devaluation necessary to restore external balance will be enormous , perhaps larger than that in Argentina . 
Greece now has its third government in less than a year , and a fourth is not far off . 
Argentina ran through four presidents in less than two years , before the political and economic situation stabilized . 
Greece , too , will eventually stabilize . 
At this point , that is just about the only hopeful precedent that the Argentine story holds .
