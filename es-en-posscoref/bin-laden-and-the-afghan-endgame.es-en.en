Bin Laden and the Afghan Endgame 
ISLAMABAD - Osama bin Laden &apos;s death in a firefight with United States special forces will profoundly affect Pakistan &apos;s relations with America . 
The death of Al Qaeda &apos;s leader deep in Pakistan , in a city with a heavy military presence , appears to confirm what many have long alleged : Pakistan , not Afghanistan , has become the epicenter of international terrorism . 
How will Bin Laden &apos;s death affect terrorist groups operating not only in Pakistan , but also in other Muslim countries around the world ? 
What impact will it have on America &apos;s involvement in Afghanistan ? 
Some tentative answers to these questions are now possible . 
The US went into Afghanistan in October 2001 to oust the Taliban regime , which had provided Bin Laden and Al Qaeda with a sanctuary and operational base . 
The US has now stayed on for almost ten years , fighting an insurgency concentrated among Afghanistan &apos;s Pakhtun population . 
The Pakhtuns , who constitute about half of Afghanistan &apos;s population , believe that the US invasion meant a loss of power to their ethnic rivals , the Tajiks and Uzbeks . 
The Pakhtun-led insurgency aims at expelling foreign troops and restoring Pakhtun dominance . 
With Bin Laden &apos;s death , the US could argue that the mission begun almost ten years ago has been accomplished . 
Troops could begin to be brought home , in line with the promise made by President Barack Obama when he announced his Afghan strategy at West Point on December 1 , 2009 . 
But is the mission really accomplished ? 
That question cannot be answered without knowing definitively where Pakistan stands in regard to Islamist terrorism . 
Bin Laden was killed in an operation that did not involve Pakistani forces , but that may ( or may not ) have involved the country &apos;s intelligence community . 
The fact that Bin Laden had lived in the heart of Abbottabad ( where I was schooled as a boy ) , about 40 miles north of Islamabad , in a mansion built over a period of six years , and had moved in and out of it several times a year , raises troubling questions about the Pakistani military &apos;s possible complicity . 
Did the army , or senior officers , know that Bin Laden was living in their midst ? 
If so , what was their purpose in letting him use so conspicuous a hiding place practically next door to a prominent military installation ? 
It is extraordinary to even consider that Pakistan &apos;s military high command could have tolerated Bin Laden &apos;s presence , given that he and Ayman al-Zawahiri , his second-in-command , had declared war on Pakistan . 
Indeed , terrorist attacks directed or inspired by Bin Laden have killed thousands of people in a number of large Pakistani cities . 
Some of these attacks targeted military installations , including the military &apos;s headquarters in Rawalpindi , not far from Abbottabad . 
In answering these questions , it would be helpful to know if the Pakistani intelligence community provided any aid at all to the US effort to locate Bin Laden &apos;s hideout . 
Or was Pakistan &apos;s military using Bin Laden as a pawn in its relations with the US ? 
Did the Pakistanis allow Bin Laden to hide in the hope of using him as a bargaining chip in the endgame for Afghanistan ? 
Had that moment arrived , leading to Bin Laden &apos;s exposure and death ? 
There are no immediate answers to such questions - not even in the op-ed written by President Asif Ali Zardari for The Washington Post within hours of Bin Laden &apos;s death . 
But answers will emerge as more details about the operation become known . 
What is known is that Bin Laden &apos;s demise came at a moment when relations between the CIA and Inter-Services Intelligence , Pakistan &apos;s intelligence agency , had sunk to an all-time low . 
Senior leaders from both sides sought to save the relationship from total rupture . 
Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha , the head of the ISI , took a day trip to Washington , DC , and spent four hours meeting with CIA Director Leon Panetta . 
Admiral Mike Mullen , Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , then went to Islamabad , where he met the commander of the Pakistani army for several hours . 
Later , on a visit to Afghanistan , Mullen expressed frustration with the ISI , and it is now clear that he already knew when he met the Pakistanis that an attack on Bin Laden &apos;s compound was imminent . 
Pakistanis fear that , with the US planning to exit , Afghanistan will become their problem . 
One way to ensure that a friendly regime holds sway in Kabul after the US withdrawal would be to introduce into the governing structure a group with close ties to Pakistan . 
From Pakistan &apos;s point of view , the group of fighters led by Jalaluddin Haqqani , one of the mujahideen leaders who fought to expel the Soviet Union from Afghanistan , could serve that purpose . 
Two decades ago , Haqqani and several other warlords were funded and trained by Pakistan and the US working together . 
Complicating the situation , however , is the fact that the Haqqanis are operating out of North Waziristan , one of the tribal agencies located in the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan , and is fiercely opposed to the presence of America and NATO troops in their country . 
There is a chance that , following Bin Laden &apos;s death , the Haqqani group could now be tamed and thus become willing to enter into negotiations with the Afghan government . 
That would satisfy both the US and Pakistan .
