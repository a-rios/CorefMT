The Tyranny of Political Economy 
CAMBRIDGE - There was a time when we economists steered clear of politics . 
We viewed our job as describing how market economies work , when they fail , and how well-designed policies can enhance efficiency . 
We analyzed trade-offs between competing objectives ( say , equity versus efficiency ) , and prescribed policies to meet desired economic outcomes , including redistribution . 
It was up to politicians to take our advice ( or not ) , and to bureaucrats to implement it . 
Then some of us became more ambitious . 
Frustrated by the reality that much of our advice went unheeded ( so many free-market solutions still waiting to be taken up ! ) , we turned our analytical toolkit on the behavior of politicians and bureaucrats themselves . 
We began to examine political behavior using the same conceptual framework that we use for consumer and producer decisions in a market economy . 
Politicians became income-maximizing suppliers of policy favors ; citizens became rent-seeking lobbies and special interests ; and political systems became marketplaces in which votes and political influence are traded for economic benefits . 
Thus was born the field of rational-choice political economy , and a style of theorizing that many political scientists readily emulated . 
The apparent payoff was that we could now explain why politicians did so many things that violated economic rationality . 
Indeed , there was no economic malfunction that the two words &quot; vested interests &quot; could not account for . 
Why are so many industries closed off to real competition ? 
Because politicians are in the pockets of the incumbents who reap the rents . 
Why do governments erect barriers to international trade ? 
Because the beneficiaries of trade protection are concentrated and politically influential , while consumers are diffuse and disorganized . 
Why do political elites block reforms that would spur economic growth and development ? 
Because growth and development would undermine their hold on political power . 
Why are there financial crises ? 
Because banks capture the policymaking process so that they can take excessive risks at the expense of the general public . 
In order to change the world , we need to understand it . 
But there was a deep paradox in all of this . 
The more we claimed to be explaining , the less room was left for improving matters . 
If politicians &quot; behavior is determined by the vested interests to which they are beholden , economists &quot; advocacy of policy reforms is bound to fall on deaf ears . 
The more complete our social science , the more irrelevant our policy analysis . 
This is where the analogy between human sciences and natural sciences breaks down . 
Consider the relationship between science and engineering . 
As scientists &quot; understanding of the physical laws of nature grows more sophisticated , engineers can build better bridges and buildings . 
Improvements in natural science enhance , rather than impede , our ability to shape our physical environment . 
The relationship between political economy and policy analysis is not at all like this . 
By endogenizing politicians &quot; behavior , political economy disempowers policy analysts . 
It is as if physicists came up with theories that explained not only natural phenomena , but also determined which bridges and buildings engineers would build . 
There would then scarcely be any need for engineering schools . 
If it seems to you that something is wrong with this , you are on to something . 
In reality , our contemporary frameworks for political economy are replete with unstated assumptions about the system of ideas underlying the operation of political systems . 
Make those assumptions explicit , and the decisive role of vested interests evaporates . 
There are three ways in which ideas shape interests . 
First , ideas determine how political elites define themselves and the objectives they pursue - money , honor , status , longevity in power , or simply a place in history . 
These questions of identity are central to how they choose to act . 
Second , ideas determine political actors &quot; views about how the world works . 
Powerful business interests will lobby for different policies when they believe that fiscal stimulus yields only inflation than when they believe that it generates higher aggregate demand . 
Revenue hungry governments will impose a lower tax when they think that it can be evaded than when they think that it cannot . 
Most important from the perspective of policy analysis , ideas determine the strategies that political actors believe they can pursue . 
For example , one way for elites to remain in power is to suppress all economic activity . 
Expand the range of feasible strategies ( which is what good policy design and leadership do ) , and you radically change behavior and outcomes . 
Indeed , this is what explains some of the most astounding turnarounds in economic performance in recent decades , such as South Korea &apos;s and China &apos;s breakout growth ( in the 1960 &quot; s and the late 1970 &quot; s , respectively ) . 
In both cases , the biggest winners were &quot; vested interests &quot; ( Korea &apos;s business establishment and the Chinese Communist Party ) . 
What enabled reform was not a reconfiguration of political power , but the emergence of new strategies . 
Economic change often happens not when vested interests are defeated , but when different strategies are used to pursue those interests . 
Political economy undoubtedly remains important . 
Without a clear understanding of who gains and who loses from the status quo , it is difficult to make sense of our existing policies . 
But an excessive focus on vested interests can easily divert us from the critical contribution that policy analysis and political entrepreneurship can make . 
The possibilities of economic change are limited not just by the realities of political power , but also by the poverty of our ideas .
