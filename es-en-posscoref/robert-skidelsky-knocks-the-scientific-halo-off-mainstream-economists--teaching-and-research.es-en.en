Post-Crash Economics 
LONDON - In last month &apos;s European Parliament election , euroskeptic and extremist parties won 25 % of the popular vote , with the biggest gains chalked up in France , the United Kingdom , and Greece . 
These results were widely , and correctly , interpreted as showing the degree of disconnect between an arrogant European elite and ordinary citizens . 
Less noticed , because less obviously political , are today &apos;s intellectual rumblings , of which French economist Thomas Piketty &apos;s Capital in the Twenty-First Century , a withering indictment of growing inequality , is the latest manifestation . 
We may be witnessing the beginning of the end of the neoliberal capitalist consensus that has prevailed throughout the West since the 1980s - and that many claim led to the economic disaster of 2008-2009 . 
Particularly important is the growing discontent of economics students with the university curriculum . 
Undergraduates &quot; discontent matters , because economics has long been the West &apos;s political lodestar . 
This discontent was born in the &quot; post-autistic economics movement , &quot; which started in Paris in 2000 , and spread to the United States , Australia , and New Zealand . 
Its adherents &quot; main complaint was that the mainstream economics taught to students had become a branch of mathematics , disconnected from reality . 
The revolt made little progress in the years of the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; of the 2000s , but was revived following the 2008 crisis . 
Two important links with the earlier network are US economist James Galbraith , the son of John Kenneth Galbraith , and British economist Ha-Joon Chang , author of the best-selling 23 Things They Don &apos;t Tell You about Capitalism . 
In a manifesto published in April , economics students at the University of Manchester advocated an approach &quot; that begins with economic phenomena and then gives students a toolkit to evaluate how well different perspectives can explain it , &quot; rather than with mathematical models based on unreal assumptions . 
Significantly , Andrew Haldane , Executive Director for Financial Stability at the Bank of England , wrote the introduction . 
The Manchester students argue that &quot; the mainstream within the discipline ( neoclassical theory ) has excluded all dissenting opinion , and the crisis is arguably the ultimate price of this exclusion . 
Alternative approaches such as Post-Keynesian , Marxist , and Austrian economics ( as well as many others ) have been marginalized . 
The same can be said of the history of the discipline . &quot; 
As a result , students have little awareness of neoclassical theory &apos;s limits , much less alternatives to it . 
The aim , according to the students , should be to &quot; bridge disciplines within and outside of economics . &quot; 
Economics should not be divorced from psychology , politics , history , philosophy , and so on . 
Students are especially keen to study issues like inequality , the role of ethics and fairness in economics ( as opposed to the prevailing focus on profit maximization ) , and the economic consequences of climate change . 
The idea is that such intellectual cross-fertilization would help students understand recent economic phenomena better and improve economic theory . 
From this point of view , everyone stands to benefit from curriculum reform . 
The deeper message is that mainstream economics is in fact an ideology - the ideology of the free market . 
Its tools and assumptions define its topics . 
If we assume perfect rationality and complete markets , we are debarred from exploring the causes of large-scale economic failures . 
Unfortunately , such assumptions have a profound influence on policy . 
The efficient-market hypothesis - the belief that financial markets price risks correctly on average - provided the intellectual argument for extensive deregulation of banking in the 1980s and 1990s . 
Similarly , the austerity policies that Europe used to fight the recession from 2010 on were based on the belief that there was no recession to fight . 
These ideas were tailored to the views of the financial oligarchy . 
But the tools of economics , as currently taught , provide little scope for investigating the links between economists &quot; ideas and the structures of power . 
Today &apos;s &quot; post-crash &quot; students are right . 
So what is keeping the mainstream &apos;s intellectual apparatus going ? 
For starters , economics teaching and research is deeply embedded in an institutional structure that , as with any ideological movement , rewards orthodoxy and penalizes heresy . 
The great classics of economics , from Smith to Ricardo to Veblen , go untaught . 
Research funding is allocated on the basis of publication in academic journals that espouse the neoclassical perspective . 
Publication in such journals is also the basis of promotion . 
Moreover , it has become an article of faith that any move toward a more open or &quot; pluralist &quot; approach to economics portends regression to &quot; pre-scientific &quot; modes of thought , just as the results of the European Parliament election threaten to revive a more primitive mode of politics . 
Yet institutions and ideologies cannot survive by mere incantation or reminders of past horrors . 
They have to address and account for the contemporary world of lived experience . 
For now , the best that curriculum reform can do is to remind students that economics is not a science like physics , and that it has a much richer history than is to be found in the standard textbooks . 
In his book Economics of Good and Evil , the Czech economist Tomáš Sedláček shows that what we call &quot; economics &quot; is only a formalized fragment of a much wider range of thinking about economic life , stretching from the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh to the meta-mathematics of today . 
Indeed , mainstream economics is a pitifully thin distillation of historical wisdom on the topics that it addresses . 
It should be applied to whatever practical problems it can solve ; but its tools and assumptions should always be in creative tension with other beliefs concerning human wellbeing and flourishing . 
What students are taught today certainly does not deserve its imperial status in social thought .
