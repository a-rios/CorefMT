Economic Policy &apos;s Narrative Imperative 
WASHINGTON , DC - The best advice I received when taking up policymaking responsibilities in Turkey more than a decade ago was to take &quot; a lot of time and care to develop and communicate the &quot; narrative &quot; to support the policy program that you want to succeed . &quot; 
The more that economic policy is subject to public debate - that is , the more democracy there is - the more important such policy narratives are . 
The crisis faced by the European Union and the eurozone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it . 
A successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic . 
It must capture the imagination , address the public &apos;s anxieties , and generate realistic hope . 
Voters often sense cheap populism . 
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi provided such a narrative to the financial markets last July . 
He said that the ECB would do everything necessary to prevent the disintegration of the euro , adding simply : &quot; Believe me , it will be enough . &quot; 
With that sentence , Draghi eliminated the perceived re-denomination tail risk that was highest in the case of Greece , but that was driving up borrowing costs in Spain , Italy , and Portugal as well . 
It was not a populist message , because the ECB does indeed have the firepower to buy enough sovereign bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates , at least for many months . 
Central bankers , more generally , are typically able to provide short- or medium-term narratives to financial markets . 
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke provided his own by pledging that US short-term interest rates would remain very low , and the Bank of Japan &apos;s new chairman , Haruhiko Kuroda , has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2 % . 
While central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets , it is political leaders who must provide the overall socioeconomic messages that encourage long-term real investment , electoral support for reform , and hope for the future . 
Central bank alchemy , to borrow a term from the US journalist Neil Irwin &apos;s new book , has its limits . 
Europe , in particular , needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery . 
France is coming closer to the danger zone , and even Germany &apos;s annual GDP growth is falling well below 1 % per year . 
In the meantime , the easing of sovereign interest-rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern Europe , where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights - close to 60 % in Greece and Spain , and almost 40 % in Italy . 
The narrative should address three essential questions . 
How can the European model of strong social solidarity and security be reformed , but endure ? 
How can economic growth be revived and sustained throughout the EU ? 
And how can Europe &apos;s institutions function with enhanced legitimacy to accommodate countries that share the euro and others that retain their national currencies ? 
For starters , a revolution is required in the organization of work , learning , and leisure . 
Social solidarity , essential to European identity , can and must include longer work lives , but also more work-sharing , adult learning , and shorter average work weeks ( particularly close to retirement ) . 
Such flexibility requires the consent of all : employees must adjust to changing requirements ; employers must re-organize their enterprises to allow more work-sharing , work from home , and learning intervals ; and governments must overhaul taxes , income support , and regulation to promote a &quot; flex-solidarity revolution &quot; that encourages personal choice and responsibility , while remaining committed to social cohesion . 
This can lead to a better future for all , with citizens gaining better access to adult education , having more free time to pursue personal interests , and remaining productive and occupationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives . 
Europe does not need Asia &apos;s rates of economic growth . 
It can secure decent jobs and prosperity , with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2 % . 
To achieve that , German voters should be told not that their country &apos;s resources will forever flow to Spain , but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without risking inflation or a current-account deficit , because Germany has the world &apos;s largest external surplus . 
Service-sector industries throughout the EU must be opened up . 
The countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan-European skill-upgrading program . 
The number of pan-European scholarships should be doubled . 
School programs everywhere should aim to educate trilingual citizens . 
Moreover , a full European banking union with shared resources for resolution should be created without further delay . 
The European Investment Bank , which received a significant capital increase in 2012 , should add a large investment-support program for medium-size enterprises to its current operations , with a subsidy financed from the European budget to encourage first-time job takers for a limited period . 
Jobs and training for young people must be the centerpiece for the new growth pact , and projects must move ahead in &quot; crisis mode , &quot; rather than according to business as usual . 
Finally , while monetary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereignty , there should also be a &quot; greater Europe &quot; that includes the United Kingdom and others . 
This implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries : the &quot; euro-ins &quot; and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values . 
These interconnected visions can and must be realized if Europe is to thrive again . 
Together , they form a compelling narrative that European leaders must begin to articulate .
