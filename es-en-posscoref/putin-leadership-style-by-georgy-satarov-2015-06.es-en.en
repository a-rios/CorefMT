Putin Made Simple 
MOSCOW - Three weeks before Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s first election victory , in March 2000 , his campaign released a book , First Person : Conversations with Vladimir Putin , based on 24 hours of interviews with three journalists . 
With quotes like &quot; Life is such a simple thing , really , &quot; the book revealed a key belief that would underlie Putin &apos;s leadership style : Simplicity can and must be imposed on a complex world . 
This worldview , which today pervades the Russian establishment , was not developed by Putin himself ; it was introduced by a think tank established in December 1999 and headed by German Gref , who would later become Economic Development and Trade Minister under Putin . 
In anticipation of Putin &apos;s victory , Gref &apos;s Center for Strategic Research invited experts to develop two programs - one focused on the economy and the other on public administration reform - based on one fundamental directive : Don &apos;t complicate things . 
Fifteen years later , Putin &apos;s ideology , policies , and activities all reflect this obsession with simplification of systems and structures . 
The separation of powers in government is too inefficient , so the presidency must dominate all other branches . 
The large number of political parties , each with its own platform , is too complicated , so it must be replaced by a short list of a few accepted parties , with one main ( and permanent ) representation of power . 
Freedom of expression facilitates an unproductive cacophony of outrage , so the media must receive clear directives to guide their reporting . 
There were also , according to Putin &apos;s regime , too many public institutions performing too many activities with insufficient oversight , so they were made smaller and given specific tasks from a short centralized list of priorities . 
Multiple higher courts were too difficult to maintain , so a single court replaced them . 
Like systems and institutions , problem-solving was also simplified . 
Instead of developing a nuanced solution to a multifaceted problem - an approach that would involve careful thought , not to mention mistakes and adjustments - every issue , from official corruption to business management , was viewed as one-dimensional . 
The Putin regime &apos;s aversion to complexity has intensified over time , moving from the relatively innocuous belief that simplicity translates into clarity , manageability , predictability , and safety , to the dangerous conclusion that complexity itself - inherently unpredictable and often impenetrable - is a threat . 
Complex or convoluted ideas and institutions , viewed as a product of forceful punditry , deliberately produced by the enemy to baffle and hurt Russia , are to be quashed at all costs . 
This black-and-white perspective may seem like a continuation of the Soviet-era worldview . 
In fact , the main driver of Russia &apos;s modernization was the formation of a new social order based on freedom , diversity , and a recognition that the modern world was rich in opportunities for self-actualization , whether in the arts , business , science , or politics . 
But , before a modern open society was fully established or the associated mindset entrenched , it was overtaken by Putin &apos;s &quot; simple is better &quot; approach . 
The view that individual opportunity and heterodoxy should be subordinated to overall predictability empowered the political elite to claim omniscience and cite outside interference as the main threat to Russia &apos;s future . 
Driven by these beliefs , a union of &quot; liberals &quot; attempted to bring about a kind of bureaucratic modernization , having convinced themselves that liberal political outcomes could somehow be orchestrated by corrupt bureaucracy through limited democratic institutions . 
Not surprisingly , they failed . 
Within just a few years , it became clear not only that , in an inescapably complex world , &quot; simple &quot; solutions do not yield results , but also that restrictions on democracy , together with top-down bureaucratic control , create ideal conditions for personal enrichment . 
The destruction of democratic institutions was now being driven both by the desire for simplicity and by pure greed . 
The Russian proverb &quot; Simplicity is worse than theft &quot; proved oddly prescient . 
The latest victim in the Putin regime &apos;s quest for simplicity is science . 
While science was not initially deemed a threat , within today &apos;s tightly restricted social and political order , it has emerged as a symbol of autonomy and diversity . 
That is why , after being elected for his third ( illegal ) term as president , Putin asserted full control over the Russian Academy of Sciences . 
More recently , the Ministry of Justice added the Dynasty Foundation , established in 2002 by the well-known scientist and telecommunications mogul Dmitry Zimin , to its list of &quot; foreign agents , &quot; most likely with the goal of stifling the organization &apos;s efforts to build a modern scientific community . 
( The &quot; foreign funding &quot; that the foundation receives - the reason it was flagged - comes , according to Zimin , from his own bank accounts . ) 
This repression has had a serious impact on the scientific community , with Russia &apos;s top scientific minds - unwilling to remain in an environment where greed and corruption stifle creativity and exploration - joining investors and capital in fleeing the country . 
From 1990 to 2010 , around 70 % of Russia &apos;s leading mathematicians and half of its theoretical physicists left the country for good . 
Biologists , chemists , engineers , and other experts have also been emigrating in search of better opportunities . 
These trends will only accelerate as Putin &apos;s regime intensifies its assault on the field . 
The oppressive atmosphere of gray , government-imposed simplicity has finally insinuated itself into every sphere of Russian life . 
One hopes that when Putin &apos;s reign ends - as it inevitably will , perhaps even soon - Russians will understand that the path toward an open , modern society is never a simple one .
