London vs. the Eurozone 
LONDON - Ever since the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community in 1973 , after the French withdrew Charles de Gaulle &apos;s veto of its membership , Britain &apos;s relationship with the European integration process has been strained . 
The British are reluctant Europeans , for historical and cultural reasons . 
For centuries , British foreign policy strove to avoid permanent European entanglements ; but , most importantly , it aimed to prevent a single continental power from achieving dominance - especially if that power happened to be France . 
In the meantime , the British colonized large portions of the globe . 
Later , after the sun set on their empire , they tried to maintain a &quot; special relationship &quot; with the United States . 
Joining the European Union was not an affirmation of belief in European integration , but rather a reluctant recognition that the transatlantic strategy had run its course . 
British public opinion concerning the EU has since remained lukewarm , at best . 
In recent years , having opted-out of the single currency and the Schengen area ( which allows Europeans to cross borders without passports ) , the UK has distanced itself from important EU initiatives . 
Nonetheless , Prime Minister David Cameron surprised everyone by vetoing a new EU treaty on December 9 - a first for the UK since joining the Union - leaving the other 26 member states to press ahead with greater fiscal integration on their own . 
More surprisingly , the negotiations broke down over arcane details of financial regulation . 
For example , Cameron wanted to strike a &quot; red line &quot; through the proposal to subject the planned Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive to the Qualified Majority Voting procedure ( meaning that no member state would have veto power ) . 
Cameron also objected to the requirement that third-country financial firms in London without business in other EU states be required to hold a &quot; single passport , &quot; which would enable them to operate in any member country , but would also require them to submit to Europe-wide regulations . 
These points are not entirely insignificant , but I would not care to explain them to a meeting of ordinary voters puzzled about Britain &apos;s new European policy . 
So why has financial regulation become the unlikely casus belli between the UK and its partners ? 
The explanation is partly political . 
Cameron &apos;s Conservative Party includes members who have been spoiling for a fight with the EU for a long time . 
For them , any excuse will do , and EU Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier has provided them with ammunition by pursuing what many see as an excessively restrictive regulatory agenda . 
When horse-trading for Commission jobs took place in 2009 , former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown was warned of the danger of allowing the French to hold the Internal Market post . 
But he chose instead to bid for the EU foreign-policy job for his Labour Party ally , Baroness Ashton . 
When Barnier was appointed , French President Nicolas Sarkozy described it as a &quot; defeat for Anglo-Saxon capitalism . &quot; 
And so it has proved - though perhaps not in the way he envisaged . 
But beneath the politics , there are other substantial conflicts between the UK and its continental neighbors . 
Barnier favors European directives that impose uniform rules for all member states - so called &quot; maximum harmonization &quot; measures . 
Previously , EU directives tended to impose minimum standards , which individual countries could supplement if they wished . 
They could outlaw initiatives that the UK holds dear , such as new rules to ring-fence retail banks &quot; subsidiaries and impose higher capital requirements on them . 
The governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , has voiced his anxieties on that point . 
British officials are also deeply concerned about measures that would oblige clearinghouses that transact their business primarily in euros to be located within the single-currency area . 
Indeed , the British government was already taking the European Central Bank to court to challenge that policy before the treaty veto . 
They may have a point ; arguably , the ECB &apos;s proposal is inconsistent with single-market principles . 
The key point of contention , however , is the pan-European Financial Transactions Tax , which the European Commission proposed with support from both Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
From a UK perspective , the FTT is highly unattractive . 
Between 60 % and 70 % of the revenue would be raised in London , yet the EU would spend most of the money to shore up eurozone finances . 
For Britons , this idea stirs sentiments akin to what Germans might feel if the EU proposed a new tax on liverwurst , with the proceeds to go into the central pot . 
They also point out that , unless an FTT were agreed globally , financial companies would quickly migrate from London to New York . 
This is Cameron &apos;s best argument on the financial front . 
But he did not deploy it strongly , for the simple reason that tax policies in Europe are still subject to the unanimity rule . 
In other words , Britain can block the proposed FTT without a special protocol . 
This lends weight to the argument that Cameron &apos;s veto was essentially a political move , intended to bolster his domestic support . 
That is a big gamble , given that the UK now appears to be shuffling towards the EU exit . 
Certainly , the new status quo looks unsustainable , with 26 countries moving towards greater integration while the 27th remains aloof . 
How will financial firms react ? 
Will they be pleased that London has stamped its collective foot , even though Cameron &apos;s regulatory demands were not accepted ? 
Or will some simply begin to contact real-estate agents to line up office space in Paris or Frankfurt ? 
The game - London versus the eurozone - has only just begun . 
It will make for fascinating viewing in the months and years to come .
