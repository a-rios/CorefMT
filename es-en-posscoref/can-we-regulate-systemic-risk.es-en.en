Can We Regulate Systemic Risk ? 
MILAN - In the past two years , two dangerous episodes of financial instability and sudden changes in market dynamics have hit the world economy . 
More are likely , because the global economy is out of balance in several respects as it emerges from the crisis , particularly in terms of sovereign debt and the structure of global demand . 
Systemic risks drive most crises , and pose a challenge for several reasons . 
First , they are not easy to detect with confidence , and are even more difficult to prove . 
Second , predicting the exact timing of a break point ( when bubbles burst , markets lock up , and credit freezes ) is , and will likely remain , beyond our ability . 
Finally , crises are highly non-linear events , which means that they occur without much warning . 
Periodic outbreaks of instability impose high social costs on those who had the least to do with causing them . 
If repeated , this pattern may erode confidence in financial markets and regulators , which could well lead to heavy-handed regulation , the expansion of the state , and retrenchment from globalization . 
But the problem is even more serious . 
The financial and economic crisis is morphing into a sovereign debt crisis in advanced countries . 
Financial and economic imbalance can lead to dangerous fiscal imbalance , as tax revenues plunge and social insurance and bailout expenditures rise . 
The International Monetary Fund suggests that as much as 75 % of the &quot; fiscal stimulus &quot; in the advanced countries comprises non-discretionary counter-cyclical measures . 
Undetected imbalances and systemic risk make fiscal policies seem prudent when they are not . 
Spain , for example , was not running a fiscal deficit coming into the crisis . 
But its revenues and expenditures were in part determined by a highly leveraged real-estate bubble . 
Extreme fiscal imbalance can also lead to a growth trap in which fiscal consolidation has such a large negative effect on growth as to be self-defeating . 
Greece is probably a case in point . 
Eventually , the only way out is to reset the value of liabilities via restructuring or inflation . 
If systemic risk can cause this kind of cascading sequential imbalance , then the &quot; sovereign &quot; needs to be alert , competent at identifying rising systemic risk , and able to take corrective action early . 
We are about to get a comprehensive package of re-regulation focused on capital requirements and leverage , transparency , ratings and other sources of information , incentives , conflicts of interest and limits on the scope of financial firms , consumer protection , and resolution mechanisms . 
The hope is that such reforms will reduce the likelihood and severity of systemic risk . 
But that doesn &apos;t deal with global imbalances and other contributors to and signs of instability . 
In addition and as a complement to re-regulation , we need a comprehensive systemic risk monitor . 
Some prominent policymakers and analysts , however , argue that oversight aimed at identifying and stemming systemic risk is futile . 
With incomplete models of risk dynamics and a complex and constantly changing global financial system , detection is , they argue , either impossible or so prone to error that the effort would be counter-productive . 
Asset bubbles are hard to identify with certainty . 
If skeptics are right , then we should accept that we will periodically be out of financial and fiscal balance without knowing it in advance . 
Thus , we should also accept the need for much more conservative fiscal positioning than was thought necessary even three years ago . 
In statistics and the theory of decision-making under uncertainty , errors are inevitable . There are two kinds . 
One error is to reject a true proposition ; the other is to accept a false one . 
Let &apos;s call them RWT ( reject when true ) and AWF ( accept when false ) . 
The issue can then be framed as follows : in the context of detecting and responding to systemic risk , which of the two types of errors has the higher expected costs ? 
Opponents of prudential oversight of systemic risk take two different positions . 
One is that the AWF error won &apos;t occur , because there are no reliable ex ante signs of rising potential instability . 
Looking for them is a waste of resources . 
Instability just strikes like lightning . 
This seems wrong . 
In the 2008 crisis , for example , some analysts issued warning signs , and some investors noted and responded to them . 
Admittedly , these warnings did not add up to an ironclad case , and they certainly didn &apos;t predict the timing of the break . 
But the signs were there . 
A second position accepts that there are warning signs , but that they are so unreliable that responding to them would do more harm than good . 
This implies that AWF has a higher expected cost than RWT , because there are a lot of false positives and / or the cure is worse than the disease . 
One can accept that there are costs to AWF . 
But RWT is costly , too , as we have seen , so the aggregate negative effect of the policy response to false positives ( AWF ) would have to be large to be convincing . 
I am not convinced . 
There may be a deeper bias at work . 
In business and investing , choices under conditions of uncertainty are made all the time , and mistakes are routine . 
By contrast , developed country policymakers &quot; default stance seems to be that proactive or preemptive measures require a high degree of certainty , owing to a deep-seated belief that financial markets are stable and self-regulating . 
If one believes that market instability is rare , then it is reasonable to refuse to act unless there is a compelling case to do so . 
In light of experience , the view that the financial system is only exceptionally unstable or on an unsustainable path seems at least questionable . 
Based on new theory and experience , we may eventually conclude that policy responses to systemic risk are impossible to devise , and that the costs of the AWF errors are higher than the RWT errors . 
But we should at least conduct the experiment , assigning responsibility to a new or existing institution that has access to information , deep analytical talent in both financial and macroeconomic analysis , and is relatively free of conflicts of interest . 
The analysis should be made public and could influence perceptions of systemic risk and market behavior , thereby increasing self-regulatory capacity of the system .
