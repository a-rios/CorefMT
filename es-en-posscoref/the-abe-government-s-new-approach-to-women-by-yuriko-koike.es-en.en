Ms. Watanabe &apos;s Profession 
TOKYO - Ms. Watanabe , age 40 , is hesitant . 
Her mother , Mrs. Watanabe , is known for moving the world &apos;s markets with the financial trading that occupies her breaks from housework . 
Mrs. Watanabe is the generic name for Japan &apos;s housewife speculators , who have wielded significant influence on foreign exchange and other markets through their trading . 
After graduating from university , Mrs. Watanabe quit her job when she married Mr. Watanabe ( who worked in the same office ) , became a housewife , and raised one daughter . 
She did this because , in Mrs. Watanabe &apos;s day , marriage was the final workplace . 
Times are different for her daughter , Ms. Watanabe , who majored in economics at a famous university and was hired by a well-known trading firm . 
But , though she outperformed the men in her recruitment class academically , she was unable to compete for promotion . 
She could not even have an official business card ( which is more important than a passport in Japan ) ; she had no choice but to make one on her computer . 
She resolved to hone her skills by following her mother &apos;s example . 
After work , she would attend night school to become an international accountant . 
She didn &apos;t like going out drinking with colleagues to complain about their boss ; communication through drinking neither improved one &apos;s skills nor helped one to rise through the ranks . 
Ms. Watanabe &apos;s story helps to illustrate a remarkable disparity . 
While productivity in Japanese factories is the highest in the world , owing to robots and other types of automation , the productivity of Japan &apos;s white-collar workers is the lowest among OECD countries . 
In 1999 , Japan &apos;s Equal Employment Opportunity Act was amended to provide equal employment opportunities for men and women by prohibiting discriminatory labor practices . 
But the legislation has had little impact on the workplace atmosphere for women . 
The other women who joined the company at the same time as Ms. Watanabe married colleagues and quit to devote their time to raising children . 
The only difference from her mother &apos;s era was that today &apos;s generation quit , married , and gave birth later . 
Women account for more than 80 % of those who use childcare leave in Japan ; in reality , more than 60 % of Japanese women leave the workplace and don &apos;t come back when they have children . 
Before she knew it , Ms. Watanabe was in her thirties . 
Her mother , Mrs. Watanabe , used the money she had made through financial trading to fund her daughter &apos;s study abroad . 
Companies pay for men to study abroad , but will not invest in female employees . 
Without other options , Ms. Watanabe took a long-term unpaid leave of absence ( which her company typically does not grant to women ) to study for an MBA in America . 
Although she returned with excellent grades , her position within the company worsened , because she did not have a boss who could use her skills . 
One day , Ms. Watanabe received a call from a headhunting firm . 
Encouraged by her mother , Ms. Watanabe set her sights on new shores . 
It was a completely new working environment , but her English skills and MBA proved to be invaluable . 
Her work was interesting , and she played an important role . 
At times , though , she thought about marriage and children when planning for the future . 
Last year , Japan &apos;s government changed , with the Liberal Democratic Party &apos;s return to power . 
Previously , the LDP had given barely a second thought to women &apos;s issues , focusing only on the needs of business and dealing with an aging society . 
Now , to Ms. Watanabe &apos;s surprise , it has made women &apos;s policy one of the key aspects of its long-term strategy . 
To top it off , exchange-listed companies must now appoint at least one female officer . 
Ms. Watanabe had heard that companies in Norway or France face delisting if their ratio of female officers falls below 40 % , and she joked with her friends that Keidanren ( the Japan Business Federation ) would vanish under such a law . 
Nonetheless , with each public company in Japan to appoint at least one female officer , it might be her turn someday . 
But she already is 40 , and is thinking of marriage . 
Would maternity leave be possible if she were appointed as an officer ? 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s government says that it will establish daycare centers , but is this really true ? 
Ms. Watanabe is hesitant . 
Should she take up an important role at this stage ? 
Or should she pursue happiness as a woman ? 
Mrs. Watanabe gives her daughter the nudge she needs . 
Mrs. Watanabe has a talent for seeing how the tide turns . 
Her advice is to grab the opportunity at work , and also find happiness in marriage and children . 
According to an estimate by Kathy Matsui , Chief Japan Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs , the country &apos;s GDP could rise by 15 % , and 8.2 million new jobs could be created , if Japanese women gain equality of opportunity at work . 
Abe has said that &quot; womanomics &quot; is the most important pillar of &quot; Abenomics , &quot; his government &apos;s growth strategy . 
Mrs. Watanabe and her daughter have much at stake in its realization .
