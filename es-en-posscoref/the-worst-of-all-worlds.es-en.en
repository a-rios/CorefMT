The Worst of All Worlds 
COPENHAGEN - Have you noticed how environmental campaigners almost inevitably say that not only is global warming happening and bad , but also that what we are seeing is even worse than expected ? 
This is odd , because any reasonable understanding of how science proceeds would expect that , as we refine our knowledge , we find that things are sometimes worse and sometimes better than we expected , and that the most likely distribution would be about 50-50 . 
Environmental campaigners , however , almost invariably see it as 100-0 . 
If we are regularly being surprised in just one direction , if our models get blindsided by an ever-worsening reality , that does not bode well for our scientific approach . 
Indeed , one can argue that if the models constantly get something wrong , it is probably because the models are wrong . 
And if we cannot trust our models , we cannot know what policy action to take if we want to make a difference . 
Yet , if new facts constantly show us that the consequences of climate change are getting worse and worse , high-minded arguments about the scientific method might not carry much weight . 
Certainly , this seems to be the prevailing bet in the spin on global warming . 
It is , again , worse than we thought , and , despite our failing models , we will gamble on knowing just what to do : cut CO2 emissions dramatically . 
But it is simply not correct that climate data are systematically worse than expected ; in many respects , they are spot on , or even better than expected . 
That we hear otherwise is an indication of the media &apos;s addiction to worst-case stories , but that makes a poor foundation for smart policies . 
The most obvious point about global warming is that the planet is heating up . 
It has warmed about 1 ° C ( 1.8 ° F ) over the past century , and is predicted by the United Nations &quot; climate panel ( IPCC ) to warm between 1.6-3.8 ° C ( 2.9-6.8 ° F ) during this century , mainly owing to increased CO2 . 
An average of all 38 available standard runs from the IPCC shows that models expect a temperature increase in this decade of about 0.2 ° C. 
But this is not at all what we have seen . 
And this is true for all surface temperature measures , and even more so for both satellite measures . 
Temperatures in this decade have not been worse than expected ; in fact , they have not even been increasing . 
They have actually decreased by between 0.01 and 0.1 ° C per decade . 
On the most important indicator of global warming , temperature development , we ought to hear that the data are actually much better than expected . 
Likewise , and arguably much more importantly , the heat content of the world &apos;s oceans has been dropping for the past four years where we have measurements . 
Whereas energy in terms of temperature can disappear relatively easily from the light atmosphere , it is unclear where the heat from global warming should have gone - and certainly this is again much better than expected . 
We hear constantly about how the Arctic sea ice is disappearing faster than expected , and this is true . 
But most serious scientists also allow that global warming is only part of the explanation . 
Another part is that the so-called Arctic Oscillation of wind patterns over the Arctic Ocean is now in a state that it does not allow build-up of old ice , but immediately flushes most ice into the North Atlantic . 
More importantly , we rarely hear that the Antarctic sea ice is not only not declining , but is above average for the past year . 
IPCC models would expect declining sea ice in both hemispheres , but , whereas the Arctic is doing worse than expected , Antarctica is doing better . 
Ironically , the Associated Press , along with many other news outlets , told us in 2007 that the &quot; Arctic is screaming , &quot; and that the Northwest Passage was open &quot; for the first time in recorded history . &quot; 
Yet the BBC reported in 2000 that the fabled Northwest Passage was already without ice . 
We are constantly inundated with stories of how sea levels will rise , and how one study after another finds that it will be much worse than what the IPCC predicts . 
But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea-level increase of 18 to 59 centimeters ( 7-23 inches ) this century . 
This is of course why the thousands of IPCC scientists projected that range . 
Yet studies claiming one meter or more obviously make for better headlines . 
Since 1992 , we have had satellites measuring the rise in global sea levels , and they have shown a stable increase of 3.2 millimeters per year ( 1 / 8 of an inch ) - spot on compared to the IPCC projection . 
Moreover , over the last two years , sea levels have not increased at all - actually , they show a slight drop . 
Should we not be told that this is much better than expected ? 
Hurricanes were the stock image of Al Gore &apos;s famous film on climate change , and certainly the United States was battered in 2004 and 2005 , leading to wild claims of ever stronger and costlier storms in the future . 
But in the two years since , the costs have been well below average , virtually disappearing in 2006 . 
That is definitely better than expected . 
Gore quoted MIT hurricane researcher Kerry Emmanuel to support an alleged scientific consensus that global warming is making hurricanes much more damaging . 
But Emmanuel has now published a new study showing that even in a dramatically warming world , hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries . 
That conclusion did not get much exposure in the media . 
Of course , not all things are less bad than we thought . 
But one-sided exaggeration is not the way forward . 
We urgently need balance if we are to make sensible choices .
