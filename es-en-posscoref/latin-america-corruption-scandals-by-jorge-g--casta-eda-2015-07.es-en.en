Latin America &apos;s Anti-Corruption Crusade 
MEXICO CITY - Even as much of Latin America engages in almost hyperbolic celebrations over the renewed diplomatic ties between Cuba and the United States , the continent is facing two major challenges . 
The first - declining economic growth , to less than 1 % , on average , across the region - has been discussed at length , with the prevailing explanation being that China &apos;s slowing economic growth has suppressed commodity prices and , thus , Latin America &apos;s export revenues . 
But it is the second - the resurgence of corruption - that is proving most interesting . 
Latin America has been plagued by corruption for centuries , ever since it emerged from what the Mexican poet Octavio Paz called the &quot; patrimonialist &quot; nature of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule . 
What is different today is the response to it , with societies and institutions refusing to remain complicit in corruption , or resigning themselves to its inevitability . 
This attitude is exemplified in the proliferation of trials , investigations , demonstrations , convictions , and resignations relating to corruption , particularly in Brazil and Venezuela , and to a lesser extent Mexico and Guatemala . 
In all four countries , major scandals have erupted , with high-level government officials and business leaders being denounced by the media , the justice system , foreign governments , and / or the local opposition . 
Though none of the governments implicated in the scandals will collapse - at least not exclusively because of corruption - the sheer scale of the social and political protest , not to mention legal action , is astonishing . 
The most shocking story has unfolded in Brazil . 
Late last year - at a time when discontent was already widespread , with protests against excesses and abuses in the preparations for last year &apos;s World Cup having erupted in 2013 - the so-called petrolâo scandal hit . 
Huge sums of money , it was revealed , had been transferred directly , or via immense construction companies , from Brazil &apos;s state oil company Petrobras to President Dilma Rousseff &apos;s Workers &quot; Party . 
Whistle-blowers and protected witnesses provided details of the graft to Brazilian judges , who pursued Petrobras officials , politicians , and the CEOs of the corporations under investigation . 
Both Rousseff and her predecessor , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , have been accused of graft and influence-peddling . 
Though Rousseff managed to hold onto power in the December election , which she won by a small margin , there is no denying that political crisis has engulfed Brazil , plunging the country into a deep recession . 
In Venezuela , accusations leaked by the United States government suggested that many of the country &apos;s leaders - including Diosdado Cabello , the head of Congress and President Nicolás Maduro &apos;s closest aid - had not only enriched themselves , but did so partly through links with Colombian drug cartels . 
With Venezuela &apos;s economy deteriorating sharply , and violence and human-rights violations proliferating , Maduro has been forced to call elections for this coming December . 
Polls indicate that , despite a rigged electoral system , his party will suffer serious setbacks . 
He may even lose his majority in Congress . 
Guatemala &apos;s situation is not as dramatic , economically speaking , but there is enormous pressure on President Otto Pérez Molina to resign , as corruption accusations fuel mass street demonstrations . 
Indeed , although Pérez Molina survived an impeachment motion this June , he may well not end up serving out his term , which ends next year . 
Mexico &apos;s situation is more complex . 
The country has long had an unparalleled reputation for corruption . 
But , since the late 1990s - and especially after 2000 , when the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , which had ruled for 70 years , was swept from power - Mexico has made significant inroads in combating the practice , at least at the federal level . 
While some feared that , when PRI returned to power in 2012 , they would bring their corrupt old ways , others believed that President Enrique Peña Nieto was different . 
And , in some ways , the optimists were right ; over the last three years , Peña Nieto has undertaken important , path-breaking reforms . 
But , when it came to corruption , they turned out to be very wrong - a fact that became apparent last year , when local and international media uncovered a raft of corrupt activities , from awarding contracts to friends to purchasing houses from the same friends at below market prices . 
In the wake of the revelations , Peña Nieto &apos;s popularity plummeted . 
Though his party managed to hold onto its majority in the lower house of congress , it received only 29 % of the vote , its lowest share ever . 
Calls for the president &apos;s resignation have foundered , but the near-unanimous conclusion is that this government is Mexico &apos;s most corrupt since the late 1980s . 
Many other Latin American countries are in similar situations . 
In Chile , Michelle Bachelet is facing the most important political crisis of her presidency , and perhaps since the return of democracy in 1989 . 
It began with accusations of influence-peddling against Bachelet &apos;s son and daughter-in-law , and continued with the emergence of other scandals , possibly involving cabinet ministers and other aides . 
Bachelet tried to show voters she was taking the issue seriously , requesting the resignation of the entire government ( though several key aides were either re-appointed or shuffled into new posts ) . 
In any case , her popularity ratings have dropped to remarkably low levels . 
As Argentina &apos;s presidential campaign heats up , charges - well-founded or not - will be leveled against outgoing President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , whose net wealth surged over the 13 years she and her late husband ruled the country . 
Similarly , Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega &apos;s proposal to build an inter-oceanic canal in his country ( with a shady Chinese businessman supposedly footing the massive bill , which could amount to anywhere between $ 55 billion and $ 100 billion ) is largely believed - though without proof - to be a money-making scheme for his family . 
Clearly , Latin America &apos;s immense strides in consolidating democracy over the last 30 years have done little to eradicate one of its longest-standing scourges . 
But it now has a renewed source of hope : its burgeoning middle classes , the product of 15 years of impressive economic and social progress . 
These new middle classes are demanding better governance , and they will not rest until they get it .
