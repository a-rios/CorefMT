Donor Funds are Needed for Poverty , Not Iraq 
America wants the world to pledge billions of dollars to Iraq &apos;s reconstruction at a donor &apos;s meeting to be held in October in Madrid . 
The world &apos;s answer should be an unequivocal &quot; No ! &quot; 
Iraq &apos;s long-term reconstruction does not need foreign financial assistance . 
What it needs is a political settlement , and that will be possible only with the withdrawal of America &apos;s occupying army . 
The billions of dollars that the US seeks should be directed towards true global emergencies , such as the fight against AIDS and hunger . 
The Bush Administration probably launched its war against Iraq because it intended to make the country a new base for long-term military operations in the Gulf region . 
After the terrorist attacks on the US of September 2001 , it wanted to withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia , and it presumably chose Iraq as its new long-term base of operation . 
This , I believe , is why America is so opposed to a quick transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis . 
A truly sovereign Iraq might well tell the US to withdraw from the country . 
As long as America remains an occupying force in Iraq , political stability there is unlikely . 
Without political stability , Iraq &apos;s economic recovery is unlikely , too . 
The US is seen by many Iraqis as a colonial occupier , and is therefore the target of attack not only by loyalists of Saddam Hussein , but by Iraqi nationalists of various sorts , as well as by Arab fighters from neighboring countries . 
The attacks against the US occupation are destroying the Iraqi economy as well as lives . 
The attackers have successfully stopped the flow of a large part of Iraq &apos;s oil exports . 
The oil pipeline in the north to Turkey has been repeatedly bombed , and functions sporadically if at all . 
The oil fields in the South do not have enough electricity to operate at capacity because the power grid is also the target of repeated bombings . 
Indeed , Iraq is reportedly pumping 1-2 million barrels of oil a day rather than the 2-3 million barrels that the country could quickly achieve in peaceful circumstances . 
This shortfall in oil earnings , not the lack of foreign assistance , is the real cause of Iraq &apos;s financial crisis . 
Each reduction of one million barrels per day translates into lost revenues of around $ 30 million per day at today &apos;s world market price of $ 30 per barrel . 
This implies that if Iraq increased its oil exports by one million barrels a day - which it could quickly achieve with a cessation of attacks on its infrastructure - it would have around $ 10 billion per year in additional revenues to begin reconstruction . 
Iraq &apos;s oil production could probably rise to around five million barrels per day within three years . 
At that level of production , Iraq would be a middle-income country , with a gross national product per person of several thousand dollars per year , including non-oil production . 
In short , Iraq would not need official development assistance at all . 
The biggest costs in Iraq are not for reconstruction but for US troops . 
America is paying an astounding $ 51 billion per year to station 140,000 troops in the country , a staggering cost of around $ 360,000 per soldier per year . 
The US could save itself tens of billions of dollars per year by withdrawing its troops from Iraq . 
If the US were then to give just a fraction of the financial saving to Iraq in 2004 , there would be plenty of incremental revenues to run the Iraqi Government and to support the recovery of oil production . 
In addition to the shocking waste of lives and money from the Iraq war , America has done the world another great disservice . 
By focusing global attention on an economic crisis that does not really exist , it has diverted public attention from serious crises that do . 
The world would stand up and cheer if the US called upon the October donor meeting to address truly life-and-death issues like the battle against AIDS and hunger . 
Consider the battle against AIDS , TB , and malaria . 
Around eight million impoverished people will die of these three preventable and treatable diseases in 2004 . 
In 2001 , the world created a Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria . 
Yet for fiscal year 2004 , the Bush Administration is committing $ 71 billion to Iraq and just $ 200 million for the Global Fund . 
For every dollar that it is giving to the Global Fund , the Bush Administration is committing $ 350 to Iraq . 
These are grotesquely distorted priorities . 
Worse , the US is encouraging other donor countries to misspend as well . 
It &apos;s time for the world to tell America some hard news . 
Other countries won &apos;t pay for America &apos;s occupation of Iraq . 
The US has to make clear that it plans to withdraw its troops quickly and entirely . 
Moreover , the US should stop wasting so much money on military spending and redirect its efforts towards the world &apos;s poorest people . 
That &apos;s a financial effort that the world can and should join .
