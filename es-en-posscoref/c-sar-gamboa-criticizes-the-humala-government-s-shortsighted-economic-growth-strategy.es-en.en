Peru &apos;s Self-Sabotage 
SAN MARCOS - You may know Peru as the cradle of Incan civilization . 
But Peru boasts another impressive characteristic : it is among Latin America &apos;s fastest-growing economies , with GDP up by 4.8 % year on year in the first quarter of 2014 . 
Peru &apos;s long-term prosperity , however , is far from certain . 
In fact , Peru &apos;s economic growth - which is based largely on exports of raw materials and hydrocarbons - is already slowing , from annual rates of 5.5-6.9 % over the last three years . 
And , though the government recognizes the need for growth-enhancing reform , its approach is all wrong . 
Specifically , President Ollanta Humala recently won legislative approval of a set of &quot; realistic &quot; procedures to reduce the red tape perceived to be hampering investment in the extractive industries - the very industries on which the economy should become less dependent . 
The new law seriously weakens Peru &apos;s ability to regulate land use , set environmental quality standards , and rein in corporate misconduct through environmental-impact assessments . 
The Peruvian government now has a serious problem . 
Beyond diminishing Peru &apos;s international credibility as a &quot; climate champion &quot; - an image that some members of the government have been attempting to cultivate - the law jeopardizes Peru &apos;s natural environment and economic-growth prospects . 
Peru &apos;s government has not just failed to do what is needed ; it has actively worked against its country &apos;s long-term interests . 
At a time when countries should be regulating land use more strictly , Humala &apos;s &quot; reform &quot; eliminates zoning restrictions . 
Moreover , under the new law , subnational governments will no longer be able to limit investments on environmental grounds - decisions that were guided by strict technical standards and highly trained experts . 
Instead , a national authority - that is , a political body - will call the shots . 
All of this makes Peru more vulnerable to corporate misconduct that results in environmental damage . 
As if that were not enough , the new law , in a reversal of previous legislation , could lead to reduced sentences for offenders , and even allow them to operate with impunity for three years . 
This is good news for mining , oil , and gas companies eyeing rich reserves under the Amazon rain forest and the Pacific shelf . 
But , for indigenous communities , it will open a new chapter of dispossession , poverty , and strife ; and , for all Peruvians , it amounts to a massive missed opportunity to put the country on a more sustainable development path . 
The problem is not the government &apos;s efforts to support businesses ; measures to bolster business growth and development would be critical to any economic-reform plan . 
But allowing companies with poor environmental records to operate with impunity is no solution . 
A country where legislation is tailor-made to benefit a few , at the expense of the public interest , cannot achieve long-term inclusive prosperity - and is likely to experience social instability . 
The new law is not the only problematic policy that Peru &apos;s government has pursued . 
Last month , the Congress also moved to weaken the government &apos;s environmental oversight , claiming that this would add 1.5-3 % to the economy &apos;s growth rate . 
The government pushed the proposal through in a little more than two weeks , with only token public consultation and no time for reasoned public debate . 
Given strong opposition from civil-society groups , political parties , the United Nations , and even some business interests , the government &apos;s behavior was both understandable and inexcusable . 
In fact , more than 100 organizations rejected the package before it was approved , while calling for higher environmental standards and stricter enforcement . 
They recognize that what Peru urgently needs is a new , future-oriented economic vision , focused on reducing its reliance on the extractive industries , whose days are numbered . 
&quot; Green &quot; investment - which , as the World Bank recently proved using robust economic modeling , does not constrain economic growth - is a good place to start . 
In September , Humala will go to New York to outline Peru &apos;s &quot; bold and ambitious &quot; actions to head-off the global climate crisis . 
In December , Peru will host the next round of UN climate negotiations , with governments from around the world gathering in Lima to pursue a comprehensive agreement that supports a transition from environmentally devastating fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions . 
Peru &apos;s recent actions have severely undercut its ability to act as a global climate leader , to everyone &apos;s detriment . 
Only with a new strategy based on economic diversification and investment in renewable energy can Peru achieve stable , inclusive , long-term prosperity - and make a real contribution to mitigating climate change .
