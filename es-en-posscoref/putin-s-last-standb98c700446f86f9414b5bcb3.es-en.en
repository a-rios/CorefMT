Putin \ u0027s Last Standb98c700446f86f9414b5bcb3 
Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin was incredibly successful in achieving his goals during his first term . 
He strengthened the power of the federal government , while defeating big business , free media , the communist party , the liberal parties and civil society . 
Within government , he squezzed regional governors , both chambers of parliament and even the government apparatus , concentrating all legislative , executive and judicial power in himself . 
Meanwhile , solid macroeconomic stability and steady growth of 6.5 % a year were attained . 
Alas , Putin &apos;s success may lead to his downfall . 
He was fortunate during his first term because he recognized limits to his power . 
An avid reader of opinion polls , he tried enigmatically to be everything to all voters . 
Now , he seems to think himself free of constraint , but no politician is that lucky . 
Putin is violating too many rules of politics , and just cannot stop . 
Putin is too jealous of power to delegate . 
Because he wants to make all decisions , he replaced a strong prime minister and chief of staff with two men unable to make decisions . 
So rather than creating a strong vertical command , he paralyzed his government . 
One reason for this extreme overcentralization is that Putin does not trust anyone . 
Another reason is his preoccupation with secrecy . 
A true secret policeman , he relies on his circle of KGB men from St. Petersburg . 
His power base shrinks by the day , and his strangling of independent information makes him increasingly ill-informed . 
The consequences were apparent in the school hostage drama in Beslan in North Ossetia . 
Law enforcement failed the population . 
It possessed no relevant intelligence . 
Policemen accepted bribes to let the terrorists though . 
Russia &apos;s best special forces were sent to Beslan , but they were not given ammunition , body armor , battle plans , or operative command . 
The school was never cordoned off . 
In the end , local Ossetians stormed the school with their own guns and killed several special troops in contempt . 
Incredibly , the Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) and the Minister of Interior arrived in Beslan soon after the siege started , but hid doing nothing . 
Similarly , the two regional governors concerned refused to go to Beslan . 
In fact , nobody from the government did anything . 
Putin and his government simply ignored the Beslan crisis , minimizing news coverage about it . 
Official statements came from a junior local official , who made himself a fool through gross lies . 
It is difficult to imagine a worse government performance . 
In his time , Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev was ridiculed for only being interested in concealing bad news and not wanting to remedy problems . 
Putin now acts just like that . 
The conclusions from the Beslan drama are obvious . 
Chechen policy must be revisited . 
The security forces should be cleansed and disciplined . 
Impotent ministers and governors should be sacked , while their offices should be given more authority . 
More open information flows and fewer KGB appointees are needed . 
Putin , however , wants nothing of the kind . 
He does not obey the elementary rule that when in a hole , you stop digging . 
None of the culprits has been sacked , while the editor of Izvestiya was sacked as a punishment for accurate reporting . 
Nothing is done against the rampant corruption of the FSB . 
Rather than give governors more authority , he demanded to appoint them himself . 
Instead of strengthening the government , he deprived it of his one of his best men , Dmitri Kozak , and appointed another unknown KGB man from St. Petersburg in his place . 
Putin &apos;s rule is not only authoritarian ; it is dysfunctional . 
It is too rigid and centralized to handle crises . 
Rather than address actual problems , Putin pursues his personal authoritarian agenda . 
This centralized police state is interested in little but its own economic and political power . 
It is difficult to escape the impression that Putin is more interested in pampering his KGB men than fighting terrorism . 
Because liberal economic reforms harm their interests , such reforms have been abandoned . 
Ordinary Russians are not blind . 
They ask : &quot; How can the appointment of governors be a means of fighting terrorism ? &quot; 
Putin is swiftly eroding the great authority he built up during his first term . 
This process can destabilize Russia faster than anybody now realizes . 
The question is no longer whether Putin will really leave office when his term ends in 2008 , but whether he will be able to save himself that long . 
He can probably do so , but will need to undertake a complete U-turn . 
A return to democracy , regional self-government and free media are other requirements . 
He must also settle the Yukos affair and change his Chechen policy . 
Putin has the power to do so , but hardly the mindset .
