Bush &apos;s Latest Blunder 
The Bush administration is once again committing a major policy blunder in the Middle East by actively supporting the Israeli government in its refusal to recognize a Palestinian unity government that includes Hamas . 
This precludes any progress toward a peace settlement at a time when progress on the Palestinian problem could help avert conflagration in the greater Middle East . 
The US and Israel seek to deal only with the president of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas . 
This is a hopeless strategy , because Hamas would boycott early elections , and even if their outcome would result in Hamas &apos;s exclusion from the government , no peace agreement would hold without Hamas support . 
Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia is pursing a different path . 
In a February summit in Mecca between Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal , the Saudi government worked out an agreement between Hamas and Fatah , which have been clashing violently , to form a national unity government . 
According to the Mecca accord , Hamas agreed &quot; to respect international resolutions and the agreements &#91; with Israel &#93; signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization , &quot; including the Oslo Accords . 
The Saudis view this accord as the prelude to the offer of a peace settlement with Israel , to be guaranteed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries . 
But no progress is possible as long as the Bush administration and Ehud Olmert &apos;s Israeli government persist in refusing to recognize a unity government that includes Hamas . 
Many of the causes of the current impasse go back to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip unilaterally , without negotiating with the then-Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority . 
Then Israel , with strong US backing , refused to recognize the democratically elected Hamas government and withheld payment of the millions in taxes collected by the Israelis on its behalf . 
But it did not reduce support for Hamas among Palestinians , and it reinforced the position of Islamic and other extremists who oppose negotiations with Israel . 
The situation deteriorated to the point where Palestine no longer had an authority with whom Israel could negotiate . 
This is a blunder , because Hamas is not monolithic . 
Its inner structure is little known to outsiders , but , according to some reports , it has a military wing , largely directed from Damascus and beholden to its Syrian and Iranian sponsors , and a political wing that is more responsive to the needs of the Palestinian population that elected it . 
If Israel had accepted the results of the election , that might have strengthened the more moderate political wing . 
Unfortunately , the ideology of the &quot; war on terror &quot; does not permit such subtle distinctions . 
Nevertheless , subsequent events provided some ground for believing that Hamas has been divided between its different tendencies . 
No sooner had Hamas agreed to enter into a government of national unity than the military wing engineered the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier , which prevented such a government from being formed by provoking a heavy-handed Israeli military response . 
Hezbollah then used the opportunity to stage an incursion from Lebanon , kidnapping several more Israeli soldiers . 
Despite a disproportionate response by Israel , Hezbollah was able to stand its ground , gaining the admiration of the Arab masses , whether Sunni or Shia . 
It was this dangerous state of affairs - including the breakdown of government 
Defenders of the current policy argue that Israel cannot afford to negotiate from a position of weakness . 
But Israel &apos;s position is unlikely to improve as long as it pursues its current course . 
Military escalation - not just an eye for an eye but roughly ten Palestinian lives for every Israeli one - has reached its limit . 
After the Israel Defense Forces &quot; retaliation against Lebanon &apos;s road system , airport , and other infrastructure one must wonder what could be the next step for the Israeli forces . 
Iran poses a more potent danger to Israel than either Hamas or Hezbollah , which are Iran &apos;s clients . 
There is the growing danger of a regional conflagration in which Israel and the US could well be on the losing side . 
With the ability of Hezbollah to withstand the Israeli onslaught and the rise of Iran as a prospective nuclear power , Israel &apos;s existence is more endangered than at any time since its birth . 
Both Israel and the United States seem to be frozen in their unwillingness to negotiate with a Palestinian Authority that includes Hamas . 
The sticking point is Hamas &apos;s unwillingness to recognize the existence of Israel ; but that could be made a condition for an eventual settlement rather than a precondition for negotiations . 
Merely demonstrating military superiority is not sufficient as a policy for dealing with the Palestinian problem . 
There is now the chance for a political solution with Hamas brought on board by Saudi Arabia . 
It would be tragic to miss out on that prospect because the Bush administration is mired in the ideology of the War on Terror .
