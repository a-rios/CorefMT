When are Public Services Successful ? 
How do we judge the quality of public services ? 
That question is far trickier than it appears . 
In some cases the answer seems simple enough : whether trains run on time . 
But is this really all we want from our trains ? 
Surely not . 
They should be safe , too , and reasonably comfortable . 
They should run not only on time , but at the right time and at reasonable intervals . 
More important still , they should be affordable . 
As the list of criteria grows longer , it becomes evident that the most easily measured component , punctuality , is but one of many desirable features , and not necessarily the most significant . 
This example is relevant for the politics of public services , which dominates debate in many countries because it lies at the heart of the big problems of both government budgets ( and cutting them back ) and taxes ( and their reduction ) . 
In keeping with the spirit of the times , governments introduce business criteria for measuring the efficiency - and the &quot; success , &quot; more generally - of public services . 
This means , above all , that they set performance targets . 
So ministers proclaim that street crime will be halved by next spring , or that the proportion of each generation going to universities will be raised to 50 % in five years . 
Waiting lists for hospital beds will be cut by one-third within two years . 
This method of governance makes it appear that , at long last , we can hold politicians accountable by establishing whether targets have been reached or not . 
But is this what we really want ? 
The examples just given are taken from real life . 
In real life , however , performance targets also have curious side effects . 
Cutting hospital waiting lists has led doctors to treat minor illnesses more quickly , leaving those with more serious conditions off the lists altogether . 
The rapid increase in university students has led to declines in admission standards and the quality of final degrees . 
Reducing street crime encouraged the police to stop registering certain offenses altogether . 
In short , because the availability of government support depends on achieving seemingly precise targets , the incentive to aim for apparent rather than real success becomes an almost overwhelming temptation . 
Moreover , many public services are so-called &quot; soft services . &quot; 
Hospital care entails much more than a well-functioning conveyor belt for surgical operations . 
Education is in all cases about more than achieving a certain &quot; throughput . &quot; 
Social services generally need time , not least the time of caregivers , and their time is often required in unpredictable bursts - a fact utterly at odds with target-mania . 
Obviously , public money must not be wasted . 
But , even here , questions arise . 
Consider publicly-funded scientific research . 
It is in the nature of such research that it proceeds by trial and error . 
For every road to new discoveries , there will be several negative results and cul-de-sacs . 
If only highly targeted research with guaranteed success is funded , the probability must be high that innovative researchers emigrate to countries or institutions that have a more generous and appropriate approach to the relationship between funding and success . 
While all this may be true , the question remains : how do we make sure that public services are run with reasonable efficiency and produce the results intended by governments and expected by taxpayers ? 
One answer has to do with input rather than outcomes - that is , with the quality and ethos of those running our public services and working in them . 
Here the business analogy is simply not sufficient . 
The old French administrative training for public services taught both relevant skills and an ethos of civic commitment . 
The old civil service in countries like Britain or Germany embraced an approach to their tasks that made it a matter of honor to perform well . 
Self-interest and charity are not the only human motivations ; there is also the motive of service , and it needs to be cultivated . 
At the other end - that of results - some targets do make sense . 
Trains should run on time . 
But beyond that is the human judgment of those most affected . 
This is why parents &apos; councils for schools , or committees of users of public transport , or patients &apos; boards for hospitals are crucial . 
Such bodies may seem weak at first sight . 
They may even be regarded as a nuisance by professionals . 
In fact , however , they provide an invaluable check on sloppy and inefficient providers of public services . 
We must beware of overly business-guided approaches to public service . 
At certain times and in certain countries , services that need not be public had to be privatized and run along business lines in order to make them run better - or to keep them running at all . 
But core public services in health , education , transport , and a few other areas will forever be just that , services , and will therefore need to be appreciated in more complex ways than meeting measurable targets .
