The Liars &quot; Last Reunion 
Next week &apos;s G-8 summit will probably be the last such meeting for Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin . 
Seven years ago , at their first meeting in Ljubljana , Slovenia , Bush looked into Putin &apos;s eyes and somehow spotted the soul of a Christian gentleman , not that of a secret policeman . 
Next week , they shouldn &apos;t be surprised if they see a mirror of each other , because both men have exemplified the arrogance of power . 
Bush and Putin both came to power in 2000 , a year when their countries were scrambling to regain international respect , Russia from the chaos of the Yeltsin years and the US from the failed impeachment of President Clinton . 
Each country thought it was getting an unthreatening mediocrity . 
But both men , on finding themselves in positions of authority , ruled from their default positions : Bush as an evangelical convinced that God was on America &apos;s side , and Putin as a KGB graduate convinced that all power comes from intimidation and threats . 
And what was the result ? 
Convinced that he is right , and incurious to hear contrary arguments , Bush felt free to undermine the rule of law in America with warrantless domestic surveillance , erosion of due process , and defense of torture , in addition to misleading the public and refusing to heed expert advice or recognize facts on the ground . 
From the tax cuts in 2001 to the war in Iraq , Bush &apos;s self-righteous certitude led him to believe that he could say and do anything to get his way . 
The damage Bush &apos;s self-confidence and self-delusion has inflicted was magnified by his gross overestimation of America &apos;s power . 
Quite simply , he thought that America could go it alone in pursuing his foreign policy because no one could stop him . 
While his father lined up world support , and troops from over a dozen countries , for the first Gulf War , the son thought that allies were more hindrance than help ; except for Tony Blair , he did not care to have them . 
Four years later , Bush &apos;s arrogance and mendacity have been exposed for the entire world , including the American public , to see . 
Putin also succumbed to the same arrogance of power . 
Buoyed by high oil prices , he now seeks to bestride the world as if the social calamities that bedevil Russia - a collapsing population , a spiraling AIDS and tuberculosis crisis , corruption mushrooming to levels unimagined by Yeltsin - do not matter . 
At a high-level security meeting in Munich this past February , Putin , who usually draws on the secretive , manipulative , and confrontational Cold War paradigm of what constitutes Russian diplomatic behavior , lashed out at the United States with the sort of language unheard of since Khrushchev said &quot; We will bury you . &quot; 
American actions were &quot; unilateral , &quot; &quot; illegitimate , &quot; and had forged a &quot; hotbed of further conflicts . &quot; 
Putin &apos;s assessment of US unilateralism ( if stripped of its overheated rhetoric ) may be correct ; the trouble is that he lacks credibility to extol moderation in foreign policy . 
High oil prices have helped him rebuild and centralize the &quot; strong state &quot; that was his goal from the outset of his presidency . 
But his recent attempts to use Russia &apos;s energy resources for political coercion in Georgia , Ukraine , Belarus and elsewhere have exposed Russia as an unreliable partner , unnerving even the Chinese , who do not wish to see a reconstituted Russian empire on their border . 
The Russian public , habituated to authoritarianism , wants Russia &apos;s rulers to be firm . 
Yet the true test of a ruler is not to pander to his people &apos;s expectations , but to peer into the future and match the country &apos;s aspirations with its needs and capacities . 
In this , Putin &apos;s arrogance is failing Russia miserably . 
His monomaniacal drive to centralize power is driving out the very expertise that the country needs to flourish . 
Shell and BP are being expelled from the oil industry at the very moment that Russian oil production is declining dramatically . 
His embittered attempts to counter American power are equally short-sighted : helping Iran develop its nuclear program and selling high-tech weapons to China are hardly in Russia &apos;s long-term strategic interest . 
As usual , history is set on fast-forward in America . 
Everyone can now see the gross and historic failures of the Bush presidency . 
Indeed , the American people have preempted the historians , rebuking Bush by electing a Democratic Congress in November 2006 . 
Meanwhile , Russia &apos;s troubles remain hidden behind the strong arm tactics and oil bloated coffers of Putin &apos;s autocratic bureaucracy . 
But the fact that Russia &apos;s social and economic diseases are going unaddressed has consigned the country to the long-term decline that his presidency was supposed to reverse . 
In the twentieth century , the Cold War parity between Russia and America was apparent . 
For Russians , America was an evil empire , the world of capitalist exploitation and a nuclear superpower , but also a cradle of economic prosperity and individual freedom . 
For America , Russia , too , was an evil empire , the world of communist expansionism and a nuclear superpower , but also a cradle of science , spirit , and soul . 
A similar parity characterized the Bush-Putin era . 
Unlike America , however , Russia &apos;s people have not yet understood the price of arrogant power run amuck .
