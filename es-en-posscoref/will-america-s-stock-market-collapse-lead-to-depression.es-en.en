Will America \ u0027s Stock Market Collapse Lead to Depression ? 
The billions of people in the world who don &apos;t invest in the US stock market have one big concern about America &apos;s plunging stock prices . 
Will the puncturing of the stock market boom incite a crumbling of the US economy , one that will spread to the rest of the world ? 
That question is vital , because many financial bubbles have , indeed , been followed by a collapse of output and employment . 
We can only guess at the answer , but my guess is that the US will escape with only a modest slowdown . 
My optimism may seem misplaced in a period when the stock market falls nearly every day , and when other countries have historically seen stock market collapses incite economic collapses as well . 
It also seems misplaced given America &apos;s weak economic leadership . 
President Bush recklessly put a tax cut for the rich above all other economic concerns . 
He is a protectionist , not a free trader . 
Now both President Bush and Vice President Cheney are under scrutiny for possible corporate misdeeds while they were in business . 
So why am I moderately optimistic ? 
Examining the links between the stock market and the rest of the economy may explain this . 
During a stock market boom , when share prices are bid up high by strong investor confidence , the stock market helps create an overall economic boom . 
Consumers who own stocks feel richer , so they buy more . 
These same consumers borrow money on the basis of their stock market wealth , in order to buy new homes , cars , and other expensive items . 
Moreover , companies find it easy to borrow or raise new equity for capital investments , thereby creating a boom in business investments . 
Banks lend on easy terms to households and businesses that own high-valued stocks , believing that stock market wealth is good collateral . 
To secure a &quot; piece of the action , &quot; foreign investors pour money in . 
When a stock market boom ends , and prices collapse , these patterns reverse . 
Consumption and investment fall . 
Foreign investors flee . 
Bank loans are tightened . 
These factors add up to an economic slowdown . 
It is likely that the US will now experience some measure of slowdown , as occurred in the mild recession of the past two years . 
But two forces can turn a mild slowdown into a severe recession or even depression : 
stock market decline can lead to a full-fledged banking crisis , as occurred in Japan , Mexico , and most recently Argentina . 
Banks may find that they can &apos;t get repaid during a stock market bust . 
Banks may then face bankruptcy , and thus severely restrict new lending . 
In extreme cases , bank depositors fear for the safety of their deposits , and flee from the banks . 
Such depositor panic adds to the banking crisis ; foreign investors may suddenly flee , as visions of easy wealth turn into financial panic . 
Suddenly the country is thrown into a balance of payments crisis , in which it cannot service its foreign debts . 
This disrupts trade and production . 
My moderate optimism comes from my belief that the US will avoid both a banking crisis and a balance of payments crisis . 
Some American banks are likely to report large losses as a result of the stock market collapse . 
Yes , it is possible that the US dollar will keep losing value . 
But neither is likely to turn into a full-fledged crisis . 
US banks still appear strong - well capitalized , reasonably well supervised , and with only moderate levels of non-performing loans . 
As for debts owed to foreign creditors , the good news is that America owes money to them in US dollars rather than another currency . 
The US won &apos;t &quot; run out of dollars &quot; to service its foreign debts , in the same way that Argentina or Korea ran out of dollars needed to repay foreign creditors during the past decade . 
The dollar may therefore lose value as investors flee the US , but probably without provoking a more serious crisis . 
Remember too that the United States can use expansionary monetary policy to offset , at least in part , any slowdown that arises . 
The Federal Reserve can continue to cut interest rates , if necessary . 
These interest rate cuts probably can &apos;t stop a slowdown from occurring , but they can help to ensure against a full economic collapse . 
History &apos;s most famous stock market crash followed by an economic collapse began in 1929 . 
America &apos;s stock market plunged in October 1929 , and the US and much of the world then fell into a Great Depression . 
But that famous and disastrous era demonstrates the principles that I am stressing today . 
The key reason for the Great Depression of the 1930s was not stock market decline , but the collapse of America &apos;s banking system that took place during 1930-33 . 
Since there was no deposit insurance in the US at that time , bank depositors panicked when some banks began to fail . 
That panic incited a widespread banking failure . 
Moreover , the Federal Reserve did not feel free to expand the money supply at the time because the US adhered to the gold standard . 
My moderate optimism should not disguise my unhappiness at America &apos;s poor economic management . 
The Bush Administration &apos;s reckless tax cuts and protectionist trade policies should be reversed . 
Corporate abuses need to be exposed and punished . 
But in the end , the US economy is productive and flexible and highly innovative , and is likely strong enough to withstand the irresponsible public and private economic management of recent years .
