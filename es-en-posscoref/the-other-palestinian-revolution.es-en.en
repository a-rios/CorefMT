The Other Palestinian Revolution 
The euphoria that has , for over a week , greeted Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s election as President of the Palestinian Authority was perhaps justified . 
Such an assessment requires acknowledging that the election was far from flawless : Hamas and Islamic Jihad boycotted the poll , and Marwan Barghouti , a fellow Fatah member with Abbas and the one candidate who could seriously have challenged him , was ungently persuaded by the movement &apos;s leadership to withdraw his candidacy in order to present a unified front . 
Moreover , Abbas ( also known as Abu Mazen ) succeeded in getting the dozen or so Palestinian security services and militias under his control . 
Yet the fact remains that after decades of Yasir Arafat &apos;s autocratic rule , and despite the obvious constraints of continued Israeli occupation , the Palestinians did elect a leader in a relatively free and competitive election . 
For years , Arafat avoided holding elections , as required by the laws of the Palestinian Authority , under the pretense that they cannot be held under occupation : but , lo and behold , two months after his demise , an election was held - and with resounding success . 
The presidential election will obviously serve as a catalyst for renewed , and possibly more successful , negotiations with Israel . 
Abbas will now bask in the glow of having been elected . 
Nothing like this has happened in any Arab country . 
Indeed , Abbas is now the only Arab leader who came to power in a more or less free election . 
Is Palestinian society so different from other Arab societies ? 
Not really . 
But there were several unique factors in the Palestinian context . 
First , there was strong external pressure : confronted and exasperated by Arafat &apos;s deviousness and autocratic style , the United States and the European Union clearly told the Palestinians that any future support for their quest for independence would depend on their going through a reasonably acceptable democratic process . 
Second , most Palestinians perceived that their ability to go through such a democratic process was itself a significant step in their struggle against Israel . 
Finally , Palestinians have been exposed not only to the obvious hardships of occupation while living under Israeli rule for the better part of four decades ; they were also able to experience , at close range , a liberal democracy at work - a free press , an independent judiciary , and political pluralism . 
The dialectic of occupation plays strange games , both with occupier and occupied . 
The Palestinian elections were seen all over the Arab world on Al-Jazeera and other Arab TV channels . 
They must have focused people &apos;s minds on their own stunted political conditions . 
If the Palestinians , under Israeli occupation , can choose their own leaders , why can &apos;t the same happen in Cairo or Damascus , in Ryadh or Algiers ? 
When the jubilation and the justly earned compliments for the Palestinians subside , both Arab rulers and Arab masses ( the much hyped &quot; Arab street &quot; ) may start asking some hard questions . 
The Palestinians have shown that it is not true that an Arab society cannot progress towards representative institutions . 
So why can &apos;t this progress be emulated in other Arab societies ? 
Perhaps a time bomb has been planted under the thrones of Arab potentates - kings , emirs and presidents . 
While Iraq - an attempt to import democracy by force - is failing , the paradoxical conditions of an Arab democracy under Israeli occupation may be a threat that Arab rulers have not yet comprehended .
