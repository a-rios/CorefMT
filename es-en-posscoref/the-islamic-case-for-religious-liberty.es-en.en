The Islamic Case for Religious Liberty 
ANKARA - Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of the Orthodox Church recently said on American TV that he feels &quot; crucified &quot; in Turkey , upsetting many Turks . Sadly , his Holiness is right . Yet his complaint is not with Islam but with the secular Turkish Republic . 
The Turkish state has kept the Halki Seminary , the only institution able to train Orthodox priests , closed since 1971 . 
Even the Patriarch &apos;s title &quot; ecumenical &quot; is lashed out at by some Turkish authorities and their nationalist supporters . 
Every year , international reports on religious freedom point to such pressures on the Patriarchate with concern , and they are right to do so . But why does Turkey do all this ? 
What is the source of the problem ? 
Things were better long ago . 
The first Turkish ruler to reign over the Ecumenical Patriarchate was Mehmed II , the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453 . 
In line with the Islamic tradition of accepting the &quot; People of the Book , &quot; the young sultan granted amnesty to the patriarchate . 
He also gave the institution many privileges and authorities , no less than that which existed under the Byzantine emperors . 
Armenians and Jews later enjoyed the same autonomies . 
In the 19th century , the non-Muslim peoples of the empire also achieved the rights of equal citizenship with Muslims . 
That &apos;s why the late Ottoman bureaucracy and the Ottoman Parliament included a great number of Greeks , Armenians and Jews - something you never see in republican Turkey . 
The Halki Seminary , opened in 1844 , is a relic from that bygone age of pluralism . 
Nationalism is what destroyed this Pax Ottomana . 
It affected the peoples of the empire one by one , including , towards the end , the Turks . 
Many conflicts took place between the latter and the rest , and the great empire &apos;s colossal collapse left a bitter taste in the mouths of all . 
The Armenians , who suffered the worst tragedy in 1915 , never forgot nor forgave . 
What the Turks remember , however , was the perceived &quot; treason &quot; of the other components of the empire , especially that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate . 
The latter had cheered the Greek armies when they invaded western Anatolia in 1919 . 
From that point on , the Patriarchate , in the eyes of many Turks , became a &quot; fifth column . &quot; 
When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded the Republic in 1923 , he defined the Patriarchate as &quot; a center of perfidy . &quot; 
As an alternative , he promoted a rival &quot; Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate , &quot; which became a bastion of ultra-nationalist ideology . 
( Some members of this artificial &quot; Patriarchate &quot; are currently on trial in the so-called Ergenekon case , a covert network of officers and civilians accused at conspiring to stage a military coup against the current Turkish government . ) 
Over the years , Atatürk &apos;s ideas evolved into an official ideology called &quot; Kemalism , &quot; which had two main pillars : A self-styled secularism that bans anything but &quot; the secular way of life , &quot; and a fierce nationalism that defies anything it deems &quot; non-Turkish . &quot; 
The Ecumenical Patriarchate , as both a religious and &quot; non-Turkish &quot; institution , fits in neither category . 
Hence , throughout the Republican regime , and especially at times of military dominance , it faced official pressure and confiscation of property , as did all other non-Muslim and Muslim religious institutions . 
So part of the problem is the curse of history . 
But you can either trap yourself inside history or take lessons from it and move on . 
To date , unfortunately , Turkey &apos;s nationalists , within both state and society , have opted for the former option . 
If one cause of the repression of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is nationalism , though , the other one is the other pillar of the Kemalist ideology : secularism . 
Turkey &quot; draconian laws on &quot; national education &quot; ban any sort of religious education unless it is strictly controlled by the state . 
The real motive behind this is the regime &apos;s distaste for Islam . 
The Ecumenical Patriarchate , as a foreign observer observes , only receives &quot; collateral damage . &quot; 
A telling manifestation of this was seen recently in a live discussion on CNNTurk , the Turkish counterpart of the international news channel . 
A deputy from the CHP , the staunchly Kemalist People &apos;s Republican Party , Muharrem İnce , who opposed the reopening of the Halki Seminary became angry . 
&quot; Do you know who most wants to open the seminary in this country , &quot; he loudly asked . 
They want this , because they want to open Islamic schools as well . &quot; 
Yes , this is indeed the position increasingly adopted by Turkey &apos;s Islamic opinion leaders - who are striving not for jihad or an &quot; Islamic state , &quot; but just a modest preservation of tradition . 
They realize that religious freedom must be championed for all . 
And they have a good frame of reference in the pluralism of the Ottomans . 
This more liberal approach to non-Muslims can be observed in today &apos;s AKP ( Justice and Development Party ) government , in power since 2002 . 
Although labeled as &quot; Islamist &quot; by its opponents , the AKP has been much more willing to liberalize Turkey than its secular counterparts , most of which are zealously nationalist . The Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom makes this point nicely : 
&quot; In November 2006 , the &#91; AKP dominated &#93; Turkish parliament , as part of the reforms related to possible EU accession , passed a new law governing Lausanne religious minority foundations , easing procedures to establish foundations and allowing non-Turkish citizens in Turkey to open them ... Then President Ahmet Necdet Sezer &#91; a staunch Kemalist &#93; , however , vetoed the legislation . 
In February 2008 , the parliament passed a similar law on the return of property confiscated from non-Muslim minorities ... 
The Ecumenical Patriarch himself acknowledged in a recent interview that the AKP has shown goodwill on this issue . 
His All Holiness also said that the real obstacle is probably &quot; the deep state &quot; - a reference to Turkey &apos;s Kemalist state establishment that considers itself above any elected government and democratic law .
