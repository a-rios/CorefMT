The Great War &apos;s Long Shadow 
BERLIN - This year marks the centennial of the outbreak of World War I , which is reason enough to reflect on what this seminal European catastrophe teaches us today . 
Indeed , the Great War &apos;s consequences for international relations and the global system of states continue to be felt . 
So , have we learned anything from the policy failures of governments , institutions , and international diplomacy that occurred in the summer of 1914 ? 
Large parts of the northern hemisphere continue to struggle with the legacies of the great European empires - Habsburg , Russian , and Ottoman - that collapsed in WWI &apos;s wake , or whose decline , like that of the British Empire , was initiated by the war and sealed by its even bloodier sequel a generation later . 
The resulting fracture zones - in the Balkans and the Middle East , for example - are the source of some of today &apos;s gravest risks to regional and even world peace . 
After the Cold War &apos;s end and the collapse of the Russian Empire &apos;s Soviet successor , war returned to the Balkans under very similar conditions to those that prevailed in the period before 1914 , with aggressive nationalism ultimately reconfiguring the disintegrating Yugoslavia as six separate states . 
Of course , Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , whose call for a &quot; Greater Serbia &quot; triggered the war , was not alone : For a moment , Europe was in danger of reverting to the confrontation of 1914 , with France and the United Kingdom supporting Serbia , and Germany and Austria favoring Croatia . 
Fortunately , there was no relapse , because the West had learned its lessons from historical mistakes . 
Today , three factors loom large in the avoidance of disaster : the United States &quot; military presence in Europe , the progress of European integration , and Europe &apos;s abandonment of great-power politics . 
Yet there is no point in fooling oneself : Only as long as the Balkan countries believe in the European Union and the benefits of membership will today &apos;s precarious peace in the region become permanent . 
No such hope currently exists for the Middle East , whose contemporary political borders were largely established by Britain and France during WWI , when the diplomats Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot negotiated the division of the Ottoman Empire . 
Likewise , the creation of Israel harks back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration , whereby the subsequent British mandatory power in Palestine supported the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people . 
The Middle East created back then is , more or less , the Middle East today . 
Yet we are now witnessing its disintegration , because the Sykes-Picot design always implied a strong external hegemonic power ( or two ) able and willing to maintain stability by channeling ( or suppressing ) the region &apos;s numerous conflicts . 
Great Britain and France , the first hegemonic powers , were succeeded by the US and the Soviet Union - and , finally , by the US alone . 
America &apos;s misadventure in Iraq , its exhaustion as a world power , and its unwillingness to maintain its previous level of commitment to the region have rendered the Sykes-Picot structure untenable , because no other external force for order is available . 
The resulting vacuum has been filled by various currents of political Islam , terrorism , protest movements , uprisings , secession attempts by national or religious minorities , and aspiring regional hegemons ( Iran and Saudi Arabia ) . 
Indeed , the partial withdrawal of the US implies that the end of the enforced stability of the old Middle East will not spare the Sykes-Picot borders . 
Developments in Syria and Iraq already suggest as much , and the future of Lebanon and Jordan has become increasingly uncertain . 
One of the few positive features of the region is that no global power rivalries are currently playing out there . 
But the regional struggle for mastery between Iran and Saudi Arabia ( with Israel as a third actor ) could prove to be all the more dangerous , given the prevailing - and deeply entrenched - mindset of traditional power politics . 
Institutions and traditions supporting cooperative conflict resolution hardly exist in the region . 
The memory of 1914 may trigger the most concern in East Asia , where all the ingredients of a similar disaster have accumulated : nuclear weapons , the rise of China as a global power , unresolved territorial and border disputes , the division of the Korean Peninsula , historical resentments , an obsession with status and prestige , and hardly any cooperative conflict-resolution mechanisms . 
Distrust and power politics are the order of the day . 
And yet there are grounds for optimism in East Asia . 
The world has changed dramatically since the summer of 1914 . 
At the time , the world &apos;s population was two billion ; now it is seven billion . 
This , together with the communications revolution , has created even more interdependencies and has forced more cooperation upon governments - as has the continued presence of the US as a stabilizer in the region , which has proved to be indispensable . 
Moreover , while nuclear weapons pose a continuing danger , they also inhibit the risk of war as a means of power politics by making mutual destruction a certainty . 
Military technology , the mindset of politicians and citizens , the structure of international diplomacy , and much more have changed in the century since WWI erupted . 
And , yes , we have even learned a few things from history , which has made the world safer . 
But , lest we forget : in the summer 1914 , most actors regarded the impending disaster as an impossibility .
