Does Debt Matter ? 
LONDON - Europe is now haunted by the specter of debt . 
All European leaders quail before it . 
To exorcise the demon , they are putting their economies through the wringer . 
It doesn &apos;t seem to be helping . 
Their economies are still tumbling , and the debt continues to grow . 
The credit ratings agency Standard 
Poor &apos;s has just downgraded the sovereign-debt ratings of nine eurozone countries , including France . 
The United Kingdom is likely to follow . 
To anyone not blinded by folly , the explanation for this mass downgrade is obvious . 
If you deliberately aim to shrink your GDP , your debt-to-GDP ratio is bound to grow . 
The only way to cut your debt ( other than by default ) is to get your economy to grow . 
Fear of debt is rooted in human nature ; so the extinction of it as a policy aim seems right to the average citizen . 
Everyone knows what financial debt means : money owed , often borrowed . 
To be in debt can produce anxiety if one is uncertain whether , when the time comes , one will be able to repay what one owes . 
This anxiety is readily transferred to national debt - the debt owed by a government to its creditors . 
How , people ask , will governments repay all of the hundreds of billions of dollars that they owe ? 
As British Prime Minister David Cameron put it : &quot; Government debt is the same as credit-card debt ; it &apos;s got to be paid back . &quot; 
The next step readily follows : in order to repay , or at least reduce , the national debt , the government must eliminate its budget deficit , because the excess of spending over revenue continually adds to the national debt . 
Indeed , if the government fails to act , the national debt will become , in today &apos;s jargon , &quot; unsustainable . &quot; 
Again , an analogy with household debt readily suggests itself . 
My death does not extinguish my debt , reasons the sensible citizen . 
My creditors will have the first claim on my estate - everything that I wanted to leave to my children . 
Similarly , a debt left unpaid too long by a government is a burden on future generations : I may enjoy the benefits of government extravagance , but my children will have to foot the bill . 
That is why deficit reduction is at the center of most governments &quot; fiscal policy today . 
A government with a &quot; credible &quot; plan for &quot; fiscal consolidation &quot; supposedly is less likely to default on its debt , or leave it for the future to pay . 
This will , it is thought , enable the government to borrow money more cheaply than it would otherwise be able to do , in turn lowering interest rates for private borrowers , which should boost economic activity . 
So fiscal consolidation is the royal road to economic recovery . 
This , the official doctrine of most developed countries today , contains at least five major fallacies , which pass largely unnoticed , because the narrative is so plausible . 
First , governments , unlike private individuals , do not have to &quot; repay &quot; their debts . 
A government of a country with its own central bank and its own currency can simply continue to borrow by printing the money which is lent to it . 
This is not true of countries in the eurozone . 
But their governments do not have to repay their debts , either . 
If their ( foreign ) creditors put too much pressure on them , they simply default . 
Default is bad . 
But life after default goes on much as before . 
Second , deliberately cutting the deficit is not the best way for a government to balance its books . 
Deficit reduction in a depressed economy is the road not to recovery , but to contraction , because it means cutting the national income on which the government &apos;s revenues depend . 
This will make it harder , not easier , for it to cut the deficit . 
The British government already must borrow Â£ 112 billion ( $ 172 billion ) more than it had planned when it announced its deficit-reduction plan in June 2010 . 
Third , the national debt is not a net burden on future generations . 
Even if it gives rise to future tax liabilities ( and some of it will ) , these will be transfers from taxpayers to bond holders . 
This may have disagreeable distributional consequences . 
But trying to reduce it now will be a net burden on future generations : income will be lowered immediately , profits will fall , pension funds will be diminished , investment projects will be canceled or postponed , and houses , hospitals , and schools will not be built . 
Future generations will be worse off , having been deprived of assets that they might otherwise have had . 
Fourth , there is no connection between the size of national debt and the price that a government must pay to finance it . 
The interest rates that Japan , the United States , the UK , and Germany pay on their national debt are equally low , despite vast differences in their debt levels and fiscal policies . 
Finally , low borrowing costs for governments do not automatically reduce the cost of capital for the private sector . 
After all , corporate borrowers do not borrow at the &quot; risk-free &quot; yield of , say , US Treasury bonds , and evidence shows that monetary expansion can push down the interest rate on government debt , but have hardly any effect on new bank lending to firms or households . 
In fact , the causality is the reverse : the reason why government interest rates in the UK and elsewhere are so low is that interest rates for private-sector loans are so high . 
As with &quot; the specter of Communism &quot; that haunted Europe in Karl Marx &apos;s famous manifesto , so today &quot; &#91; a &#93; ll the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise &quot; the specter of national debt . 
But statesmen who aim to liquidate the debt should recall another famous specter - the specter of revolution .
