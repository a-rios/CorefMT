The Other Half of the Peace Process 
PRINCETON - American officials usually spend enormous energy highlighting the &quot; process &quot; in the Middle East &quot; peace process . &quot; 
Only in the last 18 months of a second term president or following a military engagement in the Middle East does the United States actually start to concern itself with &quot; peace . &quot; 
This pattern seems to be holding true for next week &apos;s US-sponsored Middle East peace conference in Annapolis , Maryland . 
The difference now is that , unlike the Madrid Conference after the 1991 American-led Gulf War , the current effort is coming after a perceived American defeat in Iraq . 
Assuming that the Bush administration is serious in its current efforts , the US must have a Plan B in case the talks fail . 
For Palestinians , the main concern is to avoid negative repercussions if they do . 
Unlike former President Bill Clinton , who blamed Yassir Arafat for the failure of the Camp David talks in 2000 , the Bush administration must honor its commitment not to point fingers or allow either side to use failure to advance its strategic goals . 
Palestinian negotiators have always had to balance three issues : historic rights , current realities , and the price of using their negative power . 
For Palestinians , the code words for historic rights -liberating Palestinian land , securing the right of return for refugees , and insisting on a truly independent state - are &quot; international legitimacy . &quot; 
For both the PLO and Hamas , this refers to various UN resolutions and international public opinion , which have amounted to little more than lip service on the part of Western powers and Arab and Islamic leaders , whose statements raise false hopes , enticing Palestinian negotiators to harden their positions . 
The current realities that the Palestinians must reckon with include their strategic , political , and economic imbalance vis-Ã -vis Israel and the US , the reality of occupation , and the challenges of diaspora life . 
For example , Israel &apos;s harsh policies to confront the 1987 intifada , coupled with the boycott of the PLO by oil-rich Arab countries ( because of its failure to oppose Saddam Hussein &apos;s occupation of Kuwait ) formed a potent reality check for the Palestinian leadership . 
Finally , Palestinian negotiators must consider the consequences of using their most valuable bargaining chip - the ability to reject a perceived bad deal - in terms of its direct effect on Palestinians and the strong possibility of continued expansion of Jewish settlements on Palestinian lands . 
The late Haider Abdel Shafi repeatedly stated one of the major problems in the Oslo Accords , namely that it didn &apos;t secure the halt of settlement expansion in the interim period or if the final status talks failed . 
At Camp David II , former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak cleverly insisted that the first clause of his offer included acceptance of the end of the conflict , which was a problem for Palestinians , given that historic rights remained unresolved . 
Arafat used his negative power and blocked a settlement , but he couldn &apos;t predict the consequences . 
This time , Palestinian negotiators insist that they do not plan to engage in substantive negotiations . 
They argue that the positions acceptable in Taba ( following the failure of Camp David II ) must be the basis of any agreement , and that what needs to be negotiated now is the timetable for implementation . 
Backed by a reasonable Arab peace plan , they will insist that there is already a worldwide consensus on restoring the 1967 borders ( with mutual adjustments of equal size and quality ) , the need for a fair agreement on dealing with refugees , and a formula to share Jerusalem . 
As a result , Palestinian negotiators have reversed their position on the step-by-step approach to negotiations - an approach that proved disastrous , as it was exploited by radicals on both sides and gave the Israelis time to build more illegal settlements . 
They insist that a broad agreement ( in writing ) must be reached before the talks . 
Fears abound among Palestinians of another spasm of violence if no agreement is reached before Annapolis and this round of talks fails . 
But what is crucially important for Palestinians is that , whatever the outcome , new settlements must not be built and land expropriation must end . 
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that the creation of a Palestinian state is a component of US national security . 
But a Palestinian state will not appear now or in ten years if Israel continues build settlements in areas slated to be part of it .
