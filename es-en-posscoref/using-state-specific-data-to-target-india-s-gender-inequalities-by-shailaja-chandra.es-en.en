India &apos;s Data of Discrimination 
NEW DELHI - Last December &apos;s fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi triggered an unprecedented public outcry in India . 
Tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets to demand an end to police indifference to women &apos;s safety , stronger laws , and speedier trials for those charged with crimes against women . 
The protests launched a countrywide movement , spurring nonstop media coverage of women &apos;s issues . 
So , has significant change followed ? 
Within eight days of the rape , a special commission , led by former Supreme Court Chief Justice J.S. Verma , was established . 
The commission &apos;s roughly 700-page report , completed in only 29 days , urged the government to take swift , far-reaching action . 
Among the report &apos;s recommendations were stronger penalties for sex crimes , including harassment ; a requirement that police officers report every instance of alleged rape ; and broader measures to address pervasive discrimination against women . 
India &apos;s government responded two weeks later , announcing a new ordinance that not only expands the definition of rape , but also makes behavior such as groping , stalking , trafficking , and voyeurism serious criminal offenses . 
But , as the commission &apos;s report highlighted , India does not lack laws intended to deter sexual violence against women . 
Rather , amid widespread ignorance and apathy , government and law enforcement have lacked the motivation to administer existing laws adequately . 
The recent explosion of long-dormant public outrage should be a tipping point , precipitating genuine progress toward a more equal society . 
But designing effective policies to diminish the obstacles confronting women and girls requires measuring the prevalence of the attitudes and habits that limit their potential . 
If the recently enacted laws are to have the intended effect , Indian society must reject discriminatory mindsets and practices . 
Unlike conventional indicators , which capture inequality in outcomes like education and employment , the OECD &apos;s Social Institutions Gender Index ( SIGI ) evaluates the underlying drivers of such outcomes , comparing factors such as preferential treatment of sons over daughters , violence against women , and restrictions on property rights . 
According to this metric , in 2012 , India ranked 56th out of 86 countries for gender equality , lower than other major emerging markets like Brazil , China , Indonesia , and South Africa . 
But Indian society , which comprises more than 1.2 billion citizens , is hardly homogeneous . 
Indeed , India is a complex amalgam of 28 states with widely varying social indicators . 
For example , the nine states that the government has labeled &quot; high focus &quot; account for 62 % of India &apos;s maternal deaths and 70 % of infant deaths , but contain only 48 % of the country &apos;s population . 
Meanwhile , the southern states of Kerala , Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , and Andhra Pradesh account for roughly 22 % of the population , but less than 12 % of maternal deaths . 
Similarly , while infant deaths account for less than 5 % of all deaths in Kerala and Tamil Nadu , more than 20 % of babies born in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , and Rajasthan ( all high-focus states ) do not see their first birthday . 
So , given the limited value of countrywide generalizations , India &apos;s leaders must focus on the differences between states in order to devise targeted policies . 
India &apos;s National Rural Health Mission has adopted such an approach , using region-specific data to identify low-quality prenatal care , unsafe deliveries , and lack of access to birth control as high-priority issues in 18 states . 
The measures that the mission has implemented since 2005 - including free contraception , pregnancy tracking , prenatal care , compensation for hospital delivery , and regular home visits to new mothers - contributed to a 20 % drop in fertility rates in the targeted states by 2010 , and helped to reduce maternal and infant deaths . 
But this approach is not sufficient to address the gender inequality that characterizes Indian politics and society . 
Women comprise just 10 % of India &apos;s parliament , and only two of 35 ministers with full Cabinet rank are women . 
And , while the 33 % quota for women in local-government bodies has placed a million of them in elected positions at the grass roots , the extent to which this has actually improved women &apos;s status has yet to be measured . 
Moreover , discrimination in India often begins in the family . 
Indian families &quot; tendency to prefer sons has resulted in an adverse sex ratio , particularly in some northern states . 
Moreover , in the same region , more than 60 % of girls are married well before the legal age , making pregnancies among anemic and malnourished teenagers a common occurrence . 
But , at the same time , most girls complete 12 years of schooling in the northern mountain state of Himachal Pradesh , demonstrating that the north-south distinction is no more conclusive than countrywide generalizations . 
To facilitate the design of effective targeted policies , India &apos;s Central Statistical Organization is working to provide detailed data through a pilot project that captures Indian states &quot; SIGI indicators . 
The study will highlight the variations in social , cultural , and economic barriers to female empowerment across India . 
Policies based on generalities will not work . 
To initiate a fundamental shift in citizens &quot; gender-related attitudes and behavior , India &apos;s leaders must understand - by the numbers - the often-dramatic disparities between their country &apos;s individual states .
