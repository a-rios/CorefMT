The Misplaced War Against Fire 
TEMPE , ARIZONA - The simplest way to describe fire worldwide is that there is too much of the wrong kind , too little of the right kind , and too much overall . 
The wrong kinds are those such as the blaze that just killed 19 firefighters here in Arizona , or those that have put southeast Asia under a pall , that incinerate communities , befoul ecosystems with effluents , and trash biotas by burning at the wrong times and intensities . 
The right kinds are those that perform an ecological service by burning landscapes properly - and that stay in their place . 
Paradoxically , it is likely that there is not enough fire on the planet ; but , thanks to fossil fuels , there is certainly too much combustion . 
Overall , the developed world has too few good fires , and the developing world has too many bad ones . 
Nearly every observer forecasts that this will continue over the coming years . 
What to do about it depends on how we characterize the problem . 
The paradox of fire stems from its role as the great shape-shifter of natural processes . 
The reason is simple : fire is not a creature nor a substance nor a geophysical event like a hurricane or an earthquake . 
It synthesizes its surroundings . 
It takes its character from its context . 
In this way , it indexes the state of an ecosystem . 
It is also our signature act as a species , the one thing we do that no other creature does . 
While we did not invent fire ( it has been integral to Earth for more than 400 million years ) , we exercise a monopoly over its controlled use . 
All of this makes fire universal , difficult to grasp , and tricky to wrestle into manageable shape . 
There is no solution to fire , because there are many kinds of fires , and they change with their context . 
Some fire problems do have technical fixes . 
We can erect houses that resist burning . 
But these fires are fixable only because we construct their settings . We cannot survive without fire ; we just need it in the right ways . 
It is certainly a problem when it burns freely through cities . 
But it is also a problem when it is removed from wildlands that have adapted to it , because its absence can be as ecologically significant as its presence . 
The point is , urban fire is not a model for wildland fire . 
Our prevailing templates for describing fire are similarly misdirected . 
The battlefield allusion leads observers to reason that there must be more sophisticated technologies than shovels and rakes with which to suppress the flames . 
Such metaphors matter , because they mis-define the problem . 
Over the past decade , the world has experienced a pattern of untrammeled burning - what some observers have termed &quot; megafires . &quot; 
Explanations vary . 
Some of these fires have raged under abnormal conditions ; some have not . 
Others emphasize a buildup of combustible materials . 
The nature of such fuel accumulations runs the gamut , including swamp drainage in Indonesia , rainforest destruction in Amazonia , self-thickening woods in American wildlands as a result of fire exclusion , and everywhere the intrusion of urban sprawl and fire-prone houses . Still others blame changes in policy and practice . 
Lands legally recorded as wilderness will encourage more fire ; and a reluctance to put firefighters at risk in remote settings - as well as cost concerns - argues for backing off and letting the next ridge burn while offering point protection for threatened communities . 
Of course , we need the ability to control bad fires . 
But an emphasis on suppression alone leads to the fire equivalent of a police state , not to a livable landscape . 
Rather , the great diversity of fires points to the need for an equal diversity of means to cope with them or convert them to beneficial outcomes . 
Matching problems with solutions requires us to characterize the issue properly . 
A fire that burns into a community is a disaster , but if we see fire only as a disaster , then we will follow the example of many wildland fire agencies that are adopting urban , all-hazard models in place of traditional land management . 
This leaves them fighting the fires that break out , rather than managing the settings that sustain those fires . 
Likewise , if we define the fight against fire as a battlefield , we will build up our forces , search for more powerful technologies like air tankers , and accept firefighters &quot; deaths as inevitable . 
We will win battles but kill crews in a war that does not exist . 
Even if we accept the war metaphor , we are engaged less in set-piece conflicts than in an ecological insurgency that we cannot bomb or bulldoze into submission . 
In many settings , the best solution is to use good fires to contain bad ones . 
A generalized war on fire is as ill-conceived as , say , a global war on terror . 
Fire is what its setting makes it . 
It is also a relationship . 
Fire and humanity long ago began shaping each other &apos;s realm . 
Today , as always , we remain the best of friends and the worst of enemies .
