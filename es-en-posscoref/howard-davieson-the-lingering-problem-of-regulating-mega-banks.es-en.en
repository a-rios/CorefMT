The JPMorgan Problem Writ Large 
PARIS - JPMorgan Chase has had a bad year . 
Not only has the bank just reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade ; it has also agreed to a tentative deal to pay a fine of $ 13 billion to the US government as punishment for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities . 
Other big legal and regulatory costs loom . 
JPMorgan will bounce back , of course , but its travails have reopened the debate about what to do with banks that are &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
In the United States , policymakers chose to include the Volcker rule ( named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker ) in the Dodd-Frank Act , thereby restricting proprietary trading by commercial banks rather than reviving some form of the Glass-Steagall Act &apos;s division of investment and retail banks . 
But Senators Elizabeth Warren and John McCain , a powerful duo , have returned to the fight . 
They argue that recent events have shown that JPMorgan is too big to be managed well , even by CEO Jamie Dimon , whose fiercest critics do not accuse him of incompetence . 
Nonetheless , the Warren-McCain bill is unlikely to be enacted soon , if only because President Barack Obama &apos;s administration is preoccupied with keeping the government open and paying its bills , while bipartisan agreement on what day of the week it is , let alone on further financial reform , cannot be guaranteed . 
But the question of what to do about huge , complex , and seemingly hard-to-control universal banks that benefit from implicit state support remains unresolved . 
The &quot; school solution , &quot; agreed at the Financial Stability Board in Basel , is that global regulators should clearly identify systemically significant banks and impose tougher regulations on them , with more intensive supervision and higher capital ratios . 
That has been done . 
Initially , 29 such banks were designated , together with a few insurers - none of which like the company that they are obliged to keep ! 
There is a procedure for promotion and relegation , like in national football leagues , so the number fluctuates periodically . 
Banks on the list must keep higher reserves , and maintain more liquidity , reflecting their status as systemically important institutions . 
They must also prepare what are colloquially known as &quot; living wills , &quot; which explain how they would be wound down in a crisis - ideally without taxpayer support . 
But , while all major countries are signed up to this approach , many of them think that more is needed . 
The US now has its Volcker rule ( though disputes between banks and regulators about just how to define it continue ) . 
Elsewhere , more intrusive rules are being implemented , or are under consideration . 
In the United Kingdom , the government created the Vickers Commission to recommend a solution . 
Its members proposed that universal banks be obliged to set up ring-fenced retail-banking subsidiaries with a much higher share of equity capital . 
Only the retail subsidiaries would be permitted to rely on the central bank for lender-of-last-resort support . 
A version of the Vickers Commission &apos;s recommendations , which is somewhat more flexible than its members proposed , is in a banking bill currently before Parliament . 
A number of MPs want to impose tighter restrictions , and it is difficult to find anyone who will speak up for the banks , so some form of the bill is likely to pass , and big British banks will have to divide their operations and their capital . 
The UK has decided to take action before any Europe-wide solution is agreed . 
We British are still members of the European Union ( at least for the time being ) , but sometimes our politicians forget that . 
Sometimes they simply lose patience with the difficulty of agreeing on changes in negotiations that involve 28 countries , which seems especially true of financial reform , given that many of these countries are not home to systemically important banks and probably never will be . 
But EU institutions have not been entirely inactive . 
The European Commission asked an eminent-persons group , chaired by Erkki Liikanen , the head of the Finnish central bank , to examine this issue on a European scale . 
The group &apos;s report , published in October 2012 , came to a similar conclusion as the Vickers Commission concerning the danger of brigading retail and investment banking activities in the same legal entity , and recommended separating the two . 
The proposal mirrors the UK plan - the investment-banking and trading arms , not the retail side , would be ring-fenced - but the end point would be quite similar . 
But the European Banking Federation has dug in its heels , describing the recommendations as &quot; completely unnecessary . &quot; 
The European Commission asked for comments , and its formal position is that it is considering them along with the reports . 
That consideration may take some time ; indeed , it may never end . 
Germany &apos;s government seems to have little appetite for breaking up Deutsche Bank , and the French have taken a leaf from the British book and implemented their own reform . 
The French plan looks more like a Gallic version of the Volcker rule than Vickers &quot; à la française . &quot; 
It is far less rigorous than the banks feared , given President François Hollande &apos;s fiery rhetoric in his electoral campaign last year , in which he anathematized the financial sector as the true &quot; enemy . &quot; 
So we now have a global plan , of sorts , supplemented by various home-grown solutions in the US , the UK , and France , with the possibility of a European plan that would also differ from the others . 
In testimony to the UK Parliament , Volcker gently observed that &quot; Internationalizing some of the basic regulations &#91; would make &#93; a level playing field . 
It is obviously not ideal that the US has the Volcker rule and &#91; the UK has &#93; Vickers ... &quot; 
He was surely right , but &quot; too big to fail &quot; is another area in which the initial post-crisis enthusiasm for global solutions has failed . 
The unfortunate result is an uneven playing field , with incentives for banks to relocate operations , whether geographically or in terms of legal entities . 
That is not the outcome that the G-20 - or anyone else - sought back in 2009 .
