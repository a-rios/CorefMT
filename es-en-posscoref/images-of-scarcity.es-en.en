Images of Scarcity 
NEW HAVEN - Could the television image we &apos;ve all seen of the Greenland ice cap crumbling into the ocean because of global warming somehow - indirectly and psychologically - be partly responsible for high oil and other commodity prices ? 
The usual explanation of today &apos;s scarcity and high prices focuses on explosive growth in emerging countries , China and India in particular , whose demand for scarce resources is &quot; insatiable . &quot; 
But psychology also matters in speculative markets , and perhaps that image of the Greenland ice disappearing makes it seem all too plausible that everything else- land , water , even fresh air - is running out too . 
Let &apos;s take a case study , the last generalized boom-bust cycle in commodity prices , which caused these prices generally to rise ( more or less ) from some time in the 1960 &quot; s until the 1980 &quot; s , and then generally to fall until the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
Maybe images matter just as much as substance in explaining that . 
The conventional &quot; fundamental &quot; explanation for that cycle relates it to political events . 
The 1973-1974 oil crisis is said to have been due to the cutoff of oil following the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War . 
The 1979-1981 oil crisis is said to reflect the cutoff in oil due to the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war . 
The drop in oil prices after the mid-1980 &quot; s is said to be due to the collapse of the OPEC oil cartel . 
But some economists doubt that these events tell the whole story . 
Sure , there were sharp movements in oil prices corresponding to these events , but maybe there were other , even more important factors affecting general trends in oil prices . 
After all , these events don &apos;t really explain why prices of other commodities often followed that of oil . 
Maybe more important than those wars in the 1970 &quot; s was that people throughout the world got worried about running out of things . 
This was the time of the &quot; great population scare , &quot; which transformed thinking worldwide , no doubt contributing to higher commodity prices while the fear lasted . 
There seemed to be some basis for this scare . 
The rate of increase in the world &apos;s population rose from 1.8 % in 1951 to 2.1 % in 1971 . 
But those were just dry statistics . 
Images likely mattered more . 
In 1948 , the astronomer Fred Hoyle said , &quot; Once a photograph of the Earth , taken from outside , is available - once the sheer isolation of the earth becomes plain - a new idea as powerful as any in history will be let loose . &quot; 
A generation later , he was proven right . 
The first photograph of the earth from space came as part of the Apollo project in November 1967 . 
One of the Apollo astronauts , James B. Irwin , who landed on the moon in 1971 , said of his view of the earth , &quot; It was so far away ... a little ball in the blackness of space . 
That does something to your soul .... We all came back humanitarians .... We saw how fragile our planet is and yet how beautiful . 
We saw how we must learn to work together , to love each other . &quot; 
Let &apos;s not discount that statement . 
That image of the earth from space had a profound psychological effect , and we all saw it . 
Maybe that image was at least part of the reason why people became so worried in the 1970 &quot; s about population running ahead of resources . 
The Club of Rome &apos;s monumental book The Limits to Growth came out in 1972 , with a picture of the earth on its cover . 
The book , written by a team of scientists , predicted disastrous shortages and mass starvation due to population pressure . 
Despite scientific critics of the Club of Rome &apos;s methods , the public was ready to believe the dire forecast . 
The great population scare led to various birth-control efforts around the world , notably to the &quot; one-child policy &quot; instituted in China in 1979 . 
Partly due to such efforts , as well as to a change in family values , the rate of growth of the world &apos;s population , began a long decline , to 1.1 % in 2005 . 
That gradual decline led to gradual loss of concern about limits to growth . 
Commodity prices fell , too . Today , we remain mostly unconcerned about global population growth . 
But , in the last ten years or so , we have become concerned about something else : rapid world economic growth . 
While it may seem that no image in the last decade was so dramatic as the first photo of the earth from space , think again . 
Try searching YouTube , for example , on Greenland ice . 
More generally , the Internet gives a sense of vastness to the world &apos;s economic activity that was never available before . 
The ability to communicate via e-mail to everyone in the world creates a sense of the world &apos;s smallness relative to the abundance of people in it . 
We have seen photographs of hurricane and typhoon activity due to global warming , affecting people in Louisiana or Myanmar . 
We have seen devastation from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , interpreted as a sign of crowding at the coasts . 
The North Pole turned into a lake for the first time in 2000 . 
We see aerial photos of the Aral Sea drying up . 
We practically can &apos;t buy caviar from the Caspian Sea any more . 
The European Space Agency announced in September 2007 that satellite photos showed that the Northwest Passage appeared clear of ice for shipping for the first time ever , and that the Northeast Passage is almost clear . 
With so many vivid images of a shrinking and damaged planet , is it really any wonder that human psychology is ripe for high commodity prices ?
