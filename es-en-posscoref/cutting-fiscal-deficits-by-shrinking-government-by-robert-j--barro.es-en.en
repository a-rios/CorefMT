Lessons from the Fiscal Cliff 
CAMBRIDGE - One of the many things I learned from Milton Friedman is that the true cost of government is its spending , not its taxes . 
To put it another way , spending is financed either by current taxes or through borrowing , and borrowing amounts to future taxes , which have almost the same impact on economic performance as current taxes . 
We can apply this reasoning to the United States &quot; unsustainable fiscal deficit . 
As is well known , closing this deficit requires less spending or more taxes . 
The conventional view is that a reasonable , balanced approach entails some of each . 
But , as Friedman would have argued , the two methods should be considered polar opposites . 
Less spending means that the government will be smaller . 
Hence , people who favor smaller government ( for example , some Republicans ) will want the deficit closed entirely by cutting spending , whereas those who favor larger government ( for example , President Barack Obama and most Democrats ) will want the deficit closed entirely by raising taxes . 
As the economist Alberto Alesina has found from studies of fiscal stabilization in OECD countries , eliminating fiscal deficits through spending cuts tends to be much better for the economy than eliminating them through tax increases . 
A natural interpretation is that spending adjustments work better because they promise smaller government , thereby favoring economic growth . 
For a given size of government , the method of raising tax revenue matters . 
For example , we can choose how much to collect via a general income tax , a payroll tax , a consumption tax ( such as a sales or value-added tax ) , and so on . 
We can also choose how much revenue to raise today , rather than in the future ( by varying the fiscal deficit ) . 
A general principle for an efficient tax system is to collect a given amount of revenue ( corresponding in the long run to the government &apos;s spending ) in a way that causes as little distortion as possible to the overall economy . 
Usually , this principle means that marginal tax rates should be similar at different levels of labor income , for various types of consumption , for outlays today versus tomorrow , and so on . 
From this perspective , a shortcoming of the US individual income-tax system is that marginal tax rates are high at the bottom ( because of means testing of welfare programs ) and the top ( because of the graduated-rate structure ) . 
Thus , the government has moved in the wrong direction since 2009 , sharply raising marginal tax rates at the bottom ( by dramatically increasing transfer programs ) and , more recently , at the top ( by raising tax rates on the rich ) . 
One of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the US payroll tax , for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate ( because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure ) . 
Therefore , cutting the payroll tax rate in 2011-2012 and making the rate schedule more graduated ( on the Medicare side ) were mistakes from the standpoint of efficient taxation . 
Republicans should consider these ideas when evaluating tax and spending changes in 2013 . 
Going over the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; would have had the attraction of seriously cutting government spending , although the composition of the cuts - nothing from entitlements and too much from defense - was unattractive . 
The associated revenue increase was , at least , across the board , rather than the unbalanced hike in marginal tax rates at the top that was enacted . 
But the most important part of the deal to avert the fiscal cliff was the restoration of the efficient payroll tax . 
I estimate that the rise by two percentage points in the amount collected from employees corresponds to about $ 1.4 trillion in revenue over ten years . 
This serious revenue boost was not counted in standard reports , because the payroll-tax &quot; holiday &quot; for 2011-2012 had always been treated legally as temporary . 
It is true that some macroeconomic modelers , including the Congressional Budget Office , forecasted that going over the cliff would have caused a recession . 
But those results come from Keynesian models that always predict that GDP expands when the government gets larger . 
Another recession in the US would not be a great surprise , but it can be attributed to an array of bad government policies and other forces , not to cutting the size of government . 
Indeed , it is nonsense to think that cuts in government spending should be avoided in the &quot; short run &quot; in order to lower the chance of a recession . 
If a smaller government is a good idea in the long run ( as I believe it is ) , it is also a good idea in the short run .
