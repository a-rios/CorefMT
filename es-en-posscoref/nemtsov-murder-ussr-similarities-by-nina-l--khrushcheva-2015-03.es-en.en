Kremlin Murder Incorporated 
NEW YORK - In his play Murder in the Cathedral , T. S. Eliot describes the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury , Thomas Becket , as a silently ordered hit . 
The English king , Henry II , did not need to give a direct order ; his knights knew what to do with somebody seen to be undermining the state . 
Eliot may have set his play in twelfth-century England , but he wrote it in 1935 , barely two years after Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany . 
So it is , at least in part , a cautionary tale about the rise of fascism in Europe . 
Sadly , it has lost none of its relevance . 
Today , Eliot &apos;s masterpiece can be read as a warning about the path being taken by Russia , where politics under President Vladimir Putin has been growing murderously medieval . 
One by one , Putin &apos;s critics have been eliminated . 
In 2006 , the journalist Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down in an elevator , and Alexander Litvinenko , a former KGB agent who had been critical of Putin , died of polonium poison while in exile in London . 
In 2009 , Sergei Magnitsky , a lawyer campaigning against corruption , died in prison after being denied medical care for life-threatening conditions . 
The same year , another lawyer , Stanislav Markelov , a champion of human rights , was shot following a news conference . 
The murder last week of Boris Nemtsov , a leading opposition politician and a former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin , should come as no surprise . 
But it should come as a shock - and as a wake-up call for those Russians who until now have tolerated a culture of lawlessness and impunity , unseen since the darkest days of Stalin &apos;s personal rule in the Soviet Union . 
Before his death , Nemtsov was said to be working on a report titled &quot; Putin and the War , &quot; providing proof of Russia &apos;s involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine . 
He was scheduled to lead a protest against the war two days after his murder . 
Some have wondered if Putin was afraid of what Nemtsov had uncovered , and thus ordered the assassination . 
That is unlikely , at least in terms of someone receiving a direct order from Putin . 
Simply put , orchestrating Nemtsov &apos;s murder was not worth the trouble ; after all , the Kremlin &apos;s propaganda machine would have had little problem twisting Nemtsov &apos;s report to Putin &apos;s benefit . 
Indeed , even Nemtsov &apos;s brazen murder is unlikely to hurt Putin politically . 
His popularity now stands at 86 % . 
For many Russians , Nemtsov &apos;s opposition to the war in Ukraine made him a traitor , whose death was justified - indeed , almost demanded - by national necessity . 
Putin has announced that he will personally oversee the investigation into the assassination . 
But those leading the effort have already indicated its likely conclusion : Nemtsov &apos;s murder was an attempt to destabilize Russia . 
We can be all but certain that some culprit or another will be &quot; found , &quot; and that his crime will be part of a conspiracy by the CIA or Ukrainian authorities . 
The Kremlin is no stranger to twisting the truth to fit its needs . 
Before Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea , it argued that the United States had hired snipers to fire at pro-Western protesters in Kyiv in order to blame Russia for their deaths . 
When a Malaysian airliner was shot down over Ukraine - most likely by pro-Russia rebels - the official Kremlin story was that Western secret services downed it to undermine Putin &apos;s reputation . 
Allegations like these have whipped up nationalism , hatred , and anti-Western hysteria , distracting Russians from Putin &apos;s culpability for their country &apos;s economic crisis . 
As menacing as Putin &apos;s Russia may be , however , nothing about it is original . 
In 1934 , Joseph Stalin , too , ordered a thorough investigation into the murder of a rival : Sergei Kirov , the head of the Communist Party in Leningrad . 
The NKVD , the precursor to the KGB , orchestrated the assassination on Stalin &apos;s order , but the inquiry gave the Soviet dictator a pretext for eliminating other opponents . 
The search for Kirov &apos;s murderers eventually culminated in the Great Terror , a massive purge of Party leaders , military commanders , and intellectuals . 
Putin may not have ordered the hit on Nemtsov or any of the others . 
But , like Stalin , he has nurtured a climate of fear and lawlessness , in which those who rally behind the Kremlin feel a duty to eliminate the leader &apos;s opponents however they can , and in anticipation of his will . 
An atmosphere in which unlawful deeds become heroic acts was a signature feature of Stalin &apos;s rule . 
That stifling dynamic has returned under Putin . 
During the darkest days of the Soviet Union , the chiefs of the NKVD were the country &apos;s second most important officials . 
Today , Andrei Lugovoi , the KGB agent that the British government suspects of delivering the polonium that killed Litvinenko , sits in the Russian Duma . 
So what will happen next ? 
Will Putin , like Stalin , unleash his own great terror , and murderously pursue supposed adversaries ? 
Or will Nemtsov &apos;s death finally move complacent and obedient Russians to action ? 
In the first decade of this century , it was easy to love Putin . 
Today , as low oil prices and Western sanctions bite , he is making them poor and nearly universally despised . 
On March 1 , the day Nemtsov was to lead his protest , tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets with slogans like &quot; Nemtsov is love , Putin is war . &quot; 
Could it be that Russia &apos;s culture of impunity has reached an inflection point ? 
Putin &apos;s regime relies on the promise of economic prosperity , without which it could begin to unravel - if not as a result of mass protest , then because insiders no longer have a stake in its political survival . 
At that point , when Putin is at his most vulnerable , his allies will have to act carefully - and keep looking over their shoulders .
