Anchoring the Arab Awakening 
LONDON - The economic situation in the countries of the so-called Arab Awakenings is deteriorating quickly . 
Egypt is running low on cash - before recent rescue loans , currency reserves covered less than three months of imports - and Egyptians are hoarding fuel and foodstuffs in anticipation of future shortages . 
More frequent and longer-lasting power outages foretell worse to come in an economy already struggling with mass unemployment , widespread exclusion , and deep pockets of poverty . 
Short-term macroeconomic stability is the immediate priority in Egypt and the other Arab Awakening countries . 
In the medium term , however , the viability of the current order is at stake - and not only in these countries , but across the rest of North Africa and the Middle East . 
With so much at stake , Majid Jafar of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum was right to worry at the recent World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa at the Dead Sea . 
His proposal of an Arab Stabilization Plan , inspired by the post-1945 Marshall Plan in Western Europe , is laudable . 
The imperative for large-scale coordinated action is overwhelming . 
But is the Marshall Plan the right model ? 
The Marshall Plan was a macroeconomic strategy involving massive capital transfers to help reconstruct the war-ravaged industrial capacity and infrastructure of economies with well-developed institutions . 
But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented , project-based , and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world . 
In a joint report on the competitiveness of the Arab countries , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) and the World Economic Forum call for urgent institutional reform to support private-sector growth . 
Excessive red tape and ineffective enforcement of competition policy and governance rules are hampering entrepreneurship throughout the region . 
Massive investments are also needed in education to eradicate deep pockets of illiteracy , raise overall skill levels , and better match skills to the demands of the market . 
Perhaps surprisingly , there is widespread consensus in the Arab Awakening countries that the private sector is central to sustained job creation and growth . 
We saw this recently when the EBRD , together with the British-based organization Forward Thinking , conducted a closed-door workshop for 27 leading representatives of parties from across the political spectrum in the region . 
Two days of intensive discussions revealed important differences in perspective , but also many commonalities . 
Private-sector development clearly means different things to different people . 
The parties on the right largely embrace free-market thinking , while Egypt &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood and its kindred parties in Libya and Tunisia are deeply sceptical of the state , which they view as bloated , inept , and ultimately corrupt . 
Moreover , the existing banks have failed to serve these parties &quot; small-business and farming constituencies . 
Achieving ambitious goals for inclusive growth and job creation quickly without an enabling state and without using the banking system will be extremely difficult . 
Without question , the main responsibility for building these countries &quot; political systems and reforming their economies rests with their citizens . 
Outside intervention has left too many scars in the public &apos;s collective memory . 
But the region can look to the successful transition in Central Europe and the powerful anchor for reforms provided by these countries &quot; accession to the European Union . 
Countries like Hungary and Poland can hardly be accused of having a hidden agenda when they share their development experience . 
Much can also be learned from countries like Turkey , which has managed to create a dynamic and innovative private sector . 
The good news is that the economies of the Arab Awakening countries do not suffer from the deep distortions that characterized post-communist Europe . 
Many of the early reforms have already been implemented , and reasonably sophisticated banking systems are in place . 
In post-communist Europe , banks had to be built from scratch out of the rubble of socialism . 
As a result , while political uncertainty will take its toll on economic growth , the Arab Awakening countries should not have to face a transitional recession , as post-communist Europe did in the 1990 &quot; s . 
On the other hand , they are unlikely to benefit from the subsequent robust growth that most European transition countries experienced . 
Jafar is right that the Arab Awakening countries need a plan . 
But it should be a plan for private-sector-led inclusive growth , supported by efforts in the rest of the Arab world and in the EU . 
Most critically , it must be a plan owned by the countries themselves and based on an approach that recognizes the critical roles of an enabling state and a catalytic financial sector . 
The ongoing socio-political transition , underpinned by widespread public recognition of the need for change , provides a historic opportunity to embark on growth-enhancing reforms .
