Buying into Bitcoin 
LONDON - The Internet currency Bitcoin is surrounded by uncertainty . 
Is it a speculative bubble ? 
Is it really as anonymous as its proponents claim ? 
Can one actually use it to purchase the legendary White Widow strain of marijuana , or to hire a hit man ? 
These are certainly interesting questions , but they are diverting attention from far more important discussions about Bitcoin &apos;s potential to drive financial-sector innovation . 
Bitcoin is so innovative , in fact , that beyond breaking the conventions of currency , it has even transcended partisan ideologies . 
Indeed , the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and US Tea Party icon Ron Paul are diametrically opposed on virtually every issue but Bitcoin ( both deeply dislike it ) . 
And yet Bitcoin &apos;s opponents should be asking how the groundbreaking ideas that underlie it could be applied to reforming the global financial system . 
Although the 2008 financial crisis exposed profound institutional shortcomings , the response - including heightened regulatory safeguards like the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and the Basel III banking standards - has failed to bring about the needed transformation . 
Likewise , protest movements like Occupy Wall Street , aimed at raising awareness of - and ultimately reforming - the culture of finance , have delivered mixed results . 
But the fact is that no one - except perhaps the small coterie of financial insiders who have benefited enormously from taxpayer-financed bailouts - should be satisfied with the current system , not least because another crisis , most likely accompanied by more bank bailouts , can reasonably be expected in the not-so-distant future . 
While the exact timing of the next meltdown cannot be known , one thing is certain : consideration of what kind of financial system would best serve the world in the twenty-first century would be incomplete without Bitcoin . 
After all , the technology behind it could not only help to reduce systemic risk by creating safeguards shielding the payments system from useful but unpredictable financial activities ; it could also play an important role in bolstering much-needed economic growth . 
Financial institutions essentially act as matchmakers , linking investors , borrowers , and savers , and recording what people own and owe . 
In exchange for these services , financial professionals are compensated very generously . 
So , to ask whether bankers &quot; massive paychecks are fair is really to ask how much value is created by financial matchmaking - a question to which there is no simple answer . 
What is clear is that , by allowing a greater proportion of an economy &apos;s wealth to be channeled toward investment and other productive economic activities , a more efficient financial-services industry boosts economic growth . 
In other words , the financial-services industry can be viewed as a kind of tax on the rest of the economy . 
The inefficiency of the world &apos;s financial system is not simply a result of obsolete rules and structures ; profit-seeking is also a major factor . 
While British authorities recently announced that the transfer of physical checks would be abolished , a two-day check-clearing delay will remain . 
Given that scanned images of checks could easily be processed electronically almost instantaneously , the enduring delay can be explained only by &quot; float &quot; - that is , the interest earned by holding onto money for as long as possible . 
Float is just one of the many ways the financial-services industry extracts resources from the economy . 
The 3-5 % charge levied by credit-card companies works out to several hundred billion dollars in annual profits for companies like Visa and MasterCard . 
Fees for wire transfers and for exchanging currency can quickly climb to 10 % or more per transaction , with interruptions and complex procedures making such services even more costly . 
But there is reason for hope . 
With the innovations pioneered by Bitcoin , the fees , delays , and other inefficiencies that serve to line the pockets of those in the financial-services industry can largely be eliminated . 
Ahead of US Senate hearings last November , former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to senators saying that Bitcoin may &quot; hold long-term promise , particularly if the innovations promote a faster , more secure , and more efficient payment system . &quot; 
As if on cue , the US retail giant Target was hacked - another episode in a long string of major financial-data heists . 
Bitcoin , with its capacity for anonymity , could certainly help to make the global financial system more secure , saving consumers and businesses significant inconvenience and expense . 
At the same time , it offers an alternative store of value , and its use as a medium of exchange is steadily growing . 
But perhaps the most exciting innovation offered by Bitcoin is the &quot; blockchain &quot; - peer-to-peer software that keeps a record of all transactions and a tally of who owns what . 
The blockchain essentially serves the &quot; ledger &quot; function that banks do today , but at a fraction of the cost to consumers and businesses . 
Powered by an open-source algorithm and maintained by anyone who chooses to download the free software , Bitcoin marks a return to a community-based approach to money and banking , with financial services more closely connected to the people who use them . 
Large , monolithic third-party managers like today &apos;s &quot; too big to fail &quot; banks would be cut out . 
Indeed , with software like the blockchain powering a new financial architecture , &quot; the people &quot; would effectively become the bank .
