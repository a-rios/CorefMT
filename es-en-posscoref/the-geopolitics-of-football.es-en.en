The Geopolitics of Football 
In football , defeat is never definitive , but it is always passionate . 
For football lovers , FIFA ( the governing body of international football ) should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize long ago . 
For others , exasperated by football and the emotions it stirs up , the sport is no longer a game , but a type of war that stokes the basest sort of nationalist emotions . 
Is there a relationship between football ( and sports in general ) and a spirit of nationalism and militarism ? 
During the Middle Ages , sports were regularly forbidden in England because they came at the expense of military training . 
After France &apos;s defeat by Bismarck &apos;s Germany in the Franco-Prussian War , Baron Pierre de Coubertin ( who re-launched the Olympic Games a few decades later ) recommended a renewed national emphasis on sport , which by this point was seen as a form of military preparation . 
In a football match , the rituals - the flag waving , the national anthems , the collective chants -and the language that is employed ( the match starts with a &quot; breakout of hostilities , &quot; one &quot; bombs &quot; the goal , blows up the defense , launches &quot; missile &quot; ) reinforce the perception of war by other means . 
And , in fact , real war has actually broken out over football . 
In 1969 , Honduras and Salvador clashed after a qualification game for the World Cup . 
Football matches can , it seems , revive national rivalries and conjure the ghosts of past wars . 
During the 2004 Asia Nations Cup final , which pitted China against Japan , Chinese supporters wore 1930 &quot; s-style Japanese military uniforms to express their hostility to the Japanese team . 
Other Chinese fans brandished placards with the number &quot; 300,000 &quot; written on it , a reference to the number of Chinese murdered by the Japanese army in 1937 . 
But can one really say that football is responsible for the currently bad diplomatic relations between China and Japan ? 
Of course not . 
Hostility on the football pitch merely reflects the existing tense relations between the two countries , which carry the weight of a painful history . 
At the opposite end of the spectrum , the dramatic semi-final between France and Germany in Seville in 1982 produced no political ripples , either for diplomatic relations between the two countries or for relations between the two peoples . 
Antagonism was confined to the stadium , and ended when the match did . 
What football really provides is a residual area of confrontation that allows for the controlled expression of animosity , leaving the most important areas of interaction between countries unaffected . 
France and Germany will soon have a common army - they already have a common currency - yet the survival of national teams channels , within a strictly limited framework , lingering rivalry between the two countries . 
Football can also be the occasion of positive gestures . 
The joint organization of the 2002 World Cup by Japan and South Korea helped accelerate bilateral reconciliation . 
The performance of the South Korean players was even applauded in North Korea . 
Sport , indeed , seems to be the best barometer of relations between the divided Korean people . 
Moreover , football , more than long speeches or international resolutions , can help induce progress towards peaceful solutions for military conflicts . 
After their qualification for this year &apos;s World Cup , the Ivory Coast &apos;s national team , including players from the north and south , addressed all of their fellow citizens , asking the warring factions to lay down their weapons and to put an end to the conflict that has shattered their country . 
After Haiti &apos;s President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown a few years ago , Brazil &apos;s football team acted as an ambassador for the United Nations &quot; Brazilian-led peacekeeping forces . 
And , when conflict stops , from Kosovo to Kabul , football is the first sign of a society returning to normal . 
The former president of the FIFA , Joao Havelange , often dreamed of a football match between Israelis and Palestinians : the American vice-president Al Gore regarded such a match as a means to help Washington solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Perhaps one day it will take place . 
Certainly the Iran-United States football game in 1998 offered a moment of fraternization between the two teams . 
Another Iran-US match might be helpful at this difficult time . 
It is because football allows for symbolically limited confrontations , with no major political risks , that it is useful . 
Its impact on national and international public opinion is broad , but not deep . 
As the sociologist Norbert Elias put it : &quot; The spectators of a football match can enjoy the mythical excitement of battles taking place in the stadium , and they know that neither the players nor they will suffer any harm . &quot; 
As in real life , fans can be torn between their hopes for victory and their fear of defeat . 
But in football , the elimination of an adversary is always temporary . 
A return match is always possible . 
As a Frenchman , I cannot wait for the next World Cup match between France and Germany . 
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville , not its defeat at Verdun .
