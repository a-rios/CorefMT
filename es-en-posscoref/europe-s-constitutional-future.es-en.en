Europe \ u0027s Constitutional Future 
Last week , the President of the European Convention , Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing , submitted a so-called &quot; skeleton &quot; for a future Constitution of Europe . 
All the ingredients of a constitution - values , principles , the rights of citizens , the competencies of the Union and its constituent institutions , etc - were included . 
This document arose despite the fact that the Convention &apos;s mandate did not empower the delegates to produce a constitution . 
According to the Nice Declaration , which I drafted as one of the participating prime ministers , we were only to simplify and restructure the EU &apos;s basic treaties . 
As the C onvention worked , our mandate was transformed due to various pressures . 
These came from member countries , from civil society organizations , and from letters , documents , and email messages from across Europe . 
Democratic pressure changed our mandate . 
When even the Foreign Minister of Britain , a country happy with its centuries-old &quot; unwritten constitution , &quot; claims himself eager to have a written European Constitution , something truly has changed ! 
Yet , scholars such as Ralph Dahrendorf and Joseph Weiler suggest that a European constitution does not make sense because a democratic constitution presupposes a paramount common identity that is absent in an EU where individual national loyalties still prevail . 
Others , such as Robert Dahl , argue that democracy requires smaller communities based on shared interests and personal relations . 
For them , Europe may be too big to forge truly democratic institutions . 
Such theoretical objections must be set against the fact Europe already exists - indeed , decisions are made everyday on the European level which determine our lives . 
We may dislike it , but the EU is part of our system of government , like municipalities , regions , and nation-states . 
So the question is not whether Europe exists , but whether we are satisfied with the way it functions . 
If not , can we fix it , and is a constitution the way to do it ? 
The first problem in need of a &quot; constitutional &quot; solution that is tackled is Europe &apos;s clear and unified identity . 
Not many people realize it , but because of the patchwork of treaties from which today &apos;s European institutions arose , &quot; Europe &quot; is not a unitary entity ; indeed , the &quot; European Union &quot; and the &quot; European Community &quot; denote two different things . 
The Community is the set of institutions created in the 1950 &apos;s to establish a common market . 
When we decided later to have a common foreign policy , and to cooperate in judicial and police matters , we invented the Union . 
The Union deals with foreign policy ; the Community with economic integration . 
One consequence of this is that agreements with third countries that involve both foreign and economic matters require two distinct treaties : one for the Union , one for the Community . 
This confuses even trained foreign diplomats who negotiate with Europe . 
If it confuses them , how befuddling must it be for ordinary citizens ? 
How can a European citizen really identify with Europe if no single &quot; Europe &quot; exists ? 
Europe &apos;s indistinct legal identity has another deleterious impact . 
If the Community does something that affects someone &apos;s rights , he or she can go to court . 
But if the Union encroaches on your rights , access to a court may be closed because the Union happens to have no legal personality ! 
The next problem to be tackled - again with constitutional implications - is the anonymous , bureaucratic nature of European legal acts . 
Criticizing institutions is as essential a part of democracy as protecting enumerated legal rights . 
But Europe &apos;s institutions are hard to criticize because they produce acts that ordinary people cannot name or understand . 
In national life , acts of parliaments are called &quot; statutes &quot; or &quot; laws , &quot; and these usually have names that you can rally for and against . 
In the EU we have &quot; regulations , &quot; &quot; directives , &quot; &quot; decisions , &quot; &quot; general guidelines , &quot; &quot; common strategies , &quot; &quot; common actions , &quot; &quot; common positions &quot; - a myriad that only experts can comprehend . 
When a &quot; directive &quot; is issued , you don &apos;t know who is responsible ; instead , they are known as , say , &quot; Directive 17.62 &quot; ( meaning that it is directive no . 
17 issued in 1962 ) . 
In Italy there is now a controversial statute that will change the rules of criminal procedure in ways that might prove helpful to eminent public figures . 
Well , the name of Senator Cirami is attached to that bill . 
By god , we can fight about &quot; the law Cirami &quot; ! 
Would things be the same if the bill were called &quot; Regulation 75 &quot; ? 
Because Europe has so many bodies that legislate - the Council of Ministers , the Council for Agriculture , the Council for Industry , the Council for the Environment , etc . - we cannot know who is doing what and why . 
We need a single legislative council , a bicameral European Parliament , with one house representing member states , and the other the European electorate . 
In this simplified system , legislation will be called legislation , and executive regulations , as in most legal systems , will fill in the gaps in primary legislation . 
This is a system European citizens will understand . 
The draft constitutional document presented last week introduces small but significant changes that may empower Europe &apos;s citizens to both identify with and criticize Europe . 
It calls for a single , unified legal entity . 
Whether it is called European Union , United States of Europe , United Europe , or something else , it will also provide for a unitary , simplified system of normative acts that will introduce more transparency and accountability . 
The institutional structure envisaged by the proposed European Constitution should also reflect and help develop Europe &apos;s broader aspirations . 
Europe must be more than a vehicle of economic integration , which is almost accomplished anyway . 
At the simplest , we expect Europe to be fair . 
We expect our social model to be realized . 
We expect economic and social matters to be connected . 
We expect Europe to play a role for good in the world . 
Of course , roadblocks await . 
One of them is that more Europe cannot mean a centralized system . 
Democratic governments are too complicated for that . 
Getting the proper balance among European , national , regional , and local institutions will be a crucial challenge . 
But if the people are to ordain a Constitution for Europe , all of their ties and values will need to be respected by that Constitution .
