The Return of the Balkan Question 
PARIS - &quot; One must Europeanize the Balkans , in order to avoid the Balkanization of Europe . &quot; 
I wrote those words with the French political scientist Jacques Rupnik in 1991 , just as war was breaking out among Yugoslavia &apos;s successor states . 
The fighting would last until the end of the decade , claim thousands of lives , and twice require the intervention of NATO ( in Bosnia in 1995 and Serbia in 1999 ) . 
Nearly a quarter-century later , the Balkans continue to constitute a threat to European peace , just as they did on the eve of World War I and at the end of the Cold War , when Yugoslavia &apos;s implosion led not only to Europe &apos;s first war since 1945 , but also to the return of genocidal murder . 
The recent fighting in Macedonia , which left eight police officers and 14 Albanian militants dead , raises the specter of renewed violence . 
It is difficult to know whether the bloodshed represents the festering of an old , unhealed wound or something new , a backlash against a majority-Slav government that seems bent on embracing ethnic chauvinism . 
What is clear is that the region remains an explosive and confused reality , one capable of threatening Europe &apos;s stability , already on a knife &apos;s edge following Russia &apos;s adventurism in Ukraine . 
The region is a volatile mix of rising nationalism , deep economic frustration , and disillusionment about progress toward membership in the European Union . 
The potential for a plunge into chaos obliges us to consider once again how best to handle the Balkan tinderbox . 
When I was in Belgrade recently , the gunplay in Macedonia was the talk of the town . 
Some of my Serbian interlocutors decried the West &apos;s blindness . 
In particular , they criticized the EU , NATO , and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for describing the upsurge in violence as a series of &quot; isolated incidents . &quot; 
From the Serbs &quot; perspective , attacks by Albanian nationalists were more likely the beginning of an attempt to enlarge their territory at the expense of their Christian neighbors , beginning with the weakest . 
It is views like these that , along with the violence , risk reinforcing the deep ambivalence within the EU about the prospect of any new enlargement . 
The precedent of Greece , hardly a poster child for European accession , seems especially relevant when applied to its northern neighbors , which are similarly plagued with high rates of corruption and unemployment . 
These European apprehensions partly reflect failure by the continent &apos;s leaders to capitalize on the sometimes-spectacular successes of enlargement , Poland being the most notable example . 
Instead , the exigencies of domestic politics have induced many European leaders to underscore the difficulties and accentuate the failures of expansion . 
With such a cold wind blowing from the West , it is little wonder that Europhilia has begun to give way in places like Belgrade to a pining nostalgia for the Yugoslav era . 
&quot; At that time , we were respected , &quot; was how a retired Serbian diplomat put it to me . 
&quot; We were one of the Great countries of the Non-Aligned Movement . &quot; 
Similar sentiments are evident in Bosnia , and even in Croatia , an EU member since 2013 . 
During the communist era , Yugoslavia provided a sharp contrast with the Soviet bloc . 
Economically and socially , its citizens were far better off than those of Central Europe . 
Today , their fortunes have flipped . 
Poland is booming , while Yugoslavia &apos;s successor states ( with the exception of Slovenia ) are struggling , victims of the unhealed wounds of the distant and recent past - including former Yugoslav and Serbian President Slobodan Milošević &quot; s cynical atavism in winning and maintaining power . 
It has been years since the EU looked so distant , so aloof . 
The decision by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to abolish the post of Commissioner for Enlargement has been seen as highly symbolic , leaving many in search of an alternative model . 
The Russian re-conquest of Crimea provides a gleeful talking point for ultra-nationalist Serbs bemoaning the loss of Albanian-majority Kosovo . 
Meanwhile , the Gazprom office in central Belgrade offers a large , visible proof of Russia &apos;s energy presence in the country . 
The truth , of course , is that there is no &quot; Russian model &quot; for the Balkans beyond the use of brute force . 
Ever-closer ties with Europe remain the best way forward for the region &apos;s residents and the EU alike . 
In a time of severe economic crisis , European ideals remain , in spite of everything , the only efficient antidote to virulent nationalism . 
For the Balkans , as for the rest of Europe , the EU is the only alternative to a future as bad as the worst of the past .
