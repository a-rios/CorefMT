Iran &apos;s Pre-Emptive Strike 
Iran &apos;s quarreling and competing leaders have decided , by their acts , to reject the offer by Europe and the United States of a nuclear reactor , aircraft spare parts , economic cooperation , and more in exchange for giving up uranium enrichment . 
Many people hoped that Iran &apos;s leaders , despite their extremism , would accept the offer if only to avoid sanctions - which are sure to come even if China and Russia refuse to support them in the United Nations Security Council . 
The US and Europe are united this time , and can effectively cut off Iran from world banking , bar Iranian leaders from traveling to the West , and stop exports to Iran of everything but food and medicine . 
Instead of waiting passively for sanctions , Iran &apos;s leaders decided to start a Middle East crisis by organizing attacks against Israel . 
Their aim is to discourage the US and the Europeans from starting another crisis - financial markets and everyday politics in Europe can tolerate only so much conflict . 
They may also hope to shatter the unified EU / US position that now exists . 
Moreover , Iran &apos;s claim to leadership in the Muslim world is being undermined by the conflict in Iraq , where Iran supports the Shia militias that are killing Sunnis . 
Every bloody day of bombings and executions in Iraq reminds Arabs that the Iranians are neither Arab nor Sunni . 
But attacking Israel unites Muslims , and gains Arab gratitude . 
Iran &apos;s move was prepared in a series of meetings with both Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
Khaled Mashal , Hamas &apos;s overall leader , who lives under Syrian protection in Damascus , traveled to Tehran , where he received some $ 50 million in badly needed cash . 
Although an offshoot of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood , whose Arab financial supporters loathe the Ayatollahs , Hamas decided to cooperate in Iran &apos;s scheme because it was diplomatically isolated and cut off from Western funding due to its refusal to recognize Israel . 
Hamas acted by increasing rocket attacks on nearby Israeli territory , and by launching a raid into Israel itself , killing two soldiers and capturing another . 
That provoked Israeli retaliation , starting the Gaza end of the crisis that Iran wanted . 
As for the impact on lives in Gaza , Hamas - like Yasir Arafat - has again shown itself to be more devoted to the idea of Palestine than to the welfare of Palestinians . 
It was far more costly to get Hezbollah to serve Iran &apos;s strategy . 
While it retains a heavily armed , salaried , and uniformed guerilla / terrorist force of some 5,000 , its leader , Hassan Nasrallah , has been striving for years to build Hezbollah into a legitimate political party and the main representative of Lebanon &apos;s Shia . 
This effort was so successful that Hezbollah now has two ministers in the government . 
But to be accepted by other Lebanese , and to some extent even to retain the support of fellow Shia , Hezbollah had to agree to join the Lebanese consensus on the priority of reconstruction and economic recovery after years of civil war . 
That meant avoiding a war with Israel . 
Hezbollah is under order by the UN Security Council to disarm and disband its militia , but it claimed that even after Israel &apos;s full withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 , it needed its weapons to continue to liberate &quot; Lebanese territory . &quot; 
That refers to a tiny fragment of land , the so-called Sheba farms , declared by UN inspectors to be in Israel , but which Hezbollah claims as part of Lebanon . 
Other Lebanese political parties agreed that Hezbollah could keep its weapons to fight there - but only on condition that it keep the peace on the rest of the border . 
With that , Hezbollah threw away its political position in Lebanon . 
For the Israeli coalition government headed by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , matters are relatively simple . 
It ordered the withdrawal from Gaza in order to stop the cycle of violence there , on the presumption that Israeli territory proper would not be attacked . 
But the possibility of attack was of course anticipated , and military planners determined that the only possible response was to counterattack as heavily and for as long as might be needed , until Palestinian attacks would stop , whether from exhaustion or agreement . 
Hamas &apos;s control of the Palestinian Authority does not diminish or increase the need for Israeli military action , but it does increase its political benefits , because the fighting and destruction tells Gaza &apos;s population that their rulers are endangering their physical survival . 
As for Hezbollah , the Israeli military response is by no means confined to retaliation . 
Over the years , Hezbollah has received and stored several thousand rockets and some one hundred longer-range missiles from Iran . 
Recently , and very revealingly , two Iranian leaders threatened Israel with bombardment by Hezbollah &apos;s rockets if Israel attacked Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
Thus , Israel is using the opportunity brought by the current fighting to search out and destroy Hezbollah &apos;s underground and other hidden sites where it keeps its rockets and missiles . 
Israel &apos;s political aim is to destroy Hezbollah &apos;s position as a legitimate Lebanese political party by exposing it as the paid agent of Iran , which serves foreign interests at grievous cost to Lebanon . 
So Israel is blocking Lebanon &apos;s ports from the sea , has breached the runways of all three jet-capable airfields , including Beirut &apos;s international airport , and remains ready to destroy generating plants and other high-value targets , if necessary , to generate sufficient political pressure on Hezbollah . 
If Lebanon &apos;s political forces and Nasrallah &apos;s followers cannot get him to revert to a truce , Israel will bomb more targets , including Nasrallah &apos;s offices in south Beirut . 
If more missiles are launched , Israel will cross the border deep into Lebanese territory . 
Of course , in both Gaza and southern Lebanon , the outcome is pre-determined by the one-sided military balance . 
The only open question in both places is how much damage Israel will need to inflict to obtain new cease-fires .
