The Ethics of Fighting Ebola 
PRINCETON - It may , in the end , turn out to be fortunate that a handful of people in developed countries - four in the United States and one in Spain - have contracted Ebola . 
Tragic as this was for Thomas Duncan , the only one of these patients who has died , if all of the more than 13,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths had occurred in Africa , Ebola would never have aroused nearly as much attention in rich countries . 
In this respect , Ebola is - or , rather , was - an example of what is sometimes referred to as the 90 / 10 rule : 90 % of medical research is directed toward illnesses that comprise only 10 % of the global burden of disease . 
The world has known about the deadly nature of the Ebola virus since 1976 ; but , because its victims were poor , pharmaceutical companies had no incentive to develop a vaccine . 
Indeed , pharmaceutical companies could expect to earn more from a cure for male baldness . 
Government research funds in affluent countries are also disproportionately targeted toward the diseases that kill these countries &quot; citizens , rather than toward diseases like malaria and diarrhea that are responsible for much greater loss of life . 
But the tiny number of Ebola cases in rich countries - and the ensuing panic-inducing headlines and quarantine measures - have brought home the global nature of infectious disease today . 
Mass travel has made effective containment of epidemics extremely difficult . 
The best defense against an infectious disease is to fight it where it originates , and that requires good health services . 
Ebola appears to have been eradicated from Nigeria , in no small part because that country had a Gates Foundation-supported hospital with personnel trained and equipped to control infectious diseases . 
If , over the past decade or two , affluent countries had done more to assist Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Guinea , the current Ebola outbreak could have been minimized , if not prevented . 
But now it is too late for that , and scientists are rushing to find both a vaccine and an effective treatment for Ebola . 
What ethical considerations should guide them in their search ? 
The standard way to judge the efficacy of a vaccine is to conduct a trial in which those who could benefit are randomly assigned to two groups , one of which receives the potentially beneficial vaccine , while the other receives a substance with no active ingredients , known as a placebo . 
To avoid possible confounding factors , such as greater risk-taking by those who know they have been vaccinated , or the desire of those conducting the trial to show that the vaccine works , the study is &quot; double blind &quot; : Neither the subjects nor those administering the trial and collecting the data know who got the vaccine and who got the placebo . 
Only an independent group examining the data sent in from the field has that information . 
Without such a trial , the appearance of efficacy may be an illusion , because other factors would have led to a lower rate of infection anyway . 
Yet if a promising vaccine is available - and if safety trials in healthy human volunteers who are not at risk of infection demonstrate that it does no harm - to deny it to those who are tending to the sick and dying , at great risk to their own health , seems unethical . 
That question will soon need to be answered , because both the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline ( in conjunction with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ) and the Public Health Agency of Canada have candidate vaccines in development . 
At a recent World Health Organization meeting in Geneva , Ripley Ballou , the head of GlaxoSmithKline &apos;s program to develop a vaccine , argued that a randomized controlled trial comparing a potential Ebola vaccine with a vaccine that protects against another virus would be the most ethical way to assess efficacy . 
Depending on the outcome , results could be available within three months , allowing production and distribution to go ahead with greater confidence . 
Representatives of Médecins Sans Frontières ( Doctors without Borders ) , which has more than 3,000 staff members combating Ebola in the most affected countries , strongly opposed giving placebos to anyone at high risk of contracting the disease . 
If that is true , a randomized controlled trial could be the most ethical option . 
When it comes to treatment , the situation is different . 
In a letter published last month in The Lancet , doctors , scientists , and bioethicists from a wide range of countries - including Guinea , Ghana , Nigeria , and Senegal , as well as Britain , France , Hong Kong , and the United States - argued that a randomized trial is justified only when there is &quot; equipoise , &quot; or balance , between the two options offered . 
This can happen when doctors do not know whether a proposed treatment will do more harm than good , or when they are in doubt about which of two treatments is more likely to cure the patient . 
But , when facing a disease that kills up to 70 % of those who are infected , and no accepted treatment yet exists , patients could reasonably refuse consent to a trial in which they might receive a placebo , rather than an experimental treatment that offers some hope of recovery . 
In such cases , it might be more ethical to monitor carefully the outcomes of different treatment centers now , before experimental treatments become available , and then compare these outcomes with those achieved by the same centers after experimental treatments are introduced . 
Unlike in a randomized trial , no one would receive a placebo , and it should still be possible to detect which treatments are effective .
