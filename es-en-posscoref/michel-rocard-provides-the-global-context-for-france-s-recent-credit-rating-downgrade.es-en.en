What \ u0027s Ailing France ? 
PARIS - France is gravely ill . 
So ill , in fact , that Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s recently cut its sovereign-credit rating - the country &apos;s second downgrade in less than two years . 
The decision was accompanied by warnings that the budgetary and structural reforms that President Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s administration has implemented over the last year have been inadequate to improve France &apos;s medium-term growth prospects . 
Now , the pressure is on for structural reforms covering everything from labor markets to taxation . 
While the S &amp; P downgrade was unexpected , it was not exactly shocking . 
The recent downturn in France &apos;s industrial output has created large trade deficits , and is undermining the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises . 
Unemployment stands at about 11 % , with a record-high 3.3 million workers registered as jobless in October . 
At the same time , political crisis is impeding the government &apos;s pursuit of difficult reforms . 
French leaders have demonstrated an inability to communicate effectively or apply past experiences in analyzing current threats . 
Instead , they are resorting to diversionary tactics by engaging in overblown rhetorical battles about minor controversies . 
But they cannot ignore their problems forever , and the consequences of delaying the reforms that France needs could be catastrophic . 
And yet , viewed from a broader perspective , France &apos;s problems are largely symptoms of a disease that is affecting the entire global economy ( including the European Union &apos;s southern members ) . 
In recent decades , unfettered capitalism has produced significant mutations worldwide . 
For starters , industrialism has become obsolete . 
In the advanced countries , the market for first-time purchases of mass-market goods like cars , refrigerators , and televisions is saturated , while the secondary market for used and reconditioned goods has become much less dynamic , undermining employment in repairs and renovations . 
With no industrial good that still requires a large-scale labor force - and the communications and services industries unable to fill the gap - employment is shrinking and economic growth is stagnating . 
The second mutation stems from excessive shareholder dominance , which has been on the rise for more than three decades . 
Gathered into pension , investment , and hedge funds , shareholders can place considerable pressure on companies to extract dividends , using performance-based bonuses to gain executive support for their preferred policies . 
This has led to excessive workforce externalization , high rates of CEO turnover , takeover bids , and restructurings of all kinds - all which have far-reaching consequences . 
In OECD countries , the share of salaries in GDP has fallen by about ten percentage points , on average , to roughly 57 % . 
Cumulative figures for the last 30 years vary from $ 200-300 trillion . 
For this reason , consumption - the main driver of economic growth - has stagnated since 2000 , while unemployment rates have risen almost everywhere , creating instability that affects even those who still have jobs . 
Capitalism &apos;s third mutation is the extreme financialization of economies and societies . 
Financial and industrial managers are compensated at a level that most of the world would struggle even to imagine . 
And the unrestrained expansion of financial markets , notably the proliferation of derivatives , led directly to the crisis that engulfed the Western banking system in 2007-2008 . 
Governments , in order to contain the fallout of the crisis , ran up public debt , including in countries whose balance sheets had already been weakened significantly by declining GDP growth . 
In many countries - particularly in Southern Europe - bleak economic circumstances are generating social tension , political apathy , civil unrest , and delinquency . 
The persistent specter of climate change only compounds public anxiety . 
This is obviously not the ideal environment for France - not to mention the struggling economies of Southern Europe - to implement difficult structural reforms . 
But , by changing its economic doctrine , Europe can improve its prospects considerably . 
Instead of remaining on the German-led path of orthodoxy - which , through counter-productive austerity and deflation ( forcing down domestic wages and prices ) , has turned stabilization into recession - Europe must develop a growth-based strategy to overcome the crisis once and for all . 
Many economists , including the Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz , advocate precisely such a policy change for Europe . 
Only by heeding their recommendations , and demonstrating a shared capacity for - and commitment to - long-term thinking , can France and its troubled southern European neighbors finally begin to recover enough strength to do what they must for their long-term health .
