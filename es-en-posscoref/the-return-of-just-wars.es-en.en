The Return of Just Wars ? 
SALZBURG - As war loomed over Kosovo ten years ago , Germany &apos;s then foreign minister , Joschka Fischer , explained that the principle that had always governed his involvement in politics was : &quot; Never again war ; never again Auschwitz ! &quot; 
Ethnic cleansing and violence in Kosovo , however , soon made it clear to him that there were moments when one had to choose between those two imperatives : a new Auschwitz sometimes could be prevented only by means of war . 
The idea of a &quot; just war , &quot; legitimized by a justa causa ( just cause ) , though scorned for many years , is thus back in vogue . 
The notion used to be frowned upon because any warring party tends to view its own cause as just . 
Moreover , in the absence of an impartial judge , a winner can always impose his &quot; truth &quot; upon the vanquished , as happened with the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. 
While &quot; just wars &quot; seem to be back , international law has also come to condemn waging aggressive ( &quot; unjust &quot; ) war as a punishable crime , with the consequence that every warring party now declares its wars to be a defense against foreign attack , much as Hitler did in 1939 . 
( Indeed , all war ministries have become &quot; defense ministries , &quot; leaving one to wonder against whom a country must be defended if there are no longer any attackers . ) 
But in this matter as well , the winner gets to judge who was the aggressor , so it is fortunate that Hitler did not prevail . 
Of course , military intervention for purposes beyond defending one &apos;s country remains possible , but requires a UN Security Council resolution . 
The latter alone , provided no permanent member of the Security Council disagrees , can decide whether a war is legitimized by a &quot; just cause &quot; ( nowadays generally a gross breach of human rights ) . 
The Security Council &apos;s permanent members thus remain legibus soluti , i.e. , sovereign in the seventeenth-century sense of the word , meaning &quot; able to do evil with impunity . &quot; 
The right of humanitarian intervention limits the sovereignty of all other countries . 
Behind this is the notion that respect for human rights can be enforced externally , together with the hope that rulers will behave better because they recognize that they may be held accountable for violating human rights . 
Whether this hope is justified remains to be seen . 
In the meantime , the return to the idea of a &quot; just cause &quot; carries big risks , especially evident when , as happened in Georgia , a great power claims the mantle of a protector of the rights of its nationals in a neighboring country . 
If this idea stands , Russian minorities from the Baltic to the Crimea may turn out to be ticking time bombs . 
The idea of the &quot; moral indifference &quot; of the law of war is based on the recognition that wars will not be eliminated , and that they should instead be limited and their horrors mitigated by universally applicable rules of conduct . 
Precisely because it is less ambitious than the principle of &quot; just war , &quot; moral indifference has been tremendously successful in mitigating war &apos;s horrors by banning some particularly inhuman types of weapons , forcing armies to protect civilians and accord humane treatment to prisoners of war , banning annexations , etc . 
The pacifist Leo Tolstoy , in his novel War and Peace , regarded this pruning and tending of war as cynical . 
Wars shouldn &apos;t happen at all , he believed . 
On the other hand , Tolstoy justified the unrestrained and unregulated eruption of public anger and the furious slaying of retreating French soldiers by Russian peasants . 
Mao would approve . 
Pacifists want to understand war as a lawless condition that should be abolished . 
The medieval Popes practiced this wisdom when they limited permissible wars to certain times of year . 
But any &quot; last stand &quot; type of warfare refuses to recognize the possibility of a future war for which it may be a precedent . 
Such a war will always be without rules , always a total war . 
After all , when it &apos;s do or die , no laws apply . 
So the object of international law is not to ban &quot; unjust &quot; wars and permit &quot; just &quot; ones , but to assure that wars are waged for limited aims , so that they don &apos;t rage out of control . 
You have to be able to lose without losing everything . 
The language of justice and injustice , and demands of unconditional surrender and criminal retribution for the vanquished only promote - indeed , provoke - total war . 
The flip side of the criminalization of &quot; aggressive &quot; war is the fact that peace is also no longer a reliable legal state that can be ended only by a formal declaration of war . 
When state leaders decide to bomb a city like Belgrade without any formal end to peace , they are not engaging in war , but in a form of state terrorism . 
Terrorism will prevail if its mentality infects the civilized world , and if state leaders resort to terror to fight terror . 
Fighting terrorism is not a war , because terrorism itself is not a warring party , but a means to an end . 
Terrorists , when caught , are subject to criminal sanctions and punishment under the law . 
Countries unwilling or unable to prevent terrorist violence emanating from their territory forfeit their right to territorial integrity , and others can declare war on them to pursue the problem at its root . 
But those who adhere to the motto &quot; Terror can only be countered with terror &quot; should remember who coined that phrase : Adolf Hitler .
