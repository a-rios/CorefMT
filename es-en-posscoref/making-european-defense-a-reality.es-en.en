Making European Defense a Reality 
BRUSSELS - Anyone reflecting on the value , weight , and relevance of today &apos;s European military forces for global affairs needs to keep two crucial questions in mind : Where do we want to go ? 
What do we want to achieve ? 
The EU &apos;s goal is to be a global player with its own foreign policy , one shared by its 27 member states . 
Any effective foreign policy clearly needs to rely on effective military and civilian resources . 
But this goal does not mean that the EU will compete with NATO . 
Whereas NATO is a political-military alliance , the EU endorses the development of a community of national destinies . 
Moreover , NATO benefits from the military might of a dominant nation , while the EU must depend on the shared voluntary efforts of its members . 
For two key reasons , it would be more correct to say that NATO and the European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) are complementary . 
First , certain countries turn specifically to Europe for help . 
Whether in sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East , their populations and governments are more inclined - for political , historical , or cultural reasons - to request European rather than NATO assistance . 
Conversely , there are certain long-term crises , such as those provoked by terrorism , for which NATO is better placed to act . 
For example , given its member states &quot; current resources , the EU , acting alone , would be unable to ensure a Western commitment in Afghanistan . 
At the same time , the governments of Chad and the Central African Republic would never have accepted NATO &apos;s intervention to help resolve the Darfur crisis . 
Second , the EU is building its crisis management know-how on the basis of a global approach . 
Military resources are only one tool among many others , and , generally speaking , their deployment is clearly defined , limited in time , and coordinated with civilian action . 
As a result , the EU doesn &apos;t need the articulated military structure that NATO possesses . 
The recent creation in Brussels of the Civilian Planning Conduct Capability , based on a system comparable to that of a military chain of command , demonstrates - and , above all , guarantees - cohesive action . 
In the same way , EUFOR military commanders regularly and frequently exchange information with the heads of such EU civil missions as the EUPOL police mission , the EUSEC security reform mission , the EUJUST justice mission , and so on , including , if present , the European Commission &apos;s own representatives . 
Being able to act militarily requires capable , flexible forces that are suited to their mission . 
Their essential tasks should be movement , information gathering , and , if necessary , combat . 
Moreover , their main qualities should be resistance - the ability to hold out - and the psychological resilience to deal successfully with an &quot; intense &quot; situation and to respond to it by exerting the best possible control . 
This implies a high level of cohesion , which in the case of multinational forces is not guaranteed . 
But the EU &apos;s &quot; Battlegroups &quot; are a first response to this requirement . 
As multinational forces that are built either on regional affiliations or strong bilateral relations , they bestow a &quot; European &quot; label on military resources while guaranteeing efficiency in the field . 
Where necessary , they can be supported by air and maritime rapid response assets , and thus constitute a fully-fledged military resource for armed intervention . 
However , although about 15 Battlegroups have been created - two of which are , at any time , on permanent call for six months - none has actually been deployed since the Artemis &quot; prototype &quot; mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003 . 
As time passes , a concept without real commitment in the field may eventually raise suspicions about its relevance . 
The EU also suffers from a well-known lack of capacity in strategic air transport , in-theater air transport , and combat support . 
The European Defense Agency has a very important role to play in proposing and running programs to address these shortfalls . 
The Capability Development Plan , which the EDA is developing in close collaboration with the EU Military Committee , aims to foster and improve solidarity in terms of capability , which is what Europe needs . 
There are other areas in which we must make progress if the EU &apos;s military resources are to be brought into line with its political ambitions . 
One urgent need is simplification of our operational planning and the manner in which we conduct operations . 
Finally , as all of the EU &apos;s 27 member states are now trying to reduce public spending in sustainable ways , financing for military operations , without which nothing is possible , requires a new approach . 
Those member states that are most heavily involved in an operation , in terms of both human resources and military equipment , are penalized by the financial burden that this commitment places on their national budgets . 
Political solidarity must be underpinned by effective financial solidarity . 
As an integral part of the CFSP , today &apos;s ESDP and tomorrow &apos;s Common Security and Defense Policy will work only if the member states responsible for implementing them allocate the resources that they need . 
This implies a Europe-based approach that takes precedence over national considerations once national and European-level foreign policies are unified .
