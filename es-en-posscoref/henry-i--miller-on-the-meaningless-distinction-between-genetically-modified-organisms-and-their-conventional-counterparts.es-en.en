The GMO Stigma 
STANFORD - In August , at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines , a group of activists vandalized test fields of so-called &quot; golden rice , &quot; which has been genetically engineered to contain beta-carotene , a precursor of vitamin A. Some of the perpetrators were even supported by the Swedish government &apos;s International Development Cooperation Agency via its funding of the radical Filipino group MASIPAG . 
For poor people whose diet is composed largely of rice - a carbohydrate-rich but vitamin-poor source of calories - &quot; biofortified &quot; strains are invaluable . 
In developing countries , 200-300 million preschool children are at risk of vitamin A deficiency , which compromises immune systems , increasing the body &apos;s susceptibility to illnesses like measles and diarrheal diseases . 
Every year , vitamin A deficiency causes blindness in about a half-million children ; some 70 % of them die within a year . 
In September , an eminent group of scientists called upon the scientific community to &quot; stand together in staunch opposition to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances , such as golden rice , that have the potential to save millions &quot; of people from &quot; needless suffering and death . &quot; 
But this passionate appeal fails to address the fundamental problem : the unfounded notion that there is a meaningful difference between &quot; genetically modified organisms &quot; and their conventional counterparts . 
The fact is that GMOs and their derivatives do not amount to a &quot; category &quot; of food products . 
They are neither less safe nor less &quot; natural &quot; than other common foods . 
Labeling foods derived from GMOs , as some have proposed , thus implies a meaningful difference where none exists - an issue that even regulators have acknowledged . 
Humans have been engaging in &quot; genetic modification &quot; through selection and hybridization for millennia . 
Breeders routinely use radiation or chemical mutagens on seeds to scramble a plant &apos;s DNA and generate new traits . 
A half-century of &quot; wide cross &quot; hybridizations , which involve the movement of genes from one species or genus to another , has given rise to plants - including everyday varieties of corn , oats , pumpkin , wheat , black currants , tomatoes , and potatoes - that do not and could not exist in nature . 
Indeed , with the exception of wild berries , wild game , wild mushrooms , and fish and shellfish , virtually everything in North American and European diets has been genetically improved in some way . 
Despite the lack of scientific justification for skepticism about genetically engineered crops - indeed , no cases of harm to humans or disruption to ecosystems have been documented - they have been the most scrutinized foods in human history . 
The assumption that &quot; genetically engineered &quot; or &quot; genetically modified &quot; is a meaningful - and dangerous - classification has led not only to vandalism of field trials , but also to destruction of laboratories and assaults on researchers . 
Moreover , the GMO classification has encouraged unscientific regulatory approaches that are not commensurate with the level of risk , and that , by discriminating against modern molecular genetic-engineering techniques , inhibit agricultural innovation that could reduce strain on the natural environment and enhance global food security . 
Even as study after study - both formal risk assessments and &quot; real-world &quot; observations - has confirmed the technology &apos;s safety , the regulatory burden placed on GMOs has continued to grow . 
This trend is making the testing and development of many crops with commercial and humanitarian potential economically unfeasible . 
Despite robust laboratory research on plants since the invention of modern genetic-engineering techniques in the early 1970 &quot; s , the commercialization of products has lagged . 
Unprovoked attention from regulators inevitably stigmatizes any product or technology . 
Endless discussion of the &quot; coexistence &quot; of genetically engineered and &quot; conventional &quot; organisms has reinforced the stigma , leading activists to pursue frivolous yet damaging litigation . 
For example , in at least four lawsuits brought against regulators in the United States , judges initially ruled that regulators had failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the US National Environmental Policy Act . 
And marketing as &quot; natural &quot; products that contain genetically engineered ingredients has led to lawsuits for false labeling . 
The discriminatory treatment of GMOs creates widespread mischief . 
In many places , the location of field trials now must be identified , even including GPS coordinates - a practice that facilitates vandalism . 
( And activists frequently destroy conventional plants inadvertently , because they are difficult to distinguish from genetically engineered varieties . ) 
In 1936 , the Nobel laureate Max Planck observed that scientific innovations rarely spread as a result of their opponents &quot; conversion ; instead , opponents of innovation &quot; gradually die out , &quot; and the next generation accepts the breakthrough . 
This was the case with vaccinations and the recognition that DNA is the stuff of heredity - and it will happen eventually with genetic engineering . 
Unfortunately , many will suffer needlessly in the interim . 
As University of California agricultural economist David Zilberman and his colleagues have written , the lost benefits are &quot; irreversible , both in the sense that past harvests have been lower than they would have been if the technology had been introduced and in the sense that yield growth is a cumulative process of which the onset has been delayed . &quot; 
As long as today &apos;s activists and regulators remain convinced that GMOs represent a distinct and dangerous category of research and products , genetic engineering will fall short of its potential . 
That is bad news for the millions of poor people for whom genetic engineering in agriculture , medicine , and environmental science could offer a healthier , more secure future .
