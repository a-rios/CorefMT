Golden Slumbers 
CAMBRIDGE - In principle , holding gold is a form of insurance against war , financial Armageddon , and wholesale currency debasement . 
And , from the onset of the global financial crisis , the price of gold has often been portrayed as a barometer of global economic insecurity . 
So , does the collapse in gold prices - from a peak of $ 1,900 per ounce in August 2011 to under $ 1,250 at the beginning of July 2013 - represent a vote of confidence in the global economy ? 
To say that the gold market displays all of the classic features of a bubble gone bust is to oversimplify . 
There is no doubt that gold &apos;s heady rise to the peak , from around $ 350 per ounce in July 2003 , had investors drooling . 
The price would rise today because everyone had become convinced that it would rise even further tomorrow . 
Doctors and dentists started selling stocks and buying gold coins . 
Demand for gold jewelry in India and China soared . 
Emerging-market central banks diversified out of dollars and into gold . 
The case for buying gold had several strong components . 
Ten years ago , gold was selling at well below its long-term inflation-adjusted average , and the integration of three billion emerging-market citizens into the global economy could only mean a giant long-term boost to demand . 
That element of the story , incidentally , remains valid . 
The global financial crisis added to gold &apos;s allure , owing initially to fear of a second Great Depression . 
Later , some investors feared that governments would unleash inflation to ease the burden of soaring public debt and address persistent unemployment . 
As central banks brought policy interest rates down to zero , no one cared that gold yields no interest . 
But it is also true that as the price rose , a growing number of na√Øve investors sought to buy in . 
Lately , of course , the fundamentals have reversed somewhat , and the speculative frenzy has reversed even more . 
China &apos;s economy continues to soften ; 
By contrast , despite the ill-advised fiscal sequester , the US economy appears to be healing gradually . 
Global interest rates have risen 100 basis points since the US Federal Reserve started suggesting - quite prematurely , in my view - that it would wind down its policy of quantitative easing . 
With the Fed underscoring its strong anti-inflation bias , it is harder to argue that investors need gold as a hedge against high inflation . 
And , as the doctors and dentists who were buying gold coins two years ago now unload them , it is not yet clear where the downward price spiral will stop . 
Some are targeting the psychologically compelling $ 1,000 barrier . 
In fact , the case for or against gold has not changed all that much since 2010 , when I last wrote about it . 
In October of that year , the price of gold - the consummate faith-based speculative asset - was on the way up , having just hit $ 1,300 . 
But the real case for holding it , then as now , was never a speculative one . 
Rather , gold is a hedge . 
If you are a high-net-worth investor , or a sovereign wealth fund , it makes perfect sense to hold a small percentage of your assets in gold as a hedge against extreme events . 
Holding gold can also make sense for middle-class and poor households in countries - for example , China and India - that significantly limit access to other financial investments . 
For most others , gold is just another gamble that one can make . 
Unless governments firmly set the price of gold , as they did before World War I , the market for it will inevitably be risky and volatile . 
In a study published in January , the economists Claude Erb and Campbell Harvey consider several possible models of gold &apos;s fundamental price , and find that gold is at best only loosely tethered to any of them . 
Instead , the price of gold often seems to drift far above or far below its fundamental long-term value for extended periods . 
( This behavior is , of course , not unlike that of many other financial assets , such as exchange rates or stock prices , though gold &apos;s price swings may be more extreme . ) 
Gold bugs sometimes cite isolated historical data that suggest that gold &apos;s long-term value has remained stable over the millennia . 
For example , Stephen Harmston &apos;s oft-cited 1998 study points to anecdotal evidence that an ounce of gold bought 350 loaves of bread in the time of Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , who died in 562 BC . 
Of course , we do not have annual data for Babylonian gold prices . 
So the recent collapse of gold prices has not really changed the case for investing in it one way or the other . 
Yes , prices could easily fall below $ 1,000 ; but , then again , they might rise . 
Meanwhile , policymakers should be cautious in interpreting the plunge in gold prices as a vote of confidence in their performance .
