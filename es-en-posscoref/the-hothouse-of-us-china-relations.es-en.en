The Hothouse of US-China Relations 
As Hu Jintao , China &apos;s Communist Party Secretary General and President , prepares to visit the US on April 20 , myriad unresolved issues are disturbing Sino-US relations . 
Debates rage over the bilateral trade balance and revaluation of the renminbi , the status of Taiwan and Tibet , human rights violations , and intellectual property theft . 
China &apos;s role in restraining North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions and its tense relations with Japan are an additional burden on ties . 
There is even disagreement about whether Hu &apos;s trip to Washington is an official &quot; state visit . &quot; 
These issues will dominate the headlines , but they pale in comparison to another problem that is on neither side &apos;s agenda : global warming . 
That is a pity , because as British Prime Minister Tony Blair recently observed , over the long term , &quot; there is no issue more important than climate change , &quot; and there can be no agreement to reduce it &quot; that doesn &apos;t involve China , America and India . &quot; 
Moreover , climate change is no longer such a long-term problem , and only the lunatic fringe remains in doubt about whether the escalating use of carbon-based fuels is responsible for global warming . 
Indeed , recent assessments by the British Antarctic Survey suggest that temperatures over the Antarctic have increased 3.6 degrees since the early 1970 &quot; s , and that warming is taking place far faster than researchers had hitherto believed . 
Similarly , the journal Science reports that new studies show that ocean levels may rise much more rapidly and precipitously than anticipated . 
Although the US and China are the world &apos;s two primary producers of greenhouse gases - the US being the largest - neither has signed the Kyoto Protocol , which commits countries to cut carbon emissions 5 % below 1990 levels by 2008-12 . 
With China and the US out of the picture , the problem will likely get far worse before it gets better . 
The increasing climate-change danger is mainly due to developments in China . 
The country derives almost 76 % of its energy needs from coal , burning almost 2.2 billion tons of it in 2005 , with consumption set to rise to 2.6 billion tons by 2010 . 
Moreover , car production soared from only 640,000 in 2000 to 3.1 million by 2005 , and annual growth is expected to continue rising by 80 % . 
Petroleum independent until 1993 , China now consumes more and more imported petroleum every year , and power consumption is predicted to double by 2025 , requiring an average of one new coal-fired plant to come on line each week . 
Small wonder , then , that the water in 75 % of China &apos;s rivers is undrinkable , that the country is home to seven of the world &apos;s most polluted cities , and that one can often live in Beijing or Shanghai for weeks without ever seeing the sun . 
Indeed , China is on the precipice of becoming an environmental wasteland . 
Unlike George W. Bush &apos;s administration , which remains cavalier in its disregard for the warning signs of climate danger both at home and globally , Hu Jintao &apos;s leadership has begun to evince a hopeful assertiveness , at least in domestic environmental policy . 
There is a paradox here : while China &apos;s central government is trying to provide national environmental leadership , local governments have often resisted . 
In the US , it is the federal government that has been weak - even retrograde - in providing environmental leadership , while states such as California have led the way with higher standards . 
While US Vice President Dick Cheney denigrates the idea of energy conservation , China &apos;s leaders have adopted a new five-year plan that commits the country to cut energy use by one-fifth , industrial pollution by one-tenth , and industrial water consumption by one-third . 
A 12 % tax increase has been imposed on gas-guzzling cars , along with reductions for cars with small-engines , and a new 5 % tax is being levied on wooden flooring and even chopsticks , which are estimated to use two million cubic meters of timber each year . 
Nevertheless , because both Hu and Bush fear the economic effects of reducing their country &apos;s carbon emissions , each has hidden behind the non-participation of the other to justify absence from international efforts and failure to assume a global leadership role . 
Having awakened to the environmental threat , the next challenge for Hu is to begin translating some of China &apos;s new awareness and boldness into its foreign policy - exactly what the US has failed to do . 
It would be a pity if China , the new industrial hub of the world , overlooked the benefits of capitalizing economically on the multinational effort to control carbon emissions that is inevitable if the global environment is to remain hospitable . 
Indeed , any national leadership that anticipates the new research , development , manufacturing , and trade possibilities that will grow out of this new imperative may find itself positioned for exactly the kind of sustained economic growth that every country seeks . 
If the US and China were to team up to address the challenge of climate change , the results might not only be a more congenial climate and a better Sino-US relationship , but also new and vibrant economic sectors in both countries . 
If climate change were on the agenda for Hu &apos;s upcoming trip , the meeting , whether or not it is designated a &quot; state visit , &quot; could be one of historic consequence .
