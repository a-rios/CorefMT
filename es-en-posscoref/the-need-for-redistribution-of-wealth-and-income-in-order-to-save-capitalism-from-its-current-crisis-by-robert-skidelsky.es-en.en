Inequality is Killing Capitalism 
LONDON - It is generally agreed that the crisis of 2008-2009 was caused by excessive bank lending , and that the failure to recover adequately from it stems from banks &quot; refusal to lend , owing to their &quot; broken &quot; balance sheets . 
A typical story , much favored by followers of Friedrich von Hayek and the Austrian School of economics , goes like this : In the run up to the crisis , banks lent more money to borrowers than savers would have been prepared to lend otherwise , thanks to excessively cheap money provided by central banks , particularly the United States Federal Reserve . 
Commercial banks , flush with central banks &quot; money , advanced credit for many unsound investment projects , with the explosion of financial innovation ( particularly of derivative instruments ) fueling the lending frenzy . 
This inverted pyramid of debt collapsed when the Fed finally put a halt to the spending spree by hiking up interest rates . 
( The Fed raised its benchmark federal funds rate from 1 % in 2004 to 5.25 % in 2006 and held it there until August 2007 ) . 
As a result , house prices collapsed , leaving a trail of zombie banks ( whose liabilities far exceeded their assets ) and ruined borrowers . 
The problem now appears to be one of re-starting bank lending . 
Impaired banks that do not want to lend must somehow be &quot; made whole . &quot; 
This has been the purpose of the vast bank bailouts in the US and Europe , followed by several rounds of &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; by which central banks print money and pump it into the banking system through a variety of unorthodox channels . 
( Hayekians object to this , arguing that , because the crisis was caused by excessive credit , it cannot be overcome with more . ) 
At the same time , regulatory regimes have been toughened everywhere to prevent banks from jeopardizing the financial system again . 
For example , in addition to its price-stability mandate , the Bank of England has been given the new task of maintaining &quot; the stability of the financial system . &quot; 
This analysis , while seemingly plausible , depends on the belief that it is the supply of credit that is essential to economic health : too much money ruins it , while too little destroys it . 
But one can take another view , which is that demand for credit , rather than supply , is the crucial economic driver . 
After all , banks are bound to lend on adequate collateral ; and , in the run-up to the crisis , rising house prices provided it . 
The supply of credit , in other words , resulted from the demand for credit . 
This puts the question of the origins of the crisis in a somewhat different light . 
It was not so much predatory lenders as it was imprudent , or deluded , borrowers , who bear the blame . 
So the question arises : Why did people want to borrow so much ? 
Why did the ratio of household debt to income soar to unprecedented heights in the pre-recession days ? 
Let us agree that people are greedy , and that they always want more than they can afford . 
Why , then , did this &quot; greed &quot; manifest itself so manically ? 
To answer that , we must look at what was happening to the distribution of income . 
The world was getting steadily richer , but the income distribution within countries was becoming steadily more unequal . 
Median incomes have been stagnant or even falling for the last 30 years , even as per capita GDP has grown . 
This means that the rich have been creaming off a giant share of productivity growth . 
And what did the relatively poor do to &quot; keep up with the Joneses &quot; in this world of rising standards ? 
They did what the poor have always done : got into debt . 
In an earlier era , they became indebted to the pawnbroker ; now they are indebted to banks or credit-card companies . 
And , because their poverty was only relative and house prices were racing ahead , creditors were happy to let them sink deeper and deeper into debt . 
Of course , some worried about the collapse of the household savings rate , but few were overly concerned . 
In one of his last articles , Milton Friedman wrote that savings nowadays took the form of houses . 
To me , this view of things explains much better than the orthodox account why , for all the money-pumping by central banks , commercial banks have not started lending again , and the economic recovery has petered out . 
Just as lenders did not force money on the public before the crisis , so now they cannot force heavily indebted households to borrow , or businesses to seek loans to expand production when markets are flat or shrinking . 
In short , recovery cannot be left to the Fed , the European Central Bank , or the Bank of England . 
It requires the active involvement of fiscal policymakers . 
Our current situation requires not a lender of last resort , but a spender of last resort , and that can only be governments . 
If governments , with their already-high level of indebtedness , believe that they cannot borrow any more from the public , they should borrow from their central banks and spend the extra money themselves on public works and infrastructure projects . 
This is the only way to get the big economies of the West moving again . 
But , beyond this , we cannot carry on with a system that allows so much of the national income and wealth to pile up in so few hands . 
Concerted redistribution of wealth and income has frequently been essential to the long-term survival of capitalism . 
We are about to learn that lesson again .
