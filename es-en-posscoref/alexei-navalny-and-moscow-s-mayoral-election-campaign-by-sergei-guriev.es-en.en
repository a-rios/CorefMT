The Battle for Moscow 
PARIS - Today &apos;s most important political battle in Russia is not for control of the Kremlin , but for power over its capital city . 
Indeed , the outcome of Moscow &apos;s mayoral election campaign concerns every Russian - and everyone who is interested in Russia &apos;s fate . 
Just as presidential elections in the United States matter for the entire world , mayoral elections in Moscow matter for Russia &apos;s national politics - and thus for its economy . 
So what happens in Moscow on September 8 ( and , possibly , in the run-off election two weeks later ) will have profound implications for the country &apos;s future . 
The election is a watershed for several reasons . 
For starters , this is the first Moscow mayoral campaign since President Vladimir Putin canceled subnational elections in 2005 . 
( Putin &apos;s one-term successor , Dmitri Medvedev , now the prime minister , reinstated them in 2011 . ) 
Since the last mayoral election in 2004 , Moscow has changed dramatically . 
It is now not only the largest and most important subnational entity in the Russian Federation ; it also is a major European capital , a global business destination , and a large consumer market . 
Per capita income in Moscow is similar to that of Spain or Italy . 
The size of Moscow &apos;s city budget is close to that of New York City . 
Officially 12 million people live in Moscow ( not counting commuters and irregular immigrants ) - more than in an average European country . 
And yet , before this year , Moscow &apos;s mayor was appointed by the federal government , not elected by Muscovites . 
Second , the ongoing mayoral race is an unusually competitive election in Putin &apos;s Russia . 
The most important indication of this is the participation of Alexei Navalny - by far the Kremlin &apos;s most persistent political opponent . 
Navalny was registered as a candidate in the election and joined the campaign a day after being released from jail , following his conviction - and five-year prison sentence - in a completely fabricated case . 
Why the government first imprisoned him and then released him less than 24 hours later remains a mystery . 
What is clear is that the authorities want the Moscow mayoral election to be substantially more competitive than anyone expected it to be . 
Third , thanks to Navalny &apos;s participation , the Moscow election has fostered - for the first time ever - genuine grassroots politics in Russia . 
Denied access to TV , Navalny has launched a US-style door-to-door campaign . 
He has enlisted an unprecedented 15,000 volunteers ( mostly young ) and has raised - again unprecedented for Russia - $ 1.5 million dollars from 8,000 Russian citizens to finance his campaign . 
Navalny &apos;s volunteers not only promote his message through social media ; they also distribute his program and talk to voters in Moscow &apos;s streets and Metro . 
Most impressive ( and completely unheard of in Russia ) , Navalny himself organizes three street rallies every weekday and five rallies on Saturdays and Sundays . 
His goal is to hold a hundred such rallies by the end of the campaign . 
Finally , Navalny &apos;s background and support base give him a level of moral authority with voters that other politicians in Putin &apos;s Russia cannot attain . 
Navalny &apos;s campaign is crowd-funded by ordinary Russians , who understand that he is not on the payroll of an oligarch or the government . 
Indeed , Navalny has been a persistent and effective critic of corruption in both the Russian government and state-owned companies . 
Moreover , even though his emails have been hacked and published , and the government has searched his home and confiscated his computers and phones , there are no convincing charges against him - except for the obviously politically motivated cases . 
As a result , voters can be confident that Navalny , who refused to bow to legal intimidation , is clean , and that he is running for the job not for his own material benefit or to do the bidding of any particular interest group , but because he believes in a greater good . 
A campaign such as Navalny &apos;s certainly bodes well for Russia &apos;s future . 
Indeed , the absence of genuine political competition and the public &apos;s lack of confidence in Russia &apos;s politicians are the country &apos;s main problems , for they undermine the rule of law , enable interest groups to &quot; capture &quot; state institutions , and encourage corruption , all of which have led to capital flight and a brain drain . 
Thus , Navalny &apos;s growing support in Moscow is good news not only for Russian citizens , but also for those who invest in Russia . 
To be sure , there are still many reasons to be worried . 
Navalny certainly is not perfect , and , though the Moscow election may be competitive by Russian standards , it is still outrageously unfair in terms of media access , financing , and voter intimidation . 
Putin and the ruling party did not win a majority in Moscow in the 2011 Duma election or the 2012 presidential election , but they seem confident of victory in the city this time . 
And Navalny &apos;s five-year prison sentence remains in place , pending an appeal whose outcome is completely uncertain . 
Even so , what we are witnessing in Moscow far exceeds anyone &apos;s expectations . 
Win or lose , Navalny &apos;s campaign will have a lasting impact .
