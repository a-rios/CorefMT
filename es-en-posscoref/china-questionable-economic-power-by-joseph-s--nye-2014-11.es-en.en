China &apos;s Questionable Economic Power 
TOKYO - The World Bank recently announced that China &apos;s economy will surpass that of the United States this year , measured according to purchasing power parity ( PPP ) . 
Though PPP can serve some purpose in comparing welfare across countries , it is affected significantly by population size . 
India , the world &apos;s tenth largest economy measured according to the market exchange rate of the US dollar and the Indian rupee , is the third largest in PPP terms . 
Moreover , power resources , such as the cost of imported oil or an advanced fighter aircraft engine , are better judged according to the exchange rates of the currencies that must be used to pay for them . 
To be sure , total size is an important aspect of economic power . 
China has an attractive market and is many countries &quot; largest trading partner - important sources of leverage that China &apos;s leaders are not afraid to wield . 
But , even if China &apos;s overall GDP surpasses that of the US ( by whatever measure ) , the two economies will maintain very different structures and levels of sophistication . 
And China &apos;s per capita income - a more accurate measure of economic sophistication - amounts to only 20 % of America &apos;s , and will take decades , at least , to catch up ( if it ever does ) . 
Moreover , as Chinese officials and researchers have acknowledged , though China surpassed Germany in 2009 as the world &apos;s largest exporter by volume , it has yet to develop into a truly &quot; strong &quot; trading country , owing to lackluster trade in services and low value-added production . 
And China lacks the kind of strong international brands that trade powerhouses like the US and Germany boast ; indeed , 17 of the top 25 global brands are American . 
China &apos;s lagging economic sophistication is also reflected in its financial markets , which are only one-eighth the size of America &apos;s , with foreigners permitted to own only a tiny portion of Chinese debt . 
Though China has tried to increase its financial clout by encouraging the international use of its currency , renminbi-denominated trade still represents just 9 % of the global total , compared to the dollar &apos;s 81 % share . 
Not even China &apos;s massive foreign-currency reserves - the world &apos;s largest , at nearly $ 4 trillion - will be adequate to boost its financial leverage , unless the authorities create a deep and open bond market with liberalized interest rates and an easily convertible currency . 
These reserves do not give China much direct bargaining power over the US , either , given that interdependent relationships depend on asymmetries . 
China holds dollars that it receives from its exports to America , while the US , by keeping its market open to Chinese products , helps to generate growth , employment , and stability in China . 
Yes , China could bring the US economy to its knees by dumping its dollars , but not without taking a serious hit itself . 
The differences between China and the US in terms of economic sophistication extend to technology as well . 
Despite some important achievements , China relies on copying foreign inventions more than domestic innovation for its technological progress . 
Though China is issuing more patents than ever , few represent groundbreaking inventions . 
Chinese often complain that they produce iPhone jobs , but not Steve Jobs . 
In the coming decades , China &apos;s GDP growth will slow , as occurs in all economies once they reach a certain level of development - usually the per capita income level , in PPP terms , that China is approaching . 
After all , China cannot rely on imported technologies and cheap labor to support growth forever . 
The Harvard economists Lant Pritchett and Lawrence Summers have concluded that regression to the mean would place Chinese growth at 3.9 % for the next two decades . 
But this straightforward statistical estimate does not account for the serious problems that China must address in the coming years , such as rising inequality between rural and urban areas and between coastal and inland regions . 
Other major challenges include a bloated and inefficient state sector , environmental degradation , massive internal migration , an inadequate social safety net , corruption , and weak rule of law . 
Moreover , China will face increasingly adverse demographic conditions . 
After enforcing a one-child policy for more than three decades , China &apos;s labor force is set to peak in 2016 , with elderly dependents outnumbering children by 2030 . 
China &apos;s authoritarian political system has demonstrated an impressive ability to meet specific targets , from the construction of high-speed railways to the creation of entire new cities . 
What China &apos;s government is not yet prepared to do is respond effectively to increasingly loud demands for political participation - if not democracy - that tend to accompany rising per capita GDP . 
Will political change occur when per capita nominal GDP , now at roughly $ 7,000 , approaches $ 10,000 , as occurred in neighboring South Korea and Taiwan ? 
It remains to be seen whether China can develop a formula to manage an expanding urban middle class , regional inequality , and , in many places , restive ethnic minorities . 
Its lagging economic sophistication may complicate matters further . 
In any case , it means that aggregate GDP , however it is measured , is inadequate to determine when - and whether - China will overtake the US in economic power .
