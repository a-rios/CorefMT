The End of China &apos;s Surplus 
CAMBRIDGE - China &apos;s current-account surplus - the combination of its trade surplus and its net income from foreign investments - is the largest in the world . 
With a trade surplus of $ 190 billion and the income from its nearly $ 3 trillion portfolio of foreign assets , China &apos;s external surplus stands at $ 316 billion , or 6.1 % of annual GDP . 
Because the current-account surplus is denominated in foreign currencies , China must use these funds to invest abroad , primarily by purchasing government bonds issued by the United States and European countries . 
As a result , interest rates in those countries are lower than they would otherwise be . 
That may all be about to change . 
The policies that China will adopt as part of its new five-year plan will shrink its trade and current-account surpluses . 
It is possible that , before the end of the decade , China &apos;s current-account surplus will move into deficit , as the country imports more than it exports and spends its foreign-investment income on imports rather than on foreign securities . 
If that happens , China will no longer be a net buyer of US and other foreign bonds , putting upward pressure on interest rates in those countries . 
Although this scenario might now seem implausible , it is actually quite likely to occur . 
After all , the policies that China will implement in the next few years target the country &apos;s enormous saving rate - the cause of its large current-account surplus . 
In any country , the current-account balance is the difference between national saving and national investment in plant and equipment , housing , and inventories . 
This key fact is not a matter of economic theory or an historic regularity . 
It is a fundamental national-income accounting identity that must hold for every country in every year . 
So any country that reduces its saving without cutting its investment will see its current-account surplus decline . 
China &apos;s national saving rate - including household saving and business saving - is now about 45 % of its GDP , which is the highest rate in the world . 
But , looking ahead , the five-year plan will cause the saving rate to decline , as China seeks to increase consumer spending and therefore the standard of living of the average Chinese . 
The plan calls for a shift to higher real wages so that household income will rise as a share of GDP . 
Moreover , state-owned enterprises will be required to pay out a larger portion of their earnings as dividends . 
And the government will increase its spending on consumption services like health care , education , and housing . 
These policies are motivated by domestic considerations , as the Chinese government seeks to raise living standards more rapidly than the moderating growth rate of GDP . 
Their net effect will be to raise consumption as a share of GDP and to reduce the national saving rate . 
Since China &apos;s current-account surplus is now 6 % of its GDP , if the saving rate declines from the current 45 % to less than 39 % - still higher than any other country - the surplus will become a deficit . 
This outlook for the current-account balance does not depend on what happens to the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate against other currencies . 
The saving-investment imbalance is fundamental , and it alone determines a country &apos;s external position . 
But the fall in domestic saving is likely to cause the Chinese government to allow the renminbi to appreciate more rapidly . 
Higher domestic consumer spending would otherwise create inflationary pressures . 
Allowing the currency to appreciate will help to offset those pressures and restrain price growth . 
A stronger renminbi would reduce the import bill , including prices for oil and other production inputs , while making Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and foreign goods more attractive to Chinese consumers . 
This would cause a shift from exports to production for the domestic market , thereby shrinking the trade surplus , in addition to curbing inflation . 
China &apos;s trade surplus and the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate were high on the list of topics that President Hu Jintao and US President Barack Obama discussed when Hu visited Washington earlier this month . 
The Americans are eager for China to reduce its surplus and allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly . 
But they should be careful what they wish for , because a lower surplus and a stronger renminbi imply a day when China is no longer a net buyer of US government bonds . 
The US should start planning for that day now .
