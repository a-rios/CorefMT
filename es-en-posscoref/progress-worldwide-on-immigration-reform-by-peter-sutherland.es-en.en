The Changing Mood on Migration 
LONDON - Headlines about migration can seem unbearably stark : attacks on foreigners by neo-fascists in Greece , dozens of domestic workers on death row in the Gulf , a crass and callous campaign by the British government to drive out migrants . 
Yet , despite persistent and even rising anti-immigrant sentiment in much of the world , promising signs of a more enlightened approach to migration are emerging . 
The United States is in the midst of an intense debate on a sweeping immigration overhaul . 
After a quarter-century of near-paralysis , American legislators are close to agreeing on reforms that would allow 11 million undocumented migrants to earn citizenship . 
The proposed changes also would make the US a magnet for talent and creativity from around the world . 
The fiscal and economic arguments for a more liberal approach to migration have shaped the American debate . 
According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office , the US Senate &apos;s reform legislation , passed in June , would result in fiscal benefits worth almost $ 1 trillion over the next two decades . 
Supporters also point out that immigrants launched 28 % of all new American businesses in 2011 , even though they accounted for just 13 % of the population . 
The voices of both grassroots and establishment advocates have been equally decisive . 
&quot; Dreamers &quot; - children raised in the US but without legal status - have become the human face of reform . 
Business leaders , long afraid to participate in such a polarized debate , have finally entered the fray , arguing forcefully that immigration is critical to American competitiveness . 
Thanks in part to all this spirited work , 72 % of Americans , according to a recent Gallup poll , now consider immigration a net benefit for the country . 
Given its history , America &apos;s leadership on immigration is natural . 
Germany , on the other hand , is not widely considered progressive in this realm . 
Yet , fairly quietly , Germany has done as much as any other country in recent years to court foreigners and refashion itself as a country of immigration . 
One million people relocated to Germany in 2012 alone . 
Today , one-fifth of Germany &apos;s residents - and one-third of its schoolchildren - have a migrant background . 
In July , Germany jettisoned 40 % of its immigration rules , lowering barriers for mid-skilled workers like train drivers and machinists . 
For the highly skilled , its immigration laws are among the OECD &apos;s most liberal . 
And yet the German government estimates that the country will face a shortfall of two million skilled workers by 2020 . 
Recent reforms not only seek to attract immigrants , but also to help them fulfill their potential . 
Germany , for instance , is focused on helping foreigners get their qualifications recognized - so that , for example , doctors do not have to drive taxis . 
Public institutions like the police are hiring more immigrants . 
A &quot; Diversity Charter , &quot; launched in 2006 and originally endorsed by a mere four companies , now has more than 1,500 corporate signatories . 
And 4 % of candidates in September &apos;s parliamentary election have a migrant background , the highest ratio ever . 
Other countries have also gotten on the reform bandwagon . 
The United Arab Emirates has been revamping its laws to improve migrants &quot; living conditions and strengthen protection of their rights . 
Its activism is noteworthy , given the benighted approach to migrants typical in other Gulf countries , such as Saudi Arabia . 
Brazil , meanwhile , aims to gain a competitive edge by making it easier for foreigners to immigrate with their families . 
The list of reformers is growing . 
Even more surprising , new international norms are being advanced . 
The Domestic Workers Convention , adopted in 2011 , enters into force on September 5 , promising to extend labor protections to tens of millions of the most vulnerable migrant workers . 
The treaty is quickly gaining momentum , having been ratified in recent months by Germany , Italy , Argentina , and South Africa , among others . 
All this progress is coming at an opportune moment . 
In October , for only the second time in its history , the United Nations General Assembly will address international migration . 
The first such summit , in 2006 , gave birth to an important new institution , the Global Forum on Migration and Development . 
In the seven years since , the Forum has helped to foster trust , knowledge , and cooperation among states and other stakeholders . 
Collaboration has led to some stunning gains . 
Migrants used to pay a fee of almost 15 % on average to send money back home ; this has fallen to less than 9 % , and in some cases nearly to zero , which should be the universal goal . 
Given that migrants remitted $ 401 billion last year to developing countries alone , such progress is freeing up tens of billions of dollars for some of the world &apos;s poorest households . 
But even more ambitious action is needed . 
When they gather at the UN in October , policymakers should take courage from the reform trailblazers in the US , Germany , the UAE , and elsewhere . 
If profound change is possible at the national level in the face of toxic populism , it should come more easily at the international level , where cooperation produces mostly winners . 
( The losers generally are bad actors : smugglers , traffickers , abusive recruiters , and exploitative employers . ) 
States need not agree on all aspects of migration in order to settle on an agenda for common action . 
There is no shortage of problems to confront and opportunities to seize . 
We need to rein in the bad actors ; eliminate discrimination against migrants ; sharply reduce human trafficking ; increase the share of migrants working at their highest skill level ; decriminalize migration violations ; end the detention of migrant children ; recast refugees as productive members of our communities ; and lower the proportion of migrants lacking residency rights . 
Some advocates of open borders estimate that unrestricted movement across borders could double global GDP . 
While a borderless world is a political non-starter , that figure does point to the scale of the development gains that a truly well-managed system of global mobility might produce . 
Migration reform is not for the faint-hearted . 
But those who want to leave their mark on one of the twenty-first century &apos;s most vital issues - and to create a world in which international migrants are treated equitably and with dignity - will embrace it .
