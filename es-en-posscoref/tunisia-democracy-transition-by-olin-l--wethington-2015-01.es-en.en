It &apos;s the Economy , Tunisia 
TUNIS - On December 21 , Tunisia completed a remarkable democratic transfer of power , with the election of Beji Caid Essebsi , the leader of the secular political party Nidaa Tounes ( Call of Tunisia ) . 
As with the parliamentary election in October , the process of choosing a president was , for the most part , fair and free of violence . 
For the moment , Tunisia is the only Arab Spring country that appears to be on a path to genuine democratic governance . 
Since the ouster of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 , the country has endured pressures from Islamic radicals , a deterioration of its economy , and a chaotic transitional period . 
But it has also written and adopted a new constitution structured to encourage the separation and balance of powers , and it seems on track to pull off a successful change in government . 
Tunisia is relatively homogeneous ethnically and lacks sharp sectarian divisions ; nonetheless , owing partly to its porous borders with Algeria and Libya , the specter of violence is always present . 
Indeed , the issue of security dominated both the parliamentary and presidential elections , with all sides claiming to be the best qualified to counter extremism . 
Lurking in the background of the presidential election was fear in some quarters that a victory by Nidaa Tounes , which won a plurality in parliament , might mean a return to authoritarian rule . 
Given concerns about security and the fate of the democratic transition , economic issues were essentially put on hold in both elections . 
Now it is time for Tunisia &apos;s leaders to put the economy at the top of their agenda . 
In the coming weeks , Nidaa Tounes , which won 86 of the parliament &apos;s 217 seats , will face a difficult decision as it attempts to form a government . 
The party &apos;s leaders could strike a power-sharing arrangement with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party , which finished second , with 69 seats , and risk a stalemate over policy . 
Or they could piece together a working majority from smaller political parties and try to govern in an unstable coalition beset by deep policy disagreements . 
Whatever Nidaa Tounes decides , the new government will have to act quickly . 
The country &apos;s moribund economy has fueled public disillusionment . 
Unemployment is falling , but it remains high , at more than 15 % - and higher still among the young . 
The fiscal and current-account deficits are widening , foreign investment is weak , inflation is rising , and corruption remains rampant . 
Distrust of political parties and disappointment in their ability to govern is widespread , as evidenced by low voter turnout in the recent elections . 
Tunisia &apos;s political achievements could rapidly be reversed if the new government cannot quickly revive the economy and improve citizens &quot; daily lives . 
Nidaa Tounes must take the lead in forging support from all major parties for a national-unity agenda on economic reforms . 
In its first 30 days , the new National Assembly should publicly announce a consensus vision for economic growth and job creation . 
A broad multi-party commitment would likely help discipline subsequent legislative action and assist in generating the necessary public support . 
There is already broad agreement among the major political parties on the necessary priorities : bringing public spending under control , encouraging private-sector growth and employment , promoting regional development and social inclusion , and investing in essential infrastructure . 
In the previous assembly , work stalled on several significant pieces of legislation , including laws on public-private partnerships , foreign investment , and banking reform . 
The unity agenda should include early passage of these bills . 
Tunisia &apos;s politicians will be able to draw on existing work . 
The program developed by acting Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa in September 2014 deserves serious consideration . 
The International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement of 2013 provides a similar starting point . 
To maintain support from the IMF when its current program ends in summer 2015 , Tunisia will need to negotiate new commitments . 
A consensus reform package could serve as a credible point of departure . 
In the meantime , Western democracies must do their part and sustain engagement with Tunisia . 
The 2011 Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition , in which G-8 members pledged to support Arab countries &quot; efforts to move toward &quot; free , democratic , and tolerant societies , &quot; has a role to play . 
This mechanism may be unlikely to mobilize significant new financing , but participating countries can provide valuable political and technical support on structural reform , regional integration , and private-sector development . 
Provided the security threats are contained , an early consensus within Tunisia on a credible economic agenda would open the taps of the largest potential source of capital : international financial markets . 
The incoming funds , and the subsequent growth and job creation , would undergird the consolidation of democracy - and thus help cement the impressive gains that Tunisia has made so far .
