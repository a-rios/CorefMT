Inequality on the Horizon of Need 
BERKELEY - By any economic measure , we are living in disappointing times . 
In the United States , 7.2 % of the normal productive labor currently stands idle , while the employment gap in Europe is rising and due to exceed that of the US by the end of the year . 
So it is important to step back and remind ourselves that the &quot; lost decade &quot; that we are currently suffering is not our long-run economic destiny . 
As Paul Krugman recently reminded us , John Maynard Keynes perhaps put it best : 
&quot; This is a nightmare , which will pass away with the morning . 
For the resources of nature and men &apos;s devices are just as fertile and productive as they were . 
The rate of our progress towards solving the material problems of life is not less rapid . 
We are as capable as before of affording for everyone a high standard of life - high , I mean , compared with , say , 20 years ago - and will soon learn to afford a standard higher still . 
We were not previously deceived . 
But today we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle , having blundered in the control of a delicate machine , the working of which we do not understand . 
The result is that our possibilities of wealth may run to waste for a time . &quot; 
But what is our long-run economic destiny ? 
Keynes looked forward to a time , perhaps 2050 , when everyone ( in England , at least ) would be able to have the lifestyle of a Keynes . 
And , because he imagined that no sane person could want more of the necessities , conveniences , and luxuries of life than a Keynes had , the economic problem would be solved . 
We are wiser - and perhaps sadder - than Keynes . 
We know that we want hip replacements and heart transplants and fertility treatment and cheap air travel and central heating and broadband Internet and exclusive beachfront access . 
Already nearly everybody in the North Atlantic region has enough food to avoid hunger , enough clothing to stay warm , enough shelter to remain dry . 
And yet we want more , feel resentful when we do not get it , and are self-aware enough to know that luxuries turn into conveniences , and then into necessities - and that we are very good at inventing new luxuries after which to strive . 
So the economic problem will certainly be with us for a long time yet . 
But at least we can count on being able to generate a relatively egalitarian middle-class society as we collectively slouch toward our consumerist utopia , right ? 
It was Karl Smith of the University of North Carolina who explained to me that this was likely to be wrong . 
The long post-Industrial Revolution boom , which carried unskilled workers &quot; wages to previously unheard-of heights - keeping them within shouting ( or at least dreaming ) distance of the lifestyles of the rich and famous - is not necessarily a good guide to what will come next . 
To create wealth , you need ideas about how to shape matter and energy , additional energy itself to carry out the shaping , and instrumentalities to control the shaping as it is accomplished . 
The Industrial Revolution brought ideas and energy to the table , but human brains remained the only effective instrumentalities of control . 
As ideas and energy became cheap , the human brains that were their complements became valuable . 
But , as we move into a future of artificial intelligence that observers like Kevin Drum expect ( or even of the artificial moronity that is already clearly at hand ) , and into a future of biotechnology that grows itself as biological systems do , won &apos;t human brains cease to be the only valuable instrumentalities of control ? 
It is not necessarily the case that &quot; unskilled &quot; workers &quot; standards of living will fall in absolute terms : the same factors that make human brains less valuable may well be working equally effectively to reduce the costs of life &apos;s necessities , conveniences , and luxuries . 
But wealth is likely to flow to the owners of productive - or perhaps fashionable - ideas , and to owners of things that can be imitated only with great difficulty and high cost , even with dirt-cheap instrumentalities of control , dirt-cheap energy , and plentiful ideas . 
The lesson is clear : the market is not guaranteed by nature to produce a long-run future characterized by a reasonable degree of wealth inequality and relative poverty . 
Unless and until we recognize this fully , we will remain at the mercy of Keynes &apos;s poorly understood &quot; delicate machine . &quot;
