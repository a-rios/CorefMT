The Tragedy of Trade Blindness 
LONDON - The Doha Round of global free-trade negotiations is on the brink of collapse after ten years of talking . 
This is a tragedy in the making , because the gains available from what has already been agreed upon in the negotiations are considerable , and would provide a major boost to the global economy . 
By contrast , if the Round is completed , aside from this generalized gain , specific and important improvements would benefit the world &apos;s least developed countries . 
The European Union , for example , has already agreed that all such countries will be afforded duty- and quota-free market access for their exports . 
Furthermore , EU export subsidies for agricultural products will be abolished from 2013 . 
Other such examples abound . 
Moreover , completing the Doha Round is crucial for the World Trade Organization . 
Brazil &apos;s ambassador to the WTO , Roberto Azevedo , said recently that his country &quot; rejects the notion that this organization &apos;s credibility and legitimacy are in a death embrace with the Round . 
The WTO is bigger than the Round and transcends it . &quot; 
Of course , he is right : even if the Doha Round fails , the WTO will survive . 
Indeed , all previous trade rounds - even the Uruguay Round , which took eight years to complete - concluded favorably . 
To pretend that the Doha Round &apos;s failure would not have negative and lasting effects for the WTO betrays a profound lack of understanding of the risks we run , as well as of the Round &apos;s vital importance for weaker and smaller states . 
So , what will happen ? 
Either the Round will fail outright , or some parts of it will be salvaged , with the rest ( most of the areas under negotiation ) put to one side amid promises to return to them after the 2012 elections in the United States . 
Either way , the consequences promise to be far-reaching . 
During the last 20 years , the world has witnessed dramatic proliferation of regional and bilateral preferential trade agreements . 
Indeed , bilateral trade flows covered by such agreements now amount to roughly half of the world &apos;s imports , and have contributed significantly to the dramatic growth of trade . 
Yet such agreements pose great dangers if they are not subject to effective WTO oversight . 
There is a big difference between multilateral negotiations of universal rules and the effective imposition of rules - and even concessions - in a negotiation between the EU or the US and a smaller trade partner . 
While large developing countries - such as Brazil , Russia , India , and China - can avoid such impositions from developed economies , most others cannot . 
Aside from the great damage caused by unequal bargaining power outside of the multilateral framework , the path of bilateral negotiations threatens to remove the focus from universal outcomes , which are the bedrock of globalization . 
The basic principle of non-discrimination is at risk : once trading countries negotiate separately with each other , various forms of discrimination become inevitable , giving rise to various kinds of conflicts . 
A focus on preferential agreements would fragment the global trading system , rather than integrating it . 
The gradual marginalization of the WTO would also erode its credibility in fulfilling its key role as adjudicator of trade disputes . 
The success of the WTO &apos;s adjudication system is reflected in its widespread acceptance . 
Even when WTO decisions have had serious negative effects on a trading partner , they have generally been accepted . 
This constitutes a remarkable advance in global governance . 
The primary responsibility for completing the Round now rests with the US , Brazil , China , and India . 
This group &apos;s inflexibility is at the root of the current impasse , and , should the Round fail , 
Yet , with even a little flexibility , the Round could still succeed . 
The US administration &apos;s heart has not been in this negotiation for a long time . 
However foolish that stance may be , it is even harder to understand why China , Brazil , and India have not made a more determined effort . 
They have so much to lose . 
In fact , Brazil would most likely be the biggest winner from the Round , but it has not made the relatively small concessions in non-agricultural market access that are necessary . 
All of this recalls earlier times , which one might have hoped were long behind us . 
The threat to the globalization process may not be immediately apparent , but it is very real . 
The failure of the Doha Round would be more than a footnote in future history books ; it would be a hugely consequential case of political myopia at a time of great opportunity . 
Most distressing of all , even now , with the consequences of failure staring our political leaders in the face , they do not get it .
