The New Monetary Disorder 
PRINCETON - Currency chaos is back , highlighting demands for a revised international monetary order . 
The rapid decline of the dollar and the pound , but also of the renminbi - now more firmly tied to the dollar than ever - is fanning tensions . 
Some of the ghosts of the 1930 &quot; s have returned , too - in particular , the fear of unfair trade advantages caused by competitive devaluation . 
United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has already accused China of currency manipulation . 
There are two alternative and sharply contrasting approaches to getting currencies right . 
One is to have an international conference at which experts can suggest models to calculate exchange rates and politicians can negotiate deals . 
The only successful instance of such an arrangement is the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 , but even then the exchange rates that were fixed there proved unrealistic , and a major wave of parity alterations was soon needed ( as well as the maintenance of exchange controls ) . 
Other currency-centered conferences were dismal failures . 
President Richard Nixon hailed the 1971 Smithsonian agreement as &quot; the most significant monetary agreement in the history of the world . &quot; 
But it was soon in tatters , and the world moved to generalized floating . 
In 1987 , at the Louvre conference , there was not even any agreement about what had been concluded . 
Some participants thought they had agreed to a sort of semi-fixing of exchange rates in the form of target zones , but the powerful German Bundesbank never shared that interpretation . 
History suggests that collective negotiation about currencies and a new approach to the issue of reserves are unlikely to succeed . 
The second , and better , approach lies in agreements in each country about what the appropriate basis for monetary policy should be . 
If those agreements have widespread acceptance and mutual consistency , the result will be a stable international monetary system . 
There have been two models for such a consensus . 
In the first , a century ago , confidence was underpinned by gold ; in the more recent wave of globalization , it depended upon the power of the human intellect to solve policy problems . 
The end of inflation and &quot; the great moderation &quot; of the past three decades were fundamental to the liberalization of large parts of the world and to increased confidence , trade , and prosperity . 
The search for a monetary rule during the latter period had two phases : in the earliest attempt to construct a basis for stable monetary policy , the emphasis was on monetary targeting . 
In the second , more successful , phase , an increasing number of countries adopted either explicit or implicit inflation targets . 
But inflation targeting was never an obvious concept , and the financial crisis has discredited it . 
In 2003 , Ben Bernanke , then a Governor of the US Federal Reserve , stated in a speech that many Americans considered inflation targeting &quot; foreign , impenetrable , and possibly slightly subversive . &quot; 
That feeling is stronger now . 
There was always uncertainty over the extent to which central banks should attempt to correct or limit asset-price bubbles when there was no corresponding rise in the general level of inflation . 
Rising asset prices lead to a general increase in purchasing power , because many asset holders are willing ( and able ) to borrow more . 
Many Europeans tried to argue in recent years that monetary policy should also take asset-price developments into account , whereas American policymakers and academics largely resisted this approach . 
The problem is that asset prices and consumer-price inflation may move in different directions , as they did in the 2000 &quot; s , and that weighing both factors would produce inconsistent policy recommendations . 
As a result , central banks ran the risk of no longer appearing to follow a clearly formulated policy guideline . 
The credibility associated with a simple rule disappeared . 
After the financial crisis , we have become wiser . 
Formulating monetary policy has become a more complex process , but also a more politicized process , which is why it is likely to become more chaotic , with sharp differences between national approaches . 
The Fed and the Bank of England remain less likely to be concerned about the emergence of new kinds of asset bubbles in stock markets or commodities . 
But the European Central Bank ( ECB ) will be more worried . 
As divergences become explicit , the demand for a wider political debate about monetary policy and for political involvement in its formulation will become more intense . 
The Bank of England &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee has often been presented as a pioneer in making monetary policy transparent . 
But , from an early stage , the transparency that resulted from the early publication of who voted for and against rate increases led to a public identification of members of the Committee as hawks or doves . 
If it is clear who will vote for which measure , there will be increased demand for a public debate about who should be chosen : why not elect the MPC , since it is effectively a monetary government ? 
In Europe , a similar debate about the political accountability of European central banks has been simmering since before the ECB was even established . 
Tensions between advocates of different policy solutions will lead to a demand for a greater political say . 
This exercise looks like a dramatic repeat of the interwar story , when it was impossible to obtain consensus about policy and about mutually consistent policy frameworks . 
Then , too , central banks were blamed when their policy framework ( at that time the gold standard ) disintegrated . 
Consequently , nationalization of the central bank became a major platform of the British or French left . 
That , in turn , cleared the way for manipulation of currencies in the interests of exporters , businesses , and labor unions . 
The result was international monetary chaos - precisely the path we are heading down now .
