Preventing Europe &apos;s Next Banking Crisis 
As shockwaves from America &apos;s subprime disaster continue to reverberate , there is growing doubt about Europe &apos;s ability to handle a financial crisis on a major scale . 
Severe lapses in bank regulation - in Germany , Britain , and perhaps France - have damaged the credibility of national systems of supervision . 
But this is only part of the problem . 
The European Union remains hopelessly ill-equipped to handle the crises that haven &apos;t yet happened : cross-border crises sparked by EU banks &quot; increasing interdependence . 
EU financial integration began in earnest in the 1980 &quot; s , and the European Commission and European Council made great strides in financial-sector reform . 
Among the milestones were the decisions in 1986-1988 to remove all restrictions on cross-border capital flows , and the launch in 1999 of a legislative action plan on financial services . 
The euro was introduced and quickly became the world &apos;s second currency , behind the dollar . 
Perhaps less conspicuous , the EU &apos;s decision to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in 2000-2002 triggered an extraordinary move toward the global harmonization of accounting rules . 
Meanwhile , the Commission &apos;s steadfast defense of competition in the banking sector - particularly in Portugal , Germany , Italy , and Poland - ended an era of protectionism in the guise of prudential control ; this helped to spur cross-border financial integration to an extent unprecedented in developed economies . 
These achievements came during a period of remarkable stability in Europe &apos;s financial markets . 
Even during the 1992-1993 dark days of the European Monetary System , Europe looked like a safe haven in an unsettled financial world . 
Many countries outside the European Community suffered banking crises , including neighboring Norway , Sweden , Finland , and Turkey , as well as many East European nations during their transitions from communism . 
By contrast , the most serious bank failures inside the EC in the 1990 &quot; s - including BCCI , Crédit Lyonnais , and Barings - had only a limited fiscal cost and a negligible impact on growth . 
Later , corporate governance scandals in Asia and then in the US , notably after the dot-com bubble and the accounting debacles at Enron , WorldCom , and others , encouraged Europeans to think that the &quot; old continent &quot; had somehow preserved higher standards . 
The subprime-induced storm ended that fair-weather complacency . 
From the point of view of public policy , three points can already be made in its wake . 
First , the good news : the European Central Bank proved itself an efficient lender of last resort to Europe &apos;s financial system . 
When the crisis started in earnest in August 2007 , the ECB reacted quickly and intervened as long as the inter-bank market needed support . 
Banks in the euro zone and beyond all benefited . 
By contrast , the Bank of England &apos;s reluctance to provide liquidity - because of concerns about &quot; moral hazard &quot; - was a poor choice . 
Second , however , national banking supervision in Europe fell far short of requirements and its overall credibility is now in question . 
German authorities have been deplorably tolerant of commercial bank involvement in complex asset-backed securities investments , which were kept off their balance sheets via so-called &quot; conduit &quot; operations in Ireland . 
Even if the three German banks most stricken by the credit crunch - Sachsen LB , IKB , and West LB - had technically complied with capital adequacy requirements , their &quot; conduits &quot; represented high risk factors at around 30 % , 20 % , and 13 % of their total assets , respectively . 
Much stronger supervision was needed . 
In Britain , the Northern Rock meltdown highlighted problems with the three bodies responsible for financial stability : the Treasury , the Financial Services Authority , and the Bank of England . 
In France , doubts were cast on the risk controls at major investment banks - first Calyon , then Natixis , and then most dramatically in January 2008 , Société Générale . 
Finally , the current financial turmoil highlights a long-standing but urgent problem for Europe : the lack of credible arrangements for the management of cross-border banking crises . 
Until recently , most banks focused on their country of origin , so risks largely arose under national systems of supervision . 
But Europeans banks have now dramatically expanded their operations across the EU . 
Ten years ago , non-domestic assets were barely one-sixth of the total European assets of the EU &apos;s largest banks ; the proportion today has grown to one-third . 
By contrast , the proportion of assets held outside the EU is almost unchanged . 
Cross-border mergers and acquisitions are likely to continue apace once the current market turbulence is over , further increasing the likelihood of a major cross-border banking crisis . 
Both economic theory and past experience show that scattered national regulators who face conflicting pressures cannot efficiently manage such crises . 
Without a framework for more centralized supervision of a limited number of major international banks , the cost of a future cross-border crisis involving one of them is likely to be larger than Europe &apos;s economy can afford . 
There are therefore very good reasons to put discussion about new EU-level prudential institutions high on the policy agenda . 
The exact arrangements will have to be decided , but they must allow quicker and better-informed decision-making while respecting national fiscal prerogatives . 
A system built on a strictly limited mandate could be both more efficient and less controversial than some single , all-encompassing financial regulator . 
No doubt there will be difficult political and technical issues to resolve , but the current credit chaos has generated a fresh feeling of urgency . 
Even Britain , an enduring opponent of EU institutions for financial regulation , may decide that its own interests as Europe &apos;s financial hub would be better served by reform . 
As Walter Bagehot once famously said , &quot; Money will not manage itself . &quot; 
The private sector cannot act alone to sort out the financial mess ; it needs support from well-adapted public institutions . 
An up-to-date system of EU supervision is more crucial than ever if Europe &apos;s financial system is to serve its proper purpose .
