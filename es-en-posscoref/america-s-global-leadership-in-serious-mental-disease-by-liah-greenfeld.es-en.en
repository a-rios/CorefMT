The Maddening of America 
BOSTON - The relative global decline of the United States has become a frequent topic of debate in recent years . 
Proponents of the post-American view point to the 2008 financial crisis , the prolonged recession that followed , and China &apos;s steady rise . 
Most are international-relations experts who , viewing geopolitics through the lens of economic competitiveness , imagine the global order as a seesaw , in which one player &apos;s rise necessarily implies another &apos;s fall . 
But the exclusive focus on economic indicators has prevented consideration of the geopolitical implications of a US domestic trend that is also frequently discussed , but by a separate group of experts : America &apos;s ever-increasing rates of severe mental disease ( which have already been very high for a long time ) . 
The claim that the spread of severe mental illness has reached &quot; epidemic &quot; proportions has been heard so often that , like any commonplace , it has lost its ability to shock . 
But the repercussions for international politics of the disabling conditions diagnosed as manic-depressive illnesses ( including major unipolar depression ) and schizophrenia could not be more serious . 
It has proved to be impossible to distinguish , either biologically or symptomatically , between different varieties of these conditions , which thus constitute a continuum - most likely of complexity , rather than severity . 
Indeed , the most common of these illnesses , unipolar depression , is the least complex in terms of its symptoms , but also the most lethal : 20 % of depressed patients are estimated to commit suicide . 
Both manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia are psychotic conditions , characterized by the patient &apos;s loss of control over his or her actions and thoughts , a recurrent state in which s / he cannot be considered an agent with free will . 
Obsessive suicidal thinking and paralyzing lack of motivation allow depressed patients to be classified as psychotic as well . 
These conditions are often accompanied by elaborate delusions - images of reality that confuse information generated in the mind with that provided from outside . 
Often the distinction between symbols and their referents is lost , and patients begin seeing people solely as representations of some imagined force . 
The judgment of such people cannot be trusted , to put it mildly . 
A massive statistical study , conducted from 2001 to 2003 by the US National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , estimated the lifetime prevalence of major depression among American adults ( ages 18-54 ) at more than 16 % . 
Lifetime prevalence for schizophrenia was estimated at 1.7 % . 
There is no known cure for these chronic diseases ; after onset ( often before the age of 18 ) , they are likely to last until the end of the patient &apos;s life . 
Surveys among US college students estimated that 20 % fit criteria for depression and anxiety in 2010 , and that nearly 25 % fit these criteria in 2012 . 
Other studies have consistently shown rising rates of prevalence with each successive generation , and it is argued that , if older statistics were faulty , they erred on the side of underestimating the spread of mental illness . 
All of this suggests that as many as 20 % of American adults may be severely mentally ill . 
In view of disputes over the significance of available data , let &apos;s assume that only 10 % of American adults are severely mentally ill . 
As these conditions are presumed to be distributed uniformly within the population , they must afflict a significant share of policymakers , corporate executives , educators , and military personnel of all ranks , recurrently rendering them psychotic , delusional , and deprived of sound judgment . 
If it is deemed sensationalist to characterize this situation as terrifying , one may add that a much larger share of the population ( estimated at close to 50 % in the NIMH study ) is affected by less severe forms of mental disease that only occasionally disturb their functionality . 
Comparative epidemiologists have repeatedly noticed something remarkable about these illnesses : only Western countries ( or , more precisely , societies with monotheistic traditions ) - particularly prosperous Western countries - are subject to prevalence rates of this magnitude . 
Southeast Asian countries appear to be especially immune to the bane of severe mental illness ; in other regions , poverty , or lack of development , seems to offer a protective barrier . 
As I argue in my recent book Mind , Modernity , Madness , the reason for high concentrations of severe mental illness in the developed West lies in the very nature of Western societies . 
The &quot; virus &quot; of depression and schizophrenia , including their milder forms , is cultural in origin : the embarrassment of choices that these societies offer in terms of self-definition and personal identity leaves many of their members disoriented and adrift .
