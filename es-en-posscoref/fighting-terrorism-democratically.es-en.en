Fighting Terrorism Democratically 
Bombings in London and Turkey have brought to the fore the old ideas that authoritarian regimes are better equipped than democracies to combat terrorism , and that such attacks are the price we pay for liberty . 
For some , that is a price worth paying ; for others , the costs seem too high . 
But a look at the record shows that democracies possess more effective weapons to fight terror than do authoritarian regimes . 
Indeed , it is when democracies abandon their ethics and fail to resist the authoritarian temptation that they become weaker . 
Of course , the logic behind calls to restrict our freedoms has a simplistic appeal : extremists use our freedoms to commit their crimes , so preventing the abuse of freedom requires curtailing freedom &apos;s scope . 
The mistake , however , is to assume that open societies are more permissive and vulnerable to terrorism than those who live under authoritarian regimes . 
One need only look at today &apos;s Russia , or recall Algeria in the 1990 &quot; s . 
True , democracy and the rule of law provide no foolproof security guarantee . 
It is because Britain is a democracy that respects the rule of law that it has been able to mobilize vast sectors of its Muslim community . 
By contrast , authoritarian regimes &quot; repression of civilians , and their non-differentiation between civilians and killers , provides extremists with fertile recruiting conditions by discrediting the government in the eyes of a significant part of its population . 
An undifferentiated approach towards political Islamism that fails to distinguish between those who reject violence and those who resort to terror only facilitates the extremists &quot; work , for they emerge as champions of causes that do not reflect their true goals . 
Russia provides conclusive evidence of the impotence of authoritarian violence and disregard for the rule of law . 
President Vladimir Putin undertook a scorched-earth policy in Chechnya , driving many Chechen nationalists straight into the extremists &quot; arms . 
Terrorist attacks on Russia did not cease or decline . 
Indeed , recall the terrorism in Beslan in September 2004 , in which a single attack on a school killed over 330 people . 
Iraq also is demonstrating the limits of illegitimate violence when combating terrorism . 
The Bush administration now seems to realize this . 
It would be a mistake to believe that the deaths of thousands of civilians , along with arbitrary imprisonment and torture , do not contribute to the spread of terror in Iraq . 
After all , torture victims are the best possible advertisement for terrorist recruitment . 
When it comes to fighting terrorism , moreover , democracies are more effective both politically and operationally , particularly in terms of their intelligence services . 
Intelligence forces in authoritarian states are either highly centralized or tend to become autonomous power centers . 
In either case , they are subject to no public scrutiny and accountability . 
As a result , they lose their ability over time to evaluate critically their own actions and errors . 
Intelligence services in democratic contexts usually have oversight mechanisms that serve to limit abuses of power , and to guarantee effective action by punishing top officials that fail to do their jobs properly . 
In the United States , a powerful bi-partisan Senate committee directly monitors the intelligence services . 
Its report on the inability of the intelligence services , notably the CIA and the FBI , to prevent the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks also contained a series of recommendations for restructuring these services to render them more effective . 
Europe &apos;s response to terror requires , first and foremost , strengthening its intelligence services so that they can detect and dismantle terrorist cells while respecting basic rights and due process . 
It also requires greater coordination among all the European Union &apos;s member states and their allies and partners . 
At the same time , the rule-of-law approach to fighting terrorism must be a pillar of European cooperation with third countries , namely with those of the Mediterranean , or with Pakistan , thereby contributing to a security culture that is conducive to democratization . 
Deepening democracy in turn means allowing full civic participation , including non-violent Islamic groups . 
The right to public speech and peaceful assembly must be defended for those who feel marginalized and indignant at what they - and most Europeans - view as injustices committed against the Palestinians , the Chechens , and the Iraqis . 
Last , but not least , combating identity-based extremism calls for a greater capacity to integrate all those who live within the EU . 
The response to terrorism should be to reaffirm the value of the rule of law over arbitrary repression , and of the diversity that is the hallmark of Europe &apos;s cities , particularly London and Paris , but increasingly many others across the Union . 
We cannot - indeed , must not - cede to terror by building walls around and within our societies . 
The best response to intolerant extremism is to cultivate an open and pluralistic society that treats all those who live within its borders as full citizens . 
Europe turned diversity into one of its constitutional traits , and this is why it has had such an impact on the world . 
Protecting that essence is the best way to honor the memory of the victims of terror , be they from London , Sharm el-Sheik , Madrid , Casablanca , or New York .
