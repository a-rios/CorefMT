Markets &quot; Rose-Tinted World 
LAGUNA BEACH - This has been an unusual year for the global economy , characterized by a series of unanticipated economic , geopolitical , and market shifts - and the final quarter is likely to be no different . 
How these shifts ultimately play out will have a major impact on the effectiveness of government policies - and much more . 
So why have financial markets been behaving as if they were in a world of their own ? 
Apparently unfazed by disappointing growth in both advanced and emerging economies , or by surging geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East , equity markets have set record after record this year . 
This impressive rally has ignored a host of historical relationships , including the long-established correlation between the performance of stocks and government bonds . 
In fact , correlations among a number of different financial-asset classes have behaved in an atypical and , at times , unstable manner . 
Meanwhile , on the policy front , advanced-country monetary-policy cohesion is giving way to a multi-track system , with the European Central Bank stepping harder on the stimulus accelerator , while the US Federal Reserve eases off . 
These factors are sending the global economy into the final quarter of the year encumbered by profound uncertainty in several areas . 
Looming particularly large over the next few months are escalating geopolitical conflicts that are nearing a tipping point , beyond which lies the specter of serious systemic disruptions in the global economy . 
This is particularly true in Ukraine , where , despite the current ceasefire , Russia and the West have yet to find a way to ease tensions definitively . 
Absent a breakthrough , the inevitable new round of sanctions and counter-sanctions would likely push Russia and Europe into recession , dampening global economic activity . 
Even without such complications , invigorating Europe &apos;s increasingly sluggish economic recovery will be no easy feat . 
In order to kick-start progress , ECB President Mario Draghi has proposed a grand policy bargain to European governments : if they implement structural reforms and improve fiscal flexibility , the central bank will expand its balance sheet to boost growth and thwart deflation . 
If member states do not uphold their end of the bargain , the ECB will find it difficult to carry the policy burden effectively - exposing it to criticism and political pressure . 
Across the Atlantic , the Fed is set to complete its exit from quantitative easing ( QE ) - its policy of large-scale asset purchases - in the next few weeks , leaving it completely dependent on interest rates and forward policy guidance to boost the economy . 
The withdrawal of QE , beyond being unpopular among some policymakers and politicians , has highlighted concerns about the risk of increased financial instability and rising inequality - both of which could undermine America &apos;s already weak economic recovery . 
Complicating matters further are the US congressional elections in November . 
Given the likelihood that the Republicans will continue to control at least one house of Congress , Democratic President Barack Obama &apos;s policy flexibility will probably remain severely constrained - unless , of course , the White House and Congress finally find a way to work together . 
Meanwhile , in Japan , the private sector &apos;s patience with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s three-pronged strategy to reinvigorate the long-stagnant economy - so-called &quot; Abenomics &quot; - will be tested , particularly with regard to the long-awaited implementation of structural reforms to complement fiscal stimulus and monetary easing . 
If the third &quot; arrow &quot; of Abenomics fails to materialize , investors &quot; risk aversion will rise yet again , hampering efforts to stimulate growth and avoid deflation . 
Systemically important emerging economies are also subject to considerable uncertainty . 
Brazil &apos;s presidential election in October will determine whether the country makes progress toward a new , more sustainable growth model or becomes more deeply mired in a largely exhausted economic strategy that reinforces its stagflationary tendencies . 
In India , the question is whether newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi will move decisively to fulfill voters &quot; high expectations for economic reform before his post-victory honeymoon is over . 
And China will have to mitigate financial risks if it hopes to avoid a hard landing . 
The final source of uncertainty is the corporate sector . 
So far this year , healthy companies have slowly been loosening their purse strings - a notable departure from the risk-averse behavior that has prevailed since the global financial crisis . 
Indeed , an increasing number of firms have started to deploy the massive stocks of cash held on their balance sheets , first to increase dividends and buy back shares , and then to pursue mergers and acquisitions at a rate last seen in 2007 . 
The question is whether companies also will finally devote more cash to new investments in plant , equipment , and people - a key source of support for the global economy . 
This is a rather weighty list of questions . 
Yet financial-market participants have largely bypassed them , brushing aside today &apos;s major risks and ignoring the potential volatility that they imply . 
Instead , financial investors have trusted in the steadfast support of central banks , confident that the monetary authorities will eventually succeed in transforming policy-induced growth into genuine growth . 
And , of course , they have benefited considerably from the deployment of corporate cash . 
In the next few months , the buoyant optimism pervading financial markets may prove to be justified . 
Unfortunately , it is more likely that investors &quot; outlook is excessively rosy .
