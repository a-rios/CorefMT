Europe &apos;s Options 
STANFORD - Many Europeans have come to believe that they have weathered the economic and financial storm . 
In the last two years , deficits and debt have stabilized . 
Yields on the sovereign debt of the eurozone periphery &apos;s weak economies have fallen sharply . 
Portugal and Ireland have exited their bailout programs . 
Talk of Greece leaving the euro has subsided . 
All of that is true , but there is a big catch : economic growth in the European Union remains anemic . 
GDP in Holland and Italy shrank in the last quarter , and France &apos;s barely budged . 
Forecasters are revising down their estimates for 2014 eurozone growth to just 1 % year on year . 
Unemployment remains at a staggering 11.6 % in the eurozone as a whole , compared to 10 % in the United States at the worst of America &apos;s Great Recession . 
It is above 25 % in Greece and Spain - and even higher among the young . 
Europe &apos;s economy remains shackled by three problems - sovereign debt , the euro , and wobbly banks - despite several new policy backstops : the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) ; the European Central Bank &apos;s easy-money policies and holdings of sovereign debt ; and the ECB &apos;s takeover in November of supervision of the 130 or so largest pan-eurozone banks . 
None of these reforms has been sufficient to restore the stronger growth that Europe desperately needs . 
Widespread economic discontent is reflected in recent political instability . 
The European Parliament election in May shocked Europe &apos;s elites , as parties of the far right , assorted euroskeptics , and even leftists made strong gains in many countries , fueled in part by popular frustration with the European Commission &apos;s concentration of power . 
Great Britain may be headed for a referendum on EU membership in 2017 unless certain terms of its membership are revised . 
Elected leaders face a daunting task : enacting difficult structural reforms of labor markets , pension systems , and taxes . 
All were long overdue prior to the crisis , and they remain in the very early stages , at best , in most countries , while the high-debt countries &quot; fiscal condition has improved only modestly . 
And Italy and France demand relief from the eurozone &apos;s budget deficit and debt rules . 
Economists are not certain whether there are short-run costs or benefits to rapid fiscal consolidation . 
My view is that it depends on facts and circumstances , such as the size , credibility , and timing of the consolidation ; the mix of spending and tax cuts ; whether consolidation is mostly permanent and structural ( for example , a change in pension formulas ) ; and , of course , the stance of monetary policy . 
Given most European countries &quot; increasingly daunting demographic outlook , the current pace of structural reform is woefully insufficient . 
Italy and Germany are headed toward a ratio of one retiree per worker ; without more rapid GDP growth , new immigration policies , higher retirement ages , and efforts to stem the increase in welfare spending , taxes will inexorably rise from already damaging levels . 
Europe has three broad options . 
The first is the status quo - which would entail cobbling together responses to future mini-crises as they arise , following the pattern of the past few years . 
Given the divergent interests and problems facing different countries within the eurozone and the EU , together with cumbersome governance structures and the difficulty of treaty changes , this is the path of least resistance for elected leaders - and thus the one most likely to be followed . 
The second option is serious , concerted structural reform . 
It would also include an aggressive attempt to reduce the sovereign-debt overhang that remains a major impediment to growth and continues to threaten some European banks . 
Existing debt agreements are not sufficient without a decade of strong growth , which appears unlikely , to say the least . 
European governments and banks ultimately will need a solution similar to Brady bonds , which worked quite well in overcoming the 1990s Latin American debt crisis and the threat that it posed to highly exposed US money-center banks . 
As was true then , a menu of exit options and credit extensions will have to be negotiated . 
The third option is rethinking and reworking the EU itself , from the euro to its basic institutions . 
As a free-trade arrangement , the EU has been a major success . 
Some economists have proposed a two-track euro , with &quot; problem &quot; countries using a &quot; euro-B &quot; that floats against the &quot; euro-A &quot; until they abide by the economic and financial rules and earn re-entry . 
Enhanced labor mobility has been another great benefit brought about by the EU . 
While it is unlikely that much progress will be made along the lines of the second or third options in the near future , Europe &apos;s elected leaders should constantly test what makes sense and what needs to be reformed . 
The recent election was a wake-up call ;
