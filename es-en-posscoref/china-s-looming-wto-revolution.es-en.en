China \ u0027s Looming WTO Revolution 
China is now an active member of the world economic and political community . 
Relative affluence and greater personal freedom exist for many , even as other Chinese citizens are racked by the travails of modernization . 
Many anticipate that China &apos;s entry into the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) will speed these trends along and may even precipitate fundamental and legal political change . 
Although forward momentum will be slower than many anticipate , the changes exacted by WTO membership will be profound because China &apos;s future will be dictated or determined more than ever before by factors beyond Beijing &apos;s control . 
Moreover , WTO membership will not only prevent backsliding but will raise fundamental questions about national sovereignty and powerful debates about the amount of foreign engagement China is willing to tolerate . 
The impact will go beyond economics to affect , deeply , social and political life . 
Although some analysts produced doomsday scenarios about increasing unrest from rising unemployment and inequality , liberal intellectuals in China welcome membership in anticipation of a more rule-bound and democratic political order . 
In reality , entry will push forward trends set in motion well before China joined the WTO . 
The demise of the old economic order will be hastened while the emerging private enterprise and new sectors will become ever more privileged . 
In the social realm , WTO entry will increase inequality and the restructuring of the labor force into extremes of wealth and poverty . 
In this process , the concentration of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) along the coasts will also continue to exacerbate regional inequalities . 
In 1998 , Guangdong province alone received 26.5 % of FDI while the entire West of China received 3 % . 
As a result , those living in Shanghai enjoy a real income twice that of the Northwest and 60 % higher than the Southwest . 
Already radically different levels of education , resource endowment and skilled labor mean that , with WTO entry , the already privileged coastal areas of China will continue to advance disproportionately over more backward inland areas . 
Increased economic competition will also add to unemployment in the state-owned sector while new , private job creation will not match the rising need . 
For example , the real unemployment rate in the Northeast is already over 10 % and this region will feel the strongest impact from agricultural changes . 
While much of China will gain from agricultural diversification , areas such as the Northeast that are overly dependent on grain production will suffer because under the WTO China will import much cheaper and better quality grain for both human consumption and animal fodder , causing rural incomes to decline even further . 
Migration to a city will be the only choice for many dispossessed peasants . 
It is no surprise , then , that rural and urban unrest is mounting . 
China &apos;s new leadership must address this rising tide of disaffection when calculating the pace with which to move ahead with WTO compliance . 
The CCP must decide how to accommodate the social forces that will benefit from further globalization while disentangling itself from its traditional power base , housed in the failing state-owned sector propped up by the old central planning apparatus . 
To deal with the social cleavages that will increase as a result of WTO accession , China will have to develop more participatory and open mechanisms by allowing for a competitive political market place to develop to parallel the economic one . 
Doubtless , such changes will be difficult for the CCP to accept . 
No less necessary will be further development of a legal and regulatory framework as a means to improve the potential for both domestic and international investment . 
Here the major challenge will be for the CCP to accept that WTO membership presumes that disputes will be resolved by an independent , rules-based , supra-national body rather than by party-fiat or through the mediation of local political connections . 
Within China , pressure will mount for a more independent judiciary to adjudicate economic issues and create greater transparency in international transactions . 
Such changes run counter to current practice and will not be easy for party members to swallow . 
The developed economies of the world can facilitate this process . 
Sluggish progress may be unacceptable , but outsiders must recognize that the CCP must balance the imperatives of progress against mushrooming social unrest . 
China has agreed to implement its WTO commitments in a stunningly short period of time that can only have been agreed to because of extreme American pressure . 
But China is too big and too political to be pushed so fast that it is not permitted sufficient time to adapt properly . 
Cooler heads must prevail around the world so that China is not taken to WTO dispute mechanisms for each and every insignificant infraction . 
In short , there needs to be political maturity exercised by everyone as China integrates with the world economy . 
Importantly , those countries who expect China to yield to WTO protocols will have to behave responsibly when demanding it abide by international decisions beyond its own jurisdiction , not all of which will be to its liking . 
To date , this has not been a strong suit , particularly for America . 
But if disdain is shown for the WTO process , there will be little incentive for China to comply during the difficult months ahead .
