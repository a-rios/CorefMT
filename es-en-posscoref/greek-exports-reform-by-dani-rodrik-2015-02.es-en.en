Reforming Greek Reform 
PRINCETON - Greece &apos;s new government , led by the anti-austerity Syriza party , presents the eurozone with a challenge that it has not yet had to face : dealing with national officials who are outside the traditional European mainstream . 
Syriza is in many ways a radical party , and its views on economic policy are often described as hard left ; but the party &apos;s take on debt and austerity is supported by many perfectly mainstream economists in Europe and America . 
So what sets Syriza apart ? 
All negotiations between debtors and creditors involve bluff and bluster to some extent . 
One might expect that the negotiations between the Greeks and the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) would be mainly about reaching an agreement about the economics of the situation . 
But that would be wishful thinking . 
They think that offering easier terms would be economically counterproductive , not least because it would give the Greeks an opportunity to go back to their bad old ways . 
So what is unfolding before our eyes is not a rational discussion of economics but pure haggling . And just about the only bargaining chip that Varoufakis holds may be the implicit threat that Greece could leave the euro ( &quot; Grexit &quot; ) . 
But , without the threat , Varoufakis &apos;s claims of democratic legitimacy would most likely fall on deaf ears in Berlin , Frankfurt , and Brussels . 
Syriza would have no choice but to continue the economic program it was elected to revoke . 
The effectiveness of the Grexit threat depends on two conditions . 
First , Germany and other eurozone members must regard Grexit as a significant risk to themselves . 
Second , a return to the drachma must offer the prospect that the Greek economy will eventually do better on its own than in the currency union ( and under the existing economic program ) . 
In the absence of the first condition , the eurozone will respond to Greece by saying , &quot; Be our guest , leave . &quot; 
In the absence of the second condition , Greece &apos;s threat will not be credible . 
And here is where economics re-enters the picture . 
Consider the first condition . 
Some observers seem to have convinced themselves that any Grexit spillovers would be manageable . 
So it is possible that other fragile members - Spain , Portugal , and Italy - would be spared from financial contagion and the euro &apos;s viability would not be dramatically affected . 
But the consequences are so unpredictable , and the costs of any domino effect potentially so large , that Germany and other creditors have no interest in precipitating a Grexit scenario . 
On the contrary , presiding over the eurozone &apos;s breakup must be one of German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s worst nightmares . 
And if it is not , it should be . 
Here , too , there are plenty of disaster scenarios . 
Grexit would require capital controls and financial isolation , at least for some time . 
The resulting uncertainty about policies and prices might produce a severe adverse shock on the real economy , sending unemployment to even greater heights . 
But there are clear examples of positive economic outcomes resulting from breaking a similar currency bond . 
Britain dropped out of the Gold Standard early , in 1931 , so that it could ease monetary conditions and reduce interest rates , and it did better than countries that delayed the exit until later . 
Argentina abandoned its fixed exchange rate against the US dollar in 2001 , and experienced rapid recovery after two bad quarters . 
In both cases , regaining monetary sovereignty allowed a more competitive currency , which in turn increased export demand and assisted economic recovery . 
Under Grexit , Greece &apos;s best hope would be something similar - a sharp boost in external competitiveness . 
The Greek government has limited room for fiscal stimulus , and it would be shut out of financial markets . 
A cheaper currency could , in principle , reverse the effects of austerity . 
Currency depreciation works by lowering domestic costs in foreign-currency terms . 
One such cost has already come down significantly in Greece . 
Since the onset of the crisis , Greek wages have dropped by more than 15 % - a process called , appropriately enough , internal devaluation . 
Yet the response in terms of exports has been disappointing . 
Though the country &apos;s whopping current-account deficit is gone , this reflects a collapse of imports - a result of austerity - rather than an export boom . 
This fact on its own suggests that bringing back the drachma might not help Greece much . 
Greek exports appear to have been hampered by other factors . 
Higher energy costs ( owing to increases in both excise taxes and electricity rates ) , credit bottlenecks , specialization in stagnant export markets , and generalized policy uncertainty all seem to have played a role . 
As a result , Greek export prices have not come down nearly as much as wages . 
Grexit might conceivably help with some of these costs , but it will aggravate others ( such as policy uncertainty ) . 
In the short to medium run , increasing Greek competitiveness requires remedies targeted at specific binding constraints faced by exporters . 
A Greek program that identifies these constraints and proposes remedies would be much better economics than blind adherence to the troika &apos;s laundry list of structural reforms . 
It would also offer a credible alternative to remaining in the eurozone under current terms , thereby strengthening Greece &apos;s hand in bargaining for a deal that ensures that Grexit does not in fact occur .
