Vanguard Scotland ? 
LONDON - Since I believe that the Scots are sensible , I think that they will vote &quot; no &quot; this week to independence . 
But , whichever way the vote goes , the spectacular rise of nationalism , in Scotland and elsewhere in Europe , is a symptom of a diseased political mainstream . 
Many are now convinced that the current way of organizing our affairs does not deserve such unquestioning allegiance ; that the political system has closed down serious debate on economic and social alternatives ; that banks and oligarchs rule ; and that democracy is a sham . 
Nationalism promises an escape from the discipline of &quot; sensible &quot; alternatives that turn out to offer no alternative . 
Nationalists can be divided into two main groups : those who genuinely believe that independence provides an exit from a blocked political system , and those who use the threat of it to force concessions from the political establishment . 
Either way , nationalist politicians enjoy the huge advantage of not requiring a practical program : all good things will flow from sovereignty . 
Though nationalist politics was long suppressed after World War II by economic prosperity and memories of pre-war horrors , Europe offers fertile ground for its revival . 
It is because practically all of Europe &apos;s existing nation-states contain geographically concentrated ethnic , religious , or linguistic minorities . 
Moreover , these states &quot; incorporation into the European Union - a kind of voluntary empire - challenges their citizens &quot; allegiance . 
That is why Britain has spawned two nationalisms simultaneously . 
The United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) , led by populist Nigel Farage , looks to London to protect British independence against the EU bureaucracy . 
The Scottish National Party ( SNP ) , led by the astute Alex Salmond , looks to Brussels to protect Scotland against the &quot; imperial &quot; parliament in Westminster . 
Given the right conditions , nationalism will always discover an &quot; other &quot; against which to define itself . 
Scottish nationalism was not created by the recent economic crisis , but the Scottish referendum was . 
Scotland convened its first devolved parliament in 1999 , giving the SNP a political platform in Edinburgh from which to campaign for independence . 
The removal of the Labour government in London in 2010 was the voters &quot; way of punishing the Labour Party for the economic collapse of 2008-2009 . 
To maintain governability in Scotland , British Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to permit a referendum on independence . 
An independent Scottish government would face huge economic costs . 
It would inherit its share of UK public-sector debt and future liabilities without the benefit of the substantial subsidy that it currently receives from the British Treasury . 
The SNP claims that additional revenues from North Sea oil would offset the subsidy . 
But these revenues are naturally time-limited , and the SNP has failed to mention the large decommissioning costs that will be incurred when the oil runs out . 
So , almost certainly , Scottish taxes would have to be higher than UK taxes . 
In addition , leading Scottish-based banks and many large businesses have said they would relocate some of their operations to London . 
According to the SNP , an independent Scotland would not cause fragmentation of the UK internal market , because it would maintain a currency union with Britain . 
But the three main British political parties , and the Bank of England , have rejected this . 
If the Scots want sovereignty , they will need their own currency - and their own central bank : no British lender of last resort would be available to Scotland &apos;s banks . 
Scotland might try to keep its currency at par with sterling , but this would require larger reserves than a Scottish central bank could command , at least at the outset . 
And a Scottish currency that floats against the British pound would mean large transaction costs and reduced trade between the two countries . 
Nor is there any easy escape , at least in the short run , by joining the EU , which may well require an independent Scotland to apply for membership . 
In short , the SNP &apos;s dream of social democracy in one country would fall afoul of the larger interdependencies that bind together the components of the UK , and that tie the UK to the EU and the EU to the rest of the globalized world . 
None of this fazes the Scottish nationalists . 
In nationalism &apos;s forward march in post-crash Europe , its standard-bearers often use immigration to exploit pre-crash resentment against globalization , notably the erosion of cultures and identities , declining sense of community , wage stagnation , rising inequality , uncontrolled banks , and high unemployment . 
They question whether people can enjoy the benefits of globalization while being sheltered from its costs - and what alternatives there are to the &quot; market fundamentalism &quot; that has defined capitalism since the late twentieth century . 
In this mood , people are more willing to discount nationalism &apos;s costs , because they have come to doubt the benefits of its liberal capitalist rival . 
Ordinary Russians , for example , refuse to face the costs of their government &apos;s Ukraine policy , not just because they underestimate them , but because they somehow seem unimportant relative to the huge psychological boost the policy brings . 
Nationalism today is not nearly as virulent as it was in the 1930s , because economic distress is much less pronounced . 
But its revival is a portent of what happens when a form of politics claims to satisfy every human need except the coziness of communal belonging - and then lets the people down .
