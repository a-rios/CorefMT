Global Warming &apos;s Dirty Secret 
Last week , the European Union declared that it had practically saved the planet . 
With European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso claiming that Europe will lead the way on climate change , the EU has promised to cut CO2 emissions by 20 % below 1990-levels by 2020 . 
Of course , with the EU already having promised an 8 % cut by next year in the Kyoto Protocol , this new target seems slightly less ambitious . 
Moreover , in continuing the fundamental problems besetting the crippled Kyoto Protocol , the EU has essentially gone and made a worse deal . 
Man-made climate change is , of course , real , and constitutes a serious problem . 
Yet the current cut-emissions-now-before-it-is-too-late mindset neglects the fact that the world has no sensible short-term solutions . 
This seems to be why we focus on feel-good approaches like the Kyoto Protocol , whose fundamental problem has always been that it is simultaneously impossibly ambitious , environmentally inconsequential , and inordinately expensive . 
It required such big reductions that only few countries could live up to it . 
Some countries , like the United States and Australia , chose to opt out of its stringent demands ; others , like Canada , Japan , and a raft of European states , pay lip service to its requirements but will essentially miss its targets . 
Yet , even if everyone had participated and continued to stick to Kyoto &apos;s ever more stringent commitments , it would have had virtually no environmental effect . 
The treaty &apos;s effect on temperature would be immeasurable by mid-century and only postpone warming by five years in 2100 . 
Nonetheless , the cost would have been anything but trivial - an estimated $ 180 billion per year . 
With its high-pitched rhetoric , you would be forgiven for believing that the EU has now single-handedly taken the major step towards solving the problem . 
Barroso calls the agreement &quot; historic , &quot; Tony Blair extols its &quot; groundbreaking , bold , ambitious targets , &quot; and German Chancellor Angela Merkel even ventured that the promises &quot; can avoid what could well be a human calamity . &quot; 
But nobody sees fit to reveal the agreement &apos;s dirty little secret : it will do next to no good , and again at very high cost . 
According to one well-established and peer-reviewed model , the effect of the EU cutting emissions by 20 % will postpone warming in 2100 by just two years , yet the cost will be about $ 90 billion annually . 
It will be costly , because Europe is a costly place to cut CO2 , and it will be inconsequential , because the EU will account for only about 6 % of all emissions in the twenty-first century . 
So the new treaty will be an even less efficient use of our resources than the old Kyoto Protocol . 
It is important to learn from the past . 
We have often been promised dramatic cuts in CO2 emissions far into the future , only to see the promises vanish when we got there . 
In Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , the West promised to stabilize emissions , but overshot by 12 % . 
In Kyoto , we were promised a 7 % reduction in world emissions , but will probably achieve only 0.4 % . 
Of course , those promises were made by politicians who in all likelihood will no longer be in office when the time comes to fulfil them . 
We will not be able to solve global warming over the next decades , but only the next half or full century . 
We need to find a viable , long-term strategy that is smart , equitable , and doesn &apos;t require inordinate sacrifice for trivial benefits . 
Fortunately , there is such a strategy : research and development . 
Investing in R D of non-carbon-emitting energy technologies would leave future generations able to make serious and yet economically feasible and advantageous cuts . 
A new global warming treaty should mandate spending 0.05 % of GDP on R D in the future . 
The EU &apos;s new global warming agreement may help win elections for leaders faced with voters scared by the prospect of climate change . 
But it will do virtually no good , at high cost , and - as with many other lofty promises from the EU - it will carry a high probability of failure . 
Let us hope that the rest of the world will keep its cool and propose a better , cheaper , and more effective solution for the future .
