What Now ? 
More Europe ! 
The rejection of the European Union &apos;s Constitution by French and Dutch voters forces us to think well beyond that treaty . 
That much is clear from the current debate on the Community budget . 
The naysayers &quot; victories show that sovereignty-based arguments that oppose any kind of European political union are on the march . 
Euroskeptics , it seems , are gaining ground everywhere , and a kind of xenophobia is on the rise . 
But xenophobia and sovereignty were not the primary impulses that propelled the &quot; no &quot; votes . 
Above all , the &quot; no &quot; votes in France and Holland - and rising discontent in other member states , such as Germany - are the result of the inability of national governments and the Union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens . 
Not only anti-Europeans rejected the constitution ; far from it . 
Many Europeans are , in fact , calling on the EU to act to reduce unemployment and to intervene decisively in the international arena . 
Many interpreted Europe &apos;s internal division over the war in Iraq , with ordinary citizens overwhelmingly opposed to military intervention , as a sign of the Union &apos;s weakness . 
But the answer to such doubt and dismay is more Europe , not less . 
The European Council &apos;s summit on June 16-17 should give a clear sign that it recognizes this . 
Most supporters of the Constitution believe that it will not only help build a citizens &quot; Europe , but also create better conditions for European economic development , and for the EU to act globally . 
They are right . 
It would be imprudent to assume that the French and Dutch &quot; no &quot; votes were not about discontent with Union policies ; but that anger was directed against the French and Dutch governments , not Europe itself . 
The fact is that citizens in every EU member country are increasingly aware that national policies are determined by decision making at the European level , over which they have little influence . 
The European Constitution has little to do with this , but referenda are never confined to the actual questions put to voters . 
Instead , they provide opportunities for citizens to express what they feel about the choices their governments make , particularly within the EU framework . 
The 2004 elections for the European Parliament had already shown that the level of discontent with the Union was high . 
Voters heavily punished almost all national governments . 
Yet nobody thought that that election had changed the course of Europe . 
Above all , the French and Dutch referendums confirmed that politics in the Union is now conducted &quot; on the street , &quot; and that it is no longer possible to &quot; construct &quot; Europe at a distance and by stealth . 
This means that EU governments must respond to popular anxieties and make the Union more transparent and democratic . 
This would be a lot easier with the Constitution in place , but there are measures that can and should be adopted now to make that possible . 
First , the community budget should be structured so that it has a significant impact on growth and employment ( a return to the voluntarism of the Delors Packages , now applied to the Lisbon Strategy ) . 
Second , European governments must show a real commitment to act together . 
A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there . 
Finally , Council meetings should be open when legislative matters are at stake , so that citizens can know who voted for what and according to which criteria . 
All of this can be decided at the next European Council , even before the constitutional problem is resolved . 
This kind of action is more likely to win back a skeptical citizenry than any information campaign , however well designed . 
At the same time , it is necessary to solve the Constitutional deadlock . 
As already proposed by the Convention , this would mean separating constitutional matters per se from Union policy . 
The real innovations are found in Part I and II of the proposed Constitution , in the definition of the normative and political identity of the Union , its competences , the new institutional balance - including the creation of a European Minister of Foreign Affairs - and , last but not least , the introduction of a Bill of Rights . 
The part that was actually rejected and raises the most concerns among citizens of the member States is in Part III , which focuses on Union policies such as the Common Market , competition policy and the Common Agricultural Policy . 
So the first and second parts could be ratified without new negotiations and could form the basis for the new Treaty , so that the Treaty of Nice would still apply ; and the debate on the European social model would continue . 
It is essential to reaffirm the normative essence of the Constitutional Treaty to protect the greatest achievement of the Constitutional Convention . 
Diversity and inclusiveness , through the integration of European democracies with a common project , remains Europe &apos;s great gift to the world . 
It is what has made Europe an &quot; international public good &quot; to use former Brazilian foreign minister Celso Lafer &apos;s felicitous turn of phrase . 
Such a Europe is better placed to contribute to a fairer international order than the narrow , bitter Europe the xenophobes have in mind . 
For Europe to remain a promise for the world , it must thrive as a public good for all its citizens . 
Europe and Europeans cannot wait for a new treaty to show that the Union is able to fulfill that promise .
