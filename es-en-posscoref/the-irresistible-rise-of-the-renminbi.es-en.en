The Irresistible Rise of the Renminbi 
BEIJING - China is making a big push to encourage greater international use of its currency , the renminbi . 
It has an agreement with Brazil to facilitate use of the two countries &quot; currencies in bilateral trade transactions . 
It has signed renminbi swap agreements with Argentina , Belarus , Hong Kong , Indonesia , South Korea , and Malaysia . 
Last summer , it expanded renminbi settlement agreements between Hong Kong and five mainland cities , and authorized HSBC Holdings to sell renminbi bonds in Hong Kong . 
Then , in September , the Chinese government issued in Hong Kong about $ 1 billion worth of its own renminbi-denominated bonds . 
All of these initiatives are aimed at reducing dependence on the dollar both at home and abroad by encouraging importers , exporters , and investors to make more use of China &apos;s currency . 
The ultimate goal is to ensure that China eventually gains the flexibility and financial prerogatives that come with being a reserve-currency country . 
No one questions that the renminbi is on the rise . 
For the same reasons that the global economy has become more multipolar , the international monetary system will become more multipolar , with several currencies sharing reserve-currency status . 
The question is when . 
Cautious observers warn that making the renminbi a true international currency will take time . 
Making it attractive for private and official international use will require China to build deep and liquid financial markets . 
It will require a benchmark asset , a well-defined yield curve , and a critical mass of market participants . 
All of these dimensions of liquid markets take time to build . 
Moreover , those markets will have to be open to the rest of the world . 
In other words , China will have to fully open its capital account before the renminbi can become a true international currency . 
This will require putting banks and state-owned enterprises on a fully commercial footing , and moving to a more flexible exchange rate . 
In short , it will entail fundamental changes in the Chinese growth model . 
All this is a reminder that the task will not be completed overnight . 
But the United States &quot; own history suggests that the process can be completed more quickly than is sometimes supposed . 
As late as 1914 , the dollar played absolutely no international role . 
No central bank held its foreign reserves in dollars . 
No one issued foreign bonds in dollars . 
Instead , they all went to London , allowing British banks to underwrite their transactions and conducting their business in sterling . 
Even US importers and exporters requiring trade credits obtained them in London rather than New York and did their business in sterling rather than dollars . 
That London rather than New York still dominated in 1914 , when the US economy was already more than twice the size of Britain &apos;s , reflected the latter &apos;s head start as an industrial power , an exporter , and a foreign investor . 
This is a reminder that incumbency is a considerable advantage in the competition for reserve-currency status . 
In particular , the US lacked a liquid market in trade acceptances , the instrument used to finance imports and exports . 
This changed in 1914 with the creation of the Federal Reserve System . 
One of the new central bank &apos;s first actions was to encourage the development of a market in trade acceptances . 
It did so by using repurchase agrements to buy for its own account the majority of trade acceptances issued in New York . 
As a result of this official support , private investors gained confidence in the new instrument . 
New York surpassed London as a source of trade finance by the mid-1920 &quot; s . 
At this point , the Fed could curtail its intervention and give the market over to private investors . 
In the second half of the 1920 &quot; s they held more of their reserves in dollars than sterling . 
Thus , it took barely a decade , from a standing start , for the new international currency to overtake the incumbent . 
Chinese officials have targeted 2020 as the date by which both Beijing and Shanghai should become leading international financial centers , with deep and liquid financial markets open to the rest of the world . 
By implication , that is the date by which they want to see the renminbi become a leading international currency . 
Can the renminbi become a major international currency in as little as a decade ? 
Only time will tell .
