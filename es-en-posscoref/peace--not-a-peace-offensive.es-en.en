Peace , Not a Peace Offensive 
TOKYO - When a North Korean dove clutching an olive branch suddenly appears , the world should challenge it to reveal its hidden talons . 
This is the only prudent stance for South Korea to adopt when face-to-face negotiations with the North begin on February 8 . 
Kim &apos;s less-than-innocent intentions are demonstrated by his regime &apos;s secret construction of a massive uranium-enrichment facility , containing more than 2,000 centrifuges , revealed to Stanford University &apos;s Siegfried Hecker , a former director of America &apos;s Los Alamos National Laboratory . 
The existence of the facility seems as clear a declaration as possible that the regime is committed to achieving the capacity to intimidate its neighbors with its nuclear arsenal . 
Some believe that North Korea has begun displaying its growing nuclear threat in order to secure the succession to power of Kim Jong-un , Kim Jong-il &apos;s rotund , twenty-something youngest son . 
The &quot; Dear Leader &apos;s &quot; key objective is most likely to secure his own position , given the North &apos;s dire economic condition . 
The challenges facing Kim are piling up . 
Deification of the leader , once the foundation of the regime , is disintegrating . 
Economic failure , chronic food shortages , mounting public distrust of and animosity toward Kim &apos;s government , and an apparent reluctance within elements of the North Korean military to go to war all point to the regime &apos;s increasing fragility . 
There are also signs of growing adoration of liberal countries such as the US and South Korea throughout North Korean society - a sentiment that the regime has sought to appease by broadcasting one or two Western films on state television . 
More ominously , crime is on the rise and a breakdown in state-controlled health care is fueling the spread of various types of infectious disease . 
Kim &apos;s hope must be that , by showing off his nuclear arsenal , he can bully the US , Japan , and South Korea into helping him to resolve some of his regime &apos;s domestic crises . 
Most immediately , Kim &apos;s aim is to pressure Barack Obama &apos;s administration into weakening the US-led sanctions against North Korea , having evidently decided that his dynasty has no future so long as the sanctions remain in place . 
To drive the point home , his regime has been refusing to attend multilateral talks . 
Here Kim has shown just how fundamentally flawed his understanding of the workings of Western democracy is . 
He apparently believed that , following the defeat that Obama absorbed in the mid-term elections , the US would lack the will to stand up to a fresh nuclear threat and would move to conclude a peace accord with his regime , thus perpetuating his dynasty . 
&quot; We are ready for both dialogue and war , &quot; Kim has declared . 
But , of course , just the opposite is true : the victory of conservative Republicans in Congress has left Obama with even less room to offer carrots to the North . 
Moreover , nuclear brinkmanship is a particularly poor tactic , since Kim &apos;s behavior is now becoming fused in American minds with arguably the most serious strategic threat on the US agenda : Iran &apos;s push to secure nuclear weapons of its own . 
Indeed , there is considerable talk among Western security services that the recently disclosed centrifuges were not actually assembled in the Nyeongbyeon facility , implying that Kim &apos;s regime is hiding another facility . 
The question then becomes , who helped Kim build these facilities ? 
Although there is mounting circumstantial evidence of cooperative exchanges between North Korea and Iran , no conclusive proof has been found . 
It has been reported that more than 200 North Koreans are currently working surreptitiously in Iran . 
If these include personnel from Room 99 , Kim &apos;s secret nuclear directorate , and Room 39 , the bureau that controls his slush fund of hard currencies , more attention is needed . 
Of course , the inner workings of Kim &apos;s regime are shrouded in mystery , not only to the outside world , but also to most of North Korea &apos;s government . 
The only way to increase transparency from outside is to shine a light on North Korea &apos;s external activities , which means exposing as many connections and links between North Korea and Iran as can be found . 
Nuclear cooperation between North Korea and Iran is no doubt assisting both countries to flaunt international norms - and now it appears that Burma has joined this axis of illicit nuclear proliferation . 
One country could help the world gain the transparency - and the leverage - that it needs : China , over whose territory Iran and North Korea must be conducting their nuclear relations . 
Assuming that China does not approve of this unholy alliance , it has a responsibility to call a halt to these exchanges . 
Vague expressions of concern , such as those offered by President Hu Jintao during his Washington summit , will not do the job .
