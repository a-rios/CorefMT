Will the Bond Bubble Burst ? 
Unless inflation drops much more , now is an ideal time to be a borrower and a bad time to be a lender or investor in long-term bonds . 
Indeed , in many countries , exaggerated fears of deflation are keeping interest rates depressed and the cost of capital at historic lows . 
The lowest rates were seen on June 13 th . 
Ten-year bonds in the US yielded 3.11 % , not much above the 2.1 % inflation rate of the past 12 months . 
Ten-year government bonds in the Euro-area yielded 3.54 % , while the Euro-area inflation rate was 1.9 % . 
The yield in the UK was 3.86 % , while inflation was 3 % , and Japanese bonds yielded 0.44 % , compared with inflation of -0.1 % . 
In each case , a small increase in today &apos;s very low inflation rates would eliminate any real gain from investing in bonds . 
If low long-term rates do not hold , long-term bond prices will drop sharply , leaving investors with a loss . 
The history of developed-country bond markets in the last half-century is relatively straightforward . 
Consumer inflation increased fairly steadily ( albeit with major short-run swings ) , until the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-81 propelled it to historic highs in Europe , North America , Japan and other countries . 
Afterwards , the trend was reversed , and inflation declined fairly steadily . 
The oil crises marked a political as well as an economic turning point . 
Until that time , central banks , fearing recession , were gradually losing their grip on inflation . 
But public anger over sky-high price growth precipitated by the oil crises finally allowed central banks to tighten credit and smother inflation with massive global recessions . 
Corporate managers , meanwhile , got the public support needed to resist many cost-of-living allowances that were fueling a wage-price spiral . 
The general investing public never really understood these trends . 
They did not comprehend the upward trend in prices before 1980 , so bond yields , lagging behind rising inflation , were too low . 
In the US , ten-year US Treasury yields averaged only 1.46 % above the inflation rate between 1953 , when annual average inflation was only 0.63 % , and March 1980 , when inflation peaked at 14.66 % . 
Nor did the investing public fully comprehend the downtrend in inflation after 1980 , so long-term bond yields , lagging behind falling inflation , were too high . 
In the US , yields on ten-year Treasuries have averaged 4.14 % above the rate of inflation throughout the period of declining inflation that began in April 1980 . 
The public &apos;s failure to recognize inflation trends meant that long-term bonds were a terrible investment until 1980 , when inflation was only a little lower than yields , and a lucrative investment thereafter , when declining inflation and high yields guaranteed large real gains . 
Investors are again making the mistake of pricing bonds in expectation that the downward trend of inflation will continue into deflationary territory . 
Indeed , today &apos;s low long-term rates suggest that investors are projecting the downward trend to continue over the next ten years at the same pace that it has done since 1980 , implying that the current US inflation rate of 2.1 % would fall to zero or below by 2013 . 
Is this reasonable ? 
Almost certainly not . 
No central bank would permit deflation for long , and the current level of inflation probably represents the lower boundary that most monetary authorities consider acceptable . 
At the same time , there is no such clear upper bound to inflation . 
So with inflation rates near their long-term lower bound , the expectation should be for higher , not lower , inflation rates over the longer term . 
The current situation in the bond markets does not reflect this because of public overreaction to the talk of deflation , with Japan used as a scarecrow . 
But even in Japan , annual deflation has been only about 0.7 % since 1998 , and was caused by a monetary-policy error unlikely to be repeated . 
Japan is really the only example of advanced-country deflation in the post-1945 era . 
So why should bad policy by the Bank of Japan set the trend for world inflation rates ? 
Indeed , the opposite may be the case : combating deflation could have the perverse effect of creating high inflation . 
This is what Masuru Hayami , the former governor of the Bank of Japan , feared when he resisted calls for more monetary stimulus . 
He was right to worry : a sharply expanding money supply may have unexpected and unquantifiable lagged effects . 
The kinds of heterodox monetary policy that might be used to prevent deflation similarly risk an overreaction and renewed inflation . 
But fear of deflation is so widespread nowadays that if inflation overshoots the target , central banks will merely try to stop further inflation , rather than try to bring the consumer price level back down which would mean deflation . 
Then any inflationary monetary policy errors driven by exaggerated fears of deflation will be allowed to stand , and the cumulative inflation will offset any returns on investments in long-term bonds . 
Today &apos;s fears about deflation may represent a historic turning point , much as when the public mood turned decisively against inflation around 1980 . 
Conventional wisdom has changed , and many people will be breathing a sigh of relief when inflation rates rise above 3 % or more in the US and elsewhere . 
If we have arrived at such a turning point , as the trend in bond markets in recent weeks might suggest , it will be a turning point for interest rates and bond prices as well . 
The current combination of exceptionally low yields and high prices suggests that much of the world is in a bond-market bubble , and when it bursts in coming years , a period of higher long-term interest rates and lower long-term bond prices will follow .
