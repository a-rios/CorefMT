Crony capitalism American-style 
Remember the East Asia crisis ? when the US Treasury and its IMF allies blamed that region &apos;s problems on crony capitalism , lack of transparency , and poor corporate governance ? 
Countries were told to follow the American model , use American auditing firms , bring in American entrepreneurs to teach them how to run their companies . 
( Never mind that under the leadership of their own entrepreneurs East Asia grew faster than any other region - and with greater stability - over the previous three decades . ) 
The unfolding Enron scandal brings new meaning to two favorite American sayings : &quot; What goes around comes around , &quot; and &quot; People in glass houses shouldn &apos;t throw stones . &quot; 
Enron used fancy accounting tricks and complicated financial products ( derivatives ) to mislead investors about its value . 
No transparency here . 
It used its money to buy influence and power , shape U.S. energy policy , and avoid regulations . 
Crony capitalism is not new ; nor is it the province of a single party . 
Former US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reportedly tried to influence the current government to intervene on behalf of Enron in its hotly contested dispute in India . 
In office , he had intervened when the supposedly independent board for setting accounting standards tried to clean up the accounting of senior executives &apos; share options . 
Partly thanks to him , this effort to make corporate accounting more transparent was stymied . 
America &apos;s willingness to provide multi-billion dollar bail-outs to airlines or to create cartels to protect its steel and aluminum industries suggests that free market ideology is but a thin guise for old-fashioned corporate welfare : give to those with the appropriate connections . 
To some , the fact that Enron was not bailed out and the problems uncovered , is testimony to the absence of crony capitalism . 
I have a different interpretation : it is testimony to the importance of a free press , which may not stop but can curtail abuses . 
As the press started taking a closer look at Enron , the number of members of Congress who had accepted money from Enron became clear . 
Campaign contributions were not just a matter of public spirit , but an investment . 
Like many of Enron &apos;s investments , it worked well in the short run , but did not pan out in the long run . 
Many lessons emerge . 
Some concern politics : the Enron scandal strengthens the case for campaign finance reform , and the need for even stronger laws requiring public disclosure . 
Democracies are undermined by corporate interests being able to , in effect , buy elections . 
The Bush administration , however , refuses to disclose information which would show the role of corporate interests in setting its energy policy . 
Other lessons concern economics , especially the economics of information . 
For markets to work , for the appropriate signals for efficient resource allocation to be provided , investors must have as much information as possible . 
There are inherent conflicts of interest : owners and managers have a natural incentive to present a picture as rosy as possible . 
Auditing is intended to put limits on potential abuses . 
But who is to guard the guardians ? 
Who is to audit the auditors ? 
We rely heavily on incentives . 
Auditors desire to maintain their reputation . 
But the interlinking of consulting and auditing practices puts other perverse incentives in place : an incentive to please the clients , who dislike unfavorable reports . 
Arthur Levitt , the former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , recognized the conflict : as many within the auditing firms focus on their own short-term interests , the integrity of the audits could be compromised . 
He is perhaps the unsung hero of the entire debacle . 
But the auditing firms and their corporate clients - not surprisingly , given the cabal that developed - roundly attacked his proposal for separating consulting from auditing . 
What Levitt grasped - and what the Enron debacle shows so clearly - is that incentives matter , but that unfettered markets by themselves may not provide the right incentives . 
Markets may not provide incentives for wealth creation ; they may provide incentives for the kind of shenanigans Enron pursued . 
The new economy - and its complicated new financial instruments - enhance the problems of reliable accounting frameworks ; they make it easier to obfuscate . 
Rather than facing up to the issues , corporate America systematically turns its back - aided and abetted by crony capitalism , American style . 
The central issue of our time is finding the right balance between the government and the market . 
The status quo will argue that Enron is an exception : that its demise was due to fraud , that we have laws against fraud , and that those who violate these laws should and will bear the consequences . 
But much of what Enron did was not illegal . 
Its auditors claim that its central practices were within the law ; that thousands of firms do the same . 
They are right - and that &apos;s the problem . 
Investors need assurance that information received adequately reflects the economic situation of a firm . 
Within the current regulatory and legal environment , with derivatives and other off-balance-sheet liabilities , there is no way for investors to have that assurance today . 
We need better standards and stronger laws . 
While we will never be able to prevent all abuses , we can get the incentives right . 
We can try to inculcate better ethical standards . 
But we cannot rely on them when so many worldly people see nothing wrong with revolving doors . 
They claim to manage conflicts of interest ; but we see that they may manage them for their own interests . 
But even as evidence for such abuses becomes apparent , new venues for abuse are repeatedly opened up - take the US repeal of the Glass Steagall Act , which separated commercial from investment banking . 
Repeatedly , we have seen the consequences of the excesses of deregulation , of unfettered markets . 
Now we must resist the temptation to go to the other extreme . 
The challenge is : get the balance right .
