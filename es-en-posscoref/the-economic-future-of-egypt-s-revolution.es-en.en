The Economic Future of Egypt &apos;s Revolution 
CAMBRIDGE - For Egypt , the question of the day is whether the country will build an open , democratic political system or relapse into some form - new or old - of autocracy . 
But an equally important question - above all for Egyptians , but also for other developing countries ( and for development experts ) - is the economic impact of its revolution . 
For the past quarter-century , a major agenda item for the international development organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , has been to bolster developing nations &quot; financial markets . 
Stronger financial markets can move savings to where they can do the most to spur economic growth . 
And that capacity has been seen as one of the handful of key prerequisites for economic development . 
Making finance work should boost economic development significantly . 
Economic historians point to financial revolutions as setting the stage for strong economic development in England ( in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , following the Glorious Revolution ) , in the United States ( after Alexander Hamilton in the 1790 &quot; s built up major financial structures in a primarily agricultural country ) , and in Japan ( after the Meiji Restoration ) . 
The World Bank , the IMF , and dozens of academics have studied long and hard what makes financial markets grow and what holds them back . 
Many focus on the quality of institutions , such as courts and tax authorities . 
Others emphasize the quality of corporate law . 
Still others look at policies , like trade openness or lightness of taxation . 
Everyone extols property rights . 
Yet , when one looks at what actually happens in developing countries , the lessons are disappointing . 
Though some countries have fixed their court systems , streamlined their tax administrations , and begun to get a handle on corruption , the impact on financial markets has been uneven . 
Worse still for some theories of what makes financial markets flourish are the examples of the US , Great Britain , and Japan . 
Financial markets leaped forward in eighteenth-century Great Britain , and in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Japan and the US - a time when several key institutions , such as corporate law and the court system , were woefully substandard . 
American courts in the nineteenth century were notably corrupt , sometimes incompetent , and often irrelevant , yet stock and bond markets grew , and continent-spanning firms rose up and got the financing they needed to operate , expand , and industrialize the US economy . 
The core protective legal institution for outside finance , the federal securities laws , didn &apos;t fall into place until the 1930 &quot; s - decades after US financial markets had grown to finance America &apos;s economic rise . 
Britain and Japan seem to have followed the same sequence : finance first , protective institutions later . 
Japan had no corporate law until complex business finance started developing at the end of the nineteenth century . 
Yet that sequence is the opposite of what one might have expected : only after financial markets developed did those with a stake in them press for better legislation to protect investors . 
So , in Britain , Japan , and the US , something more foundational must have been in place before financial markets started operating . 
Something else must affect which countries are most likely to get strong finance , which won &apos;t , and when it all happens . 
That &quot; something &quot; now usually seems to be basic political stability , preferably of the democratic kind . 
In a stable political environment , informal mechanisms - such as reputations for reliability , trade associations , and stock exchanges - can develop and facilitate financial dealings . 
Investors and businesses don &apos;t fear that a new regime can take power and call off all , or too many , bets , leading to losses on their investments . 
The data linking democratic political instability and financial backwardness in the modern era , which Jordan Siegel of the Harvard Business School and I analyze in a forthcoming article , show unmistakably that instability powerfully predicts an inability to develop financial markets . 
Democratic political stability is the most important harbinger of financial development . 
There is a deep logic to this finding . 
Even if all of the rules for finance are right , few will part with their money if they fear that an unfavorable regime change might occur during the lifetime of their investment . 
More importantly , the grim stability of the type displayed by Hosni Mubarak &apos;s Egypt is oftentimes insufficient for genuine financial development . 
Authoritarian regimes , especially those with severe income and wealth inequality , inherently create a risk of arbitrariness , unpredictability , and instability . 
They are themselves arbitrary . 
Because financiers and savers have limited confidence in the future , such regimes can &apos;t readily build and maintain strong foundations for financial development . 
By contrast , democratic regimes with widespread property ownership typically best protect property rights over the long term , because enough people in the polity want to protect property . 
Yes , the rules of the game count for finance . 
But what counts even more is that the polity has a continuing , stable stake in keeping those rules in place and making them work for finance and economic growth . 
So , what does this mean for Egypt ? 
The Egyptian revolution is political thus far , not economic . 
Yet , if the revolution leads to a more open , democratic , middle-class-oriented political system , in which enough people believe that they have a stake in the government &apos;s continuity , the economic benefits for Egyptians could be large . 
Financial markets will more likely flourish , and more rapid and equitable development will more likely follow .
