Le défi Chinois6e3bd40146f86f4031f85308 
Thirty-five years ago Jean _ Jacques Servan _ Schreiber &apos;s &quot; Le Défi Americain &quot; ( The American Challenge ) claimed that Europe was in danger of becoming a branch office for American multinationals . 
A decade later , Japan &apos;s rising commercial challenge seemed paramount . 
Now China makes people nervous . 
But today &apos;s responses to China &apos;s economic challenge may be as misbegotten as yesterday &apos;s answers to le défi Americain . 
China in 2002 resembles nothing so much as Japan in the 1960s , when it was preparing to become a global competitor , with echoes of Dickensian England and America &apos;s &quot; robber baron &quot; era of the late 1800s , when the US first rose to global economic power . 
What is unprecedented is that something similar should occur in a Communist nation , or in one with such a massive population . 
The new China is symbolized by an electronics components factory in Shenzhen in the Pearl River ( Zhu Jiang ) Delta . 
When I visited it , the factory had 10,000 workers , each earning about $ 80 per month . 
All were young women . 
None wore eyeglasses . 
&quot; Don &apos;t you have employees with bad eyesight ? &quot; 
I asked . 
They can find another job - that &apos;s not my problem . &quot; 
Indeed , those laid off generally do not return to peasant life , but become urban entrepreneurs in the service industries of China &apos;s new cities . 
China owes its growing dynamism partly to the central authorities &apos; shrewd pursuit of well-timed and complementary development strategies . 
Less noticed than the 15-year process of gaining admission to the World Trade Organization has been the stabilization of the currency , the renminbi ( RMB ) , pegged to the Hong Kong dollar since 1997 , when the territory reverted to Chinese rule . 
By prohibiting exchange of RMB abroad , the central authorities prevented the currency fluctuations that in recent years wreaked havoc in other developing nations . 
But the real key to China &apos;s success is not found in Beijing , but at lower levels of government . 
In most regions , officials welcome foreign businesses - offering tax-free zones and other benefits - and unfettered competition as a means of strengthening their industries . 
More than 100,000 component manufacturers , mostly from Japan or Taiwan , have relocated to China &apos;s Pearl River and Yangtze River Delta regions , which always had cheap labor but now also have modern highways , port facilities , and communications links . 
Nearly $ 45 billion in foreign direct investment entered China in 2000 , compared with about $ 10 billion for Japan and even less for Asia &apos;s tigers . 
Much of that money went directly into raising industrial productivity . 
A typical Chinese factory once consisted of rows of women at workbenches . 
Today factories are as modern , sophisticated , and automated as their Japanese counterparts , and their managers are mastering the skills needed to compete globally faster than in any other nation I have studied . 
China &apos;s regions learned to specialize by competing fiercely for foreign investors . 
Each has its cluster of component suppliers and professional service providers , with an infrastructure of transportation lines , communications networks , and research laboratories to support them . 
They are also developing links to the outside world independent of China &apos;s central government . 
Because China &apos;s domestic market is so huge , many companies have not yet turned their attention overseas . 
But they are poised to become the most capable and competitive original equipment manufacturers - producers of goods sold under other brand names -  that the world has ever seen . 
Malaysia and Thailand spent ten years building the expertise , production base , and infrastructure for precision metalworks that could sell components to Swiss watch manufacturers . 
Chinese firms took over that business in only a year . 
The same is happening with electronics and machinery . 
China is now doing to Asia what Japan did to the West 20 years ago . 
Suddenly , it is extremely difficult for a non-Chinese company to compete in any worldwide market with a strategy of low-cost , low-price commodities , even if those commodities are precision electronics components . 
Few commodities are out of reach for Chinese industry , because , unlike any other nation , it can simultaneously mobilize low-cost labor and high-tech automation . 
Singapore and Taiwan weathered Asia &apos;s 1997 financial crisis relatively unscathed , but their manufacturers are suffering now . 
Much of Taiwan &apos;s manufacturing sector has migrated across the Taiwan Strait - despite restrictions on direct contacts with the mainland - and Singapore is becoming a kind of Asian Switzerland , betting its prosperity on investments in China . 
Indonesia , the Philippines , and Thailand , which lack Singapore &apos;s resources , are likely to suffer deprivation , fragmentation , and unrest , to say nothing of countries such as Laos , Cambodia , and Myanmar . 
What does this Chinese juggernaut mean for Japan , Europe , the US , and other wealthy regions ? 
For consumers , it is an unalloyed boon . 
Chinese industries will cut costs , raise quality , and propel innovation for most consumer and industrial products - not just because of their own efforts , but because global companies vying for position in China are putting their own best practices to use there . 
This will lead to a frenetic new wave of competition , but not between China , America , and Japan as monolithic entities . 
In each industry and region , companies will race to internalize China &apos;s new methods in order to beat their local and immediate competitors - just as US management methods have been internalized by companies around the world , including within China . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s growth will pose a greater challenge to the global status quo , both diplomatically and economically , than , say , Islamic extremism . 
Politicians and businesspeople will complain . 
When we meet the enemy , we will discover that it is us .
