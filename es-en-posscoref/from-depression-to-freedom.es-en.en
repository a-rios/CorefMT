From Depression to Freedom 
Clinical depression affects roughly one in four people at some point in their lives . 
It is a severe and prolonged state of mind in which normal sadness grows into a painful state of hopelessness , listlessness , lack of motivation , and fatigue . 
Mild depression can result in brooding on negative aspects of self or others , feeling resentful , irritable or angry much of the time , feeling sorry for oneself , and needing constant reassurance from someone . 
It can also result in various physical complaints that do not seem to be caused by any physical illness . 
As depression worsens , feelings of extreme sadness and hopelessness combine with low self-esteem , guilt , memory loss , and concentration difficulties to bring about a severely painful state of mind . 
To make things worse , there may be a change in basic bodily functions . 
The usual daily rhythms seem to go wrong : can &apos;t sleep , or sleep too much , can &apos;t eat , or eat too much . 
Enthusiasm for what are usually enjoyable activities fades . 
Sometimes , there is even a feeling that life is not worth living and that one would be better off dead . 
The most commonly used treatment for major depression is antidepressant medication . 
It is relatively cheap , and it is easy for family practitioners , who treat the majority of depressed people , to prescribe . 
However , when the episode has passed , and medication ceases , depression tends to return , and at least 50 % of those who experienced an initial episode of depression find that depression comes back , despite appearing to have made a full recovery . 
After a second or third episode , the risk of recurrence rises to 80-90 % . 
For those who have been suicidal in the past , any depressed mood is likely to be accompanied by a return of suicidal thinking . 
The problem with viewing antidepressants as the main method for preventing recurrence is that many people do not want to stay on medication for indefinite periods , and when the medication stops , the risk of becoming depressed again returns . 
Finding new ways of helping people stay well after depression demands an understanding of why depression keeps returning . 
During a period of crisis in which someone becomes depressed and suicidal , an association is learned between the various symptoms ( low mood , physical pain , suicidal tendencies , and so on ) . 
This means that when the negative mood returns , for any reason , it will tend to trigger all the other symptoms - a process called &quot; cognitive reactivity &quot; ) . 
The discovery that the link between negative moods and negative thoughts remains ready to be reactivated even when people feel well is hugely important : it means that preventing future crises depends on learning how to keep mild upsets from spiraling out of control . 
Research has shown that combining the ancient practice of meditation with modern psychotherapies can accomplish this . 
Based on Jon Kabat Zinn &apos;s Stress Reduction program at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center , Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) combines modern cognitive behavioral therapy with meditation practices to help people become more aware of the present moment , including getting in touch with moment-to-moment changes in the mind and body ( see www.mbct.co.uk ) . 
In weekly classes ( the atmosphere is that of a class , rather than a therapy group ) , and by listening to CD &apos;s or tapes at home during the week , participants learn the practice of mindfulness meditation . 
The classes also include basic education about our moods , and several exercises from cognitive therapy that show the links between thinking and feeling and how participants can best look after themselves when a crisis threatens to overwhelm them . 
The MBCT approach helps participants in the classes to see more clearly the patterns of the mind and to learn how to recognize when their mood is starting to sink . 
It helps break the normal link between negative mood and negative thinking . 
Participants develop the capacity to allow distressing moods , thoughts , and sensations to come and go , without having to battle with them . 
They find that they can stay in touch with the present moment without having to ruminate about the past or worry about the future . 
Thus , they come to see with greater clarity and conviction how to approach moment-by-moment experience skillfully , taking more pleasure in the good things that often go unnoticed or unappreciated while dealing more effectively with the difficulties encountered , whether real or imagined . 
Two controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that MBCT can reduce the likelihood of relapse by about 40-50 % in people who have suffered three or more previous episodes of depression . 
As a result of such findings , MBCT has now been included in the British government &apos;s national guidelines for treating recurrent major depression . 
But this implies a redefinition of treatment itself . 
As our understanding of depression grows and we see that it is a recurring problem , the emphasis is shifting from cure to prevention . 
Mindfulness-based approaches have already proven that they will play an enormously important role in this .
