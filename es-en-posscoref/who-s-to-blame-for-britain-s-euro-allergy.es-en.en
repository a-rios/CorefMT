Who \ u0027s to Blame for Britain \ u0027s Euro Allergy ? 
Forty years ago , Charles de Gaulle said &quot; Non &quot; to Britain &apos;s request to join the European Community . 
By June 9 , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will offer his own &quot; No &quot; to Europe . 
But Britain &apos;s decision whether to join the single European currency , the Euro , was taken long ago , and it was always going to be some version of &quot; No . &quot; 
When France first invited Britain to join the infant European enterprise , a decade before General de Gaulle barred the door , the supercilious mandarins in Britain &apos;s Treasury ensured that Britain would indignantly reject the offer . 
Treasury bureaucrats have remained predictably anti-European ever since . 
Like the courtiers who surrounded Louis XVIII , they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing . 
The only question now in doubt is whether Brown &apos;s verdict on the Euro will be &quot; Not quite yet , &quot; &quot; Not before the next election , &quot; or just plain &quot; No . &quot; 
It is a decision being taken virtually independently of Prime Minister Tony Blair , and even against his wishes . Blair believes that Britain ought to join the Euro , because he wants Britain to be , as he puts it , &quot; at the heart of Europe . &quot; 
Most commentators tended to assume that , if that &apos;s what Tony Blair wants , then sooner or later that is what will happen , because , after all , he is the Prime Minister . 
The flaw in this reasoning is that Blair surrendered control of the single currency decision to the Treasury early in his first term , and he has never had the courage or political strength to take it back . 
It is sometimes said that Tony Blair is instinctively European ( though that is said less often since the Iraq war ) . 
But when he came to power , in 1997 , he was not able or willing to face down Britain &apos;s traditional anti-Europeanism ; in particular , he was not prepared to commit his government to eventual Euro membership . 
Blair &apos;s solution to his Euro dilemma was to pretend that adopting the Euro was not a major political decision , but a technical question , to be decided on &quot; purely &quot; economic grounds . 
So , in October 1997 , Gordon Brown announced that he had devised five tests to see whether Britain and the Euro were suited to each other . 
In due course , the Treasury would reach a judgment that would be technically expert , economically impartial , and politically neutral . 
If Tony Blair ever believed any of this , he was a fool . 
Brown claimed that his five tests would produce answers that were plain and unambiguous . 
Yet , because they were all questions about the future , they would inevitably be based entirely on speculation . 
Where Gordon Brown himself really stands on the issue is unclear , because he is a deeply secretive man . 
Many believe that his primary concern in the Euro debate is over how it affects his power vis-Ã -vis Blair . 
In any event , once the decision of principle had been subordinated to ostensibly technical economic tests , it was unavoidable that Treasury mandarins , who are institutionally opposed to European integration , would conduct them . 
So the verdict was always going to be &quot; No , &quot; which is why the only freedom of movement for Blair and Brown was going to be &quot; Not yet . &quot; 
Of course , there is not and cannot be an overpowering economic case for joining the Euro , at any time . 
Imagine that the British government decides one day to go for Euro membership , and to put the issue to the test of a referendum . 
At the moment , the electorate is hostile to Euro membership by a large margin ; if the government is to persuade the voters to change their minds on purely economic grounds , it must deploy a powerful case . 
Voters will not be impressed by the Treasury &apos;s mumbo-jumbo ; they will need strong , simple arguments that Britain will be better off by joining . 
If the British economy and the Euro-zone economy are both doing well , the economic case for British membership is obviously weak . 
The same is true if the British economy and the Euro-zone economy are both doing badly . 
If the British economy is doing well and the Euro-zone economy is doing badly , there is no economic case whatsoever for British membership . 
That is the current situation . 
The only scenario in which there could be a strong , purely economic case for Euro membership is one in which the Euro-zone is doing very well , the British economy is doing very badly , and membership looks like the best way to deliver long-term recovery . 
But if the British economy were doing very badly , the other member states might snub Britain . 
Obviously , &quot; doing well &quot; and &quot; doing badly &quot; are clumsy notions ; but we are talking about a referendum , not about higher mathematics . 
A referendum on joining the Euro probably cannot be won unless a British government is willing to say three things : first , that it favors closer EU political integration ; second , that the single currency is but one expression of that integration , and third , that it is committed to Euro membership . 
Curiously , many voters who oppose Euro membership nonetheless believe that it will happen . 
No doubt they would prefer the government to tell them the truth first .
