A Cure for Fiscal Failure ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates ? 
Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people &apos;s feelings about fiscal policy , declaring that &quot; the whole government is a Ponzi scheme . &quot; 
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $ 50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008 . 
Personally , I suspect Madoff &apos;s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while . 
Still , with many of the world &apos;s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt , unprecedented old-age pension obligations , and a downshift in growth , one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is . 
In a new paper , &quot; A Decade of Debt , &quot; Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States , including federal , state , and local debt , has now surpassed the record 120 % of GDP reached at the end of World War II . 
Japan , of course , is in even worse shape , with government debt totaling more than 200 % of GDP . 
Though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves , Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs - and this on top of its depressing demographic trends . 
Many other rich countries &quot; debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs , despite relative peace in much of the world . 
There is a no easy way out . 
For now , low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs , but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods , whereas real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates can rise far more quickly , even for rich countries . 
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue , hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity . 
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts . 
In principle , an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts . 
It is high time to consider novel approaches . 
Of course , no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems . 
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs - including their pension schemes - more realistic . 
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start . 
A number of countries , including Denmark , the Netherlands , the US , and Belgium , have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies , such as the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) . 
But , while these older institutions have proven enormously useful , they are typically quite constrained . 
The CBO , for example , is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth , but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future &quot; fixes &quot; at face value , somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies . 
To enhance credibility , a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence , often with central banks as a role model . 
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden , the United Kingdom , Slovenia , and Canada . 
The remit of Sweden &apos;s fiscal council is particularly broad , giving it a mandate not only to forecast , but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy . 
In principle , an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis . 
In the US , such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans , perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk . 
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks , at least anytime soon . 
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy . 
Still , the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity . 
Of course , fiscal councils by themselves are not enough , no matter how well designed they are . 
It will remain very tempting for each generation to say , &quot; My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I , so who cares if they have to pay some debt ? &quot; 
Moreover , the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias , as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment . 
To resist these powerful pressures , fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund , both to protect their independence and to promote accountability . 
To be sure , Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right , and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever . 
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape .
