Decision Time on Venezuela 
MEXICO CITY - For the last 15 years , Venezuela has been mired in crisis , characterized by wasteful government spending , rampant corruption , growing authoritarianism , relentless human-rights violations , and now economic collapse . 
But , beyond the occasional sharp word from the late President Hugo Chávez , the periodic expropriation of a foreign company without adequate compensation , and some minor meddling in the elections of neighboring countries , the crisis barely registered abroad . 
This is no longer the case . 
Earlier this month , US President Barack Obama officially classified Venezuela as an &quot; extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States , &quot; and ordered sanctions against seven officials , thereby stoking bilateral tensions . 
But , while the crisis in Venezuela undoubtedly has far-reaching implications , the precise motivation behind Obama &apos;s decision remains unclear . 
One possible explanation stems from the enduring passivity of Venezuela &apos;s regional neighbors toward its plight . 
Obama may be trying to force these countries to choose sides : either support Venezuela explicitly or support the US in opposing its leaders &quot; policies . 
More important , Obama could be trying to drive a wedge between Venezuela and Cuba at a time when the Cuban leadership is keenly interested in improving its relationship with the US . 
As it stands , Cuba will sink without Venezuela - unless , of course , it finds another lifeline . 
The US - which in placing itself in direct opposition to Venezuela has also highlighted the country &apos;s fragility - may be an increasingly appealing option . 
In any case , Maduro has not taken Obama &apos;s affront lightly . 
Employing the age-old tactic of exaggerating the threat of external aggression - in this case , from what Maduro , like Chávez before him , refers to as the &quot; empire &quot; - to justify internal repression , he has compelled the legislative assembly to enact a law enabling him to govern temporarily by decree . 
To reinforce the image that a US invasion may be imminent , Maduro has mobilized the army and militia for war maneuvers . 
This approach has helped Maduro obtain the support of the Union of South American Nations - a new regional bloc that issues harmless pronouncements . 
He is now preparing to transform the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Panama - which Obama and , for the first time , Cuba &apos;s Raúl Castro are expected to attend - into a rhetorical witch hunt against &quot; Yankee interventionism &quot; in his country . 
As it stands , it is possible that they could meet bilaterally to negotiate the establishment of embassies in each other &apos;s capitals , with the US potentially even removing Cuba from the list of countries that it counts as supporters of international terrorism . 
But , with the US engaged in such a severe political confrontation with Venezuela , progress would effectively require that Cuba abandon its unconditional support for the Venezuelan regime . 
Given Cuba &apos;s desperation to attract investment , tourism , and trade , such an outcome is certainly plausible . 
Of course , Cuba is not the only country facing the stark choice between intervention in Venezuela and support for Chavismo . 
Countries like Brazil , Mexico , and Chile - all of which back neither alternative , and have rightly applauded the détente between Cuba and the US - must also consider their options ahead of the Panama summit . 
Will these countries &quot; leaders join Nicaragua &apos;s Daniel Ortega , Bolivia &apos;s Evo Morales , Ecuador &apos;s Rafael Correa , and Argentina &apos;s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in supporting Maduro , backing Obama into a corner in Panama ? 
Or will they disable the trap Maduro is trying to set , perhaps even reprising Spanish King Juan Carlos I &apos;s 2007 outburst to Chávez : &quot; Why don &apos;t you shut up ? &quot; 
Amid these questions , one thing is certain : Latin America &apos;s larger countries cannot continue to ignore Venezuela &apos;s crisis . 
If the country &apos;s economic collapse - the consequence of incompetent governance and the sharp fall in oil prices - is not enough to spur them to choose a side , Obama &apos;s extreme maneuver will be . 
Their time for indifference is over .
