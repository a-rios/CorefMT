Macro Malpractice 
NEW HAVEN - The wrong medicine is being applied to America &apos;s economy . 
Having misdiagnosed the ailment , policymakers have prescribed untested experimental medicine with potentially grave side effects . 
The patient is the American consumer - the world &apos;s biggest by far , but now in the throes of the worst funk since the Great Depression . 
Recent data on consumer spending in the United States have been terrible . 
Growth in inflation-adjusted US personal consumption expenditures has just been revised down to 1.5 % in the second quarter of 2012 , and appears to be on track for a similarly anemic increase in the third quarter . 
Worse , these numbers are just the latest in what has now been a four-and-a-half-year-old trend . 
From the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2012 , annualized growth in real consumption spending has averaged a mere 0.7 % - all the more extraordinary when compared with the pre-crisis trend of 3.6 % in the decade ending in 2007 . 
The disease is a protracted balance-sheet recession that has turned a generation of America &apos;s consumers into zombies - the economic walking dead . 
Think Japan , and its corporate zombies of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Two bubbles - property and credit - enabled a decade of excessive consumption . 
Since their collapse in 2007 , US households have understandably become fixated on repairing the damage . 
That means paying down debt and rebuilding savings , leaving consumer demand mired in protracted weakness . 
Yet the treatment prescribed for this malady has compounded the problem . 
The convoluted logic behind this strategy is quite disturbing - not only for the US , but also for the global economy . 
There is nothing cyclical about the lasting aftershocks of a balance-sheet recession that have now been evident for nearly five years . 
Indeed , balance-sheet repair has barely begun for US households . 
The personal-saving rate stood at just 3.7 % in August 2012 - up from the 1.5 % low of 2005 , but half the 7.5 % average recorded in the last three decades of the twentieth century . 
Moreover , the debt overhang remains massive . 
The overall level of household indebtedness stood at 113 % of disposable personal income in mid-2012 - down 21 percentage points from its pre-crisis peak of 134 % in 2007 , but still well above the 1970-1999 norm of around 75 % . 
In other words , Americans have much farther to go on the road to balance-sheet repair - which hardly suggests a temporary , or cyclical , shortfall in consumer demand . 
Moreover , the Fed &apos;s approach is severely compromised by the so-called zero bound on interest rates . 
Having run out of basis points to cut from interest rates , the Fed has turned to the quantity dimension of the credit cycle - injecting massive doses of liquidity into the collapsed veins of zombie consumers . 
To rationalize the efficacy of this approach , the Fed has rewritten the script on the transmission mechanism of discretionary monetary policy . 
Unlike the days of yore , when cutting the price of credit could boost borrowing , &quot; quantitative easing &quot; purportedly works by stimulating asset and credit markets . 
There is more : Once the demand problem is cured , according to this argument , companies will start hiring again . 
And then , presto - an unconventional fix magically satisfies the Fed &apos;s long-neglected mandate to fight unemployment . 
But the Fed &apos;s policy gambit has taken the US down the wrong road . 
Just as two previous rounds of quantitative easing failed to accelerate US households &quot; balance-sheet repair , there is little reason to believe that &quot; QE3 &quot; will do the trick . 
Quantitative easing is a blunt instrument , at best , and operates through highly circuitous - and thus dubious - channels . 
Significantly , it does next to nothing to alleviate the twin problems of excess leverage and inadequate saving . 
Policies aimed directly at debt forgiveness and enhanced saving incentives - contentious , to be sure - would at least address zombie consumers &quot; balance-sheet problems . 
Moreover , the side effects of quantitative easing are significant . 
Many worry about an upsurge in inflation , though , given the outsize slack in the global economy - and the likelihood that it will persist for years to come - that is not high on my watch list . 
Far more disconcerting is the willingness of major central banks - not just the Fed , but also the European Central Bank , the Bank of England , and the Bank of Japan - to inject massive amounts of excess liquidity into asset markets - excesses that cannot be absorbed by sluggish real economies . 
That puts central banks in the destabilizing position of abdicating control over financial markets . 
For a world beset by seemingly endemic financial instability , this could prove to be the most destructive development of all . 
The developing world is up in arms over the major central banks &quot; reckless tactics . 
Emerging economies &quot; leaders fear spillover effects in commodity markets and distortions of exchange rates and capital flows that may compromise their own focus on financial stability . 
While it is difficult to track the cross-border flows fueled by quantitative easing in the so-called advanced world , these fears are far from groundless . 
Liquidity injections into a zero-interest-rate developed world send return-starved investors scrambling for growth opportunities elsewhere . 
As the global economy has gone from crisis to crisis in recent years , the cure has become part of the disease . 
In an era of zero interest rates and quantitative easing , macroeconomic policy has become unhinged from a tough post-crisis reality . 
Untested medicine is being used to treat the wrong ailment - and the chronically ill patient continues to be neglected .
