Bernanke Meets the Press 
CAMBRIDGE - At the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s recent and first-ever public press conference , Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a spirited defense of the Fed &apos;s much-criticized policy of mass purchases of US government bonds , also known as &quot; quantitative easing . &quot; 
But was his justification persuasive ? 
Most economists viewed his performance as masterful . 
But the fact that the dollar has continued to slide while gold prices have continued to rise suggests considerable skepticism from markets . 
One of the hardest things in central banking is that investors often hear a very different message from that which the central bank intends to send . 
The Fed , of course , has been forced to turn to &quot; QE , &quot; as traders call it , because its normal tool for fine-tuning inflation and growth , the overnight interest rate , is already zero . 
Yet US economic growth remains sluggish , and is accompanied by stubbornly high unemployment . 
QE has been blamed for everything from asset-price bubbles to food riots to impetigo . 
Everyone from foreign finance ministers to cartoon satirists ( check out the video &quot; quantitative easing explained &quot; ) to Sarah Palin has ripped into the policy . 
Critics insist that QE is the beginning of the end of the global financial system , if not of civilization itself . 
Their most telling complaint is that too little is known about how quantitative easing works , and that the Fed is therefore taking undue risks with the global financial system to achieve a modest juicing of the US economy . 
Whether or not the critics are right , one thing is clear : with the Fed lagging other global central banks in the monetary-tightening cycle , and with rating agencies contemplating a downgrade of America &apos;s credit score , the US dollar &apos;s purchasing power has sunk to an all-time low against the currencies of America &apos;s trading partners . 
Bernanke &apos;s defense was robust and unequivocal . 
He argued that QE is not nearly as unconventional as its critics claim . 
If one looks at how it has affected financial conditions , including long-term interest rates , volatility , and stock prices , QE looks an awful lot like conventional interest-rate policy , which we think we understand . 
Thus , concerns about QE &apos;s supposed ill effects are wildly overblown , and there is nothing especially challenging about eventually reversing course , either . 
Bernanke dismissed complaints about commodity prices and emerging-market inflation , arguing that these phenomena had far more to do with lax monetary policies and overly rigid exchange rates in fast-growing developing economies . 
The Fed chairman &apos;s comments come at a critical and sensitive moment . 
Over the next year or so , the Fed is likely to enter a tightening cycle , raising interest rates on a steady and sustained basis . 
It does not want to rush , because the US economy is still weak , with first-quarter growth a lackluster 1.8 % . 
But it cannot wait too long , lest inflation expectations drift to a dangerously high level , forcing the Fed to move aggressively - and at the cost of considerable economic pain - to wring inflation out of the system . 
In unwinding QE , Bernanke must avoid another landmine , namely an unwelcome collapse in asset prices . 
Many savvy Wall Street traders are convinced that QE is just the old &quot; Greenspan put &quot; on steroids . 
The cult of the &quot; Greenspan put &quot; stemmed from the previous Fed chairman &apos;s avowed belief that the Fed should not try to resist a sharply rising stock market , except to the extent that such a market undermines the long-term stability of prices for ordinary goods . 
But if the stock market collapses too quickly , the Fed should worry about a recession and react aggressively to cushion the fall . 
Are traders right ? 
Is QE merely the sequel to the &quot; Greenspan put &quot; ? 
It is certainly the case that today &apos;s super-low interest rates encourage investors to pour funds into risky assets . 
The Fed probably would argue that it is the job of regulators to make sure that asset bubbles do not induce too much borrowing and an eventual debt crisis , though of course monetary policy has to be in the mix . 
Given the sluggish recovery , Bernanke could have gone even further and argued that the Fed is the one who has it right . 
Other advanced-economy monetary authorities , such as the European Central Bank , might be over-reacting to short term inflation volatility . 
However , perhaps not wanting to cause problems for his foreign counterparts , Bernanke took a more cautious approach , merely defending the Fed &apos;s policy as the right choice for America . 
In defending the Fed &apos;s policy , Bernanke had to be careful not to say anything that might overly alarm investors . 
Indeed , there is already reason enough for them to be nervous : after all , the Fed &apos;s epic easing of financial conditions must eventually be followed by exceptionally painful tightening . 
Will the economy be ready when the time comes ? 
Explaining the inevitable shift to tightening could prove a far greater challenge than explaining the exceptional accommodation of quantitative easing . 
The Fed must always remember that no matter how calm and rational its analysis may be , it is dealing with markets that can be anything but calm and rational . 
Precisely because so much emotion has been invested in QE , the psychological effects of returning to normalcy are going to be perilous and unpredictable .
