Austerity Is Not Greece &apos;s Problem 
CAMBRIDGE - When looking out a window , it is easy to be fooled by your own reflection and see more of yourself than the outside world . 
This seems to be the case when US observers , influenced by their own country &apos;s fiscal debate , look at Greece . 
For example , Joseph Stiglitz regards austerity in Greece as a matter of ideological choice or bad economics , just like in the US . 
According to this view , those who favor austerity must be obsessed with the theory , given the availability of a kinder , gentler alternative . 
Why would you ever vote for austerity when parties like Greece &apos;s Syriza or Spain &apos;s Podemos offer a pain-free path ? 
The question reflects a lamentable tendency to conflate two very different situations . 
In the US , the issue was whether a government that could borrow at record-low interest rates , in the middle of a recession , should do so . 
By contrast , Greece piled up an enormous fiscal and external debt in boom times , until markets said &quot; enough &quot; in 2009 . 
Greece was then given unprecedented amounts of highly subsidized finance to enable it to reduce gradually its excessive spending . 
But now , after so much European and global generosity , Stiglitz and other economists argue that some of Greece &apos;s debt must be forgiven to make room for more spending . 
But the truth is that the recession in Greece has little to do with an excessive debt burden . 
Until 2014 , the country did not pay , in net terms , a single euro in interest : it borrowed enough from official sources at subsidized rates to pay 100 % of its interest bill and then some . 
This situation supposedly changed a bit in 2014 , the first year that the country made a small contribution to its interest bill , having run a primary surplus of barely 0.8 % of GDP ( or 0.5 % of its debt of 170 % of GDP ) . 
Greece &apos;s experience highlights a truth about macroeconomic policy that is too often overlooked : The world is not dominated by austerians ; on the contrary , most countries have trouble balancing their books . 
Recent advances in behavioral economics show that we all have enormous problems with self-control . 
And game theory explains why we act even more irresponsibly when making group decisions ( owing to the so-called common pool problem ) . 
Fiscal deficits , like unwanted pregnancies , are the unintended consequence of actions taken by more than one person who had other objectives in mind . 
And lack of fiscal control is what got Greece into trouble in the first place . 
So the problem is not that austerity was tried and failed in Greece . 
It is that , despite unprecedented international generosity , fiscal policy was completely out of control and needed major adjustments . 
Insufficient spending was never an issue . 
From 1998 to 2007 , Greece &apos;s annual per capita GDP growth averaged 3.8 % , the second fastest in Western Europe , behind only Ireland . 
But by 2007 , Greece was spending more than 14 % of GDP in excess of what it was producing , the largest such gap in Europe - more than twice that of Spain and 55 % higher than Ireland &apos;s . 
In Spain and Ireland , though , the gap reflected a construction boom ; euro accession suddenly gave people access to much cheaper mortgages . 
In Greece , by contrast , the gap was mostly fiscal and used for consumption , not investment . 
Unsustainable growth paths often end in a sudden stop of capital inflows , forcing countries to bring their spending back in line with production . 
In Greece , however , official lenders &apos; unprecedented munificence made the adjustment more gradual than in , say , Latvia or Ireland . 
In fact , even after the so-called Greek Depression , its economy has grown more in per capita terms since 1998 than Cyprus , Denmark , Italy , and Portugal . 
Sudden stops are always painful : economics has not discovered a hangover cure . 
But the way to minimize the pain is to cut spending without cutting output , which requires selling to others what residents can no longer afford . 
In other words , unless Greece boosts exports , spending cuts will amplify the output loss in the same way that Keynesian multipliers amplified the output gain from borrowing . 
The problem is that Greece produces very little of what the world wants to consume . 
Its exports of goods comprise mainly fruits , olive oil , raw cotton , tobacco , and some refined petroleum products . 
Germany , which many argue should spend more , imports just 0.2 % of its goods from Greece . 
Tourism is a mature industry with plenty of regional competitors . 
The country produces no machines , electronics , or chemicals . 
Of every $ 10 of world trade in information technology , Greece accounts for $ 0.01 . 
Greece never had the productive structure to be as rich as it was : its income was inflated by massive amounts of borrowed money that was not used to upgrade its productive capacity . 
According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity , which I co-authored , in 2008 the gap between Greece &apos;s income and the knowledge content of its exports was the largest among a sample of 128 countries . 
Too much of the debate since then has focused on what Germany , the EU , or the International Monetary Fund must do . 
But the bottom line is that Greece needs to develop its productive capabilities if it wants to grow . 
The unfocused set of structural reforms prescribed by its current financing agreement will not do that . 
Instead , Greece should concentrate on activist policies that attract globally competitive firms , an area where Ireland has much to teach - and where Stiglitz has sensible things to say . 
Unfortunately , this is not what many Greeks ( or Spaniards ) believe . 
A large plurality of them voted for Syriza , which wants to reallocate resources to wage increases and subsidies and does not even mention exports in its growth strategy . 
They would be wise to remember that having Stiglitz as a cheerleader and Podemos as advisers did not save Venezuela from its current hyper-inflationary catastrophe .
