WikiLeaky Power 
PARIS - Beyond the headlines , the embarrassment of governments , and the blow dealt to the secrecy of diplomatic correspondence , WikiLeaks &quot; exposure of US diplomatic cables offers a raw illustration of how deeply the essence of power has been altered in our information age . 
Since its inception , the state has been the main vessel of power ; access to power usually meant control of the state , whether by election or by violent takeover . 
This model , within which individuals are subjects or , at best , taxpayers and voters , is being undermined by several recent trends that have empowered the individual . 
Consider the Internet , a network of connected nodes invented in the 1960 &quot; s , at the height of the Cold War , to preserve the United States from total chaos after a nuclear attack on its nerve centers . 
It was deliberately constructed with no hierarchy , no core , and no central authority , though few at the time could have suspected where , given the numerous breakthroughs of the digital revolution , the Internet &apos;s built-in trend toward decentralized power would lead . 
It has led to the second trend : a metamorphosis of the production process . 
Information has become much more than a message conveyed by technology ; it is now the raw material of services-intensive advanced economies , and the building block of modern social and productive organizations . 
The third trend concerns the room this has opened for individual and collective action . 
In The Human Condition , the philosopher Hannah Arendt linked politics to the human capacity not simply to act , but to &quot; act in concert . &quot; 
While concerted action is a familiar notion , it used to be aimed mainly at influencing the state - exemplified by the way civil society prompted America &apos;s withdrawal from Vietnam . 
Today , however , collective action is of a different magnitude . 
Because of the universality of the digital language , its ease of use , and the virtual absence of marginal costs for producing or disseminating information , the state &apos;s tools of control have been weakened and depleted . 
Global finance has been one of the most eager beneficiaries of these trends , using Internet networks not just as a tool to conduct operations with greater efficiency and velocity , but also as a means to circumvent state supervision . 
Corporations have dwelled on connectivity to globalize their markets , R D , ownership , tax domiciliation , and leadership , thoroughly transforming their relationship with states , whether in their country of origin or elsewhere . 
In September 1992 , it took George Soros $ 10 billion to bring the Bank of England to its knees and impose devaluation on the pound . 
It now takes only a computer and Internet connection to cause serious trouble : intrusion by hackers into protected networks , or the introduction of havoc-wreaking software viruses and worms in sensitive information systems . 
While the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 - the deadliest of all time - had nothing &quot; virtual &quot; about them , their perpetrator , al-Qaeda , projects a cloud of threat and power by using cyberspace to promote its bloody &quot; successes , &quot; spread hatred , and recruit jihadists . 
Of course , access to a networked world has also balanced state power in positive ways , by giving a formidable boost to independent advocacy , as seen in the online campaign to ban landmines and the treaty that ratified its success - despite opposition by powerful states . 
Many similar organizations have flourished , gaining the ability to shape political outcomes and public policies . 
But there is no place where the transformative power of connectivity is potentially greater than in China , with its reported 420 million Internet users . 
No matter how eager China &apos;s authorities are to keep the Internet under their control - for example , by blocking foreign Web sites - they are also aware of how much their economy now needs the Internet . 
As a result , the room for &quot; concerted action &quot; has never been so large for individual Chinese to gain access to uncensored information , share opinions , and communicate country-wide to expose official misconduct . 
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for circulating on the Internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitution , Charter 08 , which gathered 10,000 signatures online in only 24 hours . 
In the late 1980 &quot; s , glasnost - transparency - was one of the nails in the coffin of the Soviet Union . 
While WikiLeaks has certainly not had a similar effect , it epitomizes the extent of the individual &apos;s empowerment in a networked world . 
All that was necessary to challenge the world &apos;s mightiest power , after all , was a disgruntled US Army intelligence analyst , some hacking knowledge , a few computers , and a handful of determined activists enrolled under the contested banner of transparency . 
At the time she was named Director of Policy Planning at the US State Department , Anne-Marie Slaughter , a respected scholar of international affairs , boldly heralded the advent of a networked world . 
&quot; War , diplomacy , business , media , society ... are networked , &quot; she wrote in Foreign Affairs in January 2009 , and &quot; in this world , the measure of power is connectedness . &quot; 
Having the greatest potential for connectivity , America has the edge in a &quot; networked century . &quot; 
This drive prompted US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in January 2010 to proclaim the &quot; freedom to connect &quot; as the cyber-equivalent of the more familiar freedoms of assembly or expression . 
Of course , Clinton added , these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing , and can be misused for darker purposes . 
That storm will leave behind no trace of understanding if it is assessed in isolation , rather than as part of a broader pattern . 
WikiLeaks &quot; latest release demonstrates that the transformation of power by the &quot; digital revolution &quot; could be as far-reaching as that brought about by the fifteenth-century printing revolution . 
In this game , where new players invite themselves , the edge goes to agility and innovation . 
All of this implies that connectedness will remain a double-edged sword - the leverage it provides being fraught with vulnerability .
