Can Regional Integration Save Africa ? 
During the last quarter-century , global economic growth has soared , but Africa continued to lose ground . 
Indeed , the continent &apos;s share of world exports fell from 4.6 % in 1980 to 1.8 % in 2000 , and its share of world imports declined from 3.6 % to 1.6 % over the same period . 
Africa &apos;s share of global flows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) also fell , from 1.8 % in 1986-90 to 0.8 % in 1999-2000 . 
Can regional economic groupings , such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , help increase trade and bolster growth ? 
Overall trade flows in southern Africa fell from $ 131.1 billion in 2002 to $ 112.3 billion in 2003 , with South Africa - one of only three countries in the region that recorded current-account surpluses - accounting for 65 % of the total . 
Whereas South Africa &apos;s foreign trade almost doubled between 1994 and 2002 , exports from , say , Malawi to Tanzania or from Mozambique to Zambia remained negligible , despite their geographic proximity . 
The low level of intraregional trade , despite the SADC and COMESA , reflects several factors , including a range of non-tariff barriers - mainly communication and transport problems , customs procedures and charges , and a lack of market information . 
Moreover , in the past , southern African countries put their faith in protectionism and import substitution policies . 
Relying on &quot; infant economy &quot; arguments , major exports were restricted and legal obstacles were erected against foreign participation in the development of natural resources , as well as financial and other services , further impeding regional integration . 
Nowadays southern African countries are committed to reinforcing their regional integration through economic harmonization . 
A regional plan approved in August 2003 in Dar-Es-Salaam , Tanzania &apos;s capital , by the SADC focuses on promoting trade , economic liberalization , and development as a means of facilitating the establishment of an SADC Common Market . 
A common market - including harmonized policies for free movement of factors of production - will enhance competitiveness , industrial development , and productivity . 
However , protocols and political treaties are not sufficient to boost integration . 
The major barrier is the region &apos;s great diversity in economic and institutional development . 
The SADC &apos;s regional plan establishes a timeframe for policy implementation over the next fifteen years that takes these constraints into account , focusing on macroeconomic policies , debt problems , and establishing a stable and secure investment climate . 
Macroeconomic policy harmonization is needed to ensure that changes in one SADC member country do not adversely affect economic activity elsewhere . 
The new initiative calls for all member states to harmonize their economic , fiscal , and monetary policies completely , beginning with currency convertibility and followed by exchange-rate unification and , finally , a common currency . 
Several currencies have attained some measure of regional convertibility , which should encourage monetary harmonization and promote intraregional trade , as countries &quot; trade flows shift from partners that require payment in foreign currency . 
A form of monetary harmonization in southern Africa already exists between South Africa and Lesotho , Namibia , and Swaziland , whose currencies are traded at par with the South African Rand . 
The Reserve Bank of South Africa implements monetary policy after consultation with the other countries &quot; central banks . 
Despite tight monetary policy and foreign exchange regulations , the scheme has boosted trade and investment while reducing intraregional indebtedness . 
But debt remains a grave challenge for southern Africa as a whole . 
The region &apos;s total aggregate external debt stood at $ 75.6 billion in 2003 , up from $ 56.6 billion in 2000 , with Angola , Mozambique , and South Africa accounting for 75.9 % of the total . 
Angola , Malawi , Mozambique , and Zambia owe an average of 150 % of their GDP , and servicing the debt swallows billions of dollars annually . 
Moreover , SADC has faced a sharp decline in FDI inflows , which fell from $ 9.8 billion in 2001 to $ 3 billion in 2003 . 
This is attributable mainly to Angola , Botswana , and Namibia , owing to cyclical investment behavior in the petroleum and extraction industry , and to South Africa , where privatization and acquisitions activity have slowed . 
Indeed , South Africa and Angola alone accounted for 73 % of the region &apos;s inward FDI in 2003 . 
For southern Africa - indeed , for the continent as a whole - global competitiveness requires diversification to higher value-added and manufactured exports . 
In order to attract the FDI needed to achieve this , southern African countries have enacted laws aimed at encouraging greater private sector participation , with special emphasis on foreign investment . 
This reflects the real and perceived risks associated with investment in the region . 
Southern Africa &apos;s leading economies must therefore make every effort to promote regional integration . 
Removing all trade barriers , as called for by SADC &apos;s plan , would enable them to take full advantage of the region &apos;s abundant natural resources and point the way toward deeper global integration for all of Africa .
