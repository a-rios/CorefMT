The Eighteenth Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger 
Replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given Californian voters an enormous - if guilty - pleasure . 
Some members of the opposition in Germany would dearly love to do the same to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , though they have not ( yet ! ) found a film star to replace him . 
Several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected . 
Beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio &quot; Lula &quot; da Silva , to say nothing of Mexican President Vicente Fox and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun , the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity . 
Electoral success , it appears , fades fast nowadays . 
So should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments ? 
Absolutely not . 
Democracy , in the words of the philosopher Karl Popper , is about being able to remove those in power without violence ; it is in this sense about trial and error . 
But leaders must be given the chance to govern . 
Indeed , they need a chance to make mistakes and to learn and recover from their errors , as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself . 
Trial and error implies the opportunity to err before we try again . 
Californian voters &apos; first mistake is thus what may be called &quot; the lure of the immediate &quot;  - none too surprising in a state where instant gratification is supposedly a core value . 
But sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere . 
Indeed , democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads ; today &apos;s hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow , and there are always more waiting in the wings . 
In politics this can be dangerous , because it encourages basing decisions , no matter how weighty , on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails . 
The call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend . 
Referenda are for the most part snapshots . 
Switzerland , with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before votes are held , may be the exception . 
As a rule however , referenda measure the popularity of political leaders at a particular moment , regardless of the issue at stake . 
If and when Britain votes on joining the Euro , the result will most likely tell us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and about the European Union , but little about the merits of the common currency . 
So the case for representative government remains strong . 
Democracy is government by debate , by taking important decisions after thorough deliberation of the kind that - at least in large countries - must be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives . 
Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly , and perhaps must do so , but as a rule they take enough time to examine issues fully . 
Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions ; hence their name . 
Consider Germany , where some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats yearn to sink the Schröder government . 
Clearly , the reforms proposed and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular , and there is little doubt that , a year after their re-election , the coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens would not stand much of a chance at the polls . 
But who knows what the electorate will think in three years , at the end of the government &apos;s full term in office ? 
By the time of the next regularly scheduled election , it could become clear that there were no real alternatives to Schröder &apos;s policies , and it could even be the case that the predicted beneficial effects of painful reforms will become apparent by then . 
Leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones . 
Leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity . 
This is why they should commit their cruelest deeds in the first year and soften up as the next election approaches . 
The uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic . 
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position . 
So California has set a bad example , and Californians will probably pay a heavy price for it . 
They may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago , when the popularly elected Louis Napoleon transformed himself , via a wildly popular referendum , into Napoleon III - that vote being the last the French would enjoy until the end of the Second Empire . 
Californians , of course , won &apos;t be disenfranchised , but their willfulness threatens to yield a wayward and irresponsible form of state politics . 
To be sure , democracy implies limiting the time that the powerful have to exercise their power without challenge . 
An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legislate and to carry out their program . 
These two imperatives are inherently contradictory , but the balance between them is still best achieved through representative , parliamentary democracy . 
Anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week &apos;s top ten pop songs .
