Banking on the IMF 
CHICAGO - The biggest financial nightmare looming over the world economy is the insolvency of a large international bank . 
Be it because of a sovereign default or because of large losses accumulated under complacent accounting rules , the insolvency of a large bank ( particularly a European bank ) is far from a remote possibility . 
Even if it were a remote possibility , the 2008 financial crisis has taught us that rare events occur . 
What makes this possibility the financial nightmare of choice , worse than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 , is the fear that many sovereign states have already shot all their bullets and would thus be powerless to intervene . 
Credit default swaps ( CDS ) of major southern European banks trade slightly lower than the CDS of their sovereign states , indicating that the market does not perceive the latter as able to support the former . 
Unfortunately , almost two years after Lehman &apos;s collapse , little has been done to address this risk . 
The United States Congress is about to finalize a bill that will grant resolution authority over major US financial institutions to a newly formed systemic council . 
The procedures to trigger this intervention , however , are complex and the funding is sufficiently opaque that the bill will not eliminate collateral damage from a large bank failure even for US institutions , let alone for international ones , whose unwinding would require coordination by several states , with varying degree of solvency . 
To minimize the risk of an unruly collapse , it is necessary to approve an international resolution mechanism with authority over all major international financial institutions . 
The goal would not be to rescue banks and their creditors , but to minimize the disruption that an uncontrolled default might cause . 
This institution should be an international version of the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code . 
But , while the goal of Chapter 11 is to save the ongoing value of a firm , the goal of the international resolution mechanism should be to preserve the ongoing value of the counterparties of insolvent financial institutions . 
The first problem to resolve in approving this mechanism is who should have this authority . 
The obvious answer is the International Monetary Fund . 
Created after WWII to finance temporary imbalances of the members of a fixed-exchange rate system , the IMF has been in search of a cause since the demise of the dollar exchange-rate system in 1971 . 
More importantly , through its numerous rescues of sovereign states , the IMF has acquired expertise in debt restructuring , while developing a reputation for toughness and impartiality , which would be very useful in these situations . 
The IMF also has the unique advantage of being the only depositary of international reserves . 
In the absence of an international fiscal authority , the IMF is the organization that comes closest to being one . 
When a large financial institution is insolvent , the IMF should take it over , guaranteeing its short-term obligations , but wiping out the shareholders and repaying the long-term creditors only after all the other creditors ( including the IMF itself ) are repaid . 
Some people would scream that this is tantamount to nationalization , but it is no more a nationalization that the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy process is . 
Takeover by an international organization has three advantages over a domestic solution . 
First , it makes certain that the cost ( if the losses exceed the combined value of equity and long-term debt ) is shared by the international community and not only by the country where the institution is located , making the intervention credible even when the sovereign state is not . 
Second , by removing decision-making power from the national government that hosts an insolvent institution , this solution minimizes the potential distortions created by the lobbying power of the incumbent bankers . 
Would you trust the Greek government to run a Greek bank in a non-corrupt way after a government takeover ? 
The IMF would be better . 
Finally , thanks to IMF involvement , even less advanced countries would be able to take advantage of the best international expertise to address the problem . 
If a major oil spill in Haiti were threatening the Gulf of Mexico , wouldn &apos;t we want the best technology ( and not just the technology available in Haiti ) to try to contain it ? 
Why should it be any different in financial markets ? 
The last problem to be resolved is the trigger . 
In the case of the US resolution authority , this has been a very controversial issue . 
The fear was that powerful banks would exploit national government help , asking for intervention too soon . 
Two safeguards can avoid this problem in the international context . 
First , rigid rules that wipe out shareholders and penalize long-term creditors are a clear deterrent from bankers &quot; point of view . 
Second , because IMF intervention would reduce the influence of powerful domestic insiders , early intervention would be less attractive to them . 
The trigger should be the domestic government itself . 
Refusing international help in such instances would mean electoral suicide for any government that faces a major bank collapse . 
There are few areas in which government intervention is known to create value : reducing the devastating effects of a bank run is one . 
Only a government that is sufficiently powerful , in terms of legal authority and solvency , can do so . 
Unfortunately , in the international arena these two conditions are almost never met . 
Empowering the IMF to take over failed international banks would fill this gap - and chase away our worst nightmare .
