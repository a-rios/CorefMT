The Welfare State , RIP 
PARIS - It is usually easier to see the beginning of something than the end of it . 
Born in 1945 in post-war Britain , the welfare state met its end in Britain this week , when British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne repudiated the concept of the &quot; universal benefit , &quot; the idea that everyone , not just the poor , should benefit from social protection . 
The welfare state was described by its intellectual architect , Lord Beveridge , as a structure built to protect the individual &quot; from the cradle to the grave . &quot; 
This model came to dominate every West European country , with local traditions and local politics dictating the diversity of its application . 
By the 1960 &quot; s , all of democratic Europe was social democratic , a combination of free markets and mass social protection . 
This European model succeeded beyond anyone &apos;s wildest dreams , and for decades was the envy of the world in a way that neither &quot; Wild West &quot; American capitalism , nor Soviet and Maoist state socialism , ever could be . 
Social democracy seemed to deliver the best of both worlds , economic efficiency and social justice . 
True , there were always some nagging doubts about the European welfare state , mostly starting in the 1980 &quot; s , when globalization arrived at Europe &apos;s door . 
Hampered by the financial cost built into the welfare state - and perhaps by the psychological and financial disincentives built into it as well - European economies began to slow , with per capita income becoming stagnant and high unemployment a permanent fixture . 
European advocates of the free market never proved sufficient to roll back the welfare state . 
Even Margaret Thatcher failed to touch the National Health Service . 
At best , like in Sweden or Denmark , the welfare state stopped expanding . 
The welfare state resisted its critics and the pain of stagnating economies by making collaborators of the middle class . 
Indeed , the political genius of the men who built the welfare state was their insight that it would benefit the middle class even more than it would benefit the poor . 
Consider health-care benefits . 
In France , it has been demonstrated that the middle class spends more per capita on its health than the 20 % of the poorest French do . 
As a consequence , the national health-care scheme actually provides a net benefit for the average income earner . 
Indeed , even America &apos;s smaller welfare state seems aimed at the middle class more than at the poor , with the so-called Earned Income Tax Credit being the biggest handout . 
Every year , 24 million middle-class American families get a refund from the Internal Revenue Service . 
Those below the poverty line do not receive cash , but only in-kind support . 
So America &apos;s welfare state means cash for the middle class and social programs for the poor . 
That discriminatory pattern can be found everywhere in Western Europe as well . 
Osborne &apos;s assault on the British welfare state began with the universal child subsidy , a broad-base entitlement distributed to all families with children , regardless of their incomes . 
This universal child benefit was introduced nearly everywhere in Western Europe to encourage childbearing in countries deeply damaged by World War II . 
In the United Kingdom , 42 % of child subsidies goes to middle-class and wealthy families . 
The proportion is the same in France . 
Osborne has proposed ending payments to families with incomes in the highest tax bracket - the opening shot in a campaign that could end up transforming the entire welfare system by reducing benefits handed to the middle and upper class . 
The savings ( £ 1.6 billion ) implied by Osborne &apos;s proposal represent only a tiny fraction of Britain &apos;s £ 310 billion annual bill for social-welfare programs . 
But , by targeting this entitlement , Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government hopes to give the British people a better understanding of the unfairness of the current welfare state . 
Every government in Europe will have to do the same : target the weakest link in the social protection system , the one most easily understood by most people . 
The French government , in this same spirit , has gone after public-sector workers &quot; extravagant pension benefits , as well as the legal retirement age , trying to increase it from 62 to 65 . 
Anybody can grasp how child benefits for the wealthy or retirement at only 62 is unjustifiable . 
Yet popular resistance to these supposedly unfair entitlement reductions is stronger than expected . 
Intuitively , the middle class can see that this is the end of an era . 
Will Cameron &apos;s government - and any others that may go down this path - eventually retreat in the face of middle-class rage ? 
To a certain extent , governments have no choice in going after middle-class entitlements . 
The 2008 financial crisis , aggravated by useless Keynesian public spending , has brought all European states to the edge of bankruptcy . 
Only the United States can indefinitely print its own currency and increase its debt . 
So European states have no choice but to reduce their expenditures , and targeting welfare benefits that represent , on average , half of European public spending is the easiest way to bring immediate fiscal relief . 
The welfare state will not vanish from Europe , but it is set to be scaled back - and focused on those who actually need help . 
If one takes unemployment as the ultimate criterion , the European welfare state has brought a safety net to the middle class , but has mired 10 % of its most vulnerable people in permanent welfare dependency . 
Sixty-five years after Lord Beveridge trusted the state to hold our hand from cradle to grave , Cameron and Osborne have asked us to stand more or less alone on our own two feet .
