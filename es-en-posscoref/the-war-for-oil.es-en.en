The War for Oil 
For decades , through Democratic and Republican presidential administrations , America has pursued a set of straightforward energy policy objectives : keep world oil prices as stable as possible ; reduce domestic consumption of oil as painlessly as possible ; reduce dependence on foreign imports whenever possible ; and diversify the sources of imported oil . 
Despite appearances , none of these objectives has changed under the Bush administration . 
Many observers believe that Bush has set a new course because the invasion of Iraq seems to fly in the face of these objectives . 
A big increase in Iraq &apos;s oil production would probably increase US dependence on oil relative to other energy sources , as world oil prices will probably fall in response to the additional supplies . 
This , in turn , would mean an increase in US dependence on imported oil , especially from the Middle East . 
The irony , however , is that the US exercised greater control over the Iraqi oil sector under the UN &apos;s pre-war &quot; Oil-for-Food Program &quot; ( in which the UN , not Saddam Hussein , determined the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad ) than it will in any future democratic Iraq . 
If the Bush administration was seeking stable , secure , diverse and cheap oil supplies , it could have simply lifted the embargos on Libya , Iran , Iraq , and Sudan and let the oil gush . 
But America &apos;s interest in Iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy . 
The Bush administration recognized that , above all , Iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset . 
Whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq . 
Saddam &apos;s power came from his control of the world &apos;s second largest oil reserve . 
He understood perfectly the role that oil played in his power . 
Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat , Saddam threatened to burn Iraq &apos;s oil fields . 
Much of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi oil facilities and pipelines reflects the widespread realization that control of oil means control of Iraq . 
As the US planned its invasion , securing the oil fields became a critical priority . 
The goal was not increased supplies or reduced prices for Americans , but stripping Saddam of his power and , ultimately , establishing and solidifying a new Iraqi government . 
Iraq &apos;s future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production . 
Yet the vagaries of the oil business , particularly in such unsettled conditions , make it hard to see how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in Iraq within the next few years . 
The logic is simple . 
The US must use oil revenues to lift the burden of financing regime change in Iraq from American taxpayers . 
All reconstruction plans depend in the long run on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities . 
If Iraq does not deliver its oil , President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people , the American people , or the world community . 
Before the invasion , Iraq &apos;s oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day . 
Iraq will not be able to increase its production to that level within the time frame needed to establish an Iraqi government . 
Any increase in Iraqi oil production requires developing the oil fields , which means big investments , a legal and representative government , and political stability . 
Not even the Bush administration expects these requirements to be met soon . 
Indeed , political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity . 
Historical evidence from Iran , Kuwait , Russia , and even Iraq itself , indicates that it takes about three years from the re-establishment of political stability for capacity to increase significantly and for those new higher levels to be sustained . 
Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution , establish a legitimate and democratic government , negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among its various regions , enact new investment laws , and make the economy attractive to foreigners . 
It also needs time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighboring countries , to perform technical and feasibility studies , and to reconstruct , rehabilitate , and explore its oil fields . 
So even a three-year time frame seems optimistic , for it assumes that within that period , the occupation will end , Iraqis will establish their own democratic government , and that political stability will be achieved . 
Needless to say , the situation may play out differently . 
Tensions may remain high for years . 
No one should be surprised , moreover , if Iraqi oil production suddenly stops altogether even under a democratic government . 
History suggests that labor strikes and similar disruptions that can halt oil production are a greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries . 
If Iraq cannot quickly increase its production capacity in the next few years , this will hinder both US foreign and energy policies . 
How will the US finance the long-term reconstruction of Iraq ? 
Who will pay to maintain a fragile Iraqi democracy ? 
Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food , health care , and other basic services to Iraq &apos;s people ? 
These are tough questions , and they are fundamentally unanswerable until a stable , democratic regime in Iraq can control and ensure a steady flow of oil exports .
