The Morality of Capital Punishment 
The US is often criticized for its refusal to abolish capital punishment . 
Many now claim that abolition of capital punishment is a precondition of a civilized criminal-law system . 
Nobel laureate Gary Becker disagrees . 
European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment - the European Union bans it outright - and some Europeans consider its use in the United States barbaric . 
Indeed , many European intellectuals argue that not just capital punishment , but punishment in general , does not deter criminals . 
But , whereas Europeans , with crime rates well below American rates for the past half-century , could long afford to be relatively &quot; soft &quot; on most crimes , they have seen their crime rates increase sharply during the past twenty years . 
By contrast , American rates have fallen , in part because of greater use of punishment . 
This includes capital punishment . 
I support executing some people convicted of murder because - and only because - I believe that it deters other murders . 
If I did not believe that , I would oppose capital punishment , because revenge and other possible motives should not be a basis for public policy . 
Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US began with a pioneering study by Isaac Ehrlich , published in 1975 in the American Economic Review . 
Some subsequent studies have sometimes found a much weaker deterrent effect , while others have found a much stronger effect . 
The available data are quite limited , however , so one should not base any conclusions solely on the econometric evidence . 
Of course , public policy on any punishment cannot wait until the evidence is perfect . 
But , even with the limited quantitative evidence available , there are good reasons to believe that capital punishment deters . 
Most people , and murderers in particular , fear death , especially when it follows swiftly and with considerable certainty following the commission of a murder . 
As David Hume put it in discussing suicide , &quot; no man ever threw away life , while it was worth living . 
For such is our natural horror of death ... &quot; Likewise , Schopenhauer believed that &quot; as soon as the terrors of life reach a point at which they outweigh the terrors of death , a man will put an end to his life . 
But the terrors of death offer considerable resistance ... &quot; 
Opponents of capital punishment frequently proclaim that the state has no moral right to take anyone &apos;s life , including that of the most reprehensible murderer . 
Yet that is absolutely the wrong conclusion for anyone who believes that capital punishment deters . 
To see why , suppose that for each murderer executed ( instead of , say , receiving life imprisonment ) , the number of murders is reduced by three , which is a much lower number than Ehrlich &apos;s and some other estimates of the deterrent effect . 
This implies that for each murderer not executed , three innocent victims would die . 
In fact , the government would indirectly be &quot; taking &quot; many lives if it did not use capital punishment . 
Saving three innocent lives for every person executed seems like a very attractive trade-off , and even two lives saved per execution seems like a persuasive benefit-cost ratio for capital punishment . 
Admittedly , however , the argument in favor of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut as the number of lives saved per execution falls . 
But , even if only one life were saved per execution , the tradeoff might still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the life taken , which would usually be the case . 
Many people object to comparing the quality of the life spared and the life taken . 
Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison . 
Consider a career criminal who robs and kills a victim who led a decent life and left several children and a spouse behind . 
Suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing such a criminal . 
To me it is obvious that saving such a victim &apos;s life must count for more than taking the criminal &apos;s life . 
Obviously , not all cases are so unambiguous , but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy . 
This helps explain why capital punishment should be used only for murders , and not for lesser crimes . 
When the tradeoff is between taking lives and , say , reducing property theft , the case for milder punishments is far stronger . 
Although severe assaults , including some gruesome rapes , may approach some murders in severity , and might conceivably call for capital punishment , I do not support its use in these cases . 
A powerful argument for reserving capital punishment for murders is &quot; marginal deterrence . &quot; 
If assault were punished with execution , perpetrators would have an incentive to kill their victims to avoid discovery ( which is a major reason why the severity of punishments more generally should be matched to the severity of crimes ) . 
One complication is that capital punishment may make a murderer fight harder to avoid being captured , which could lead to more deaths . 
But , while marginal deterrence is important , I believe the resistance of murderers to being captured , possibly at the expense of their own lives , is really indirect evidence that criminals do fear capital punishment . 
Of course , I worry about the risk of executing the innocent . 
My support for capital punishment would weaken greatly if the rate of killing innocent people were as large as that claimed by many . 
However , I believe that the appeal process in the US offers enormous protection , not so much against wrongful conviction as against wrongful execution , so that there are very few , if any , documented cases of innocent people being killed . 
And this process has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification . 
Again , the debate about capital punishment is essentially a debate about deterrence ( which may be reduced by lengthy appeals ) . 
I can understand that some people are skeptical about the evidence , although I believe they are wrong about both that and the common sense of the issue . 
It is very disturbing to take someone &apos;s life , even a murderer &apos;s life , but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior that takes the lives of innocent victims .
