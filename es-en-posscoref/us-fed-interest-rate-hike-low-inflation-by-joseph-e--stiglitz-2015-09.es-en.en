Fed Up with the Fed 
NEW YORK - At the end of every August , central bankers and financiers from around the world meet in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , for the US Federal Reserve &apos;s economic symposium . 
This year , the participants were greeted by a large group of mostly young people , including many African- and Hispanic Americans . 
The group was not there so much to protest as to inform . 
They wanted the assembled policymakers to know that their decisions affect ordinary people , not just the financiers who are worried about what inflation does to the value of their bonds or what interest-rate hikes might do to their stock portfolios . 
And their green tee shirts were emblazoned with the message that for these Americans , there has been no recovery . 
Even now , seven years after the global financial crisis triggered the Great Recession , &quot; official &quot; unemployment among African-Americans is more than 9 % . 
According to a broader ( and more appropriate ) definition , which includes part-time employees seeking full-time jobs and marginally employed workers , the unemployment rate for the United States as a whole is 10.3 % . 
But , for African-Americans - especially the young - the rate is much higher . 
For example , for African-Americans aged 17-20 who have graduated high school but not enrolled in college , the unemployment rate is over 50 % . 
The &quot; jobs gap &quot; - the difference between today &apos;s employment and what it should be - is some three million . 
With so many people out of work , downward pressure on wages is showing up in official statistics as well . 
So far this year , real wages for non-supervisory workers fell by nearly 0.5 % . 
This is part of a long-term trend that explains why household incomes in the middle of the distribution are lower than they were a quarter-century ago . 
Wage stagnation also helps to explain why statements from Fed officials that the economy has virtually returned to normal are met with derision . 
Perhaps that is true in the neighborhoods where the officials live . 
But , with the bulk of the increase in incomes since the US &quot; recovery &quot; began going to the top 1 % of earners , it is not true for most communities . 
The young people at Jackson Hole , representing a national movement called , naturally , &quot; Fed Up , &quot; could attest to that . 
There is strong evidence that economies perform better with a tight labor market and , as the International Monetary Fund has shown , lower inequality ( and the former typically leads to the latter ) . 
Of course , the financiers and corporate executives who pay $ 1,000 to attend the Jackson Hole meeting see things differently : Low wages mean high profits , and low interest rates mean high stock prices . 
The Fed has a dual mandate - to promote full employment and price stability . 
It has been more than successful at the second , partly because it has been less than successful at the first . 
So why will policymakers be considering an interest-rate hike at the Fed &apos;s September meeting ? 
The usual argument for raising interest rates is to dampen an overheating economy in which inflationary pressures have become too high . 
That is obviously not the case now . 
Indeed , given wage stagnation and the strong dollar , inflation is well below the Fed &apos;s own 2 % target , not to mention the 4 % rate for which many economists ( including the International Monetary Fund &apos;s former chief economist , Olivier Blanchard ) have argued . 
Inflation hawks argue that the inflation dragon must be slayed before one sees the whites of its eyes : Fail to act now and it will burn you in a year or two . 
But , in the current circumstances , higher inflation would be good for the economy . 
There is essentially no risk that the economy would overheat so quickly that the Fed could not intervene in time to prevent excessive inflation . 
Whatever the unemployment rate at which inflationary pressures become significant - a key question for policymakers - we know that it is far lower than the rate today . 
If the Fed focuses excessively on inflation , it worsens inequality , which in turn worsens overall economic performance . 
Wages falter during recessions ; if the Fed then raises interest rates every time there is a sign of wage growth , workers &quot; share will be ratcheted down - never recovering what was lost in the downturn . 
The argument for raising interest rates focuses not on the wellbeing of workers , but that of the financiers . 
The worry is that in a low-interest-rate environment , investors &quot; irrational &quot; search for yield &quot; fuels financial-sector distortions . 
In a well-functioning economy , one would have expected the low cost of capital to be the basis of healthy growth . 
In the US , workers are being asked to sacrifice their livelihoods and wellbeing to protect well-heeled financiers from the consequences of their own recklessness . 
The Fed should simultaneously stimulate the economy and tame the financial markets . 
Good regulation means more than just preventing the banking sector from harming the rest of us ( though the Fed didn &apos;t do a very good job of that before the crisis ) . 
It also means adopting and enforcing rules that restrict the flow of funds into speculation and encourage the financial sector to play the constructive role in our economy that it should , by providing capital to establish new firms and enable successful companies to expand . 
I often feel a great deal of sympathy for Fed officials , because they must make close calls in an environment of considerable uncertainty . 
But the call right now is not a close one . 
On the contrary , it is as close to a no-brainer as such decisions can be : Now is not the time to tighten credit and slow down the economy .
