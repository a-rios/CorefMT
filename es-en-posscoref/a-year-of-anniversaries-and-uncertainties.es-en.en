A Year of Anniversaries and Uncertainties 
ALBERTA - As China enters the &quot; Year of the Ox , &quot; there is much to reflect on from the past 12 months and even more to speculate about regarding the coming year . 
2008 began with devastating snowstorms that paralyzed most of central and southern China &apos;s transport system , interrupting lives and causing severe material damage . 
Then came the riots in Tibet , which caught the government off guard , followed by embarrassing protests over China &apos;s Olympic torch relay in several Western and Asian countries . 
Then , as Chinese were wondering why 2008 , a year of supposed good fortune marked by the lucky number eight , had started with so much misfortune , a deadly earthquake struck Sichuan province , killing 80,000 people and leaving millions homeless . 
Emerging more united from this tragedy , the country welcomed the world to the long-anticipated Olympics , which were remarkably successful , but were soon superseded by the tainted-dairy-product scandal in which many babies became ill , and some died . 
In contrast to last year , when the rush home for the lunar New Year celebration was hampered by freak storms , this year millions of migrant workers have already returned to their rural homes . 
Many will be staying there , because the global economic downturn has hit China hard , costing them their jobs . 
Littered with a host of extremely sensitive anniversaries , 2009 could prove even more dramatic and unpredictable than 2008 . 
Fast approaching is not only the March anniversary of last year &apos;s disturbances in Tibet , but also the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan unrest in 1959 that led to the exile of the Dalai Lama and his supporters . 
Since the riots last spring , China &apos;s government has taken many pro-active measures , even adopting a &quot; Serf Liberation Day , &quot; to defend its record in Tibet of the past 50 years , while continuing to talk with the Dalai Lama &apos;s representatives . 
Then comes the 20th anniversary of the June 4 crackdown on the Tiananmen Square student demonstrations . 
Calls to re-evaluate the official response began when President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao came to power seven years ago . 
Although neither Hu nor Wen were directly involved in the crackdown , they nonetheless must tread carefully . 
Doing everything possible to avoid a repeat of the 1989 scenario may well be the Communist Party leadership &apos;s top priority in 2009 . 
And , given the economic slowdown , widening income disparity , rising unemployment , and growing popular discontent over corruption , China &apos;s leaders will have their hands full . 
As the 90th anniversary approaches , China has made great strides in science , but still has a long way to go in terms of democracy . 
This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the Great Leap Forward , when 20-40 million Chinese died of starvation , as well as the tenth anniversary of the government &apos;s ban on Falun gong , an organization of self-claimed religious and meditation practitioners that has challenged the Communist Party &apos;s legitimacy . 
Though largely discredited inside the country , this militant movement still has a following around the world , and further protests may come at any time and in unpredictable forms . 
While some of the plethora of anniversaries that China &apos;s leaders must confront are potentially very destabilizing , several have , and will , work in their favor . 
More importantly , October will mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples &quot; Republic of China , an occasion that the Party will commemorate in grand style . 
After all , the Middle Kingdom has re-emerged as the world &apos;s third-largest economy ( having recently replaced Germany ) , sent astronauts into space , dispatched advanced naval destroyers to the Horn of Africa , and become the largest holder of US foreign debt . 
China will want to flex its muscles and proclaim to the world that the Party has delivered the goods to its people , while making the country strong and prosperous . 
As the worst recession since the1930 &quot; s continues , both the American and Chinese economies are bound to suffer further setbacks . 
There is no guarantee that protectionist and xenophobic sentiment in America will not hit China-US relations , or that the economic downturn will not fuel new unrest in China . 
The world should not misjudge the effect of such troubles on China . 
Nor should it forget China &apos;s fierce display of nationalism in response to Western protests of the Olympic touch relay , the extraordinary patriotism that swept the country in response to the Sichuan earthquake , and the national pride evinced by the Olympic Games . 
But , in 2009 , it would not hurt if China &apos;s leadership also took note of the need to continue assuring the world of its commitment to a &quot; peaceful rise , &quot; and to do so by boldly addressing some of the unresolved issues that this year &apos;s anniversaries will highlight .
