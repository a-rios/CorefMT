Saving Resources to Save Growth 
NEW YORK - Reconciling global economic growth , especially in developing countries , with the intensifying constraints on global supplies of energy , food , land , and water is the great question of our time . 
Commodity prices are soaring worldwide , not only for headline items like food and energy , but for metals , arable land , fresh water , and other crucial inputs to growth , because increased demand is pushing up against limited global supplies . 
Worldwide economic growth is already slowing under the pressures of $ 135-per-barrel oil and grain prices that have more than doubled in the past year . 
A new global growth strategy is needed to maintain global economic progress . 
The basic issue is that the world economy is now so large that it is hitting against limits never before experienced . There are 6.7 billion people , and the population continues to rise by around 75 million per year , notably in the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
Annual output per person , adjusted for price levels in different parts of the world , averages around $ 10,000 , implying total output of around $ 67 trillion . 
There is , of course , an enormous gap between rich countries , at roughly $ 40,000 per person , and the poorest , at $ 1,000 per person or less . 
But many poor countries , most famously China and India , have achieved extraordinary economic growth in recent years by harnessing cutting-edge technologies . 
As a result , the world economy has been growing at around 5 % per year in recent years . 
At that rate , the world economy would double in size in 14 years . 
This is possible , however , only if the key growth inputs remain in ample supply , and if human-made climate change is counteracted . 
If the supply of vital inputs is constrained or the climate destabilized , prices will rise sharply , industrial production and consumer spending will fall , and world economic growth will slow , perhaps sharply . 
Many free-market ideologues ridicule the idea that natural resource constraints will now cause a significant slowdown in global growth . 
They say that fears of &quot; running out of resources , &quot; notably food and energy , have been with us for 200 years , and we never succumbed . 
Indeed , output has continued to rise much faster than population . 
This view has some truth . 
Better technologies have allowed the world economy to continue to grow despite tough resource constraints in the past . 
But simplistic free-market optimism is misplaced for at least four reasons . 
First , history has already shown how resource constraints can hinder global economic growth . 
After the upward jump in energy prices in 1973 , annual global growth fell from roughly 5 % between 1960 and 1973 to around 3 % between 1973 and 1989 . 
Second , the world economy is vastly larger than in the past , so that demand for key commodities and energy inputs is also vastly larger . 
Third , we have already used up many of the low-cost options that were once available . 
Low-cost oil is rapidly being depleted . 
The same is true for ground water . 
Land is also increasingly scarce . 
Finally , our past technological triumphs did not actually conserve natural resources , but instead enabled humanity to mine and use these resources at a lower overall cost , thereby hastening their depletion . 
Looking ahead , the world economy will need to introduce alternative technologies that conserve energy , water , and land , or that enable us to use new forms of renewable energy ( such as solar and wind power ) at much lower cost than today . 
Many such technologies exist , and even better technologies can be developed . 
One key problem is that the alternative technologies are often more expensive than the resource-depleting technologies now in use . 
For example , farmers around the world could reduce their water use dramatically by switching from conventional irrigation to drip irrigation , which uses a series of tubes to deliver water directly to each plant while preserving or raising crop yields . 
Yet the investment in drip irrigation is generally more expensive than less-efficient irrigation methods . 
Poor farmers may lack the capital to invest in it , or may lack the incentive to do so if water is taken directly from publicly available sources or if the government is subsidizing its use . 
Similar examples abound . 
With greater investments , it will be possible to raise farm yields , lower energy use to heat and cool buildings , achieve greater fuel efficiency for cars , and more . 
With new investments in research and development , still further improvements in technologies can be achieved . 
Yet investments in new resource-saving technologies are not being made at a sufficient scale , because market signals don &apos;t give the right incentives , and because governments are not yet cooperating adequately to develop and spread their use . 
If we continue on our current course - leaving fate to the markets , and leaving governments to compete with each other over scarce oil and food - global growth will slow under the pressures of resource constraints . 
But if the world cooperates on the research , development , demonstration , and diffusion of resource-saving technologies and renewable energy sources , we will be able to continue to achieve rapid economic progress . 
A good place to start would be the climate-change negotiations , now underway . 
The rich world should commit to financing a massive program of technology development - renewable energy , fuel-efficient cars , and green buildings - and to a program of technology transfer to developing countries . 
Such a commitment would also give crucial confidence to poor countries that climate-change control will not become a barrier to long-term economic development .
