The Wobbly West 
CHARLESTON , SOUTH CAROLINA - Early in the financial crisis , a major emerging-market investor told me : &quot; This is not a global , but a semi-global financial crisis . &quot; 
He was right : it really was a crisis of the United States , Europe , and Japan . 
Among emerging markets , only Eastern Europe was badly hit . 
Indeed , the crisis marks the emerging economies &quot; overtaking of the major Western countries , with huge consequences for global power , finance , politics , and economics . 
The eurozone sovereign-debt crisis appears to have been the worst-managed financial crisis since Argentina &apos;s default in 2001 . 
The European Union and eurozone leaders have seriously discredited themselves . 
Europe requires institutional changes that are much more fundamental than anything discussed so far . 
The International Monetary Fund has never bet such huge sums on a single country as it has on Greece . 
As a result , the IMF , a custodian of some of the international reserves held by the world &apos;s central banks , risks losing tens of billions of dollars . 
Is this a responsible use of international taxpayers &quot; money ? 
Would the IMF not have insisted on a much tougher program , with less financing , for any country outside the eurozone ? 
The apparent explanation for the IMF &apos;s extraordinary gamble is that the managing director who made the decision to support Greece so heavily hailed from the eurozone and , at the time , was barely disguising his ambitions to run for the French presidency - that is , before his arrest in New York on charges of rape . 
Europeans , moreover , dominate the Fund &apos;s leadership . 
It is a discomforting conflict of interest that debtors dominate an international institution that lends them vast sums . 
This mismanagement should disqualify any eurozone policymaker from the IMF &apos;s managing directorship , and yet Christine Lagarde , French finance minister , was named to succeed her compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn after his resignation . 
Who would seriously have suggested a Russian to lead the IMF after its financial crash in 1998 , or an Argentine after its default in 2001 ? 
Today , the eurozone is equally toxic . 
The EU , the United States , and Japan are in fiscal jeopardy , and several countries - Japan , Greece , Italy , and Belgium - have public debts exceeding their GDP . 
Increasingly , people recognize that loose fiscal policy was poor economic policy , with serious implications for macroeconomic thinking , politics , and constitutions . 
In macroeconomic theory , Keynesianism is due for its second demise . 
Milton Friedman &apos;s monetarism delivered the first death blow in the 1980 &quot; s , but it did not generate useful policy rules or predictions . 
During the crisis , prevailing macroeconomic theory counseled massive fiscal stimulus , thereby aggravating the public-debt crisis . 
The question today is whether macroeconomic theory will render itself as irrelevant as the political economy of socialism , or make useful contributions to economic policy . 
For the time being , elementary fiscal and monetary rules appear more appropriate . 
How could people and governments accept these enormous debts and even recommend further fiscal stimulus ? 
Many public expenditures and budget deficits have no justification other than populism , and the big political loser of the crisis has been European social democracy , Keynesian economics &quot; political counterpart . 
All too often , social democracy has amounted to populism , opposing any cuts in public expenditures and even deregulation , which would have enhanced productivity . 
European voters are now punishing social-democratic parties , which have become weaker than at any time since World War I. Instead , a fiscally responsible center-right alignment of political forces has taken power in all but three of the 27 EU countries . 
Western democracies have prided themselves on institutional checks and balances , but obviously these mechanisms did not work during the crisis or the preceding boom . 
And they have been a recipe for policy paralysis in America &apos;s long debate about raising the ceiling on its national debt . 
So , when Chinese and Russians officials attack democracy as such , old questions about democracy &apos;s efficacy and stability are raised anew . 
There is no denying that advanced democracies largely failed to preempt the financial and sovereign-debt crises , while most emerging economies pursued better economic policies . 
How can modern Western democracies impose strict fiscal discipline ? 
Has the independence of central banks given unelected officials license to print money ? 
How can accountability be imposed ? 
How can unrepresentative vested interests be contained ? 
Such questions have triggered a wide-ranging constitutional debate . 
After the Second World War , many European countries enshrined extensive social guarantees in their constitutions . 
Now many of these guarantees will need to be thrown out . 
Instead , a number of European countries are discussing the introduction of stringent fiscal rules into their constitutions , and are contemplating even more far-reaching changes . 
Excessive fiscal deficits in many Western countries must be reduced . 
The average public debt in the eurozone has soared to 85 % of GDP . 
Some European countries can reduce their debt through continuous budget surpluses , as Bulgaria , Finland , Russia , and Sweden have done in the last decade . 
Privatization of public corporations and property is another possibility . 
My Petersen Institute colleague Carmen Reinhardt suspects that financial repression will be the main debt-reduction method : governments will rely on regulation and manipulation to force savers to pay down public debt through negative real returns on their bond investments . 
Meanwhile , central bankers everywhere ask themselves : why keep ever-larger international reserves in two of the world &apos;s most mismanaged currencies , the US dollar and the euro ? 
However rare changes in reserve currencies have been historically , the current situation is no longer tenable ; but a switch could further destabilize the world economy . 
The West &apos;s economic mismanagement will also reduce its military power . 
At present , the US accounts for half of all global military expenditures , but cuts are due . 
Relative US military power is not likely to be this great ever again , and China &apos;s military rise looks as inevitable as its economic success . 
The predicament of the West remains lamentable . 
Even so , some economists still advocate more fiscal stimulus . 
Instead , Western leaders need to focus on fixing their state budgets in order to salvage what they can .
