The Blinders of the Left 
Is it 1956 for the Left ? 
Well , yes . 
All over the world , the Left was thrown into confusion and crisis after Khrushchev &apos;s 1956 speech exposing ( some of ) Stalin &apos;s crimes . 
It wasn &apos;t only Communist Party members who were dazed by Khrushchev &apos;s revelations ; progressives of all stripes - from trade unionists to Trotskyites - were forced , if they were honest and brave enough , to reassess long-cherished beliefs . 
September 11 th has thrust those of us who consider ourselves progressives - who believe in democracy , feminism , human rights and socialism - into a 1956-type crisis . 
By this I do not mean that the Islamic fundamentalists who declared war on &quot; the infidels &quot; ( including so many of their own people ) are Stalinists ( though the two groups certainly share some characteristics ) . 
I do mean that we must , if we are honest and brave enough , reassess many of our long-cherished beliefs . 
Questioning authority must now start with our own . 
Are we up to that task ? 
I am not at all sure that we will do better than our forebears in the 1950s ; years of self-imposed political correctness have resulted in muddled , strident and obtuse ways of approaching ( or is it avoiding ? ) the world . 
I should say here that I consider this piece primarily a self-critique ; but I know , too , that though the universe of &quot; progressives &quot; I am addressing is not infinite , it is larger than one . 
The holy grail of much Leftist thinking over the past two or three decades has been cultural relativity . 
Terrified of being thought racist , imperialist , arrogant , elitist or &quot; too Western , &quot; we averted our eyes from ( and sometimes even supported ) barbarisms of all types . 
Along with this came an odd reverence for &quot; traditional cultures &quot; - strange for those who fancy themselves forward-looking rationalists - at least if those cultures flourish in the so-called Third World . 
For example : a student of mine defended female genital mutilation in Africa on the grounds that it is &quot; traditional . &quot; 
True , I replied ; and so was slavery in the American south . 
That &apos;s different ! , she cried . 
Ah , but it &apos;s not . 
Indeed , if Marx was writing today , he &apos;d be vilified for blasting the idiocy of rural life , for today every idiocy is interpreted - all evidence to the contrary - as a form of intelligence . 
Then there is the opiate of the people , which has somehow metamorphosed into a self-conscious , nay dialectical , cry for national liberation . 
Ah , but it &apos;s not . 
Bitter irony : this attempt to purify ourselves of racism resulted in a racist worldview . 
What else can we call our willful ignorance of the agony of so many in the underdeveloped world : the torture chambers that litter virtually every Arab nation , the million &quot; martyrs &quot; in the lunatic Iran-Iraq war , the thousands of state executions in China , the grotesque subjugation of women ? 
( The Taliban &apos;s strictures against women make the Nuremberg Laws look almost mild , though in spirit the two sets of decrees are one . ) 
Our &quot; solidarity &quot; with the Third World has been anything but . 
Yet another irony : our belief in human rights in some ways abetted this betrayal . 
I often hear it said these days that human rights are inalienable - as if rights , like genes or DNA , reside &quot; within &quot; us from birth . 
Convenient , this ; for who needs to defend , much less create , something innate ? 
Rights , however , are not natural : they are artificial human constructs , the result of deliberate thought , of history , of ethical and political work . 
We don &apos;t inherit rights : we make them . 
Hannah Arendt put it well ( the year was 1951 , but it could be today ) : &quot; No paradox of contemporary politics is filled with a more poignant irony than the discrepancy between the efforts of well-meaning idealists who stubbornly insist on regarding as &apos; inalienable &apos; those human rights , which are enjoyed only by citizens of the most prosperous and civilized countries , and the situation of the rightless themselves . . . . 
Equality . . . is not given us , but is the result of human organization insofar as it is guided by the principle of justice . 
We are not born equal ; we become equal as members of a group on the strength of our decision to guarantee ourselves mutually equal rights . &quot; 
Starting in the 18 th century and continuing into the middle of the 20 th , the Left defined itself as the defender of knowledge , science , secularism , progress , skeptical thought and universal ( not relative ) freedoms . 
All this has been horribly turned on its head ; in place of our forebears &apos; robust values , we substituted timid , frightened rationalizations for all sorts of voodoo ideologies and practices . 
September 11 th - by which I mean not just the World Trade Center massacre , but the skein of hateful , reactionary worldviews and organizations it revealed with unmistakable force - is a clarion call . 
There are times when things change , when history bends if not quite breaks . 
This is that time . 
Because it is , we must un-learn the wretched habit of thinking that truthfulness resides in the messenger rather than the message . 
If a neo-liberal or conservative has more to tell us than a Noam Chomsky , so be it . 
All morality begins in realism : our ability to see the world as it is , rather than as we want it to be , must henceforth be ( and should always have been ) the starting point of Left-leaning politics . 
Are we honest and brave enough ( which in this case also means scared enough ) to shuck our romantic fantasies about the downtrodden , and our shameful rationalizations borne of guilt , bravado and indifference ? 
Our lives - and certainly the kind of world , if any , that we bequeath to future generations - depend on this .
