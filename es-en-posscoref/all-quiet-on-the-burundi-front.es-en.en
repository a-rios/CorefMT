All Quiet on the Burundi Front ? 
Like its neighbors , Congo and Rwanda , Burundi is a war-torn land . 
Its troubles have not riveted world attention in recent years , probably because Burundi &apos;s rebels failed to plumb the depths of savagery seen in Rwanda and Congo . 
But , unlike its neighbors , this year can mark a turning point for Burundi . 
Thanks to agreements between the rebels and the government that Nelson Mandela and South African Vice President Jacob Zuma helped broker , Burundi can now either turn decisively away from civil strife , or risk a return to the machete politics that have mauled Africa &apos;s Great Lakes region for a decade . 
Since its independence from Belgium in 1962 , Burundi has suffered five episodes of what amounts to the same civil war . 
About 600,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands made into refugees . 
Many portray this war as the result of hatred between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi . 
But this does not explain why these groups supposedly hate each other so much . 
Burundi &apos;s cultural and linguistic homogeneity , rare in Africa , belies the simplistic view that the Hutu and Tutsi fight because they are so different . 
Indeed , most countries are far more heterogeneous than Burundi but have never fallen into ethnic war . 
To understand the dynamics of conflict in Burundi , we need to examine three root causes . 
The first such cause is the legacy of colonization . 
In the 1920 &apos;s and 1930 &apos;s , the Belgian authorities enacted policies that defined the population along ethnic lines and favored the Tutsi in a deliberate - and successful - effort to divide society and fan resentment among Hutu leaders . 
Second , the bloody 1959 revolution in Rwanda , a country mirroring Burundi &apos;s ethnic and social structure , induced Burundi &apos;s Tutsi to cling even more tightly to power . 
At the same time , Burundi &apos;s Hutu saw Rwanda as a role model and believed their ethnic majority should guarantee them de facto control of the country . 
Third , successive governments widened the ethnic divide through catastrophically predatory governance . 
A tiny elite of Tutsi from the southern province of Bururi controlled all institutions , exploiting them to the fullest . 
The army brutally suppressed any opposition to Bururi rule . 
No surprise , then , that millions of Burundians felt alienated , and that many resorted to violence . 
In October 1993 , the killing by members of the army of Melchior Ndadaye , the first civilian , Hutu , non-Bururi , and democratically elected president provoked a bloody reaction by the Hutu . 
Presidential assassinations do not necessarily lead to civil wars , but in Burundi , a large-scale massacre of Tutsi civilians by Hutu immediately followed the coup attempt . 
Fearing retribution by the Tutsi-dominated army , large numbers of Hutu fled the country while armed rebels engaged the army . 
For the first time , the army failed to crush the rebellion . 
As a result , the Tutsi-dominated government entered into negotiations with Hutu leaders , which led to the signing of a political accord in August 2000 . 
But the accord had a major flaw : the absence of a cease-fire . 
Violence only receded in 2003 , when the main rebel group , the 
These breakthroughs came about thanks to the dedicated mediation of Mandela and Zuma . 
The presidents of Uganda and Tanzania , and the international community in general , also exerted leverage . 
( Burundi is an aid-dependent country , so donors have considerable sway in influencing its rulers &apos; behavior . ) 
The question now is whether each party will honor its commitments . 
What guarantees exist that the rebel groups will fully demobilize ? 
Why should the rebels believe that the government will honor its commitments once they no longer represent a threat ? 
Neither party , it seems , can commit credibly to peace . 
Burundi &apos;s donors need to join hands with African leaders to make certain that the agreements are implemented . 
Everyone agrees that recent pledges of a $ 1 billion in aid are a sign that donors are ready to show Burundians that peace has a dividend . 
But aid will help build peace only if it is carefully used . 
It must be distributed to the needy rather than favoring the elite - a tendency established in the past . 
Yet it would be dangerous to redress past imbalances solely at the expense of traditional beneficiaries , especially because they remain powerful enough to derail the peace process . 
It is encouraging to note that Burundi &apos;s leaders have so far managed to integrate leaders from the opposition and rebel groups into the country &apos;s political and military institutions without dismissing incumbents . 
The danger is that applying this approach rigorously will invariably result in a bloated civil service and army . 
But while downsizing government may be fashionable in the West , now is not the time for slimming down Burundi &apos;s state sector . 
For once , over employment is politically justified . 
The international community must understand that the political benefits of not alienating the old elite while offering new opportunities to traditionally excluded groups outweigh the financial cost . 
Burundi will need even deeper pockets from its donors to transform today &apos;s political overtures into sustainable peace .
