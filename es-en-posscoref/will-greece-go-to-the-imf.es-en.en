Will Greece Go To the IMF ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - Traditionally , &quot; you should go to the IMF &quot; was not something you would say to friendly neighbors and close allies . 
Over the past few decades , the International Monetary Fund became associated with excessive fiscal austerity , extreme political insensitivity , and - since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 - with an out-and-out stigma . 
Countries borrowed from the IMF only under duress , when all else failed - and when there was simply no other way to pay for essential imports . 
( For Iceland in the fall of 2008 , for example , the only alternative to IMF financing was to eat locally obtained goods , which mostly means fish . ) 
But the IMF has changed a great deal in recent years , largely under the auspices of Dominique Strauss-Kahn , its current managing director . 
Strauss-Kahn , a former French finance minister and contender for the Socialist nomination for the French presidency , has pushed through changes that allow the IMF to lend without conditions in some circumstances , and to give greater priority to protecting social safety nets ( including unemployment benefits and healthcare systems ) . 
He has also moved the Fund decisively away from its obsession with fiscal austerity measures ( a big early mistake - with lasting traumatic consequences - in Indonesia and Korea in late 1997 ) . 
Greece undoubtedly has serious problems today . 
T he great opportunities offered by European integration have been largely squandered . 
Germany and France - as de facto leaders of the European Union - are haggling over a belated support package , but they have made it abundantly clear that Greece must slash public-sector wages and other spending . 
Greek trade unions know what this means - and are in the streets . 
If Greece still had its own currency , everything would be easier . 
Just as in the case of the United Kingdom since 2008 , the Greek exchange rate would depreciate sharply . 
But , with Greece and other troubled euro-zone economies ( known to their detractors as the PIIGS : Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece , and Spain ) having surrendered monetary policy to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in Frankfurt , their currencies cannot fall in this fashion . 
So Greece - and arguably the PIIGS more generally - are left with the need to curtail demand massively , lower wages , and reduce the public-sector workforce . 
The last time we saw this kind of precipitate fiscal austerity - when countries were tied to the gold standard - it contributed directly to the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930 &quot; s . 
This is a situation tailor-made for Strauss-Kahn and the &quot; new IMF &quot; to ride to the rescue . 
Since early 2009 , the Fund has had significantly greater resources to lend to countries in trouble , to cushion the blow of crisis , and to offer a form of international circuit-breaker when it looks like the lights might otherwise go out . 
The idea is not to prevent necessary adjustments - for example , in the form of budget-deficit reduction - but to spread them out over time , to restore confidence , and to serve as an external seal of approval on a government &apos;s credibility . 
T he IMF was created in the waning days of World War II , essentially as a United States-West European partnership . 
Europe retains strong representation at the Fund , and has always chosen its top leader - in fact , most emerging markets ( in Asia , Latin America , and Africa ) complain that Europe is overrepresented and has far too much say in how the Fund operates . 
Yet at this moment of growing European crisis , while there is still time to act , the Fund is confined to the sidelines . 
This is partly because German Chancellor Angela Merkel , currently maneuvering to ensure that a German is the next head of the ECB , does not want the Fund to become more involved in euro-zone policies . 
The IMF might reasonably take the position that ECB policies have been overly contractionary - resulting in a strong euro and very low inflation - and are no longer appropriate for member countries in the midst of a financial collapse . 
If the IMF were to support Europe &apos;s weaker economies , this would challenge the prevailing ideology among Frankfurt-dominated policy makers . 
But the real reason is much simpler . 
When French President Nicolas Sarkozy put forward Strauss-Kahn &apos;s name to run the IMF , he meant to park a past and potentially future rival in a faraway place about which people cared little . 
Then the global financial crisis hit , and Strauss-Kahn was propelled to center stage . 
With France &apos;s next presidential election fast approaching in 2012 , the last thing Sarkozy now needs is for Strauss-Kahn to play a statesman-like role in saving the euro zone . 
We can expect to hear all kinds of misleading excuses from EU sources for excluding the IMF : &quot; the Fund is too American , &quot; &quot; Europe must resolve its own problems , &quot; and &quot; the IMF is not appropriate to our circumstances . &quot; 
Given the magnitude of the Greek crisis , they will all ring hollow . 
Sometimes history is driven by deep forces beyond our control , and sometimes by sheer chance . 
The EU &apos;s leaders will try hard to keep the IMF at bay . 
This is not good news for Greece - or for anyone who cares about global financial stability .
