Technological Cooperation 
In early February , the United States National Academy of Engineering released a report on &quot; Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century . &quot; 
The goal is to focus attention on the potential of technology to help the world address poverty and environmental threats . 
The list includes potential breakthroughs such as low-cost solar power , safe disposal of CO2 from power plants , nuclear fusion , new educational technologies , and the control of environmental side effects from nitrogen fertilizers . 
The report , like the Gates Foundation &apos;s similar list of &quot; Grand Challenges &quot; in global health , highlights a new global priority : promoting advanced technologies for sustainable development . 
We are used to thinking about global cooperation in fields such as monetary policy , disease control , or nuclear weapons proliferation . 
We are less accustomed to thinking of global cooperation to promote new technologies , such as clean energy , a malaria vaccine , or drought-resistant crops to help poor African farmers . 
By and large , we regard new technologies as something to be developed by businesses for the marketplace , not as opportunities for global problem solving . 
Yet , given the enormous global pressures that we face , including vastly unequal incomes and massive environmental damage , we must find new technological solutions to our problems . 
There is no way , for example , to continue expanding the global use of energy safely unless we drastically alter how we produce electricity , power automobiles , and heat and cool our buildings . 
Current reliance on coal , natural gas , and petroleum , without regard for CO2 emissions , is now simply too dangerous , because it is leading to climate changes that will spread diseases , destroy crops , produce more droughts and floods , and perhaps dramatically raise sea levels , thereby inundating coastal regions . 
The National Academy of Engineering identified some possible answers . 
We can harness safe nuclear energy , lower the cost of solar power , or capture and safely store the CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels . 
Yet the technologies are not yet ready , and we can &apos;t simply wait for the market to deliver them , because they require complex changes in public policy to ensure that they are safe , reliable , and acceptable to the broad public . 
Moreover , there are no market incentives in place to induce private businesses to invest adequately in developing them . 
Consider carbon capture and sequestration . 
The idea is that power plants and other large fossil fuel users should capture the CO2 and pump it into permanent underground storage sites , such as old oil fields . 
This will cost , say , $ 30 per ton of CO2 that is stored , so businesses will need an incentive to do it . 
Moreover , public policies will have to promote the testing and improvement of this technology , especially when used at a large scale . 
New kinds of power plants will have to be built to make carbon capture economical , new pipelines will have to be built to transport the CO2 to storage sites , and new monitoring systems will have to be designed to control leaks . 
Likewise , new regulations will be needed to ensure compliance with safety procedures , and to assure public support . 
All of this will take time , costly investments , and lots of collaboration between scientists and engineers in universities , government laboratories , and private businesses . 
Moreover , this kind of technology will be useful only if it is widely used , notably in China and India . 
This raises another challenge of technological innovation : we will need to support the transfer of proven technologies to poorer countries . 
If rich countries monopolize new technologies , the goal of worldwide use to solve worldwide problems will be defeated . 
Thus , technological developments should involve a collaborative international effort from the start . 
All of this will require a new global approach to problem solving . 
We will need to embrace global goals and then establish scientific , engineering , and political processes to support their achievement . 
We will need to give new budgetary incentives to promote demonstration projects , and to support technology transfer . 
And we will have to engage major companies in a new way , giving them ample incentives and market rewards for success , without allowing them to hold a monopoly on successful technologies that should be widely adopted . 
I believe that this new kind of global public-private partnership on technology development will be a major objective of international policy making in the coming years . 
Look for new global cooperative approaches to clean energy systems , medicines and vaccines , improved techniques for fish farming , drought-and-temperature resistant crop varieties , high-mileage automobiles , and low-cost irrigation techniques . 
Rich countries should fund these efforts heavily , and they should be carried out in collaboration with poor countries and the private sector . 
Successful technological breakthroughs can provide stunning benefits for humanity . 
This will be an exciting time to be a scientist or engineer facing the challenges of sustainable development .
