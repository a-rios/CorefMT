Voters vs. the Welfare State 
STANFORD - Canada &apos;s Prime Minister Stephen Harper , by winning an outright majority of seats in his country &apos;s parliament for the first time since assuming office , continues a remarkable series of national election victories , backed by voters demanding at least a pause , and perhaps some reversal , of the growth of the welfare state . 
Moreover , Harper &apos;s victory follows the Republican Party &apos;s resounding 2010 triumph in the United States &quot; mid-term election , a campaign largely fought on the size and scope of government , following the massive expansion of public spending in the wake of the financial crisis and recession . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron ( who leads , as Harper did until recently , a center-right coalition government ) , likewise won on a platform to roll back the excesses of the welfare state . 
Next up is French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s anticipated re-election bid . 
France has higher taxes and social-welfare benefits than the United Kingdom , Canada , or the US . 
Sarkozy , despite initial attempts to roll back some French entitlements , has thus far produced less reform than Cameron or Harper , let alone Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Some might argue that economic problems faced by governments are so severe that simply being in power invites being tossed out of office , regardless of ideology . 
But Harper &apos;s re-election suggests otherwise . 
Harper lowered Canada &apos;s sales and corporate taxes ( now well below America &apos;s ) , and , like Cameron , desires more rapid fiscal consolidation than US President Barack Obama . 
The potential significance of these elections must be understood in the context not only of the recession and financial crisis , and the government interventions designed to deal with them , but also in the broader sweep of the historical evolution of these countries &quot; welfare states . 
The following trends stand out : 
· In all four countries , there has been a sizeable upward trend in government outlays as a share of GDP ; 
· In each country , there has been a sizeable increase in public spending in the last few years , particularly in the US and the UK ; 
· France has the highest government spending as a share of GDP - well over 50 % , according to the OECD - and this has increased continually , decade after decade ; 
· The US currently has the smallest share of government spending in GDP , although it has gained substantially on Canada because of the spending explosion since 2000 - President George W. Bush &apos;s military spending and Obama &apos;s social spending ; 
· The increase in Canada &apos;s public spending as a share of GDP since 2000 has been the smallest of the four countries ; 
· Canada and the UK have had periods of important reductions in the share of government spending . 
In the UK , the share fell four percentage points in 1980-1990 ( the Margaret Thatcher revolution ) , and fell further until 2000 . 
In the years prior to the financial crisis , Canada &apos;s share fell from the mid-40 &quot; s to about 40 % ; 
· Likewise , the Reagan Revolution in the US stopped the upward trend in non-defense spending . 
What about economic performance , as measured by real GDP per capita ? 
The four countries rank exactly in inverse order of their government spending shares ( according to both 2009 and pre-crisis 2007 data ) , with the US highest , followed by Canada , the UK , and France . 
The simple correlation coefficient is about -0.9 ! 
The voters appear to be onto something important . 
Of course , correlation does not prove causation ; there are myriad other factors that affect economic performance besides the size , composition , and nature of welfare-state spending ( and clearly related taxes and debt ) . 
Moreover , governments provide services , from defense and law enforcement to a humane safety net , that are essential to a successful economy and society . 
But the size of the welfare state - and the erosion of incentives to work , save , and invest , owing to high taxes and bloated transfer payments - is a major impediment to faster income growth . 
This simple analysis should raise a red flag about how we think about the trade-offs between dynamism and security , or growth and redistribution . 
After all , real per capita income in the US is about 40 % higher than in France , 22 % higher than in Canada , and 31 % higher than in Great Britain . 
The relative histories have followed a similar trend ( again , other factors are involved , not just taxes and spending ) . 
For example , the US advantage over France has expanded from 25 % to 40 % since 1980 , a period in which the share of government spending in GDP was stabilized in the US ( until recently ) , while it grew substantially in France . 
Likewise , French real per capita GDP exceeded the UK level in 1980 , but was overtaken in 2000 , and by 2007 lagged the UK by about 10 % . 
These differences are the equivalent of an entire generation of economic progress . 
Those who want to control , reform , and reduce government spending seem to have the big picture right . 
It is a prerequisite for substantial economic advance . 
That is the broad lesson of history - from the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions in the US and the UK , to Stephen Harper &apos;s more recent experience , to the repeat performance that David Cameron and the Republicans in the US Congress are now trying to engineer . 
Only time will tell if the recent elections in the UK , the US , and Canada signal a retreat from the growth of the welfare state or just a temporary respite . 
But comparing the US , Canada , the UK , and France reveals that the stakes are immense .
