Unsettling America 
LONDON - Is there more to be said about Egypt ? 
Hosni Mubarak has been sacrificed to save the military regime . 
A &quot; strongman &quot; who cannot keep order in the streets is of no use to anyone . 
Whether &quot; democracy &quot; will ensue is much more dubious . 
Judging on the basis of Pakistan , and much of the rest of the Muslim world , periods of ( corrupt ) civilian rule will alternate with &quot; cleansing &quot; military coups . 
I doubt that most Egyptians put what we call democracy at the top of their political agenda . 
Journalists who claim otherwise are not a representative sample , even in Western countries . 
They are a restless breed , flitting round the world &apos;s trouble spots , pen and camera poised . 
Freedom of expression is in their bones ; mass protests their visual lifeblood . 
They try to report the world as it is , but theirs is not the world of most people - their business depends on the disruption of &quot; ordinary &quot; business , so they systematically underestimate people &apos;s desire for law and order ( or at least order ) . 
Most people , it seems , will tolerate a modest amount of political repression , including secret police , torture , and corruption , if it delivers security and a modicum of prosperity and fairness . 
Otherwise , there is no explanation for the longevity of dictatorships such as Mubarak &apos;s 30-year rule . 
Likewise , in the referendum that ended his 16-year rule in Chile in 1990 , General Augusto Pinochet , with thousands of tortured and vanished victims in his grisly cupboard , ran on a law-and-order platform and received 44 % of the vote . 
Most Western leaders think naturally in terms of a &quot; transition to democracy . &quot; 
This is what they want to happen in Egypt , hoping that democracy will not jeopardize Egypt &apos;s peace treaty with Israel . 
Non-Western political systems are typically archaic : good rulers can sleep soundly at night , while bad rulers face continual danger of overthrow from the army or the streets . 
Most non-Western peoples rely upon the ruler &apos;s personal virtues , not institutional limits on his power , to make their lives tolerable . 
We interpret as striving for democracy what is really the traditional way of getting rid of bad rulers . 
Yet all of this leaves out the possibility of change , particularly change influenced by the United States &quot; unsettling role in the world . 
The idea that the US is a status quo power is a delusion of international-relations experts . 
In the short run , of course , the US behaves like an ordinary power . 
It has interests to protect , and this often requires supporting unsavory regimes . 
And , despite the rise of China and the move to a more &quot; plural &quot; international system , the US still has the power to change &quot; facts on the ground &quot; in large parts of the world , particularly the Middle East . 
Experts have always underestimated the expansionary character of American foreign policy , because they think of expansion in old-world terms : conquest , imperialism , and colonialism . 
The US does not seek to create an empire in the old sense : America pursues an imperialism of the values that it holds dear . 
If all countries have the same values , traditional imperialism becomes obsolete . 
Though it clearly lacks the power to impose its values by force , the US certainly has the power to unsettle established conditions , both through the attraction of its &quot; soft power &quot; ( the American way of life ) and by the exemplary use of force . 
I was one of those who opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 . 
Now I wonder whether I was right . 
Parts of the invasion and occupation were certainly badly mishandled by the US , leading to a much greater loss of life than was necessary . 
That is why I am not at all sure that the street uprisings in Egypt , following those in Tunisia , and now spreading to other Muslim-majority countries , can be interpreted simply as traditional forms of protest against bad rulers . 
Throughout the Muslim world , there is a sense of enlarged possibilities , especially among the young : more than half of Egypt &apos;s 80 million people are under 25 . 
Surely , this sentiment can be traced back to the US invasion and forcible overthrow of Saddam Hussein . 
In his great verse drama Faust , Goethe has God send humanity the Devil ( Mephistopheles ) in order to stir things up . 
His intention is quite clear : &quot; Man &apos;s active nature , flagging , seeks too soon the level ; 
Mephistopheles is rather a joker . 
So is America , always stirring sleepy societies out of their torpor - a role begun when Commodore Matthew Perry &quot; opened up &quot; Japan in 1854 . 
If we want to hold fast to any vision of progress , this is an indispensable role , and only America can play it today . 
With China , like seeks to talk to like . 
With America , like deliberately engages with unlike , and tries to infuse it with some of its vigor . 
True , America &apos;s intervention in the Middle East also strengthened extremist Islam , breeding on the resentment that the US presence arouses . 
The religious demon is a far less appealing devil than Uncle Sam . 
Sooner or later , the Brothers will suffer the fate of all bad devils .
