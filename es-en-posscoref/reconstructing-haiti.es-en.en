Reconstructing Haiti 
NEW YORK - The horrors of Haiti &apos;s earthquake continue to unfold . 
The quake itself killed perhaps 100,000 people . 
More than one million people are exposed to hunger and disease and , with the rain and hurricane seasons approaching , are vulnerable to further hazards . 
Even an economy as impoverished as Haiti &apos;s is a complex system dependent on trade between rural and urban areas , transport , electricity , port services , and government functions . 
Haiti &apos;s economy worked badly in the past , and was still reeling from four hurricanes in 2008 when the earthquake struck . 
The fact that the quake hit the capital , and demolished every center of social activity , destroyed the systems upon which daily urban life depends . 
Millions of people are now without livelihoods and the means for survival . 
The first stage in an effective response , the first three or four weeks , must focus on rescuing survivors and stabilizing supplies of food , water , medical services , and shelter for the population . 
Neither Haiti nor the world was properly equipped for this , and tens of thousands will die needlessly . 
The world &apos;s emergency-response systems - especially for impoverished countries in zones that are vulnerable to earthquakes , volcanoes , droughts , hurricanes , and floods - needs upgrading . 
After just a month or so , the emergency phase will give way to a decades-long struggle for recovery and long-term development . 
Haiti must avoid a prolonged period of tent cities in which people are mere refugees . 
But where should displaced people - numbering hundreds of thousands , and perhaps more than a million - live ? 
How should they be provided with food , water , health care , and shelter ? 
And how can they begin to contribute to the revival of basic economic life ? 
The economy will have a simple structure in the coming years , with most economic activities focused in five sectors : smallholder , or peasant , agriculture ; reconstruction ; port services and light manufacturing ; local small-scale trade ; and public services , including health care and education . 
The key challenge is to support these five sectors in order to combine short-term relief with long-term reconstruction and development . 
First , special efforts should be made to boost peasant agriculture and rural communities . 
With fertilizer , improved seeds , small-scale irrigation , rapid training and extension services , and low-cost storage silos , Haiti &apos;s food production could double or triple in the next few years , sustaining the country and building a new rural economy . 
Reconstruction - of roads , buildings , and water and sanitation systems - will employ tens of thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands , of Haitian construction workers , and boost the regeneration of towns . 
The World Food Program can help peasant farmers to produce more food in the countryside and then purchase the food to use in food-for-work programs oriented to construction projects . 
Haiti &quot; s infrastructure was meager before the earthquake ( hence the shocking mortality rate ) , and most of that is now rubble . 
Large-scale capital investment will also be needed to re-equip the ports and to re-establish a power grid . 
Recovery will also require re-establishing at least a small-scale manufacturing sector . 
Haiti , like its next-door neighbor , the Dominican Republic , once created jobs in port facilities , including production of clothing , baseballs , and other light-manufacturing items . 
Those jobs disappeared in the 1990 &quot; s , when the US imposed a trade embargo on Haiti as part of an effort to re-establish democracy . 
Democracy returned , but the economy was destroyed . 
Other countries have risen from the rubble of natural disaster and war , and Haiti can do the same over the next five to ten years . For the next decade , however , and especially for the next five years , there will be no escape from the need to rely on international financing , and mainly grant assistance , to finance the rebuilding effort . 
The world has spent heavily in Haiti before , but very ineffectively . 
This time , it must be done right . 
A clear strategy is needed to bolster the key sectors discussed above . 
Each sector requires a five-year recovery strategy with a clear budget and clear lines of partnership and responsibility linking the Haitian government , non-governmental organizations , and institutional donors , especially governments and international agencies . 
The second key to successful reconstruction is to harmonize the international response . 
There are probably 40 or more official organizations from abroad , if not more , already engaged in the recovery effort . 
In addition , there are hundreds , if not thousands , of native Haitian NGOs . 
The Haitian government itself has been reduced to paralysis by death and destruction . 
There should be one overarching framework . 
There should be a highly professional executive team coordinating the international support efforts . 
And all of this should be put in place very soon , while there is international interest . 
The world will move on to the next crisis very soon , well before Haiti has even started to recover . 
I have watched the problems of international cooperation for a quarter-century . 
Each agency has its role , but they also tend to squabble over turf rather than cooperate . 
International financial promises are made for headlines and photo opportunities , but end up undelivered . 
We therefore need money in the bank , and clear leadership . 
My nominee to guide the process is the Inter-American Development Bank . 
The IDB &apos;s deep , long-term commitments in Haiti and professional expertise in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure qualify it to coordinate the multitude of agencies that will be involved . 
It should work closely with a professional executive team made up of native and diaspora Haitian professionals with relevant expertise . 
Rebuilding Haiti will cost perhaps $ 10- $ 20 billion , and will take much of the coming decade . 
Getting started now will save countless lives and prevent a further tragic downward spiral of a society that stands on the brink of survival .
