Millennium Development Miles 
PARIS - The global economic crisis has claimed many victims - unemployed workers , underwater homeowners , and bankrupt pensioners - but nowhere have the repercussions been as devastating as in the developing world . 
The setback to the fragile gains of recent years , particularly in Africa , threatens to return millions of people to the extreme poverty from which they had just managed to escape . 
In addition to the prospect of enormous human suffering , severe economic , political , and social pressures now threaten to overwhelm and destabilize developing countries , triggering conflict on an unprecedented scale . 
What makes today &apos;s downward spiral particularly disheartening is that the economic crisis has hit at a time of the first glimmerings of progress , notably in health care . 
Since 2000 , the rate of people dying from AIDS has declined , child-killing diseases like malaria and measles are being tackled more effectively , universal primary education is inching forward , and the targets for safe drinking water are in sight . 
Now , though , the global economic crisis is sapping developed countries &quot; shaky efforts to fulfill their commitments for official development assistance ( ODA ) in order to achieve the United Nations &quot; Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
A UN report warns that annual investment from these donor countries is falling $ 35 billion short of the $ 150 billion goal . 
Unless something changes , there is little chance that the MDG targets can be sustained in the long run . 
Indeed , the consequences of the fall-off in ODA are already dramatic ; the number of people going hungry and in extreme poverty is now far greater than before , and the same is true of the unemployed , those who work in vulnerable jobs , or earn less than $ 1.25 a day . 
Progress in health and literacy is being undermined . 
World Bank data link the economic downturn to an increase , by 200,000 , in mortality among children under the age of five . 
Moreover , 536,000 women a year die in childbirth , and maternal health is also the one MDG progress towards which has stagnated since the targets were established 10 years ago . 
Every minute that passes means one less mother , and it is shameful that 99 % of these deaths occur in developing countries . 
So should we despair of achieving the MDGs , not just by the original deadline of 2015 but even by the end of the century ? 
Viewed through the traditional ODA prism , with its one-year budgets , public-finance constraints , and competing national priorities , there seems little cause for optimism . 
But there is a way to replace the traditional paradigm with an internationally accepted model that has a proven record of success , particularly in health care . 
Innovative financing mechanisms offer the means to tap incrementally into global financial flows without disrupting economic activity . 
Among the best-known examples is UNITAID , a UN-sponsored international drug-purchase facility funded largely through a small fee added to airline tickets , which has raised $ 1.5 billion since 2007 . 
This reliable funding source has spearheaded the fight on the three health-related MDGs : treating and fighting life-threatening diseases like HIV / AIDS , malaria , and tuberculosis ; reducing childhood mortality ; and improving maternal health . 
Providing funding in 93 countries , UNITAID today finances drugs for three-quarters of the children around the world who receive anti-retrovirals . 
Widespread coverage has been achieved through UNITAID &apos;s influence on the price of life-saving drugs : it guarantees a market through long-term commitments to purchase high volumes of medicines and diagnostics - a commitment made possible by the sustainable and predictable funding of the &quot; air tax . &quot; 
As a result , the price of anti-retrovirals has been cut by more than 50 % . 
Similarly , UNITAID is attacking child mortality through UNICEF &apos;s extensive program to eradicate mother-to-child HIV transmission . 
By the end of 2010 , four million African women will be screened , and tri-therapies treatment provided to 500,000 pregnant women worldwide . 
UNITAID is now building on this success by teaming up with the Millennium Foundation to give individuals a chance to help fight major diseases through micro-contributions . 
An innovative fundraising mechanism called Voluntary Solidarity Contribution will allow air travelers and others to make a voluntary micro-donation to UNITAID simply by checking a box when buying , say , a plane ticket , and adding $ 2 to the total cost . 
The &quot; air tax &quot; currently applies to only 7-10 % of all airline tickets sold , yet the $ 400 million it brings in yearly accounts for three-quarters of UNITAID &apos;s financing . 
With more than a billion people now traveling by air every year , and with a total of 2.2 billion flights sold , extending the &quot; air tax &quot; approach to a voluntary contributions model would vastly multiply the program &apos;s benefits . 
Such new financing mechanisms , in addition to national ODA investments , are an important means of supporting the beleaguered MDGs . 
In September , when UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convenes a summit in New York to renew the drive toward reaching the MDGs , the world leaders in attendance should endorse their use to address MDG priorities in areas other than health . 
When the MDGs were adopted in 2000 , the sense of urgency was powered by the moral conviction that extreme poverty had become an unacceptable anachronism in our globally connected world . 
But more is needed , and September &apos;s summit in New York will be an important opportunity for countries to voice their full-throated support for innovative financing mechanisms , and thus give the MDGs a fighting chance .
