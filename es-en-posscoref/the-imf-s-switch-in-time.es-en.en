The IMF &apos;s Switch in Time 
NEW YORK - The annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund was notable in marking the Fund &apos;s effort to distance itself from its own long-standing tenets on capital controls and labor-market flexibility . 
It appears that a new IMF has gradually , and cautiously , emerged under the leadership of Dominique Strauss-Kahn . 
Slightly more than 13 years earlier , at the IMF &apos;s Hong Kong meeting in 1997 , the Fund had attempted to amend its charter in order to gain more leeway to push countries towards capital-market liberalization . 
The timing could not have been worse : the East Asia crisis was just brewing - a crisis that was largely the result of capital-market liberalization in a region that , given its high savings rate , had no need for it . 
That push had been advocated by Western financial markets - and the Western finance ministries that serve them so loyally . 
Financial deregulation in the United States was a prime cause of the global crisis that erupted in 2008 , and financial and capital-market liberalization elsewhere helped spread that &quot; made in the USA &quot; trauma around the world . 
The crisis showed that free and unfettered markets are neither efficient nor stable . 
They also did not necessarily do a good job at setting prices ( witness the real-estate bubble ) , including exchange rates ( which are merely the price of one currency in terms of another ) . 
Iceland showed that responding to the crisis by imposing capital controls could help small countries manage its impact . 
And the US Federal Reserve &apos;s &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ( QEII ) made the demise of the ideology of unfettered markets inevitable : money goes to where markets think returns are highest . 
With emerging markets booming , and America and Europe in the doldrums , it was clear that much of the new liquidity being created would find its way to emerging markets . 
This was especially true given that America &apos;s credit pipeline remained clogged , with many community and regional banks still in a precarious position . 
The resulting surge of money into emerging markets has meant that even finance ministers and central-bank governors who are ideologically opposed to intervening believe that they have no choice but to do so . 
Indeed , country after country has now chosen to intervene in one way or another to prevent their currencies from skyrocketing in value . 
Now the IMF has blessed such interventions - but , as a sop to those who are still not convinced , it suggests that they should be used only as a last resort . 
On the contrary , we should have learned from the crisis that financial markets need regulation , and that cross-border capital flows are particularly dangerous . 
Such regulations should be a key part of any system to ensure financial stability ; resorting to them only as a last resort is a recipe for continued instability . 
There is a wide range of available capital-account management tools , and it is best if countries use a portfolio of them . 
Even if they are not fully effective , they are typically far better than nothing . 
But an even more important change is the link that the IMF has finally drawn between inequality and instability . 
This crisis was largely a result of America &apos;s effort to bolster an economy weakened by vastly increased inequality , through low interest rates and lax regulation ( both of which resulted in many people borrowing far beyond their means ) . 
The consequences of this excessive indebtedness will take years to undo . 
But , as another IMF study reminds us , this is not a new pattern . 
The crisis has also put to the test long-standing dogmas that blame labor-market rigidity for unemployment , because countries with more flexible wages , like the US , have fared worse than northern European economies , including Germany . Indeed , as wages weaken , workers will find it even more difficult to pay back what they owe , and problems in the housing market will become worse . 
Consumption will remain restrained , while strong and sustainable recovery cannot be based on another debt-fueled bubble . 
As unequal as America was before the Great Recession , the crisis , and the way it has been managed , has led to even greater income inequality , making a recovery all the more difficult . America is setting itself up for its own version of a Japanese-style malaise . 
But there are ways out of this dilemma : strengthening collective bargaining , restructuring mortgages , using carrots and sticks to get banks to resume lending , restructuring tax and spending policies to stimulate the economy now through long-term investments , and implementing social policies that ensure opportunity for all . 
As it is , with almost one-quarter of all income and 40 % of US wealth going to the top 1 % of income earners , America is now less a &quot; land of opportunity &quot; than even &quot; old &quot; Europe . 
For progressives , these abysmal facts are part of the standard litany of frustration and justified outrage . 
What is new is that the IMF has joined the chorus . 
As Strauss-Kahn concluded in his speech to the Brookings Institution shortly before the Fund &apos;s recent meeting : &quot; Ultimately , employment and equity are building blocks of economic stability and prosperity , of political stability and peace . 
This goes to the heart of the IMF &apos;s mandate . 
It must be placed at the heart of the policy agenda . &quot; 
Strauss-Kahn is proving himself a sagacious leader of the IMF . 
We can only hope that governments and financial markets heed his words .
