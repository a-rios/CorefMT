The New Global Economy &apos;s ( Relative ) Winners 
CAMBRIDGE - The world economy faces considerable uncertainty in the short term . 
Will the eurozone manage to sort out its problems and avert a breakup ? 
Will the United States engineer a path to renewed growth ? 
Will China find a way to reverse its economic slowdown ? 
The answers to these questions will determine how the global economy evolves over the next few years . 
But , regardless of how these immediate challenges are resolved , it is clear that the world economy is entering a difficult new longer-term phase as well - one that will be substantially less hospitable to economic growth than possibly any other period since the end of World War II . 
Regardless of how they handle their current difficulties , Europe and America will emerge with high debt , low growth rates , and contentious domestic politics . 
Even in the best-case scenario , in which the euro remains intact , Europe will be bogged down with the demanding task of rebuilding its frayed union . 
And , in the US , ideological polarization between Democrats and Republicans will continue to paralyze economic policy . 
Indeed , in virtually all advanced economies , high levels of inequality , strains on the middle class , and aging populations will fuel political strife in a context of unemployment and scarce fiscal resources . 
As these old democracies increasingly turn inward , they will become less helpful partners internationally - less willing to sustain the multilateral trading system and more ready to respond unilaterally to economic policies elsewhere that they perceive as damaging to their interests . 
Meanwhile , large emerging markets such as China , India , and Brazil are unlikely to fill the void , as they will remain keen to protect their national sovereignty and room to maneuver . 
As a result , the possibilities for global cooperation on economic and other matters will recede further . 
This is the kind of global environment that diminishes every country &apos;s potential growth . 
The safe bet is that we will not see a return to the kind of growth that the world - especially the developing world - experienced in the two decades before the financial crisis . 
It is an environment that will produce deep disparities in economic performance around the world . 
Those that do relatively better will share three characteristics . 
First , they will not be weighed down by high levels of public debt . 
Second , they will not be overly reliant on the world economy , and their engine of economic growth will be internal rather than external . 
Finally , they will be robust democracies . 
Having low to moderate levels of public debt is important , because debt levels that reach 80-90 % of GDP become a serious drag on economic growth . 
Governments preoccupied with reducing debt are unlikely to undertake the investments needed for long-term structural change . 
With few exceptions ( such as Australia and New Zealand ) , the vast majority of the world &apos;s advanced economies are or will soon be in this category . 
Many emerging-market economies , such as Brazil and Turkey , have managed to rein in the growth of public debt this time around . 
Since private debts have a way of turning into public liabilities , a low government-debt burden might not , in fact , provide these countries with the cushion that they think they have . 
Countries that rely excessively on world markets and global finance to fuel their economic growth will also be at a disadvantage . 
A fragile world economy will not be hospitable to large net foreign borrowers ( or large net foreign lenders ) . 
Countries with large current-account deficits ( such as Turkey ) will remain hostage to skittish market sentiment . 
Those with large surpluses ( such as China ) will be under increasing pressure - including the threat of retaliation - to rein in their &quot; mercantilist &quot; policies . 
Domestic demand-led growth will be a more reliable strategy than export-led growth . 
That means that countries with a large domestic market and a prosperous middle class will have an important advantage . 
Finally , democracies will do better because they have the institutionalized mechanisms of conflict management that authoritarian regimes lack . 
Democracies such as India may seem at times to move too slowly and be prone to paralysis . 
In the absence of such institutions , distributive conflict can easily spill over into protests , riots , and civil disorder . 
This is where democratic India and South Africa have the upper hand over China or Russia . 
Countries that have fallen into the grip of autocratic leaders - for example , Argentina and Turkey - are also increasingly at a disadvantage . 
An important indicator of the magnitude of the new global economy &apos;s challenges is that so few countries satisfy all three requirements . 
Indeed , some of the most spectacular economic success stories of our time - China in particular - fail to meet more than one . 
It will be a difficult time for all . 
But some - think Brazil , India , and South Korea - will be in a better position than the rest .
