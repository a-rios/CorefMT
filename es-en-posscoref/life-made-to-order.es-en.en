Life Made to Order 
MELBOURNE - In the sixteenth century , the alchemist Paracelsus offered a recipe for creating a living being that began with putting sperm into putrefying &quot; venter equinus . &quot; 
This is usually translated as &quot; horse manure , &quot; but the Latin &quot; venter &quot; means abdomen or uterus . 
So occultists now will no doubt have a fine time with the fact that Craig Venter was the driving force behind the team of scientists that last month announced that they had created a synthetic form of life : a bacterium with a genome designed and created from chemicals in a laboratory . 
The new bacterium , nicknamed &quot; Synthia , &quot; replicates and produces proteins . 
By any reasonable definition , it is alive . 
Although it is very similar to a natural bacterium from which it was largely copied , the creators put distinctive strings of DNA into its genome to prove that it is not a natural object . 
These strings spell out , in code , a Web site address , the names of the researchers , and apt quotations , such as Richard Feynman &apos;s &quot; What I cannot build , I cannot understand . &quot; 
For some years now , synthetic biology has been looming as the next big issue in bioethics . 
The scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute expected to be told that they were &quot; playing God , &quot; and they were not disappointed . 
Yes , if one believes that life was created by God , then this comes as close to &quot; playing God &quot; as humans have come , so far . 
Well-known University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Art Caplan says that the achievement ranks as a discovery of historic significance , because it &quot; would seem to extinguish the argument that life requires a special force or power to exist . &quot; 
Asked about the significance of what the team had done , Venter described it as bringing about &quot; a giant philosophical change in how we view life . &quot; 
Others have pointed out that , although the team produced a synthetic genome , they put it into a cell from another bacterium , replacing that cell &apos;s DNA . 
We have yet to build a living organism entirely from bottles of chemicals , so anyone who believes in a &quot; life force &quot; that only a divine being could imbue into inert matter will no doubt continue to believe in it . 
At a more practical level , Venter said , the team &apos;s work has produced &quot; a very powerful set of tools &quot; for redesigning life . 
He has been criticized for the fact that the research was funded by Synthetic Genomics , a company that he cofounded , which will hold the intellectual property rights resulting from the research - and has already filed for 13 patents related to it . 
But the work has taken 20 scientists a decade to complete , at an estimated cost of $ 40 million , and commercial investors are an obvious source for such funds . 
Others object that living things should not be patented . 
That battle was lost in 1980 , when the United States Supreme Court decided that a genetically modified micro-organism designed to clean up oil spills could be patented . 
( Obviously , given the damage caused by the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico , there is still some work to be done on that particular organism . ) 
Patenting life was taken a step further in 1984 , when Harvard University successfully applied for a patent on its &quot; oncomouse , &quot; a laboratory mouse specifically designed to get cancer easily , so that it would be more useful as a research tool . 
There are good grounds for objecting to turning a sentient being into a patented laboratory tool , but it is not so easy to see why patent law should not cover newly designed bacteria or algae , which can feel nothing and may be as useful as any other invention . 
Indeed , Synthia &apos;s very existence challenges the distinction between living and artificial that underlies much of the opposition to &quot; patenting life &quot; - though pointing this out is not to approve the granting of sweeping patents that prevent other scientists from making their own discoveries in this important new field . 
As for the likely usefulness of synthetic bacteria , the fact that Synthia &apos;s birth had to compete for headlines with news of the world &apos;s worst-ever oil spill made the point more effectively than any public-relations effort could have done . 
One day , we may be able to design bacteria that can quickly , safely , and effectively clean up oil spills . 
And , according to Venter , if his team &apos;s new technology had been available last year , it would have been possible to produce a vaccine to protect ourselves against H1N1 influenza in 24 hours , rather than several weeks . 
The most exciting prospect held out by Venter , however , is a form of algae that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to create diesel fuel or gasoline . 
Synthetic Genomics has a $ 600 million agreement with ExxonMobil to obtain fuel from algae . 
Obviously , the release of any synthetic organism must be carefully regulated , just like the release of any genetically modified organism . 
But any risk must be weighed against other grave threats that we face . 
For example , international climate-change negotiations appear to have reached an impasse , and public skepticism about global warming is rising , even as the scientific evidence continues to show that it is real and will endanger the lives of billions of people . 
In such circumstances , the admittedly very real risks of synthetic biology seem decisively outweighed by the hope that it may enable us to avert a looming environmental catastrophe .
