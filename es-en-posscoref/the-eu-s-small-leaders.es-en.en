The EU &apos;s Small Leaders 
The defeat of the EU &apos;s Constitutional Treaty in referendums in France and the Netherlands has , it seems , given rise to a new consensus that further enlargement of the Union should be slowed down , or even stopped . 
Advocates of this position see EU voters as terrified by the consequences of the May 2004 enlargement of the EU , when eight formerly communist states joined , and angry that they were not consulted about it . 
One set of fears concerns the labor market - the so-called &quot; Polish plumber &quot; question . 
In this interpretation , wages were eroded and jobs were lost because of the inflow of poorly qualified and cheap central Europeans . 
Particular cases , such as the elimination of German meat processing and packing jobs , or casual workers in France , were widely discussed as evidence of a new threat . 
But the &quot; Polish plumber &quot; is actually a weak bogeyman . 
First , there had already been a substantial flow of workers before enlargement . 
Poles had worked in some agricultural jobs - in sugar beet and wine harvesting - even during the communist era . 
With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 , labor flows , both legal and illegal , became much greater . 
Second , inflows of new workers bring substantial benefits as well as losses : in France , which suffers a shortage of some 6,000 plumbers , there must be plenty of households that would be pleased to find someone qualified to do repair work . 
Finally , the enlargements of the 1980 &quot; s , when Greece and then Spain and Portugal joined the then European Community , were not very disruptive . 
By themselves , the labor-market implications of poor countries &quot; accession to the EU simply are not very dislocating . 
What makes the debate so passionate in 2005 is a new fear that did not exist in the 1980 &quot; s : that the new members have a different social model , in which workers &quot; rights and the welfare state will be eroded . 
It is not so much the Polish plumber as it is the Slovak 19 % flat tax that is the challenge to the older West European social model and welfare state . 
The EU &apos;s large states feel particularly vulnerable , and it is there that the biggest shock to expectations has occurred . 
In the past , France and Germany were the motors of European integration . 
Now they are the countries that feel most threatened , and bookshops in both countries are full of alarmist and sensational accounts of national decline . 
Germany &apos;s post-1949 Federal Republic was accustomed to being regarded as Europe &apos;s great economic success story , but it never really recovered from the post-unification recession of the early 1990 &quot; s , with growth sluggish to non-existent . 
The consensual society that was at the center of the Federal Republic &apos;s Wirtschaftswunder now looks inflexible , throwing up obstacles to change . 
Germany is surrounded by small states that all seem to be prospering more in today &apos;s geo-political and geo-economic environment . 
These include not only the rapidly growing formerly communist countries to the east , Poland and the Czech Republic , but also Denmark , the Netherlands , Austria , and Switzerland , upon which Germans traditionally looked down . 
Now , as one mordant and widespread slogan puts it , Austria is &quot; the better Germany . &quot; 
Many French writers also express a vivid feeling of national decline , and many ordinary citizens believe that the rules of the global economy work against French national interests . 
In short , the large states still have illusions , encouraged by their political elites , about what the state can do to guide economic development . 
By contrast , the small European states - whether in Eastern or Western Europe - have been much more flexible in responding to the challenges of the modern globalized economy . 
Politics can offer all kinds of goods that voters find very attractive : tax breaks , subsidies , and social benefits . 
But small states are less likely to think that they can create the rules of the game , and accordingly they are more willing and able to make adjustments . 
They are more keenly aware that if they try to redistribute too much , they will simply drive away the factors of production : capital will flow elsewhere , and labor will likewise migrate . 
The same sort of logic applies to the large states : France and Germany are losing skilled labor at the same time as they are drawing in cheaper labor from Eastern Europe . 
The result is that they are feeling less French or German , creating greater political room , on both the left and the right , for nationalist ressentiment . 
In the earlier rounds of European integration , from the 1950 &quot; s to the 1980 &quot; s , the big states received very obvious gains , which their politicians could easily present as such to voters . 
But since 1989 - or since the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1992 - the political dynamic has changed . 
It is now the EU &apos;s smaller states that gain the most from wider and deeper European integration . 
If the large states are to obtain similar gains , and their politicians are to recover voters &quot; respect , their governments will have to accept the small-state logic and abandon the Great Power posturing of the past .
