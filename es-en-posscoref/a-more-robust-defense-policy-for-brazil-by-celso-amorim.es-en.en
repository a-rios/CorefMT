Hardening Brazil &apos;s Soft Power 
BRASILIA - It is , perhaps , a truism for Brazil &apos;s citizens that their country is and always will be a peaceful one . 
After all , Brazil has lived with its ten neighbors without conflict for almost 150 years , having settled its borders through negotiation . 
It last went to war in 1942 , after direct aggression by Nazi U-boats in the South Atlantic . 
It has forsworn nuclear weapons , having signed a comprehensive nuclear-safeguards agreement with Argentina and the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
Through the Common Market of the South ( Mercosur ) and the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) , Brazil is helping to integrate the region politically , economically , socially , and culturally . 
But is soft power enough for one of the world &apos;s major emerging countries ? 
To be sure , Brazil &apos;s peaceful foreign policy has served it well . 
Brazil has used its stature to advance peace and cooperation in South America and beyond . 
Its constructive stance derives from a worldview that accords pride of place to the values of democracy , social justice , economic development , and environmental protection . 
Brazil &apos;s unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power , reflected in the broad international support that placed Brazilians atop international institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization . 
Yet no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests . 
Indeed , in an unpredictable world , where old threats are compounded by new challenges , policymakers cannot disregard hard power . 
By deterring threats to national sovereignty , military power supports peace ; and , in Brazil &apos;s case , it underpins our country &apos;s constructive role in the pursuit of global stability . 
That role is more necessary than ever . 
Over the past two decades , unilateral actions in disregard of the UN Security Council &apos;s primary responsibility in matters of war and peace have led to greater uncertainty and instability . 
Likewise , little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made , in disregard of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
Brazil &apos;s abundance of energy , food , water , and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to , or control of , natural resources . 
In order to meet the challenges of this complex reality , Brazil &apos;s peaceful foreign policy must be supported by a robust defense policy . 
Brazil &apos;s National Defense Strategy , updated in 2012 , states that the modernization of the Armed Forces is intrinsically linked to national development . 
Thus , it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry . 
In accordance with the Strategy , Brazil is enhancing its conventional deterrence capabilities , including by building a nuclear-propelled submarine as part of a naval program commensurate with its responsibilities in the South Atlantic . 
Brazil coordinates closely on defense matters with its neighbors , both bilaterally and through Unasur &apos;s South American Defense Council , which aims to promote confidence-building , transparency , a joint regional defense industry , and , most important , a common defense identity . 
One potential mechanism for advancing these objectives is a South American Defense College , now under consideration . 
South America is becoming a region where war is unthinkable - what the political scientist Karl Deutsch once called a &quot; security community . &quot; 
Having visited every South American country in my tenure as Defense Minister , I am convinced that , the most effective deterrent on the continent is cooperation . 
At the same time , Brazil is pursuing increased bilateral defense cooperation with African partners . 
With our neighbors on both shores of the South Atlantic , Brazil is working closely to strengthen the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic ( ZPCSA ) , which aims to keep the ocean free from rivalries foreign to it and from nuclear weapons . 
Brazil is also reaching out to other emerging countries , such as its fellow BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) and members of the IBSA Dialogue Forum ( India , Brazil , and South Africa ) . 
For example , Brazil conducts IBSAMAR , a regular trilateral naval exercise , with South Africa and India . 
More broadly , we are exploring ways to cooperate in the joint development of defense technologies . 
Through such endeavors , Brazil hopes to contribute to a more balanced international order , one less subject to hegemonies of any kind , without losing sight of the importance of mutually beneficial partnerships with developed countries . 
Even as Brazil hardens its soft power , it remains deeply committed to the path of dialogue , conflict prevention , and the negotiated settlement of disputes . 
The presence of Brazilian peacekeepers in countries like Haiti and Lebanon underscores Brazil &apos;s contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide . 
In the twenty-first century , a truly stable global order will depend on a legitimate and effective UN Security Council , one that reflects the plurality of the emerging multipolar world .
