The IMF Needs a Leader from the Emerging Countries 
Horst Kohler &apos;s resignation as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund offers a unique opportunity to reform the embattled international financial institution . 
What the IMF needs , as a first step towards comprehensive reform , is a new leader with solid technical training , a broad vision , and first hand experience in dealing with the macroeconomic risks faced by emerging and transition economies . 
Mr. Kohler lacked all of these characteristics . 
A gray bureaucrat and a mediocre economist , he was not even Germany &apos;s first choice for the post . 
Unfortunately , instead of getting the best man or woman for the job , politics as usual is likely to prevail . 
The Managing Director position is expected to go to a European . 
Until a few days ago Mr. Rodrigo Rato , Spain &apos;s Finance Minister , appeared to be the front-runner . 
However , now that his Popular Party has been defeated in the Spanish general elections , it is unlikely that he will be Europe &apos;s candidate for the IMF post . 
Yet the fact that Rato was seriously considered shows how wrecked the process is . 
Mr. Rato is an able politician and under his stewardship Spain &apos;s finances have done well . 
However , it would be a stretch to argue that he is the best candidate for the IMF position . 
Mr. Rato is a lawyer by training and has an MBA . 
But he has no experience in crisis management , major economic reforms , or crisis prevention . 
If qualifications have any weight in selecting the next Chief of the IMF , Mr. Rato would not even make the first cut . 
Not surprisingly , the most knowledgeable people on crisis prevention and crisis resolution are in the successful countries of Latin America . 
After decades of instability , a handful of Latin countries - in particular , Chile and Mexico - have become an example of prudence , austerity and macroeconomic stability . 
These Latin American nations have learned the hard way . 
Their leaders understood that to achieve prosperity and social progress , a combination of good economic policies , political realism , and well-funded social programs was required . 
Former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo , a respected economist and currently the Director of Yale &apos;s Center for Globalization , is an excellent candidate for the IMF post . 
Earlier in Zedillo &apos;s career he worked in restructuring Mexico &apos;s debt , and he has a deep understanding of international markets . 
Moreover , during his administration the much-admired Progresa social program to reduce rural poverty was launched . 
Mr. Alejandro Foxley , Chile &apos;s first finance Minister after the return of democracy in 1990 , and one of the architects of the country &apos;s extraordinary economic success , is another ideal candidate to lead the IMF . 
People as different as Joseph Stiglitz , one of the IMF &apos;s most ferocious critics , and Robert Rubin , the former US Secretary of the Treasury have praised Chile &apos;s economic accomplishments . 
The list of Chile &apos;s achievements includes fast economic growth , the halving of poverty in less than a decade , and the management of speculative capital through market-based restrictions on short-term inflows . 
Indeed , Mr. Foxley &apos;s profile is so perfect for the position that people who don &apos;t know him may believe that he is an invention . 
With a doctorate in economics , he is a respected and widely published scholar , an experienced manager , and an able politician who was elected to Chile &apos;s Senate five years ago . 
Mr. Foxley understands the plights of the emerging and transition countries , and at the same time knows first hand that policies aimed at macroeconomic stability have a tremendous pay-off in terms of growth , prosperity and poverty reduction .
