Bubbles in the Broth 
NEW YORK - As below-trend GDP growth and high unemployment continue to afflict most advanced economies , their central banks have resorted to increasingly unconventional monetary policy . 
An alphabet soup of measures has been served up : ZIRP ( zero-interest-rate policy ) ; 
QE ( quantitative easing , or purchases of government bonds to reduce long-term rates when short-term policy rates are zero ) ; 
CE ( credit easing , or purchases of private assets aimed at lowering the private sector &apos;s cost of capital ) ; and FG ( forward guidance , or the commitment to maintain QE or ZIRP until , say , the unemployment rate reaches a certain target ) . 
Some have gone as far as proposing NIPR ( negative-interest-rate policy ) . 
And yet , through it all , growth rates have remained stubbornly low and unemployment rates unacceptably high , partly because the increase in money supply following QE has not led to credit creation to finance private consumption or investment . 
Instead , banks have hoarded the increase in the monetary base in the form of idle excess reserves . 
There is a credit crunch , as banks with insufficient capital do not want to lend to risky borrowers , while slow growth and high levels of household debt have also depressed credit demand . 
As a result , all of this excess liquidity is flowing to the financial sector rather than the real economy . 
Near-zero policy rates encourage &quot; carry trades &quot; - debt-financed investment in higher-yielding risky assets such as longer-term government and private bonds , equities , commodities and currencies of countries with high interest rates . 
The result has been frothy financial markets that could eventually turn bubbly . 
Indeed , the US stock market and many others have rebounded more than 100 % since the lows of 2009 ; issuance of high-yield &quot; junk bonds &quot; is back to its 2007 level ; and interest rates on such bonds are falling . 
Moreover , low interest rates are leading to high and rising home prices - possibly real-estate bubbles - in advanced economies and emerging markets alike , including Switzerland , Sweden , Norway , Germany , France , Hong Kong , Singapore , Brazil , China , Australia , New Zealand , and Canada . 
The collapse from 2007 to 2009 of equity , credit , and housing bubbles in the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Iceland , and Dubai led to severe financial crises and economic damage . 
So , are we at risk of another cycle of financial boom and bust ? 
Some policymakers - like Janet Yellen , who is likely to be confirmed as the next Chair of the US Federal Reserve - argue that we should not worry too much . 
Central banks , they argue , now have two goals : restoring robust growth and low unemployment with low inflation , and maintaining financial stability without bubbles . 
Moreover , they have two instruments to achieve these goals : the policy interest rate , which will be kept low for long and raised only gradually to boost growth ; and macro-prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system ( macro-pru for short ) , which will be used to control credit and prevent bubbles . 
But some critics , like Fed Governor Jeremy Stein , argue that macro-pru policies to control credit and leverage - such as limits on loan-to-value ratios for mortgages , bigger capital buffers for banks that extend risky loans , and tighter underwriting standards - may not work . 
Not only are they untested , but restricting leverage in some parts of the banking system would merely cause the liquidity from zero rates to flow to other parts of it , while trying to restrict leverage entirely would simply drive the liquidity into the less-regulated shadow banking system . 
According to Stein , only monetary policy ( higher policy interest rates ) &quot; gets in all of the cracks &quot; of the financial system and prevents asset bubbles . 
The trouble is that if macro-pru does not work , the interest rate would have to serve two opposing goals : economic recovery and financial stability . 
If policymakers go slow on raising rates to encourage faster economic recovery , they risk causing the mother of all asset bubbles , eventually leading to a bust , another massive financial crisis , and a rapid slide into recession . 
But if they try to prick bubbles early on with higher interest rates , they will crash bond markets and kill the recovery , causing much economic and financial damage . 
So , unless macro-pru works as planned , policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don &apos;t . 
For now , policymakers in countries with frothy credit , equity , and housing markets have avoided raising policy rates , given slow economic growth . 
But it is still too early to tell whether the macro-pru policies on which they are relying will ensure financial stability . 
If not , policymakers will eventually face an ugly tradeoff : kill the recovery to avoid risky bubbles , or go for growth at the risk of fueling the next financial crisis . 
For now , with asset prices continuing to rise , many economies may have had as much soup as they can stand .
