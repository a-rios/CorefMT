A False Alarm About China 
MANILA - To hear some pundits tell it , China &apos;s economic miracle - one that lifted 300 million people out of poverty and shifted the world &apos;s geopolitical center of gravity - is coming to a tumultuous end . 
The volatile stock market and the renminbi &apos;s &quot; surprise &quot; depreciation are signs of imminent economic collapse , according to this view , as risky investments and high levels of government debt put the brakes on decades of turbo-charged output growth . 
Fortunately , there is little reason to believe such dire predictions , or that the market gyrations that have been driving recent headlines represent anything more than short-term volatility . 
After all , equity-price movements are a poor predictor of the real economy &apos;s performance . 
Indeed , when Chinese GDP was growing strongly during 2010-2013 , stock prices were falling . 
More recently , when stock prices began soaring during the first half of 2015 , the economy &apos;s slowdown had already begun . 
As the American economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped , &quot; The stock market has called nine of the last five recessions . &quot; 
China &apos;s growth has slowed largely as a result of changes in its fundamentals : less favorable demographics , a shift in emphasis from exports and public investment to the service sector and domestic consumption , and lower demand from advanced economies . 
But China &apos;s past success also contributed to this slowdown , in the form of higher wages , which narrow the scope for rapid growth based on low-cost labor and technological catch-up . 
Additional signs of weakness , including soft data on exports and investment , emerged in the first half of 2015 . 
But other important indicators - like retail sales and housing - show upticks . 
And , perhaps most important , the country &apos;s labor market remains healthy , creating some 7.2 million new urban jobs - many of them in services - in the first half of 2015 . 
Meanwhile , wage growth remains strong and uninterrupted . 
China &apos;s growth rate may be lower than 7 % this year , but I do not believe that it will end up very far from the government &apos;s target of &quot; about 7 % . &quot; 
The volatility in equity prices in recent months has more to do with the peculiarities of China &apos;s stock markets than with the country &apos;s underlying economic fundamentals . 
In more developed economies , such as the United States and Europe , many institutional investors - who tend to be focused on long-term fundamentals - help stabilize stock markets . 
By contrast , the Chinese markets are dominated by retail investors , who are more likely to pursue short-term gains and engage in momentum trading , thereby exacerbating volatility and creating a greater disconnect between equity prices and real economic growth . 
Moreover , the firms listed on China &apos;s stock exchanges are not representative of the country &apos;s companies . 
Majority state-owned firms account for two-thirds of the market value of the country &apos;s exchanges , for example , though they are responsible for no more than one-third of Chinese GDP and an even smaller share of employment . 
The rise and fall of the Chinese stock market should also be understood in the context of Chinese households &quot; limited options for storing savings . 
The run-up in prices took place at a time when deposit interest rates were officially capped . 
When the alternatives are few and provide only low returns , the equity market looks more attractive , especially if - as was the case - the country &apos;s major newspapers are running bullish editorials about stock prices . 
More recent developments may have contributed to the downward pressure on prices , including discussion about abolishing interest-rate ceilings on deposits ( the cap on term deposits of one year or more was removed on August 25 ) . 
The greater ease with which wealthy households can move savings out of the country , along with an anticipated increase in interest rates in the United States , was likely another contributing factor . 
Furthermore , as Harvard &apos;s Jeffrey Frankel has pointed out , regulators increased margin requirements several times this year , making it harder to buy stocks with borrowed money . 
And , as with all stock markets , shifts in sentiment that are not connected to fundamentals can also drive volatility . 
Whether China &apos;s economy can continue to grow rapidly will depend far more on its ability to reform than on how its stock markets perform . 
If China is to thrive in the long term , raising its aggregate productivity is key . 
This means that it will need to overhaul its state-owned firms and the financial sector so that resources can flow to the most productive investment projects . 
Lowering the tax burden on firms - including the payroll tax - would also be useful . 
Reforms that increase the flexibility of the labor market are also in order . 
While China used to have a relatively flexible labor market in the manufacturing sector , firms &quot; reallocation of workers based on market needs has become more difficult in recent years . 
Greater flexibility might not stimulate short-term growth , but it would improve resilience to future negative shocks , whether they originate at home or abroad . 
As long as China continues to pursue pro-market reforms , it will remain the largest single-country contributor to global GDP growth over the medium term - unperturbed by stock-market volatility . 
If reforms stall , falling stock prices are likely to be the least of China &apos;s worries .
