Underinvesting in Resilience 
NEW YORK - The hurricane on America &apos;s eastern seaboard last week ( which I experienced in lower Manhattan ) adds to a growing collection of extreme weather events from which lessons should be drawn . 
Climate experts have long argued that the frequency and magnitude of such events are increasing , and evidence of this should certainly influence precautionary steps - and cause us to review such measures regularly . 
There are two distinct and crucial components of disaster preparedness . 
The one that understandably gets the most attention is the capacity to mount a rapid and effective response . 
Such a capacity will always be necessary , and few doubt its importance . 
When it is absent or deficient , the loss of life and livelihoods can be horrific - witness Hurricane Katrina , which ravaged Haiti and New Orleans in 2005 . 
The second component comprises investments that minimize the expected damage to the economy . 
This aspect of preparedness typically receives far less attention . 
Indeed , in the United States , lessons from the Katrina experience appear to have strengthened response capacity , as shown by the rapid and effective intervention following Hurricane Sandy . 
But investments designed to control the extent of damage seem to be persistently neglected . 
Redressing this imbalance requires a focus on key infrastructure . 
Of course , one cannot at reasonable cost prevent all possible damage from calamities , which strike randomly and in locations that cannot always be predicted . 
But certain kinds of damage have large multiplier effects . 
This includes damage to critical systems like the electricity grid and the information , communication , and transport networks that constitute the platform on which modern economies run . 
Relatively modest investments in the resilience , redundancy , and integrity of these systems pay high dividends , albeit at random intervals . 
Redundancy is the key . 
The case of New York City is instructive . 
The southern part of Manhattan was without power for almost a full workweek , apparently because a major substation hub in the electrical grid , located beside the East River , was knocked out in a fiery display when Hurricane Sandy and a tidal surge caused it to flood . 
There was no pre-built workaround to deliver power by an alternate route . 
The cost of this power failure , though difficult to calculate , is surely huge . 
Unlike the economic boost that may occur from recovery spending to restore damaged physical assets , this is a deadweight loss . 
Local power outages may be unavoidable , but one can create grids that are less vulnerable - and less prone to bringing large parts of the economy to a halt - by building in redundancy . 
Similar lessons were learned with respect to global supply chains , following the earthquake and tsunami that hit northeast Japan in 2011 . 
Global supply chains are now becoming more resilient , owing to the duplication of singular bottlenecks that can bring much larger systems down . 
Cyber security experts rightly worry about the possibility of bringing an entire economy to a halt by attacking and disabling the control systems in its electrical , communication , and transportation networks . 
Admittedly , the impact of natural disasters is less systemic ; but if a calamity takes out key components of networks that lack redundancy and backup , the effects are similar . 
Even rapid response is more effective if key networks and systems - particularly the electricity grid - are resilient . 
Why do we tend to underinvest in the resilience of our economies &quot; key systems ? 
One argument is that redundancy looks like waste in normal times , with cost-benefit calculations ruling out higher investment . 
That seems clearly wrong : Numerous expert estimates indicate that built-in redundancy pays off unless one assigns unrealistically low probabilities to disruptive events . 
That leads to a second and more plausible explanation , which is psychological and behavioral in character . 
We have a tendency to underestimate both the probabilities and consequences of what in the investment world are called &quot; left-tailed events . &quot; 
Compounding this pattern are poor incentives . 
Principals , be they investors or voters , determine the incentives of agents , be they asset managers or elected officials and policymakers . 
If principals misunderstand systemic risk , their agents , even if they do understand it , may not be able to respond without losing support , whether in the form of votes or assets under management . 
Another line of reasoning is that businesses that depend heavily on continuity - for example , hospitals , outsourcing firms in India , and stock exchanges - will invest in their own backup systems . 
In fact , they do . 
But that ignores a host of issues concerning the mobility , safety , and housing of employees . 
A broad pattern of self-insurance caused by underinvestment in resilient infrastructure is an inefficient and distinctly inferior option . 
Underinvestment in infrastructure ( including deferred maintenance ) is widespread where the consequences are uncertain and / or not immediate . 
In reality , underinvestment and investment with debt financing are equivalent in one crucial respect : they both transfer costs to a future cohort . 
But even debt financing would be better than no investment at all , given the deadweight losses . 
Cities and countries that aspire to be hubs or critical components in national or global financial and economic systems need to be predictable , reliable , and resilient . 
That implies a transparent rule of law , and competent , conservative , and countercyclical macroeconomic management . 
But it also includes physical resilience and the ability to withstand shocks . 
Hubs that lack resilience create cascades of collateral damage when they fail . 
Over time , they will be bypassed and replaced by more resilient alternatives .
