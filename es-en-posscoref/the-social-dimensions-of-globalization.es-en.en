The Social Dimensions of Globalization 
The war on terrorism and in Iraq has distracted much of the world &apos;s attention from the pressing issue of how globalization should be managed so that it benefits everyone . 
A new report , issued by the International Labor Organization &apos;s Commission on the Social Dimensions of Globalization , reminds us how far the Bush administration is out of line with the global consensus . 
The ILO is a tripartite organization with representatives of labor , government , and business . 
The Commission , chaired by the presidents of Finland and Tanzania , has 24 members ( of whom I was one ) drawn from different nationalities , interests groups , and intellectual persuasions , including members as diverse as the head of Toshiba and the leader of the AFL-CIO . 
Yet this very heterogeneous group was able to crystallize the emerging global consensus that globalization , despite its positive potential , has not only failed to live up to that potential , but has actually contributed to social distress . 
The fault lies with how globalization has been managed - partly by countries , but most importantly , by the international community , including institutions like the World Bank , World Trade Organization , and the IMF , which are responsible for establishing the &quot; rules of the game . &quot; 
The Commission even reached consensus on a number of concrete measures to help put a &quot; human face &quot; on globalization - or at least mitigate some of its worst effects . 
The gap between the emerging consensus on globalization , which this report reflects , and the Bush administration &apos;s international economic policies help explain today &apos;s widespread hostility towards America &apos;s government . 
Consider two issues that have been part of recent bilateral trade agreements pushed aggressively by the Bush administration . 
The crises in East Asia and the recent recessions in Latin America show that premature capital market liberalization can result in enormous economic volatility , increasing poverty , and destruction of the middle class . 
Even the IMF now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries . 
Yet , whether driven by narrow ideology or responding to the demands of special interests , the Bush administration is still demanding an extreme form of such liberalization in its bilateral trade agreements . 
The second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions ( TRIPs ) of the Uruguay Round of trade talks , dictated by America &apos;s pharmaceutical and entertainment industries . 
These provisions restricted countries from making generic imitations of drugs , making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries . 
Spearheaded by worries about AIDS , activists around the world demanded that something be done . 
Just before last year &apos;s trade talks in Cancun , the US made some concessions , so that it was no longer the only holdout . 
In its bilateral trade agreements , however , the US is demanding what is becoming known as &quot; TRIPs plus , &quot; which would strengthen intellectual property rights further , to ensure that countries only have the right to produce inexpensive generic drugs during epidemics and other emergencies . 
The global consensus , reflected in the Commission report , calls for more exceptions , so that , say , drugs can be made available in any case where to do so could save a life . 
To those confronting the prospect of death , what matters is access to life-saving drugs , not whether what is killing the person is part of an epidemic . 
Bilateral agreements form the basis of enhanced ties of friendship between countries . 
But America &apos;s intransigence in this area is sparking protests in countries facing the &quot; threat &quot; of such an agreement , such as Morocco , and is forming the basis of long-lasting resentment . 
The Commission highlights other issues that have received insufficient global attention - such as tax competition among developing countries , which shifts more of the tax burden from business to workers . 
In still other areas , the Commission &apos;s report argues for more &quot; balanced &quot; perspectives . 
On exchange rates , for example , it is more sympathetic towards mixed systems - in contrast to the traditional belief that countries must choose between the extremes of a completely flexible system and a hard peg ( of the kind that contributed so importantly to Argentina &apos;s woes ) . 
As this example shows , bringing different voices to the table in discussions of globalization brings new perspectives . 
Until now , the main worry for most experts on globalization has been excessive government intervention in the economy . 
The Commission fears just the opposite . 
It argues that the state has a role to play in cushioning individuals and society from the impact of rapid economic change . 
The way that globalization has been managed , however , has eroded the ability of the state to play its proper role . 
At the root of this problem is the global political system - if such it can be called . 
Key players like the IMF and World Bank must become more transparent and their voting structures must be changed to reflect the current distribution of economic power - as opposed to that prevailing in 1945 - let alone to reflect basic democratic principles . 
Whatever one thinks of the many concrete suggestions made by the Commission , this much is clear : we need a more inclusive debate about globalization , one in which more voices are heard , and in which there is more focus on the social dimensions of globalization . 
This is a message the world would do well to heed , lest discontent with globalization continue to grow .
