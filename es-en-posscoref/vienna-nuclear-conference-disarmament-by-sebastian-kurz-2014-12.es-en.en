The Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons 
VIENNA - In 1983 , three years before I was born , a chilling television docudrama about the consequences of a nuclear war was broadcast around the world . 
The Day After , now cited as the highest-rated film in TV history , left then-US President Ronald Reagan &quot; greatly depressed &quot; and caused him to rethink his nuclear strategy . 
At their summit in Reykjavik in October 1986 , he and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev came tantalizingly close to eliminating all nuclear weapons . 
My generation has conveniently consigned such fears to history . 
Indeed , with the Cold War tensions of 1983 far in the past and the international order dramatically changed , many people nowadays ask why these memories should concern us at all . 
But the premise of that question is both wrong and dangerous . 
This week , Austria is providing the world an opportunity to rethink its complacency . 
On December 8-9 , representatives from the governments of more than 150 countries , international organizations , and civil-society groups will meet in Vienna , to consider the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons . 
These weapons , which terrified people 30 years ago , still remain in countries &quot; arsenals and continue to pose a grave risk to human security and safety . 
Austria &apos;s concern is that as long as nuclear weapons exist , the risk of their use exists , either by accident or design . 
An overwhelming majority of states share this view . 
Consider how many nuclear weapons there are : an estimated 16,300 around the world , with 1,800 on high alert and ready for use on short notice . 
Nearly 25 years after the Cold War &apos;s end , we remain stuck with its strategic legacy : Nuclear weapons continue to underpin the international security policy of the world &apos;s most powerful states . 
There are too many risks - human error , technical flaws , negligence , cyber attacks , and more - to believe that these weapons will never be used . 
Nor is there good reason to believe that adequate fail-safe mechanisms are in place . 
The history of nuclear weapons since 1945 is studded with near misses - both before and after the Cuban missile crisis . 
On more than one occasion , the actions of plucky individuals , applying their intelligence against orders , saved us from catastrophe . 
For example , in 1983 , the Soviet Union &apos;s nuclear early-warning system reported , not once but twice , the launch of US missiles . 
Fortunately , Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov of the Soviet Air Defense Forces recognized these as false alarms , preventing a mistaken nuclear retaliation . 
It is remarkable that the world has avoided disaster thus far . 
Why continue to push our luck ? 
Since 2012 , when the humanitarian impact initiative was conceived , most countries have stepped up to support it , owing to their anxiety and frustration at the snail-like pace of disarmament . 
Still , one might legitimately ask whether world leaders shouldn &apos;t first focus their attention on other problems , such as climate change and sustainable development . 
In fact , like past generations &quot; loading of the earth &apos;s atmosphere with carbon , nuclear weapons represent a legacy to overcome . 
But nuclear weapons , unusable and extremely expensive to maintain , are low-hanging fruit - a risk that we can easily grasp and eliminate . 
Enticing the nuclear-weapon states to give up their arsenals will not be easy . 
As long as some states possess them , other states will be led by envy or fear to desire their own . 
But the status quo reflects yesterday &apos;s thinking . 
Acknowledgement that these Cold War relics are outmoded security tools - indeed , that they cause insecurity - is coming from a diverse range of voices . 
Thirty years ago , The Day After galvanized a president . 
The goal of next week &apos;s Vienna conference is to provide the public with new and updated evidence of the impact of using nuclear weapons . 
The picture is even grimmer and the consequences more dire than we believed in 1983 . 
As long as nuclear weapons exist , it is irresponsible not to confront the implications of their use - implications for which there is no antidote or insurance policy . 
They are not some deadly virus or long-term environmental threat . 
They are the poisonous fruit of a technology that we created - and that we can and must control .
