America Shoots Itself 
One of the casualties of the war against terrorism - or , rather , of the way the United States is conducting the war - is the US influence in promoting human rights worldwide . 
For the international human rights movement , this is a severe setback . 
For more than a quarter of a century , ever since advancing human rights internationally became an explicit and avowed goal of US foreign policy under President Jimmy Carter , American influence played a leading role in mitigating abuses . 
The consequences were most profound in what were the countries of the Soviet empire , but they extended to other regions as well . 
Even where the US supported regimes that committed grave violations of rights - or served as an apologist for them because other national interests took precedence - it was often possible for the human rights movement to embarrass Washington by making it the surrogate villain for its clients &apos; abuses . 
In the 1980 &apos;s , this approach focused attention on abuses in conflict-ridden Central America and in Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq , which the Reagan Administration favored in its struggle with America &apos;s enemy , Ayatollah Khomeini &apos;s Iran . 
It thus sometimes achieved indirectly what could not be done directly : the leveraging of American influence to promote human rights . 
But America &apos;s capacity to promote human rights in other countries has never been weaker than now . 
One reason is the tremendous increase in anti-Americanism since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
This is largely due to a widespread perception of American arrogance . 
Despite ( or because of ) its insistence that all who are not with America are against it , the Bush administration alienated many who previously counted themselves either as friends of the US or did not take sides . 
At the same time , rising anti-Americanism preceded the US response to the terrorist attacks . 
The Bush team was outspoken in its hostility to a range of international agreements , from the Kyoto Treaty to reduce global warming to the establishment of the International Criminal Court . 
Whatever goodwill towards the US prevailed after September 11 was quickly squandered . 
The Bush administration proclaimed a national security policy that insists that America provides the only sustainable model for national success , and asserted its right to engage in unilateral , preemptive military strikes . 
It treated the UN Security Council with disdain in its rush to war in Iraq , invoking justifications that have not stood up to scrutiny . 
Since then , it has continued to insist that its arguments for invading Iraq are beyond criticism , while making a mess of the postwar administration by refusing to share authority . 
The other major reason that America is losing its effectiveness as a promoter of human rights is a widespread perception of hypocrisy . 
Even before the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington , America &apos;s image as a rights proponent had been tarnished , particularly in Europe , by its continued practice of capital punishment and , to a lesser degree , by its high incarceration rate - approximately seven times the average in the European Union &apos;s fifteen member countries . 
Since September 2001 , the cause for concern has grown dramatically . 
Much international attention has focused on the USA Patriot Act &apos;s sanctioning of grave violations of civil liberties , and on the subsequent treatment of thousands of immigrants - particularly south Asian Muslims - who have faced secret detention and deportation . 
Above all , the rest of the world has looked on with alarm as the US holds more than 600 men at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba without access to family or counsel , and without prospect of an impartial hearing or trial . 
In some instances , reports of rights violations in the US are exaggerated . 
But this is an inevitable consequence of the Bush administration &apos;s own haughty manner , with leading spokespersons , such as Attorney General John Ashcroft , proclaiming their own righteousness in leading the effort to abrogate rights . 
Ashcroft is much less known internationally than Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , but he is an even match in arousing dislike for the US among those who do know him . 
Unfortunately , there is no ready substitute for the US as a force for advancing human rights internationally . 
The UN has been useful as a forum for adopting standards , but its machinery for seeking compliance with those standards is weak and has been badly compromised over the years by its failure to address grotesque abuses . 
The choice of Libya to chair the UN Human Rights Commission adds insult to injury . 
Some European governments have evolved strong human rights polices but , for a variety of reasons , they have been unable , individually or collectively , to exert the influence of the US . 
Fortunately , while this is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future , the international human rights movement is not completely without resources . 
Its own prestige is high : groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are respected voices , to whom many governments feel obliged to pay attention . 
There is also the promise of new institutions . 
In cases of extreme rights abuses , the chance that an international criminal tribunal will ultimately sit in judgment of those principally responsible is growing , thereby becoming a deterrent to would-be tyrants elsewhere . 
America should take note .
