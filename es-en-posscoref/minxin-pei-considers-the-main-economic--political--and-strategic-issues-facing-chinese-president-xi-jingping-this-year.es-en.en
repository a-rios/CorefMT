China &apos;s Three Challenges in 2014 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - Since ascending to the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s top post in November 2012 , Xi Jinping has confounded observers . 
While his political strategy has entailed tightening the CCP &apos;s control over ideology , cracking down on official corruption , repressing dissent , and championing a more nationalistic foreign policy , he has announced an unusually bold economic-reform blueprint . 
The world will soon find out whether Xi &apos;s politically conservative course is intended to facilitate his pro-market economic reforms . 
Having spent 2013 consolidating his position and formulating his agenda , this year Xi will have to begin delivering on his promises and demonstrating that he is as capable of applying power as he is at accumulating it . 
His success will depend on how he addresses three major challenges . 
The first challenge confronting Xi in 2014 is undoubtedly implementation of his economic-reform package , which has aroused both excitement and skepticism since it was unveiled in mid-November . 
Optimists point to the package &apos;s ambitious goals as evidence of Xi &apos;s commitment to reform , while critics cite its vagueness and lack of a specific timetable as grounds for caution . 
In order to prove the skeptics wrong , Xi must translate rhetoric into policy , and policies into concrete , measurable results . 
This means starting the new year by implementing reforms that require only administrative action , such as granting licenses to private banks , increasing competition by removing barriers to entry for private firms , liberalizing interest and exchange rates , and extending residency rights to migrant laborers in small cities and towns . 
Xi will have to follow these measures with legislation that formalizes some of the most critical reforms . 
Xi &apos;s agenda offers only vague promises of increased property rights for farmers , while recent government pronouncements indicate that the bureaucracy wants to restrict such rights . 
In this context , Xi must convince the public that he will not allow vested interests to block change . 
The second major challenge that Xi faces in 2014 is sustaining his highly popular - and hugely risky - anti-corruption campaign . 
Given that Xi has ruled out mobilizing the Chinese public to support his reform plans , his only means of forcing the bureaucracy to comply with his agenda is the threat of corruption investigations and prosecutions . 
But this strategy will be difficult to execute , owing not only to the vast scale of corruption , but also to its critical role in distributing rents among factions and interest groups . 
An anti-corruption campaign that targets a large number of Chinese officials is likely to result in alienation , discontent , and division among the ruling elites . 
The real litmus test of Xi &apos;s intentions will be whether his government prosecutes Zhou Yongkang , a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee , the CCP &apos;s highest policymaking body . 
According to official reports , Xi &apos;s anti-graft noose has been tightening around Zhou since the arrest of many of his former lieutenants . 
But prosecuting even a retired member of the Politburo Standing Committee would break a long-standing taboo . 
Beginning with Deng Xiaoping , the post-Mao regime has worked hard to ensure the physical security of its top officials , thereby avoiding Mao &apos;s mistake of turning internal power struggles into life-and-death contests in which nobody is safe . 
Thus , while ordinary Politburo members have been targeted in the past ( three have been imprisoned ) , members of its Standing Committee have been off limits . 
So now Xi faces a dilemma . 
If he abides by the unwritten rule against prosecuting even former Standing Committee members , he risks undermining the credibility of his anti-corruption campaign . 
But if he puts his former colleague in jail , he could undermine cohesion among China &apos;s top leadership . 
The third challenge that Xi faces is avoiding an unnecessary conflict with Japan . 
China &apos;s recent announcement of an Air Defense Identification Zone covering the disputed Senkaku Islands ( called the Diaoyu Islands in China ) , followed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine , suggest that the bilateral relationship - already at its lowest point in 40 years - will continue to deteriorate . 
Xi and his advisers should not succumb to the illusory belief that such a conflict would boost their standing with the Chinese public . 
Japan , with its US backing , would inflict a humiliating military defeat on China . 
With his political future depending on his ability to deliver on his reform promises , the last thing Xi needs is a foreign-policy distraction - let alone a disastrous military misadventure . 
The stakes are high for Xi and China in 2014 . 
That means the stakes are high for the rest of the world as well .
