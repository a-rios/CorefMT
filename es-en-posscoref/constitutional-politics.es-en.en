Constitutional Politics 
A cynic might be tempted to say that when politicians run out of ideas , they turn to making or changing the constitution . 
Take the European Union . 
Its last big project was the single market as conceived by Jacques Delors , the European Commission &apos;s then-President . 
That project has still not been completed , but the missing bits are a continuing process , not a new idea . 
Since then , the EU has tried a little of this and a little of that : a little common economic policy around the introduction of the Euro , a little common foreign policy around the Iraq war . 
None of it has been very successful . 
Indeed , none of it has an advocate of the stature of Delors . 
So the EU turned to constitution making . 
It set up a Convention , which produced a draft treaty , and soon an Intergovernmental Conference will try to take the project to a conclusion . 
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany liked the idea so much that he is now thinking of setting up his own Convention to review Germany &apos;s constitutional arrangements . 
His target-agreed with the other main parties-is the precarious relationship between Federal authority ( notably the power of the purse ) and that of the Länder and local governments . 
Perhaps the German Chancellor hopes that in the shadows of such an all-party Convention he can quietly slip through &quot; reforms &quot; that are , for the most part , really cuts in public expenditure for social services . 
The case of Prime Minister Tony Blair of the UK is even more extreme . 
The inventor of New Labour would like to be remembered as the man who squared the circle of sustainable economic growth and a reformed welfare state , the man who reconciled wealth creation and social cohesion . 
But the British economy is in a precarious state , and public services remain a mess . 
What has changed under New Labour &apos;s rule is the British constitution . 
Scotland has a parliament , Wales an assembly . 
English regions may soon follow . 
London and other cities have directly elected mayors . 
Ancient institutions , notably the House of Lords , have been &quot; modernized . &quot; 
The judicial system has seen root and branch change . 
In fact , Blair is reportedly not very interested in these changes , but it is they-not some beacon of British prosperity and social justice-that are his lasting legacy . 
Other European leaders could be added to the list , not least Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy . 
In all these cases , the cynic would be half-right . 
Constitutional change is for political leaders a welcome distraction from the much more change-resistant issues of social policy . 
But there are at least two exceptions to this suspicion . 
One is the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in countries that have recently emerged from dictatorship . 
The process requires constitution making of an often complex and painful kind . 
The most recent example is Turkey , where a courageous prime minister has confirmed the secular ( rather than Islamist ) rule of law , sought to modernize the economy , and has kept the military out of the Cabinet . 
Turkey wants desperately to be accepted into the EU , whose &quot; Copenhagen criteria , &quot; approved in 1993 , define what may be called the constitutional prerequisites of membership . 
The accession countries of East Central Europe all fulfilled the criteria ; 
Turkey is now following their example . 
The other serious issue of a constitutional nature is that of levels of government . 
In a globalized world environment , the question of who is responsible for what has become as opaque-if not unanswerable-as it is urgent . 
This is all the more true in view of the fact that the migration of decisions to an ill-defined global space is being accompanied by a widespread demand for more direct forms of democracy that can bring decisions closer to people , regions , and local communities . 
There are as yet no &quot; Copenhagen criteria &quot; to guide constitution-makers here . 
Britain is a good example of the confusions that attend mere pragmatism . 
Scotland may have a new ( and expensive ) government , but what about the English regions ? 
Are the East Midlands really an appropriate unit of self-government ? 
In Germany the issue is the distribution of tax revenue . 
Central government can easily starve the regions and local communities of their lifeblood . 
Who is to prevent it from doing so ? 
In France and Spain there are small but effective ( and sometimes violent ) regional movements . 
Should the rest of the country simply give in to them ? 
Where lies the right answer between a Scottish solution and a Chechen non-solution ? 
The point of asking such questions is to remind ourselves that genuine constitutional politics requires serious thought and careful preparation . 
It must never be a substitute for the absence of other ideas . 
In that sense , Conventions such as the one led by former French President Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing for Europe are a good idea . 
They just might dissuade politicians who are bereft of ideas from indulging in pet projects that lead nowhere .
