Can the G-8 Survive St. Petersburg ? 
Russia &apos;s gradual inclusion in the G-8 was supposed to nurture the growth of democracy , foster creation of a free-market economy , and encourage constructive behavior in international relations . 
Instead , Russia &apos;s leaders have become more interested in consolidating state power at home and abroad than in promoting democracy , protecting human rights , and cooperating with the West . 
The collapse of the USSR , President Vladimir Putin has proclaimed , was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century . 
Obviously , the USSR is not about to be resurrected . 
Moreover , Russia is coming to the fore , firmly and confidently , to regain its Great Power status . 
Putin continues to pursue a brutal military campaign in Chechnya while intervening politically in Soviet successor states like Ukraine , Georgia , Moldova , and Belarus and rejecting Western tactics aimed at curbing Iran &apos;s and North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Putin &apos;s position is reinforced by strong public support , as well as by the dramatically weakened position of major Western leaders . 
George W. Bush and Tony Blair have lost the popularity they enjoyed before the Iraq war , and Blair , together with French President Jacques Chirac , will soon leave the political scene . 
Angela Merkel in Germany and Romano Prodi in Italy are ruling with weak coalition governments . 
In these circumstances , given Russia &apos;s continuing failure to meet the G-8 &quot; s political and economic standards , the upcoming summit in St. Petersburg could produce a backlash , eroding the legitimacy , credibility , and relevance of the world &apos;s most developed countries . 
Indeed , Russia and the world may well see in the summit the G-8 &quot; s silent approval of Putin &apos;s domestic and foreign policies . 
Clearly , there are many who would endorse former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s recent call on Western countries to stop pressuring Putin over human rights . 
According to Gorbachev , Western pressure merely strengthens Putin , &quot; because in essence his position is very close to the aspirations of the people . &quot; 
Bush has echoed that sentiment , telling CNN ahead of his trip to the summit that admonishing the Russian president in public on matters such as democracy and human rights would be counterproductive . 
But can the West afford to remain aloof ? 
Russia started off its year as G-8 president with a crisis over gas supplies to Ukraine , and even threatened Europe with rerouting its gas exports to Asia . 
Putin has placed energy security at the top of the summit &apos;s agenda , but that does not mask Russia &apos;s ambition to dominate European markets by controlling the pipelines that carry its oil and gas , the refineries that process it , and the retail outlets that sell it . 
The dilemma facing the West is that it needs Russia &apos;s backing not only on policy toward Iran and North Korea , but also in Afghanistan , Iraq , and the Middle East as a whole . 
Unfortunately , Bush &apos;s strategy of democracy promotion has mainly contributed to unease around the world and alienation from Western goals . 
Especially in view of the Iraq experience , Putin has won substantial public sympathy by arguing that opposition to Western democracy promotion is resistance not to democracy itself , but to Western intervention against Russian &quot; sovereign democracy . &quot; 
Clearly , an ostracized Russia is a dangerous Russia . 
Bush and European leaders issued a statement after their recent meeting in Austria saying that Russia must honor &quot; democratic freedoms , respect for human rights , civil society and transparency , and a responsible approach to energy security . &quot; 
But words alone are not enough . 
Nor should it be the end of the story .
