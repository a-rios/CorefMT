The Free-Trade Charade 
NEW YORK - Though nothing has come of the World Trade Organization &apos;s Doha Development Round of global trade negotiations since they were launched almost a dozen years ago , another round of talks is in the works . 
Are the coming talks likely to be more successful ? 
The Doha Round was torpedoed by the United States &quot; refusal to eliminate agricultural subsidies - a sine qua non for any true development round , given that 70 % of those in the developing world depend on agriculture directly or indirectly . 
The US position was truly breathtaking , given that the WTO had already judged that America &apos;s cotton subsidies - paid to fewer than 25,000 rich farmers - were illegal . 
America &apos;s response was to bribe Brazil , which had brought the complaint , not to pursue the matter further , leaving in the lurch millions of poor cotton farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and India , who suffer from depressed prices because of America &apos;s largesse to its wealthy farmers . 
Given this recent history , it now seems clear that the negotiations to create a free-trade area between the US and Europe , and another between the US and much of the Pacific ( except for China ) , are not about establishing a true free-trade system . 
Instead , the goal is a managed trade regime - managed , that is , to serve the special interests that have long dominated trade policy in the West . 
There are a few basic principles that those entering the discussions will , one hopes , take to heart . 
First , any trade agreement has to be symmetrical . 
If , as part of the &quot; Trans-Pacific Partnership &quot; ( TPP ) , the US demands that Japan eliminate its rice subsidies , the US should , in turn , offer to eliminate its production ( and water ) subsidies , not just on rice ( which is relatively unimportant in the US ) but on other agricultural commodities as well . 
Second , no trade agreement should put commercial interests ahead of broader national interests , especially when non-trade-related issues like financial regulation and intellectual property are at stake . 
Other trade agreements have insisted on financial liberalization and deregulation as well , even though the 2008 crisis should have taught us that the absence of good regulation can jeopardize economic prosperity . 
America &apos;s pharmaceutical industry , which wields considerable clout with the office of the US Trade Representative ( USTR ) , has succeeded in foisting on other countries an unbalanced intellectual-property regime , which , designed to fight generic drugs , puts profit ahead of saving lives . 
Even the US Supreme Court has now said that the US Patent Office went too far in granting patents on genes . 
Finally , there must be a commitment to transparency . 
But those engaging in these trade negotiations should be forewarned : the US is committed to a lack of transparency . 
The USTR &apos;s office has been reluctant to reveal its negotiating position even to members of the US Congress ; on the basis of what has been leaked , one can understand why . 
The USTR &apos;s office is backtracking on principles - for example , access to generic medicines - that Congress had inserted into earlier trade agreements , like that with Peru . 
In the case of the TPP , there is a further concern . 
Asia has developed an efficient supply chain , with goods flowing easily from one country to another in the process of producing finished goods . 
But the TPP could interfere with that if China remains outside of it . 
But the USTR &apos;s office , representing corporate interests , will almost surely push for the lowest common standard , leveling downward rather than upward . 
For example , many countries have tax and regulatory provisions that discourage large automobiles - not because they are trying to discriminate against US goods , but because they worry about pollution and energy efficiency . 
The more general point , alluded to earlier , is that trade agreements typically put commercial interests ahead of other values - the right to a healthy life and protection of the environment , to name just two . 
France , for example , wants a &quot; cultural exception &quot; in trade agreements that would allow it to continue to support its films - from which the whole world benefits . 
This and other broader values should be non-negotiable . 
Indeed , the irony is that the social benefits of such subsidies are enormous , while the costs are negligible . 
Does anyone really believe that a French art film represents a serious threat to a Hollywood summer blockbuster ? 
Yet Hollywood &apos;s greed knows no limit , and America &apos;s trade negotiators take no prisoners . 
And that &apos;s precisely why such items should be taken off the table before negotiations begin . 
Otherwise , arms will be twisted , and there is a real risk that an agreement will sacrifice basic values to commercial interests . 
If negotiators created a genuine free-trade regime that put the public interest first , with the views of ordinary citizens given at least as much weight as those of corporate lobbyists , I might be optimistic that what would emerge would strengthen the economy and improve social well-being . 
The reality , however , is that we have a managed trade regime that puts corporate interests first , and a process of negotiations that is undemocratic and non-transparent . 
The likelihood that what emerges from the coming talks will serve ordinary Americans &quot; interests is low ; the outlook for ordinary citizens in other countries is even bleaker .
