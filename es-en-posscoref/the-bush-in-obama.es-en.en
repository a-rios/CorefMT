The Bush in Obama 
GUANTÁNAMO BAY , CUBA - Hearings are underway in the United States Senate to assess what to do with the 240 detainees still behind bars at Guantánamo Bay , and what will become of the military tribunals and detention without trial that the Bush administration and a compliant Congress put into place . 
The US Congress is also debating what will happen to the detention camp itself , which was established in 2002 to house men who were allegedly &quot; the worst of the worst , &quot; in a setting deliberately framed by Bush attorneys as &quot; legal outer space . &quot; 
But are those Senate hearings actually window dressing on a new reality that is just as bad as the old one - and in some ways worse ? 
Military tribunals without due process are up and running again . 
While President Barack Obama has released a few prisoners , notably the Chinese Uighurs , and sent another for a real trial in New York City , he is now , chillingly , signalling that he is about to begin &quot; preventive detention , &quot; which would empower him to hold forever an unspecified number of prisoners without charges or trials . 
On a visit to Guantánamo , Department of Defense spokesman Joe DellaVedova told me that a series of panels are reviewing the detainees &quot; files , a process that will take until this year &apos;s end . 
The review will sort the detainees into three categories : those who will be tried in criminal courts in the US ; those who will be released and sent to other countries ; and those who &quot; can &apos;t be released and can &apos;t be tried and so have to be held indefinitely ... what is being called &quot; preventive detention . &quot; &quot; 
I was stunned . 
DellaVedova &apos;s comment suggested that the review process was merely political theatre . 
If there is to be a genuine review of the accusations against these detainees , how can it be known in advance that the third category will be required ? 
Indefinite preventive detention is , of course , the foundation of a police state . 
Human rights organizations knew that Obama had prepared the way , in public-relations terms , for some criminal trials - talking up the &quot; supermax &quot; security of some US prisons , and noting that other terrorists have successfully been tried by America &apos;s justice system . 
( Other democracies , such as the United Kingdom and Spain , always try terrorism suspects , including alleged Al Qaida members , in ordinary criminal trials ) . 
But , six months after he ordered an end to torture and CIA &quot; black sites , &quot; and promised to close Guantánamo within a year , Obama seems to be re-branding Bush &apos;s worst excesses . 
He has brought in planeloads of journalists to Guantánamo Bay to show them a &quot; safe , transparent , and humane &quot; facility that now offers fresh baklava and video viewing from a shackled loveseat . 
But the roughly 240 detainees remain incarcerated without having been charged with any crime , and will still not get a fair trial , even under Obama &apos;s proposed military commissions . 
After all , the prosecutor , the judge , and the &quot; panel &quot; are all to be US government employees . 
Furthermore , Obama &apos;s Justice Department has invoked Bush &apos;s argument that the State Secrets Act bars evidence about torture from being disclosed , which means that anyone who was tortured can never appear in court . 
Moreover , Obama has sought to suppress hundreds of photographs depicting sexual assault in US-run prisons , and has done nothing to roll back the Patriot Act . 
Why should Obama , a constitutional scholar , be backtracking this way ? 
First , he does not dare appear to be &quot; soft on terror . &quot; 
Second , perhaps he needs to be able to try the Guantánamo detainees in a rigged setting , or even keep them from trial forever : lawyers claim that torture , including sexual torture , was so endemic in the CIA and the military that Obama could be holding scores , if not hundreds , of prisoners whose bodies are crime scenes . 
According to Wells Dixon , a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights who represents some of the detainees , the Obama administration cannot risk calling the torture practices crimes , so it calls them &quot; classified sources and methods &quot; that cannot be revealed in court . 
In fact , even the explanation of why this material is classified cannot be reproduced , because it is privileged . 
Nor has the access of lawyers to their Guantánamo clients improved under Obama . 
&quot; We are subject in all detainee cases to a protective order , &quot; Dixon says . 
&quot; Under this order , everything the detainee says is classified , &quot; unless the Department of Defense &quot; Privilege Team &quot; decides otherwise . 
Dixon then told me a revealing story of one of his clients , Majid Khan , a so-called &quot; high-value detainee &quot; who was held for three years in CIA &quot; black sites . &quot; 
Khan was tortured , Dixon said , though &quot; the government would say that what happened to him is an &quot; intelligence source or method . &quot; &quot; 
Because Dixon has a security clearance , he cannot discuss those classified &quot; sources and methods . &quot; 
On the other hand , Dixon continued , &quot; When the government does something to &#91; Khan &#93; that they say is classified , they have disclosed to him classified information . 
But since he doesn &apos;t have a security clearance , there is nothing that prevents him , unlike me , from saying to the outside world , &quot; This is what they did to me . &quot; 
Nothing prevents that - except for the fact that he is physically in custody . &quot; &quot; 
The &quot; logical conclusion , &quot; according to Dixon , is that Khan &quot; must be detained for the rest of his life - regardless of whether he is ever charged with a crime - because if he was ever released , nothing would prevent him from disclosing this information . 
Majid Khan - and there are many more like him - is a classic product of the Bush administration &apos;s disregard for the fundamental principles of the rule of law . 
Unfortunately , Obama &apos;s administration , for all its lofty rhetoric , appears too willing to perpetuate it .
