A Murder in Moscow 
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin &apos;s &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless . 
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya , one of Russia &apos;s bravest and best journalists , a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya , is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law . 
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make , particularly Europe . 
Germany &apos;s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian / German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin &apos;s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union . 
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena , as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia &apos;s economy . 
The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense of déjà vu : just as in the KGB &apos;s heyday , people simply disappear in Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Politkovskaya &apos;s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks . 
Enver Ziganshin , the chief engineer of BP Russia , was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30 . 
Andrei Kozlov , the deputy governor of Russia &apos;s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud , was assassinated on September 14 . 
The fact that Russia &apos;s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika , took over the investigation into Politkovskaya &apos;s killing , as he did with the murder of Kozlov , doesn &apos;t inspire hope , as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy . 
In fact , the involvement of the highest level of Russia &apos;s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found . 
Politkovskaya &apos;s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia &apos;s President . 
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow , 
I am not accusing Putin &apos;s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya . 
After all , as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin , not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister , Ramzan Kadyrov , whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom . 
But even if Vladimir Putin &apos;s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow , his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out . 
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago , the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king . 
Given what Politkovskaya represented - the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies - the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her . 
Putin &apos;s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years . 
None of those crimes has been solved , which would not be the case if Putin &apos;s &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; was anything more than a PR strategy . 
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals . 
On one hand , the world sees a young , educated leader pledging to modernize Russia , particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms . 
On the other , the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia &apos;s FSB security service ( the former KGB ) provide no security to those murdered , and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists , scientists , and environmental activists . 
These &quot; neo-spies &quot; include journalist Gregory Pasko , arms control expert Igor Sutyagin , diplomat Valentin Moiseyev , physicist Valentin Danilov , and others . 
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner - chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example - seems to have been lost on Putin &apos;s Kremlin cabal . 
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village ; 
Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule . 
The danger for the world is that Putin &apos;s lawlessness is being exported . 
Across Russia &apos;s near abroad , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root . 
Look at Putin &apos;s attempt to rig Ukraine &apos;s previous presidential election , and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko . 
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin &apos;s backing . 
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies . 
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior , criminals grow bolder . 
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is : a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows . 
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maxim
