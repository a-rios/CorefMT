Argentina &apos;s Monetary Mess 
CAMBRIDGE : Efforts to make the world safe for investment bankers are underway once again . 
The IMF is preparing a bailout estimated at $ 20 billion to keep Argentina from defaulting on loans to foreign investors . 
As usual , investors will get repaid , while Argentina sinks deeper into crisis . 
The story goes back decades . 
Argentina was seriously mismanaged from the 1940s to the early 1990s . 
Military and civilian governments alternated in irresponsible monetary and fiscal policies , and in trade protectionism that cut Argentina off from world markets . 
That combination produced massive foreign debt , a low level of exports relative to the size of the economy , and high inflation . 
In the early 1990s , President Carlos Menem and Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo took drastic actions , reducing budget deficits and ending protectionism . 
To battle inflation , however , they resorted to a trick . 
They fixed the exchange rate of the Argentina Peso at a value of one Peso per US dollar , and promised that the exchange rate would never change . 
This system is known as a &quot; currency board &quot; arrangement . 
Irrevocably fixing the exchange rate was at best a gamble , at worst a blunder . 
The exchange rate is a safety valve : when an economy becomes uncompetitive - say , if international demand for its products declines , or domestic costs rise above other countries - a decline in the currency &apos;s value can restore demand for the nation &apos;s output , and so help preserve employment . 
If the exchange rate is irrevocably fixed , that safety valve disappears . 
The economy can remain uncompetitive for years , causing chronically high unemployment and slow growth . 
At the start , Argentina &apos;s gamble seemed to pay off . 
Foreign investors , who understand little about macroeconomics and long-term growth , were delighted with Argentina &apos;s new-found stability . 
They poured money in ; 
But it is easy to boom when money pours in . 
Investors did not understand that Argentina was at risk of longer-term stagnation as a result of its currency board gamble . 
Argentine wages and prices rose significantly from 1991 through 1993 . 
As a result , Argentina priced itself out of world markets for many exports . 
Luckily , Brazil was also becoming a very expensive economy as a result of fixing the Brazilian Real to the US dollar in 1994 . 
Argentine producers could sell goods to Brazil even when they could not sell them elsewhere . 
Argentina experienced a deep financial crisis in 1995 , but recovered fast when exports to Brazil increased . 
Pleased with its success , Argentina began telling other countries to set up currency boards . 
I argued with them , saying that Argentina was in more trouble than appeared , and that Argentina should not encourage others to take the same gamble . 
Few listened . 
Argentine officials repeatedly told me that I was wrong , that Argentina was in great shape . 
The IMF also championed Argentina &apos;s gamble , urging Bulgaria , for example , to follow the same approach . 
Predictably , Argentina &apos;s gamble turned sour . 
In early 1999 Brazil decided to devalue its currency . 
Suddenly , Brazilian goods were cheaper than Argentine goods , so Brazilian consumers and businesses reduced their purchases . 
Automobile manufacturers with divided production between Argentina and Brazil shifted production to Brazilian factories . 
Unemployment rose in Argentina , and GNP fell by 3.1 % in 1999 , while Brazil &apos;s GNP rose by 1 % . 
Argentina was not the only South American economy to suffer in 1999 , but the others adjusted their exchange rates to restore international competitiveness . 
Argentina was stuck with its currency board and overvalued currency . 
Once investors understood Argentina &apos;s predicament , they started dumping its government bonds , and the risk premium on loans to Argentina rose several percent . 
Early in the year , investors required a risk premium of almost 6 points in order to buy Argentine debts . 
Bond rating agencies downgraded Argentina &apos;s government debt , which contributed to a further rise in the risk premium . 
Recently , holders of Argentina &apos;s debts have been receiving a rate of return of 15 % per year or even higher . 
High interest rate compensate for the risk that Argentina might stop paying the debts or devalue the currency or both . 
Holders of Argentine debt now scream that the world will come to an end if Argentina devalues its currency or suspends payments on its debts . 
Dutifully , the IMF is going to the rescue of bond holders . 
The IMF , World Bank , and the Inter-American Development Bank are gearing up to lend Argentina $ 20 billion so that it can continue to pay its debts without changing the exchange rate . 
This &quot; bailout &quot; will not bail out Argentina . 
The IMF &apos;s advice - to cut government spending and raise taxes - will deepen the crisis . 
This bailout money will encourage investment bankers to continue ignoring their risks . 
Yes , Argentina &apos;s debts will probably be paid in full , but Argentina &apos;s taxpayers and workers will bear a heavy burden for years to come . 
What should be done ? 
First , Argentina should end its currency board and devalue its currency . 
Argentina is uncompetitive , and will have several years of slow growth if it doesn &apos;t move the exchange rate . 
In a bold stroke , it could devalue the currency and then join a monetary union with Brazil . 
( The other hope for Argentina is that the US dollar collapses in value compared to the Euro , so that the Argentine peso becomes more competitive vis-a-vis the Euro ) . 
Second , the IMF should let Argentina and its creditors work out a refinancing or rescheduling agreement . 
A bailout just enriches creditors and lets them continue irresponsible gambling and ignore macroeconomic realities . 
Third , the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank , both development institutions , should not be misused for short-term bailouts . 
Fourth , the IMF and others should stop peddling monetary mischief such as currency boards and fixed exchange rates . 
Such arrangements make sense in rare circumstances ( perhaps in a very small and open economy such as Estonia ) . 
Even if the system made sense in Argentina in 1991 to end hyperinflation , it came at a high cost that need not be paid by other countries .
