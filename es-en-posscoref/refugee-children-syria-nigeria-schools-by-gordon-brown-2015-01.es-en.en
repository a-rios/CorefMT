Emergency Education Now 
DAVOS - In an ideal world , whenever children needed help , they would get it . 
When girls and boys were forced from their homes or classrooms because of war , natural disaster , or other crises , the international community would , within days , formulate a plan to ensure their immediate wellbeing . 
Such places exist . 
Unfortunately , ours is far from an ideal world . 
When children need help , days turn into weeks and months . 
Hundreds of desperate children become thousands and eventually millions . 
Hope gives way to prolonged misery - not for a few months or even a year , but on average for more than a decade . 
They are shut out of schools , locked out of opportunity , and condemned to live in unbearable conditions - subject to child labor or forced begging , sold into marriage , trafficked , conscripted into gangs , or recruited by extremists . 
What has happened in recent years in South Sudan , northern Nigeria , and Iraq - and in Jordan , and Lebanon , where hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugee children are being denied the chance to return to school - makes an overwhelming case for a new humanitarian fund for education in emergencies . 
What has happened during the Ebola crisis in Liberia , Guinea , and Sierra Leone - where schools serving five million children remain closed or have not reopened quickly enough - makes this case , too . 
Yemen and Chad are likely to be next . 
In all of these countries and situations , children &apos;s future depends on whether we , the international community , act . 
The Millennium Development Goals commit the international community to achieve the target of universal primary education by the end of 2015 . 
But the official out-of-school figure currently stands at 58 million . 
And , once out of school for a year or more , children are unlikely to return . 
There is a huge gap in our array of solutions . 
In 2014 , education received just 1 % of humanitarian funds - leaving millions of children and young people on the streets or idle in camps . 
And there is no mechanism to pay for the education of refugee children or those affected by disaster . 
To be sure , there are organizations - the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , UNICEF , and many other groups - that , working together , perform heroically . 
And organizations like the Global Partnership for Education , Sheikha Mozah &apos;s Educate a Child foundation , and the Global Business Coalition for Education also contribute in times of emergency . 
But that woefully small 1 % figure means that the world simply does not have enough to ensure that more than a fraction of affected children get help . 
The solution must be based on a simple humane principle : No child should be denied opportunity simply because adults are unable to work together . 
That means establishing an emergency education system that enables adequate funding to be released to UN agencies and operational NGOs at the onset of a crisis - not years later . 
What has been happening in Lebanon over the past two years is a case in point . 
Today , there are 465,000 Syrian child refugees . 
The Lebanese government has volunteered to accept refugee children into the country &apos;s schools by introducing a second afternoon session and enlisting teachers and school directors to take on the extra workload . 
Complicating the situation , officials have had to persuade a divided country , already worried about the influx of refugees ( which has added 20 % to the country &apos;s population ) . 
But few refugee children have enrolled . 
UNICEF and the UNHCR have devised a plan with the Lebanese government to implement this program , but the international community has failed to help . 
Only $ 100 million has been pledged , but $ 163 million is still needed . 
Though the Global Partnership for Education and other organizations want to do more , their mandate does not permit them to provide assistance to middle-income countries like Lebanon . 
Something is very wrong with this picture . 
Lebanon &apos;s government has a plan that requires no new schools or infrastructure , making it one of the most cost-effective solutions to a refugee crisis imaginable . 
But , still , the money is lacking . 
The same thing is happening in South Sudan . 
And in northern Nigeria , countless attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram have underscored the need for a full safe-schools program ; but the money to deliver it simply is not there . 
Similarly , in Pakistan , the Peshawar massacre last month has revealed how much more must be done to protect schools and children &apos;s future . 
Given such crises , the world can no longer afford to do without a humanitarian fund for education during emergencies . 
In April , at the World Bank &apos;s annual meeting , I will call for action by the assembled government ministers , and I hope to announce the establishment of such a fund at the Oslo Summit on Education for Development on July 6-7 . 
Passing the hat when a crisis erupts is not the solution . 
In 2015 , we must do more .
