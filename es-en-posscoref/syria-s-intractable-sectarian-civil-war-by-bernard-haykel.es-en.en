Syria &apos;s Sectarian Stalemate 
PRINCETON - What began in Syria as a revolt against an oppressive regime has evolved into a sectarian civil war and , more recently , into a proxy conflict . 
In the process , the struggle has become increasingly convoluted , with conflicting agendas among allies , together with deep-seated communal tensions , rendering the situation nearly intractable . 
On one side , the United States , the European Union , Turkey , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and Qatar are backing the opposition - a welter of armed factions with diverse agendas and ideologies that range from Syrian nationalist to global jihadi . 
This disunity reflects the fissures in Syrian society , a result of more than four decades of brutal authoritarian rule . 
On the other side , Russia and Iran ( and its proxy , Lebanon &apos;s Hezbollah ) , each for its own reasons , are supporting President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
Russia &apos;s motivations are tied to the legacy of the Cold War . 
The Assad regime has consistently adopted an anti-Western stance , aligning itself with the Soviet Union and later with Russia . 
Today , Syria represents Russia &apos;s only remaining toehold in the Arab world , while all of Assad &apos;s regional opponents are US allies . 
Iran &apos;s involvement reflects a different , much older struggle - that between Sunni and Shia for control of the Middle East . 
With Shia-dominated Iran providing weapons , money , troops , and training for Assad &apos;s forces , the conflict &apos;s sectarian dimension has taken on greater significance . 
Indeed , government forces have devolved into a sectarian army , motivated by the fear that , if the largely Sunni rebels are victorious , they will annihilate the Shia-affiliated Alawite minority that has ruled Syria for decades . 
As it stands , Assad &apos;s regime possesses an overwhelming military advantage , with an air force , tanks , missiles , and chemical and biological weapons . 
In order to defeat them , the opposition needs more sophisticated weapons - and its backers are ready to oblige . 
Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and Qatar - all Sunni-led countries - have sharply increased their military aid to the Syrian rebels in recent months . 
Even the United States , which has so far refused to provide lethal aid for fear of arming global jihadis , recently announced that it is working on a plan to deliver weapons to opposition forces . 
Sunni-Shia tensions tend to rise sharply during geopolitical power struggles , such as in Iraq in 2006-2008 . 
Prior to that , the last great Sunni-Shia battle in the Middle East involved near-constant war between the Sunni Ottoman Empire and Iran &apos;s Shia Safavid Empire during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . 
The Ottomans won by a small margin , ultimately securing control over Iraq . 
This does not bode well for Syria . 
Since the 1970 &quot; s , the Assads have failed to foster Arab nationalism in order to unite the religiously divided population , resorting instead to divisive sectarian politics to control Syria &apos;s population . 
While ensuring that their Alawite allies filled key positions in the military and intelligence services helped the Assads to retain their grip on the country , it was a strategy that widened and reinforced the Sunni-Shia rift among the population . 
When the Arab Spring began to unfold , Assad adopted the same approach , hoping that it would rally his Alawite supporters and scare the rest of the public into submission . 
This time , however , the plan backfired . 
Syria &apos;s Sunni population , inspired by the revolutions in other Arab countries and outraged by the regime &apos;s brutality , simply stopped being afraid - a potentially game-changing development for Arab authoritarianism . 
Now , the consequences of the Assads &quot; failure to promote a shared national ideology are becoming fully exposed . 
Syria &apos;s Sunnis are increasingly invoking theology to justify hatred of the Shia minority , and forms of Sunni exclusivism , similar to Al Qaeda &apos;s ideology and worldview , are becoming the norm . 
While Assad has secured the Alawite community &apos;s renewed support , he has done so at the cost of increasing the very real danger that the rebels will punish all Alawites for the regime &apos;s crimes . 
As the war grinds on , prospects for a negotiated solution are diminishing . 
As Iran throws its weight - and billions of dollars - behind the Alawites , and the Gulf States do likewise in support of the Sunnis , Syria is being torn apart . 
Soon , it will be too far gone for either side to be able to claim victory .
