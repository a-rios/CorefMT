Is Inflation the Right Battle ? 
BERKELEY - The Federal Reserve and other central banks are coming under pressure from two directions these days : from the left , they are pressured to do something to expand demand and hold down global unemployment ; from the right , they are pressured to contract demand to rein in inflation . 
This is a situation ripe for trouble , because one of these two diagnoses must be wrong . 
If the world &apos;s central banks raise interest rates while the major problem is insufficient global demand , they might cause a depression . 
If they do not raise interest rates while the major problem is inflation , they might cause spikes in prices , rising inflationary expectations , and a stubborn wage-price spiral like that of the 1970 &quot; s that can be unwound only with a later , deeper depression . 
I see the left as being correct - this time - in the global economy &apos;s post-industrial North Atlantic core . 
Headline inflation numbers are the only indication that rising inflation is a problem , or even a reality . 
The American Employment Cost index and other indicators of developed-country nominal wage growth show no acceleration of change . 
And &quot; core inflation &quot; measures show no sign of accelerating inflation either . 
The United States is experiencing a mortgage loss-driven financial meltdown that would , with an ordinary monetary policy , send it into a severe recession or a depression . 
In normal times , the Fed &apos;s response - extremely monetary stimulus - would be highly inflationary . 
But these are not normal times . 
Indeed , the Fed &apos;s monetary policy has not been sufficient to stave off a US recession , albeit one that remains so mild that many doubt whether it qualifies as the real animal . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s response has been analogous to the Fed &apos;s , but less forceful , with monetary policy easier than the headline inflation rate would suggest is appropriate . 
And in Western Europe , too , GDP is now declining . 
In brief , the major central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have responded to the financial crisis , but they have not overreacted . 
Even with their liquidity injections , the fallout from the financial crisis has eliminated the risk of a wage-price spiral that might otherwise have arisen . 
Yet headline inflation is soaring , and , not surprisingly , gets the headlines . 
This reflects three developments . 
First , the world has , for the moment at least , reached its resource limits , and we are seeing a big shift in relative prices as the global economy responds appropriately by making labor and capital cheap and oil and other resources expensive . 
The result of this relative price shift is headline inflation . 
Second , inside the US , the return of the dollar toward its equilibrium value is carrying with it import price inflation . 
Costs to US consumers are rising and making them feel poorer , not because they have become poorer , but because the previous pattern of global imbalances exaggerated their wealth . 
Global rebalancing is painful for American consumers , and shows itself as higher headline inflation . 
But to respond by fighting inflation inside the US would be grossly inappropriate - both much more painful for US consumers and pointless . 
Finally , as the economists Adam Posen and Arvind Subramanian have argued , &quot; China &apos;s single-minded pursuit of mercantilist objectives produces inflation and overheating at home . &quot; 
But &quot; US efforts to get China to shed these objectives sound hypocritical when the United States seems to be opting for excess stimulus itself .... &#91; I &#93; f the People &apos;s Bank and the Fed tightened in coordination with most central banks , domestic &#91; Chinese &#93; concerns about competitive depreciation would be muted ... &quot; 
China &apos;s policy of export subsidies through currency manipulation was always bound to become unsustainable in the long run because it was bound to generate substantial domestic inflation . 
Now it is also generating substantial pain for other developing countries as China &apos;s booming economy outbids them for resources . 
But it is politically impossible for the Chinese government to alter its exchange-rate policy under pressure without some &quot; concession &quot; from the US , and a tightening of US monetary policy could be sold as such a &quot; concession . &quot; 
But this overlooks what ought to be at the center of the discussion : higher US unemployment right now is not an appropriate goal for stabilizing US output and offers few benefits , if any , for stabilizing US prices . 
Nor is a US that cuts back on import purchases more rapidly in the interest of any export-oriented developing economy - including China .
