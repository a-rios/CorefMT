Bring Back Egypt &apos;s Elected Government 
NEW YORK - Putting an end to Egypt &apos;s deepening polarization and rising bloodshed requires one urgent first step : the reinstatement of Mohamed Morsi as Egypt &apos;s duly elected president . 
His removal by military coup was unjustified . 
While it is true that millions of demonstrators opposed Morsi &apos;s rule , even massive street protests do not constitute a valid case for a military coup in the name of the &quot; people &quot; when election results repeatedly say otherwise . 
There is no doubt that Egyptian society is deeply divided along sectarian , ideological , class , and regional lines . 
Yet the country has gone to the polls several times since the February 2011 overthrow of Mubarak &apos;s 30-year rule . 
The results have demonstrated strong popular support for Islamist parties and positions , though they also make clear the country &apos;s schisms . 
In late 2011 and early 2012 , Egypt held parliamentary elections . 
Morsi &apos;s Freedom and Justice Party , created by the Muslim Brotherhood , secured a plurality , and the two major Islamist blocs together received roughly two-thirds of the vote . 
In June 2012 , Morsi defeated his rival Ahmed Shafik , Mubarak &apos;s final prime minister , by a margin of 52-48 % to win the presidency . 
In a national referendum in December 2012 , a 64 % majority of those voting approved a draft constitution backed by the Muslim Brotherhood ( though turnout was low ) . 
The secular argument that Morsi &apos;s lust for power jeopardized Egypt &apos;s nascent democracy does not bear scrutiny . 
Secular , military , and Mubarak-era foes of the Muslim Brotherhood have used every lever at their disposal , democratic or not , to block the Islamist parties &quot; democratic exercise of power . 
This is consistent with a decades-old pattern in Egyptian history , in which the Brothers - and Islamist political forces in general - were outlawed , and their members imprisoned , tortured , and exiled . 
Claims that Morsi ruled undemocratically stem from his repeated attempts to extricate the popularly elected parliament and presidency from anti-democratic traps set by the military . 
After the Islamist parties &quot; huge victory in the 2011-2012 parliamentary elections , the military leadership and the Supreme Court ( filled with Mubarak-era judges ) worked to derail the new parliament and prevent it from establishing an assembly to draft a new constitution . 
The key action came in June 2012 , when the Supreme Court , staffed entirely with Mubarak-era holdovers , nullified the results of the parliamentary elections on specious grounds . 
The military was set to reassert full legislative powers . 
Morsi &apos;s subsequent victory in the presidential election therefore set up an epic battle over the future of the parliament and the constitution , as Morsi attempted to protect the democratically elected parliament while the military fought to dissolve it . 
In the end , Morsi insisted that the elected parliament create a constitutional assembly , which produced the draft approved in the December 2012 referendum . 
As is typical of political revolutions , Egypt &apos;s economic situation has gone from bad to worse in the course of these power struggles . 
Revolutions tend to confront new governments with steeply rising social demands ( for wage increases and higher welfare spending , for example ) at a time of capital flight , financial turmoil , and deep disruptions of production . 
In Egypt &apos;s case , the crucial tourist sector contracted sharply after the revolution . 
Unemployment soared , the currency depreciated , and food prices rose dangerously . 
None of this is surprising , and little of it can be managed by a new government that lacks experience , market confidence , and full control of the levers of power . 
Historically , outside parties have thus played a decisive role . 
Will foreign governments and the International Monetary Fund extend vital finances to the new government , or will they let it flounder and drown in a tsunami of currency depreciation and inflation ? 
Here , the feckless West - torn between its democratic rhetoric and its antipathy to the Islamists - showed its hand . 
The result was equivocation and delay , rather than commitment and assistance . 
The IMF has talked with the Egyptian government for two and a half years since Mubarak &apos;s overthrow without so much as lending a single cent , sealing the Egyptian economy &apos;s fate and contributing to public unrest and the recent coup . 
It appears from press reports that the West finally gave the green light to the Egyptian military to overthrow Morsi , arrest the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s leadership , and repress the Islamist rank and file . 
US President Barack Obama &apos;s unwillingness to stand up for Egypt &apos;s elected leaders , or even to label their overthrow a &quot; coup &quot; ( thereby protecting the continued flow of US funds to the Egyptian military ) , shows that when push came to shove , the West sided with the anti-Islamists in subverting democracy . 
Of course , in classic Orwellian fashion , the West did so in democracy &apos;s name . 
The coup and the West &apos;s complacency about it ( if not complicity in it ) could devastate Egypt . 
The Islamists are neither a marginal political group nor a terrorist force . 
They represent a large part of Egypt &apos;s population , perhaps half or more , and are certainly the country &apos;s best-organized political force . 
The attempt to repress the Muslim Brotherhood and to deny Morsi the presidency to which he was elected will most likely lead to massive violence and the strangulation of democracy , however the West and Egyptian anti-Islamists try to justify their actions . 
At this point , the correct course for the West would be to call on Egypt &apos;s military to reinstate Morsi ; to offer prompt financing to help stabilize the Egyptian economy ; and to support true pluralism , not the kind that reverts to military coups when elections produce inconvenient results . 
True pluralism means accepting the strength of Islamist political forces in the new Egypt and other countries in the region . 
Short of this , the West will most likely end up as an accomplice to Egypt &apos;s continuing downward spiral into violence and economic collapse .
