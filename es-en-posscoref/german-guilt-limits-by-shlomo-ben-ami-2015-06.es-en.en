The Limits of German Guilt 
MUNICH - This month marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Israel . 
The bilateral relationship , born in the wake of the Nazis &quot; annihilation of European Jewry , has developed into a solid one . 
David Ben-Gurion , Israel &apos;s founding father and the architect of Israel &apos;s reconciliation with Germany , was a pragmatist through and through . 
He knew that forging a partnership with Germany , which included reparations that would help boost Israel &apos;s capabilities , could go a long way toward securing Israel &apos;s survival . 
Of course , the reparations - which began in 1952 - served Germany &apos;s interests , too . 
The best way to regain international legitimacy after World War II was to atone publicly for the atrocities committed by the Nazis , and reconcile with the world &apos;s Jewish population . 
But the case for establishing full diplomatic relations was not so clear . 
Fearing that such a move would undermine its relationships with Arab countries , and thus its objective of maintaining an impartial Middle East policy , Chancellor Ludwig Erhard &apos;s government resisted Israeli pressure to establish full ties until 1965 . 
Even then , German policy in the Middle East continued to reflect a domestic consensus that Germany &apos;s responsibility for Israel &apos;s security must be balanced with an effort to remain neutral in the region &apos;s affairs . 
Still , over the last half-century , the bilateral relationship has become a formidable one . 
Germany is Israel &apos;s largest trading partner in Europe , and its third-largest overall , after the United States and China . 
Moreover , Germany has been among Israel &apos;s most reliable allies , exemplified by its role as a major arms supplier . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel has emerged as a staunch defender of the country , exemplified in a 2008 address to the Knesset ( Israel &apos;s parliament ) , in which she identified Israel &apos;s security as an essential feature of Germany &apos;s Staatsraison . 
But Germany also appears to be increasingly uneasy about having to continue supporting Israel even when its policies are clearly reproachable . 
Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz , can the bilateral relationship withstand the rising tide of anti-Israel sentiment in Europe ? 
History has its ironies . 
Post-war Germany could regain international legitimacy only through reconciliation with the Jewish people . 
Today , it is Israel &apos;s legitimacy that is being challenged in international institutions and Western public opinion for its mistreatment of the Palestinians . 
The role reversal has been remarkable . 
Both Jews and Germans emerged from WWII as defeated and crippled peoples , but the Jews had the moral high ground , while the Germans very much did not . 
Yet , in a global opinion poll conducted in 2013 by the BBC World Service , Israel ranked as one of the least popular countries - just above North Korea , Pakistan , and Iran - whereas Germany emerged as the most popular . 
But the extent of this inversion is best exemplified in the increasing prevalence of obscene comparisons between Israel &apos;s policies toward Palestine and the Nazis &quot; treatment of the Jews . 
A study conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation in January showed that 35 % of Germans have no problem making that connection . 
In what might presage a shift in the bilateral relationship , the poll also revealed that 58 % of Germans believe that the past should be consigned to history , and 62 % disapprove of Israel &apos;s policies today . 
Of course , Germany &apos;s eagerness to discharge the burden of history is not new . 
Back in 1998 , the renowned intellectual Martin Walser publicly attacked the pervasiveness of Auschwitz in Germany &apos;s remembrance culture , declaring that the Holocaust had become a &quot; moral cudgel &quot; with which to intimidate all Germans and keep them &quot; in a perpetual state of guilt . &quot; 
Walser &apos;s stance amounted to a desperate call to allow his country to shape a new national identity - one that reflected its resolute repudiation of fascism and adoption of democracy , rather than its highly regrettable ( and regretted ) history . 
And it drew a standing ovation from all but one of the 1,200 illustrious members of the audience in Frankfurt &apos;s Pauluskirche , where Walser was being awarded the German Booksellers Association Peace Prize . 
The lone exception was Ignatz Bubis , the head of Germany &apos;s Jewish community . 
As Israel &apos;s policies have become increasingly indefensible , the Germans &quot; will to shape national policy independent of Holocaust guilt has grown even stronger . 
The poem &quot; What Must Be Said , &quot; written in 2012 by the late Nobel laureate Günter Grass , may be frivolous and cliché-laden , but it is no less revealing of the growing fatigue of German society with the paralyzing memory of the Holocaust . 
Not only did Grass define Israel as &quot; a threat to world peace &quot; ; he also noted that he had remained silent for so long simply because he believed that his own origins , &quot; tarnished by a stain that can never be removed , &quot; denied him the right to speak the truth . 
Like Grass , Germans - especially the younger generations , who feel further removed from the events of WWII - are increasingly abandoning the notion that they owe it to Israel to remain its silent , steadfast supporters . 
Indeed , as Israel &apos;s right-wing government moves to bury the two-state solution for good , Germans are joining other Europeans in vocally opposing Israeli policy in Palestine . 
Simply put , historic guilt is no longer adequate to compel Germany to support Israel &apos;s wrongheaded policies - especially when those policies are victimizing another group , the Palestinians . 
Israel &apos;s current leaders should take note .
