Are the Saudis Fanatics ? 
Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question not only the ruling House of Saud &apos;s prospects for survival , but also whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive . 
Somehow , it seems , Saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy . 
The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States were Saudis crystallized a long-held view of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance . 
In some respects , this perception is accurate , but it cannot be applied to the broad Saudi public . 
On the contrary , it would be a grave mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes toward religion . 
Between 2001 and 2003 , I was part of a team that undertook an extensive survey of values in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Iran , and Jordan . 
Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes . 
Compared to respondents in the other Middle Eastern countries , Saudis were less religious overall , and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriage also indicate a moderate undercurrent . 
To be sure , in all four countries , religiosity is widespread , with more than 90 % of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God , in life after death , and in heaven and hell . 
But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims . 
Sixty-two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious , compared with 82 % of Iranians , 85 % of Jordanians , and 98 % of Egyptians . 
Americans also appear to be far more religious than Saudis , with 81 % describing themselves that way . 
Some of this variation may be explained by cross-national differences regarding what it means to be religious . 
For example , Americans may define religiosity differently than Middle Easterners , with perhaps a weaker attachment to religious beliefs than is true in Islamic countries . 
This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries . 
But the gap in self-defined religiosity between Saudis , on the one hand , and Iranians , Jordanians , and Egyptians , on the other , is so great that it challenges the prevalent perception of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious society . 
Indeed , actions speak louder than words : only 28 % of Saudis said that they participate in weekly religious services , compared to 27 % of Iranians , 44 % of Jordanians , 42 % of Egyptians , and 45 % of Americans . 
These findings , while running contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture , are less startling than they appear . 
Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment , or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state , the overall religiosity of the public declines . 
It makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior , people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions . 
Little wonder , then , that Egyptians and Jordanians , who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety , are more religious than Iranians or Saudis , who must cope with local &quot; virtue &quot; police backed by the state . 
Even on marriage , many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views . 
Respondents were nearly evenly split on the question of arranged marriages , with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent , while 48 % preferred love as the basis of matrimony . 
Given entrenched gender segregation and paternal dominance , this finding appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has traditionally been a family-driven decision . 
Finally , the Saudis turn out to be strong supporters of democracy , once again contradicting a popular image of Saudi conservatism . 
Of the Saudis polled , 58 % considered democracy the best form of government , 23 % disagreed , and 18 % did not express an opinion . 
Majority support for democracy in a country with no prior secular and nationalist history seems counter-intuitive . 
In fact , support for democracy corresponds with a number of other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia . 
Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious , more secular , more tolerant of others , more critical of public-sector performance , and more concerned with Western cultural invasion . 
Beyond the survey data , history has shown that liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch governs people in alliance with a religious establishment . 
A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid . 
At the same time , an anti-clerical , secular movement on behalf of constitutionalism appeared in Iran - a reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Quajar Shahs and the religious establishment . 
In view of the similarities between those historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia , we ought not to rule out the possibility of reform . 
Now survey data , too , suggest that Saudis may well begin demanding a more transparent politics and a less interventionist religion .
