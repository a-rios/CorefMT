The Grand Strategy of Xi Jinping 
SEOUL - China spent much of 2014 seeking to revive a concept that Japan proclaimed seven decades ago , when it was an imperial power seeking to impose its will on the region : &quot; Asia for the Asians . &quot; 
But that effort may not end as badly for China as it did for Japan . 
International relations tend to become destabilized by rapid changes in the distribution of power . 
Established powers &quot; resistance to their rising counterparts &quot; demands for a larger role in setting the global agenda fuel tensions and disrupt the existing world order . 
That is precisely what has been occurring lately between China and the United States , and is the impetus for China &apos;s &quot; Asia for the Asians &quot; policy . 
In November 2013 , China shook the regional order by unilaterally declaring an air-defense identification zone ( ADIZ ) over a large swath of the East China Sea that includes disputed territory - notably the Senkaku Islands ( known in Chinese as the Diaoyu Islands ) that are claimed by China , Japan , and Taiwan . 
This amounted to an escalation of China &apos;s already assertive stance in the region , with Chinese President Xi Jinping routinely sending maritime-surveillance and fishery law-enforcement ships to the waters surrounding the islands , spurring protests in South Korea and Japan . 
The US , prompted by its allies &quot; anger , dispatched two B-52 bombers into the ADIZ . 
Tensions continued to mount through early 2014 , raising concerns about an &quot; accidental war &quot; between China and Japan , which would demand the involvement of Japan &apos;s main ally , the US ( as President Barack Obama confirmed on a visit to Tokyo last April ) . 
Add to that simultaneous tensions over China &apos;s claims to South China Sea islands and atolls - claims disputed by the Philippines and Vietnam - and a clash between China and the US was beginning to seem inevitable . 
Before long , however , the US had to turn its attention to Russia , which under President Vladimir Putin &apos;s leadership has been seeking to recapture the Cold War-era Soviet Union &apos;s geopolitical status . 
With its regional authority apparently threatened by rising pro-European sentiment in Ukraine , Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and began supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine , prompting the US and Europe to impose increasingly tough political and economic sanctions . 
In this conflict , China has actually become something of a US ally . 
Though the conclusion of long-negotiated gas deals between Russia and China may seem to reflect a deepening of the bilateral relationship , China extracted an exceedingly low price from Russia for the gas that it will receive . 
This , together with the fact that China has cut lending to Russia since the Crimea invasion , suggests that , in the longer term , the Chinese envision Russia as a natural-resource vassal , not an equal ally . 
Chinese and American policies converged even more clearly on North Korea in 2014 . 
Xi expressed his unwillingness to tolerate any unruly behavior - particularly concerning nuclear weapons - by the country &apos;s unpredictable rulers . 
This drove the North , which depends on Chinese aid , to send diplomatic interlocutors to Japan , Russia , and even South Korea . 
But , following the United Nations General Assembly &apos;s resolution on North Korea &apos;s human-rights situation , the regime announced that it would hold its fourth nuclear test . 
These power shifts are the result less of Russia &apos;s expansionist ambitions or China &apos;s military and economic rise than of America &apos;s declining international leadership . 
With Obama unwilling - or unable , due to rising political partisanship at home - to take the lead in addressing crises like those in Egypt , Libya , and Syria , challengers to American primacy took heart in 2014 , and US allies took fright . 
Global power must be allocated somewhere ; if the US would not fill its leading role on the international stage , an understudy would have to step in . 
But China &apos;s recent shift away from muscle-flexing , and its confluence of interests with a US-led order , offers hope that it will not fuel large-scale regional instability this year . 
Indeed , China withdrew its jumbo oil platform from the waters of the disputed Paracel Islands last July , and it has been sending surveillance ships to the Senkaku Islands less frequently . 
Chinese officials have also become more willing to discuss the creation of a code of conduct for the South China Sea . 
The most important element of China &apos;s charm offensive is its effort to improve relations with Japan , initiated at a meeting between Xi and Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the sidelines of the recent APEC meeting in Beijing . 
The long-awaited climate deal that Xi struck with Obama at another peripheral meeting at the same event is no small step , either . 
China &apos;s new , more emollient diplomacy underpins a nuanced foreign policy . 
By offering generous economic incentives to its Southeast Asian neighbors , it has weakened their will to confront China in a coalition . 
Vietnam , for example , decided to &quot; reset &quot; its relations with China , and not to cooperate with the Philippines in waging a legal battle over China &apos;s maritime claims . 
Indeed , China has been shifting from hard power to soft throughout the region , and is using its economic power to challenge Western-dominated multilateral institutions . 
Specifically , China has decided to pour huge amounts of money into establishing new development institutions : the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , the Maritime Silk Road Bank , and the New Development Bank ( created by the five major emerging economies , Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) . 
Furthermore , Chinese Premier Li Keqiang recently offered $ 20 billion to finance infrastructure and development projects in the ASEAN countries . 
With the US economy yet to recover fully from the global economic crisis , and American politics increasingly dysfunctional , there is a global power vacuum that China , with shrewd diplomacy and economic might , hopes to fill - beginning in Asia . 
This may not yet mean Asia for only the Asians ; but it could mean a reduced regional role for the US - especially as America turns inward during the presidential election season that starts this year .
