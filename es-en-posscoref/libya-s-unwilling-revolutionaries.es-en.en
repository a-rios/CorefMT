Libya &apos;s Unwilling Revolutionaries 
TRIPOLI - Egypt is not the only place where the bright hopes of the Arab Spring are fading . 
From attacks against Western governments to ethnic clashes in remote desert oases , Libya &apos;s revolution is faltering . 
The blame for Libya &apos;s current travails rests largely with the interim government that led the uprising . 
The National Transitional Council refuses to make difficult decisions , instead palming them off to a future elected government . 
The NTC has preserved much of the institutional paralysis and knee-jerk behavior typical of Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi &apos;s overthrown regime . 
If the Libyan revolution is to succeed , the country &apos;s new leaders must make a clean break with the spirit of the past . 
During his 42 years in power , Qaddafi surrounded himself with advisers who were companions from his youth , supplemented by a small coterie of technocrats . 
As a result , the leaders of the revolt that overthrew him have little government experience . 
And so it has . 
Indeed , the revolution was never a smooth affair . 
When fighters failed to defeat loyalist forces on their own , outside powers were compelled to intervene . 
Later , the NTC was unable to impose discipline on the myriad militias that formed to fight Qaddafi &apos;s troops , or even to direct foreign weapons efficiently to the fledgling Libyan National Army . 
When the military chief of staff was assassinated in July under mysterious circumstances , the NTC could not offer concrete answers to an angry public . 
With no access to Libyan assets frozen abroad , it frequently paid salaries weeks in arrears . 
While the battle against Qaddafi was still raging , Libyans considered it unpatriotic to point out the NTC &apos;s weaknesses . 
Today , however , those flaws have been magnified by its paralysis . 
The NTC deliberates rather than decides . 
The two-thirds majority required to pass legislation means that many bills die after extensive debate . 
Many NTC members believe that the Council lacks the legitimacy to make tough choices . 
They argue that the NTC should limit itself to serving as a caretaker government , implementing only the most essential decisions until elected officials take office . 
As a result , the NTC and the cabinet that it appointed , known as the executive committee , merely want to pass the baton of authority . 
Hesitant to leave a large imprint in their wake , some ministries have no budgets , and ministers are reluctant to sign deals with foreign firms . 
But , beyond the question of the proper role of custodian governments lies the indecisiveness of the NTC &apos;s leaders , who simply prefer to defer to others . 
When a colonel recently asked NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel-Jalil why he has not moved to merge the militias into a national army , Abdel-Jalil replied , &quot; I head the legislative branch . 
You must speak with the executive ( committee ) . &quot; 
Other senior Libyan officials suffer from the same managerial torpor . 
The NTC &apos;s first prime minister , Mahmud Jibril , was praised by the international community for his vision . 
The NTC &apos;s paralysis is clearly reflected in the trial of Qaddafi &apos;s son , Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi . 
Though considered the most prized captive of the ancien regime , the Council has made little progress in prosecuting him . 
Ahmad Jihani , Libya &apos;s representative to the International Criminal Court , recently told me that , &quot; we as Libyans cannot begin Saif &apos;s trial . 
There is no central power to prosecute him . &quot; 
The ICC prosecutor echoed his sentiments in a June 5 legal brief , noting that &quot; the Government of Libya may be unable to move the case forward . &quot; 
With no progress toward trying Qaddafi for war crimes , the NTC is holding him on the innocuous charge of failure to possess a camel license . 
Bureaucrats lament ministerial dithering . 
&quot; Everyday people come with ideas to demobilize the fighters and integrate them into society , &quot; notes an official in the Labor Ministry , referring to the most pressing problem facing the NTC . 
&quot; But , with no one to make a decision , all of these plans just sit on our desks . &quot; 
One reason for this inertia can be found in Libya &apos;s prevailing political culture . 
When he devolved ministerial planning to bureaucrats in 2008 , many were not pleased . 
&quot; Unused to planning and possessed of limited human capacity , senior officials in the ministries are very nervous , &quot; an American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks reported . 
Libya &apos;s new leaders suffer from something worse than foot-dragging . 
They are falling back on the same facile , prefabricated responses that Qaddafi used to demonize his domestic and international opponents for four decades . For example , when eastern Libyans recently announced the formation of an interim regional council as a first step toward declaring a federalist state , Abdel-Jalil alleged &quot; the beginning of a conspiracy against Libya &quot; in the brewing crisis between the country &apos;s provinces . 
&quot; Some Arab nations , unfortunately , have supported and encouraged this to happen , &quot; he said . 
But Abdel-Jalil named no specific foreign powers and offered no proof to support his allegations , which sounded much like Qaddafi &apos;s frequent rants against &quot; imperialist-Zionist plots . &quot; 
After an eight-month revolution that devastated the country , Libyans are demanding real reforms .
