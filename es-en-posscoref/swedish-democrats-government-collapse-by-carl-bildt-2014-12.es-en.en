Sweden in Crisis 
STOCKHOLM - After decades of adherence to more or less stable rules and predictable patterns , Swedish politics has entered uncharted territory in recent weeks . 
Many are shocked that the government collapsed and had to call a new election only two months after taking office . 
After all , Sweden had been a rare beacon of success in Europe in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis . 
So what happened ? 
The immediate cause of the government &apos;s demise was Parliament &apos;s rejection of the center-left coalition &apos;s proposed budget , in favor of the budget presented by the center-right Alliance parties , which formed the previous government . 
Having failed to pass its first budget - owing to the abrupt decision by the far-right Swedish Democrats ( SD ) to support the Alliance alternative - the government could not simply continue as if nothing had happened . 
The background to this episode was the September election , which the four-party Alliance lost after eight years in power ( during which I served as Foreign Minister ) . 
The Alliance government was widely considered to have been successful ; but eight years is a long time in politics . 
Fair enough . 
In fact , the three leftist parties in Parliament gained a slightly smaller share of the popular vote than they did in the 2010 election . 
The big winner was the populist SD , which doubled its share of the vote , to more than 13 % . 
To be sure , the Social Democrat-Green coalition , with the support of only 38 % of MPs , was bound to be an uncertain exercise . 
That strategy sealed the government &apos;s fate , though the end came sooner and more dramatically than expected . 
But Sweden &apos;s current political muddle is also rooted in longer-term changes , which to some extent reflect broader European trends . 
One is the structural decline of the once-dominant Social Democrats . 
For decades , any election in which the party won less than 45 % of the vote was viewed as a disaster . 
Now the Social Democrats &quot; popular support hovers at around 30 % , and the last two elections yielded the worst results in a century . 
The other trend is the rise of the populist SD . 
Until 2010 , Sweden seemed immune to the rise of far-right parties like those in Denmark , Norway , and Finland . 
Since then , however , the SD has fundamentally changed the country &apos;s political landscape . 
Anti-immigrant sentiment is part of the story , though Swedish public opinion has become much more favorable toward immigration since the early 1990s . 
For some , immigration has become a symbol of a society gone astray . 
For others , the number of immigrants over the last few years has simply been too high . 
In fact , the numbers are high - not in comparison with a country like Turkey , but certainly relative to other European Union countries . 
Sweden and Germany receive the largest inflows of immigrants by far - and Germany is nearly ten times the size of Sweden . 
Our tradition of being open to refugees is not new . 
People came from the Baltic countries in the 1940s , Hungary in 1956 , Chile after the 1973 coup , and Iran after the 1979 revolution . 
For decades , Swedish industry was dependent on immigrant workers . 
During the Bosnian War of the 1990s , Sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people - a challenge at any time , much less during a period of profound economic crisis . 
In the new century , refugees have come increasingly from the Middle East and the Horn of Africa . 
One percent of Sweden &apos;s population today is from Iran , and almost 2 % are from Iraq . 
Indeed , after the Iraq war , the small town of Södertälje took in more Iraqi refugees than the United States did . 
Given the numbers , immigration in Sweden has worked much better than expected . 
The Swedish labor market &apos;s sometimes rather strict systems and stable structures have impeded integration relative to many other countries . 
Sweden , already a humanitarian superpower in terms of the aid it provides to conflict regions , certainly will not close its doors . 
In particular , the pace of job creation achieved in the last few years must be maintained . 
For all of its economic success during the past two decades , not least since the 2008 crisis , industry is hollowing out , and structural issues are beginning to be felt . 
Our celebrated welfare state will come under strain from an aging population . 
Indeed , in this respect , immigration is more a part of the solution than a part of the problem . 
There is no guarantee that the election in March will resolve Sweden &apos;s political crisis , particularly if the SD performs well again . 
A German-style grand coalition has never been tested in Sweden ; and Austria &apos;s experience suggests that it could play into the extremists &quot; hands . 
But a more cooperative atmosphere might well be needed .
