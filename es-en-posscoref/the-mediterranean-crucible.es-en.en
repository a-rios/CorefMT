The Mediterranean Crucible 
BERLIN - For most Europeans , the Mediterranean is an annual object of longing - the holiday idyll where they spend the best weeks of the year . 
Inside the European Union , the ugly term PIGS ( Portugal , Italy / Ireland , Greece , Spain ) is now a commonplace , denoting countries that have endangered the euro &apos;s stability and are forcing northern Europeans into costly bailouts . 
Where not long ago sunshine and solidarity were the order of the day , depression and confrontation are now the rule . 
Worse still , Europe &apos;s debt and confidence crisis is also the EU &apos;s gravest political crisis since its inception : at stake is nothing less then the future of the European project itself . 
And now the crisis has reached the southern shore of the Mediterranean , in the form of a revolution in Tunisia and a political showdown in Lebanon that has once again brought the country to the verge of war and disaster . 
With the EU &apos;s Mediterranean member states simultaneously faltering , great changes are afoot in Europe &apos;s southern neighborhood . 
So it is time to think geopolitically , not just fiscally , about the Mediterranean . 
What the EU is facing in the Mediterranean isn &apos;t primarily a currency problem ; first and foremost , it is a strategic problem - one that requires solutions urgently . 
The overthrow of Tunisia &apos;s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali is the first such spontaneous democratic uprising in the Arabic world , showing that in an age of satellite television and the Internet , suppression of information and free expression by individual governments doesn &apos;t really work anymore . 
Add to this the fact that the Arab world &apos;s nationalist regimes , which have calcified into militarized dictatorships , lost their popular legitimacy long ago . 
The &quot; Chinese option &quot; - economic rights and prosperity in exchange for public quiescence - is not feasible , owing to these regimes &quot; ineptness and rampant corruption . 
As a result , their inability to reform , combined with rapid population growth and a rising cohort of young people , is placing them under pressure , creating a possibility of explosive change . 
Whether a development will occur in the Arab world similar to that in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain is impossible to predict for the time being . 
In Eastern Europe , with the withdrawal and eventual disappearance of the Soviet hegemon , the floodgates were opened , and a torrent of change washed over the region . 
In the Middle East and the Maghreb , this external factor is missing ; democratic change must come from within each society . 
Tunisia shows that no government that has lost its legitimacy and is supported only by bayonets is sustainable in the long term . 
Whether Tunisia becomes a democratic , economic , and social success story or , instead , sees its revolution end in chaos , civil war , and a new authoritarian regime will have consequences far beyond the country &apos;s borders . 
Europe , as Tunisia &apos;s northern neighbor , will be directly affected either way , and should therefore become seriously involved in terms of promoting democracy and aiding economic progress . 
Whatever mistakes Europe may have made vis-Ã -vis the region &apos;s authoritarian regimes in the past , it can now correct them by providing decisive help . 
Indeed , Tunisia is a stern test of the EU &apos;s &quot; Mediterranean partnership &quot; - a long-promoted policy that so far consists of little more than empty phrases . 
Tunisia &apos;s revolution is a unique historical opportunity , and the EU &apos;s stake in the outcome can hardly be overestimated . 
European officials in Brussels and the major EU governments should not go for political and economic half-measures . 
Specifically , beyond direct help for Tunisia at this critical moment , the EU must breathe new life into the Mediterranean partnership . 
Projects for strategic cooperation in energy - say , production of solar and wind energy in the Sahara for sale to Europe - would be especially valuable . 
The EU and its member states - particularly Spain , France , Germany , and Italy - should make this new form of energy production and cooperation the key project of the Mediterranean partnership , and must ensure the necessary political conditions to accomplish it rapidly . 
This would create new prospects for the countries in the EU &apos;s southern neighborhood , and thus give the transformation process an economic and technological impetus . 
Moreover , such projects would promote cooperation between the states in the EU &apos;s southern neighborhood , potentially boosting investments in education , infrastructure , and industrial development . 
If the Europeans continue to look inward , allowing accountants to dominate discussions of Europe &apos;s future , they will miss a historic opportunity - one that will directly affect Europe &apos;s security . 
In that case , the costs tomorrow would be far higher than the savings today .
