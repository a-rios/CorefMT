Human Rights are Union Rights 
Are human rights related to trade union power ? 
Do both march in tandem around the globe ? 
For nearly two centuries the answer was almost always a resounding &quot; Yes ! &quot; 
On every continent , the growth of organized labor seemed to herald the emancipation of common people and the demise of their oppressors . 
Today we live in an era of global human rights . 
War criminals are put on trial in The Hague . 
Women &apos;s rights are on the social and political agenda in the Middle East . 
From Burma to Nigeria , the world pays close attention to the free speech rights of political dissidents . 
Thousands of NGOs ( Non-Governmental Organizations ) expose human rights violations and promote social , economic , and legal standards aimed at benefiting those who toil in factories in poor countries . 
Some 182 labor and human rights codes of conduct have been adopted by corporations and industry associations around the globe . 
Prodded by groups like the Workers Rights Consortium and the Ethical Trading Initiative , some corporations promise to pay living wages , open their factories to monitors , and even provide employees a voice in the workplace . 
Reebok , the multinational sportswear firm , advertises its corporate code as being &quot; based on the core principles &quot; of the UN &apos;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
The company markets its soccer balls and other goods with a &quot; Guaranteed : Manufactured without Child Labor &quot; label . 
But sensitivity to human rights has done nothing to staunch trade unionism &apos;s worldwide decline . 
The International Labor Organization reports that unions are in retreat in most nations . 
During the 1990s union membership fell to less than 20 % of workers in 48 out of 92 countries . 
The paradox is clear . 
Consider the US , where since the 1960s a multicultural , gender-sensitive tradition of rights has been legitimized and codified in US law , within major corporations , inside governmental bureaucracies , and across the political spectrum . 
Most big corporations favor &quot; diversity &quot; and boast of their compliance with civil rights and gender-equality laws . 
At the same time , in no other large nation , save for outright dictatorships , have trade unions lost so many members and so much political leverage . 
Membership has dropped sharply over the last quarter-century , and today less than one in ten private-sector American workers are union members . 
What severed the traditional link between strong trade unions and respect for human rights ? 
To be sure , trade unions have lost members and political clout owing partly to a decline in their moral authority and hence legitimacy as institutions capable of defending the interests of ordinary working people . 
Too often trade unions are seen as defending an unjust status quo , as complicit in maintaining gender and racial hierarchies , or else as being so politically self-interested that they injure the rest of society . 
Moreover , government and businesses have clearly become increasingly hostile to trade unions over the last 25 years . 
As Human Rights Watch reported , &quot; In a system replete with all the appearance of legality and due process , workers &apos; exercise of rights to organize , to bargain , and to strike ... has been frustrated by many employers who realize they have little to fear from labor law enforcement . &quot; 
But the evisceration of US labor law also reflects the extraordinary power of America &apos;s culture of rights . 
Rights are universal and are held only by individuals , which means that a company CEO enjoys them just as much as his office clerk . 
Under a regime of universal individual rights , it becomes difficult to grant trade unions the legal status and privileges of a collectivity distinct from and superior to its members . 
For millions of workers , not to mention their bosses , union solidarity has become an antiquated or even alien concept . 
This is hardly surprising . 
In the contemporary American workplace , employers use their court-protected free-speech rights to spread millions of dollars worth of anti-union propaganda , to intimidate individual workers , and to persuade employees that joining a union would mean losing their jobs . 
But are unions relevant anymore ? 
Some argue that in the US and elsewhere the human rights regime is so powerful and pervasive that trade unionism is no longer necessary or even desirable . 
If workers are protected against sexual harassment by a state agency rather than by their union shop steward , the employee &apos;s rights will be adequately protected . 
If it is legislation rather than a clause in a union contract that regulates health and safety conditions in the workplace , a factory &apos;s air will smell just as sweet . 
But a century of experience in America and other parts of the world demonstrates that , by itself , no legal-regulatory system can enforce , by administrative order or judicial ruling , the inner life of millions of workplaces . 
As anti-sweatshop and human rights advocates in places like Malaysia and South China understand , no regime of rights is possible without hearing from workers , whose voices will remain silent unless some institution protects them from the consequences of speaking up . 
The history of social regulation in the industrial West is unambiguous : systematic , organized pressure at the workplace is essential to breathing life into the rights enshrined in statute books . 
Without a new burst of trade unionism in poor countries , the worldwide movement to insure human and labor rights will lose momentum and stall , turning hope into helplessness for millions of desperate workers .
