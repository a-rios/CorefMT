China &apos;s Next Mountain to Climb 
MILAN - China is entering a complex set of transitions that will lay the foundations for the advanced-country status that it hopes to reach in the next 25 years . 
After three decades of sustained growth and a remarkably successful policy response to the recent global crisis , Chinese self-confidence is soaring . 
But the lessons that the government may draw from the crisis may not be the best guides for the long term . 
China faces several parallel and related challenges that are crucial for its internal development as well as its global economic relations . 
Among these are : 
● a major microeconomic restructuring of the economy to anchor the country &apos;s emerging middle income country status ; 
● a macroeconomic shift to a higher level of household income and consumption and a more rapid expansion of the middle class ; 
● a reversal of the country &apos;s now rising income inequality ; lowering the very high savings level relative to investment and thus reducing the current-account surplus ; 
● reducing the energy and carbon intensity of future growth ; 
● assuming greater global responsibilities . 
Indeed , China has arrived at a point where its impact on the global economy is systemically important . 
But it has reached this point at a much lower level of per capita income than any systemically important predecessor . The reason is that China is , by far , the most populous country to have sustained very rapid growth for 30 years . 
So reckoning with the country &apos;s global impact has been added to an already complex policy agenda , at a point when most countries have the luxury of maintaining a largely domestic focus . 
China needs to balance these domestic and international priorities , but it has very little historical experience to guide it . 
( India will take on this problem in about a decade , as it continues on its rapid-growth path . ) 
With a per capita income of around $ 4000 ( more with purchasing power adjustments ) , important parts of China &apos;s economy are already , or are now entering , middle-income status . 
This is a difficult transition , during which many countries have lost momentum as structural transformations stall . 
For example , China &apos;s labor-intensive export sectors are losing their competitive edge . 
They must be allowed to decline or move inland ( and eventually decline ) . 
They will be replaced by sectors that rely more on technology and human capital . 
In this transition , services will undoubtedly grow . 
Higher value-added sectors and functions that are upstream and downstream from processing industries will also need to flourish . 
Global brands should start to appear , and government ownership of enterprises will continue to diminish . 
Public-sector investment will shift toward education and R D. 
Global and domestic markets , rather than China &apos;s government , will increasingly drive this transition . 
Targeting of sectors will decline . 
Urbanization will accelerate with supporting public-sector investment . 
Household disposable income is about 60 % of national income in China , and the household savings rate is close to 30 % of disposable income . 
These numbers are low and high , respectively , compared to other countries . 
For China , this puts consumption in the range of 40-45 % of GDP . 
To empower the domestic market to drive income growth , and to accelerate the growth of the middle class , these numbers need to shift . 
Household income must rise , and , with more ample provision of social security , insurance , and services , precautionary savings should fall . 
Both will support the middle-income transition by expanding the domestic market as a driver of growth , and will help sustain growth in the face of prospectively weaker global demand . 
But , most important , rapid growth of the domestic market , especially the service sector , needs to largely replace the export sector as the employment engine pulling the rural population into the modern economy . 
As the export sector moves into higher value-added sectors , it will no longer serve this function as effectively as it did in the past . 
China &quot; s corporate sector has financed much of its investment out of retained earnings without having to raise capital from the household sector . 
The government continues to own more than 50 % of remaining state-owned enterprises , but does not need or use the income . 
A big portion of these two income streams ( corporate and government ) needs to be redirected to the household sector . 
High growth and urbanization have caused rapid rises in incomes in urban areas , with smaller increases in the rural areas . 
A large group of migrant workers and families ( on the order of 150 to 200 million people ) are formally still rural , but in fact are marginal urban residents with constrained rights and access to services . 
The resulting rise in social tensions is being addressed through expanded provision of rural services , investment in urban infrastructure and service provision , and regularization of migrants &quot; status . 
China has faced daunting challenges in the past - and has generally outperformed the forecasts of skeptics . 
But now China must face global pressures and responsibilities as well . 
But China also faces an external environment that is occasionally hostile to the country &apos;s form of government ; that sometimes overlooks or undervalues the rapid rise of millions of Chinese from poverty ; that tends to view the global economy as a zero-sum game ; and that mistakenly attributes China &apos;s economic success to non-cooperative policies in areas like exchange-rate management . 
China must confront the challenge of domestic restructuring to sustain growth , while asserting the right to develop without being penalized because of its size . 
But it must also assume greater responsibility for global imbalances , economic and financial stability , and governance , as well as represent the interests of less powerful developing countries . 
The rest of the world has a huge stake in the outcome of this complex balancing act .
