Does Anything Matter ? 
OXFORD - Can moral judgments be true or false ? 
Or is ethics , at bottom , a purely subjective matter , for individuals to choose , or perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives ? 
We might have just found out the answer . 
Among philosophers , the view that moral judgments state objective truths has been out of fashion since the 1930 &quot; s , when logical positivists asserted that , because there seems to be no way of verifying the truth of moral judgments , they cannot be anything other than expressions of our feelings or attitudes . 
So , for example , when we say , &quot; You ought not to hit that child , &quot; all we are really doing is expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child , or encouraging you to stop hitting the child . 
There is no truth to the matter of whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child . 
Although this view of ethics has often been challenged , many of the objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to God &apos;s commands . 
Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy . 
Other defenses of objective truth in ethics made no appeal to religion , but could make little headway against the prevailing philosophical mood . 
Last month , however , saw a major philosophical event : the publication of Derek Parfit &apos;s long-awaited book On What Matters . 
Until now , Parfit , who is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College , Oxford , had written only one book , Reasons and Persons , which appeared in 1984 , to great acclaim . 
Parfit &apos;s entirely secular arguments , and the comprehensive way in which he tackles alternative positions , have , for the first time in decades , put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive . 
On What Matters is a book of daunting length : two large volumes , totaling more than 1,400 pages , of densely argued text . 
But the core of the argument comes in the first 400 pages , which is not an insurmountable challenge for the intellectually curious - particularly given that Parfit , in the best tradition of English-language philosophy , always strives for lucidity , never using obscure words where simple ones will do . 
Each sentence is straightforward , the argument is clear , and Parfit often uses vivid examples to make his points . 
Thus , the book is an intellectual treat for anyone who wants to understand not so much &quot; what matters &quot; as whether anything really can matter , in an objective sense . 
Many people assume that rationality is always instrumental : reason can tell us only how to get what we want , but our basic wants and desires are beyond the scope of reasoning . 
Not so , Parfit argues . 
Just as we can grasp the truth that 1 + 1 = 2 , so we can see that I have a reason to avoid suffering agony at some future time , regardless of whether I now care about , or have desires about , whether I will suffer agony at that time . 
We can also have reasons ( though not always conclusive reasons ) to prevent others from suffering agony . 
Such self-evident normative truths provide the basis for Parfit &apos;s defense of objectivity in ethics . 
One major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong , and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused . 
If great thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham disagree about what we ought to do , can there really be an objectively true answer to that question ? 
Parfit &apos;s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics . 
He considers three leading theories about what we ought to do - one deriving from Kant , one from the social-contract tradition of Hobbes , Locke , Rousseau , and the contemporary philosophers John Rawls and T.M. Scanlon , and one from Bentham &apos;s utilitarianism - and argues that the Kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible . 
Then he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism , which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism . 
If Parfit is right , there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought . 
The defenders of each of these theories are , in Parfit &apos;s vivid phrase , &quot; climbing the same mountain on different sides . &quot; 
Readers who go to On What Matters seeking an answer to the question posed by its title might be disappointed . 
Parfit &apos;s real interest is in combating subjectivism and nihilism . 
Unless he can show that objectivism is true , he believes , nothing matters . 
When Parfit does come to the question of &quot; what matters , &quot; his answer might seem surprisingly obvious . 
He tells us , for example , that what matters most now is that &quot; we rich people give up some of our luxuries , ceasing to overheat the Earth &apos;s atmosphere , and taking care of this planet in other ways , so that it continues to support intelligent life . &quot; 
Many of us had already reached that conclusion . 
What we gain from Parfit &apos;s work is the possibility of defending these and other moral claims as objective truths .
