A Neighborly Option for Iran 
YEREVAN - Once again , the issue of bombing or sanctioning Iran has resurfaced . 
For years , debate about Iran has oscillated between two bad alternatives . 
Some are convinced that a nuclear Iran is the worst of all possible scenarios , worse even than the fall-out from a pre-emptive strike . 
But neither a nuclear-armed Iran nor air strikes against it are wise options , certainly not for this region . 
The repercussions of bombing Iran should be clear : closure of the Straits of Hormuz , skyrocketing oil prices , possible retaliation against Israel ( regardless of the origin of the attack ) , and even greater turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Indeed , the only certainty of any pre-emptive strike is irreparable and long-lasting damage to regional security and political and economic stability . 
Of course , the alternative is no safer . 
A nuclear-armed Iran would change the entire region &apos;s security environment , and , given the enmity between Israel and Iran , two such nuclear powers facing off against each other would pose a threat . 
The way out of this dilemma is to understand what Iran wants - and how to accommodate it without jeopardizing anyone &apos;s security . 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that Iran wants to develop uranium enrichment technology for industrial use . 
Everyone agrees that Iran has the right to do so . 
But the world is split over whether to believe that Iran is actually doing what it says . 
If as some argue Iran is being disingenuous , then once it achieves this first phase - uranium enrichment for industrial purposes - it can easily slide into weapons-grade enrichment , leaving the international community out in the cold , with no channels of communication , no observation teams in place , and no monitors ready to sound the whistle . 
That is why the world must not remain focused on the already-lost first phase . 
Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges despite all the international sanctions and threats . 
Instead , the world must focus on the second phase , because it is weapons potential that is the looming danger , and it is here that internationally mandated mechanisms for oversight and supervision exist . 
The Iranians have always said that they will continue to honor their commitments and open their doors to observation as members of the non-proliferation community . 
But the international community must be more respectful of Iran &apos;s current industrial aims if it wants Iranian cooperation . 
The first step is to assuage Iran &apos;s feeling of being besieged . 
Fortunately , there are voices in America and elsewhere that advocate engaging Iran at the highest level . 
But , to talk with Iran effectively , one must understand Iranian values and thinking . 
Iranians have a sense of seniority , if not superiority , born of a rich and ancient culture that has survived into modern times . 
But they also have a historically ingrained sense of insecurity , owing to frequent conquest and domination , which is being aggravated today by the presence of American troops to their west in Iraq and to their east in Afghanistan . 
Their outlook nowadays is the product of these two worldviews - suspicious of others &quot; motives and proud of themselves as smart , tough negotiators and not without their own resources . 
In my meetings with the current and past leaders of Syria and Iran , as well as in my meeting with Saddam Hussein , I heard them all say the same thing : the West is out to get them . 
Their explanation was that the West is uncomfortable with the motives and behavior of ideological states - Syria , Iran , and Iraq under Saddam were states with causes - Islam , Arab unity , or anti-Zionism . 
For Iranians , as bearers of faith and national pride , responses that seem to others self-righteous and irrational are , in fact , necessary and acceptable . 
The case of Saddam &apos;s weapons of mass destruction is a historic example of a willingness to go to hell with your head held high . 
Saddam knew that he didn &apos;t have weapons of mass destruction , but he was unwilling to concede the right of inspectors to ask . 
As in North Korea , Iran &apos;s neighbors might provide the right mechanism to create a more transparent relationship between Iran and the world . 
In the so-called &quot; six-party talks , &quot; North Korea &apos;s neighbors offered tangible incentives to Kim Jong-il &apos;s regime to abandon its nuclear program . The most prominent of these was an end to North Korea &apos;s economic isolation . 
Iran , too , feels besieged , though it is not isolated : it depends heavily on trade , and not just as a seller of oil . 
Two-thirds of its population is under the age of 30 , and unemployment is high ; it needs to attract foreign investment for its oil and gas industry , and to finance road construction and other infrastructure projects . 
Comparisons with neighboring Turkey are instructive . 
Before Iran &apos;s Islamic revolution , it led Turkey in foreign direct investment , income per head , and GDP growth . 
Now Turkey has moved ahead , and may even join the European Union . 
Other regional comparisons further reinforce that trend . 
The Qataris have outstripped them in exploiting the huge gas field they share . 
Tiny Dubai draws in far more foreign investment : Iranians go there for banking , trade , and fun . 
Iran &apos;s neighbors need to convince Iran &apos;s rulers that Iranians , too , can participate in the region &apos;s growth , and even become regional leaders . 
Only an open Iran , fully integrated into the regional economy and granted a role commensurate to its size and economic potential , will be able to moderate its siege mentality . 
Here , a vital step would be for the West to begin to envisage Iran as a potential alternative supplier of gas , by offering to link Iran to the proposed White Stream and Nabucco pipelines that are currently under development to bring Central Asian gas to Europe . 
The world &apos;s judgments about Iran &apos;s motives and actions should not be distorted by Iranian pride . 
We can only understand Iran &apos;s real intentions by engaging the Iranians - not cornering them .
