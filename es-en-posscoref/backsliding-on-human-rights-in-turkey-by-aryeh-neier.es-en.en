Turkey &apos;s Imprisoned Press 
PARIS - According to two pro-government newspapers in Turkey , Star and Yeni Akit , as well as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan himself , those who denounce the state of press freedom in Turkey are &quot; terrorists . &quot; 
That is the term that they were using last week to denounce the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists and the Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontières , both of which have issued reports saying that Turkey has imprisoned even more journalists than Iran and China . 
Last October , the CPJ reported that there were 76 journalists imprisoned in Turkey , including 61 who were in jail for their journalistic work . 
While the latter number declined to 49 by December , after some of those held were freed by the courts , that is still a lot of journalists to hold in prison . 
The situation is especially dismaying , given that , for several years , Turkey &apos;s human-rights performance had been improving dramatically under Erdoğan &apos;s leadership . 
The use of torture had declined sharply . 
The cultural rights of the large Kurdish minority , including the right to use their own language , had advanced greatly . 
Military control over the civilian government had been ended . 
And more . 
Yet , as Erdoğan and his moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party have consolidated their power and their control of the country , their tolerance for dissent has declined . 
Today , Internet freedom has largely disappeared . 
Legislation provides for mandatory filtering of content , and many Web sites have been blocked for reasons that range from facilitating the use of drugs or stimulants to offenses under the Law on Crimes against Atatürk ( the founder of the modern Turkish state and Turkey &apos;s national hero ) . 
Though it is the Turkish government that is to blame for the precipitous decline in press freedom , the policies of the European Union and the United States have been contributing factors . 
The EU had indicated that performance on human rights would be a key factor in determining whether Turkey would be admitted as a member . 
Yet it was during the period of rapid progress on human rights that Europe seemed to turn its back on the country . 
This outcome undermined those in Turkey who had promoted human-rights reforms . 
Their claims that progress would lead to accession were shown to be false , and an important incentive for officials was eliminated . 
If the process leading to EU accession is put back on track , it will greatly aid the effort to ensure that Turkey becomes an open society . 
The US government , for its part , tends to speak softly when it comes to human-rights abuses in Turkey . 
During the Cold War , Turkey &apos;s strategic value , given its geographic proximity to the Soviet Union , outweighed other concerns . 
Today , geography still plays a role , though it is Turkey &apos;s contiguity with Syria , Iraq , and Iran that has left the US reluctant to make a fuss about press freedom . 
The US has supported Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU , but its efforts would have more credibility in Europe if it also pressed Turkey to address its shortcomings . 
The situation is far from hopeless . 
Turkey has a lively civil society , with proudly independent institutions that include some renowned universities . 
The period of rapid progress is not in the distant past . 
Europe would strengthen itself economically and militarily if Turkey became a member , and it should revive accession negotiations on the same basis as other member states if Turkey meets the political criteria , including press freedom . 
With John Kerry &apos;s arrival as Secretary of State , the US ought to recognize that such a large Islamic country in a troubled neighborhood should show leadership on human-rights issues . 
As a role model for the region , it is especially important that Turkey should practice press freedom . 
If Europe and the US do their part , Erdoğan may be persuaded to resume the role of human-rights reformer that he played during his first several years in office .
