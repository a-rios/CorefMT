A Pig &apos;s Breakfast 
LONDON - The Greek debt problem has been poorly handled by Europe &apos;s decision-makers . 
European Union heads of government , and the European Central Bank , initially rejected the idea of involving the International Monetary Fund , but without a fall-back plan . 
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that part of the motivation for this was French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s reluctance to see Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the IMF &apos;s managing director , ride in from Washington to the rescue of the eurozone . 
Strauss-Kahn is , of course , likely to be Sarkozy &apos;s Socialist rival in the next French presidential election . 
Is Greece the &quot; canary in the coalmine &quot; - the warning that tells us that Europe &apos;s monetary union is on the verge of dissolution , with the other three of the famous PIGS ( Portugal , Italy , and Spain ) lining up like dominoes to fall ? 
George Soros fears this might be the case , and gives the eurozone only a 50 % chance of survival in its present form . 
Certainly , the episode highlighted flaws in the way the euro &apos;s governance - flaws that are no surprise to some of those involved in creating the common currency . 
Helmut Kohl , one of the euro &apos;s principal parents , said in 1991 that &quot; the idea of sustaining an economic and monetary union over time without political union is a fallacy . &quot; 
Margaret Thatcher , from the opposite camp , said in her memoirs : &quot; I believe the European single currency is bound to fail , economically , politically and indeed socially , although the timing , occasion and consequences are all still unclear . &quot; 
There may now be a market for a Greek translation of her book . 
Although they might not agree with either of these two apocalyptic predictions , many of Europe &apos;s leaders are coming round to the view that there is a need for change , and that the Greek case has revealed a flaw at the center of the project . 
Sarkozy , for example , has revived a long-standing French argument for some form of economic government in Europe as a counterweight to the ECB . 
The French usually advance this proposal to get some purchase on the ECB &apos;s monetary decisions , which they sometimes consider hostile to growth and employment , or in order to prevent other countries from maintaining unfair tax policies ( &quot; unfair &quot; usually being defined as a tax rate lower than the relevant French one ) . 
In the past , the Germans brushed these arguments aside , but now they are a little more receptive . 
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble , however , focuses on the issue of distressed members , and has advanced a proposal for a European Monetary Fund to provide assistance to countries in Greek-style difficulties , roughly on the IMF model . 
This idea has logic behind it . 
The drawback is that it would require a change in the European treaties , which in turn requires a unanimous decision by 27 countries , and positive votes in referendums in some of them , including the United Kingdom if David Cameron &apos;s Conservatives win the upcoming general election there . 
In the aftermath of the negative referendum votes in France , the Netherlands , and Ireland on European constitutional reform , it is close to inconceivable that EU heads of government would agree to set off down that path again . 
Certainly nothing could be achieved on a timetable that would offer any comfort to the other PIGS . 
They would all be bacon and sausages before any agreement was reached . 
So , in the short run , the IMF will have to be used , if that kind of support is needed , and Sarkozy will have to swallow his pride . 
But is an EMF really what is required in the long run ? 
I think not . 
Nor do I think that a European economic government is strictly necessary . 
What is needed , though , is a collective agreement on fiscal discipline , and a revival of the Stability and Growth Pact , which was unwisely abandoned - ironically when the French and Germans found its rules too constraining . 
Europe &apos;s leaders should refer to a paper by Otmar Issing , &quot; The Euro - A Currency Without a State , &quot; published in December 2008 , before the debt crisis erupted . 
Issing , the ECB &apos;s chief economist in its formative years , knows more about how a monetary union operates in practice than any man alive . 
He maintains that &quot; the Stability and Growth Pact contains all the rules that are necessary for Monetary Union to function . 
There is no need for coordination of macroeconomic policies to go any further than this . &quot; 
Europe does not need the French plan for coordination of tax policies , or another IMF , but there does need to be fiscal discipline to prevent other countries from free riding , as the Greeks seem to have done . 
They apparently assumed that the rest of Europe would overlook continuing high deficits , and that , as eurozone members , the market would consider their debt to be just like German bunds , though issued by friendly and welcoming people in an agreeable climate , and with a glass of ouzo on the side . 
The original Pact envisaged a 3 % -of-GDP cap on fiscal deficits , save in exceptional circumstances . 
Investors well understand that we are in such circumstances now , so it will take some time to get back to that level . 
But that should be the clear aim , with IMF assistance along the way to provide interim funding where necessary and political cover for governments obliged to take tough decisions on public spending and taxation . 
Fiscal discipline does not sound as visionary as &quot; economic government . &quot; 
But the EU has suffered from a surfeit of &quot; vision &quot; and a deficit of practical budgetary measures . 
It is time to redress that balance , or Soros &apos;s gloomy prognosis may become reality .
