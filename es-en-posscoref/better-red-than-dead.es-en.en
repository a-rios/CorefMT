Better Red than Dead ? 
Will the inexorable rise in medical costs around the world someday pose a major challenge to contemporary capitalism ? 
I submit that in the not-so-distant future , moral , social , and political support for capitalism will be severely tested as would-be egalitarian health systems face ever-rising costs . 
Rising incomes , population aging , and new technologies for extending and enhancing life , have caused health costs to rise 3.5 % faster than overall income for many decades now in the United States . 
Some leading economists project that health expenditures , which already constitute 16 % of the US economy , will rise to 30 % of GDP by 2030 , and perhaps approach 50 % later in the century . 
Other rich and middle-income countries , although typically spending only half what the US does today , won &apos;t lag far behind . 
Countries in Europe and elsewhere have shielded their citizens from a part of this rise by piggybacking on US technological advances . 
Ultimately , though , they face the same upward cost pressures . 
Hasn &apos;t the start of the twenty-first century marked the death of all other ideologies , with China &apos;s raw capitalism putting pressure on gentler forms in Europe and elsewhere ? 
The problem is that attitudes towards healthcare are fundamentally different . 
Many societies view healthcare as a right , not a luxury . 
When medical expenses constituted only a small percentage of income , as was typically the case 50 years ago , an egalitarian approach to healthcare was a small extravagance . 
The direct and indirect costs were relatively minor and affordable . 
But as health expenses start taking up a third of national income , healthcare socialism starts becoming just plain Marxism : to each according to his needs . 
Even China &apos;s authoritarian capitalism will someday feel the pressure , as its rural populations , who currently have little access to doctors or hospitals , eventually explode with discontent . 
One often hears about rising healthcare costs in the context of future government budget projections , with old-age health costs expected to dominate growth in government expenditures in coming years . 
But a careful look at the projections by , say , the US Congressional Budget Office , show that the aging of our societies is only a part of the problem , and not the larger part . 
The real issue is whether societies are willing to provide elderly people with equal access to ever newer and improved medical techniques . 
A change on the horizon that will exacerbate current frictions is the growing importance of individualized health care . 
For most of modern history , relatively inexpensive public health precautions , such as providing clean drinking water and routine vaccinations , have been the main factor pushing up life expectancy . 
Public health measures have trumped the importance of individual care . 
But today , the balance is shifting . 
Heart operations are already a major factor in extending life in many rich countries . 
Sophisticated X-ray diagnostic techniques such as CT scans make it possible to detect many cancers at a treatable stage . 
Some drug researchers predict that with continuing advances in understanding the human genome , doctors may eventually be able to predict illnesses 15-20 years in advance , and begin prophylactic treatment immediately . 
( With some experts predicting that individuals will routinely live beyond 110-115 years by mid-century , one might wonder what all this will do to other social conventions such as marriage , but I will leave this thought to another day . ) 
In addition to reducing mortality , new medical techniques can also have a huge effect on the quality of life . 
Roughly 250,000 hip replacements are performed in the US each year . 
Under-60 patients are becoming more important as newer artificial joints prove their capacity to withstand more active lifestyles . 
At $ 6,000 , the average cost of a hip replacement is only a thousandth the cost of what it supposedly took to implant a bionic arm , eye , and two legs on the fictional &quot; The Six Million Dollar Man &quot; in the popular mid-1970 &quot; s TV show . 
Of course , hip replacement patients don &apos;t get super-human speed , strength , and vision - at least not yet . 
If Tour de France officials think they have big problems now with steroids , just wait ten years . 
In principle , greater use of market mechanisms to allocate health care can slow or even temporarily reverse the rise in healthcare costs . 
But improved efficiency has its limits . 
Ultimately , the evidence suggests that societies spend ever-larger fractions of their income on health over time , in contrast to food expenditures , for example , which fall as countries become wealthier . 
Spending pressures , in turn , lead to acceleration of innovation . 
This raises long-term well being all around , but exacerbates short-term inequalities and frictions . 
I am not arguing against healthcare capitalism , but warning that support will become fragile , far more so than for , say , globalization nowadays . 
Most countries rely far too much on command and control , and provide far too few incentives for patients and providers to make efficient choices . 
Nevertheless , it remains to be seen whether healthcare pressures will ultimately cause the current trend towards free ( and freer ) market capitalism to reverse , with a very large chunk of the economy reverting to a more socialist system . 
Some societies might decide that it is better to be red than dead .
