How Can Qurei Succeed ? 
The new Palestinian Prime Minister , Ahmed Qurei , faces daunting challenges . 
He must tread between the shrapnel shards of constant Israeli military actions against the Palestinians , the ambivalence of the US about the road map , and a plethora of militant Palestinian groups seeking revenge for every one of their assassinated leaders . 
This sickening cycle of violence is all too predictable . 
It need not be inevitable . 
Breaking the sequence of Israeli assassination followed by Palestinian suicide bombing requires a change of thinking and action . 
The idea that either side can crush the other and declare victory has proven to be a seductive and dangerous mirage , leaving behind only a trail of blood and hate . 
Israeli leaders must be made to understand that preemptive attacks and assassinations only increase the chance of more anti-Israeli attacks , not less . 
So far , the right-wing Sharon government , which seems to give only lip service to peace , is more than happy to engage in military actions that it knows will lead to Palestinian retaliations . 
As harsh Israeli actions fail to deter Palestinians , Israel seems to raise the stakes , hoping that even harsher , more inhuman acts might bring the Palestinians to heel . 
Instead , brutal Israeli actions produce only more determined Palestinian reaction , and the cycle of killing and violence continues . 
The US government must change its attitude , too . 
Instead of stating that they understand that Israeli must defend itself , the Bush administration should take an unambiguous stand against Israel &apos;s assassinations and collective punishments , which now include uprooting decades-old olive trees and destroying eight story buildings . 
Travel restrictions and continued settlement activity must end . 
If the Americans can get Israel to agree to these straightforward requests , the situation could be ripe for a ceasefire , which in turn would be the prelude to a genuine peace process . 
Until recently , Israeli officials have publicly and privately refused to respond to the Palestinian request for a ceasefire agreement . 
Instead , they press for the impossible request that the Palestinian Authority dismantle the militant groups , an act that Israel , with all its powers , has not succeeded in accomplishing . 
A deadly civil war would surely ensue if the Palestinian Authority seeks to crush Palestinian militants at a time of relentless Israeli attacks and no tangible progress in the peace talks . 
Any ceasefire agreement requires both parties to refrain from attacking the other . 
Such agreements normally include a clause creating a mandate for neutral third-party monitors . 
But a ceasefire agreement to stand , it must be followed immediately with a concerted effort to produce a political solution to the issues that caused the warring parties to attack each other . 
The hudna worked out between militant Palestinian groups and the Palestinian Authority ( with the knowledge of the Americans ) clearly lacked a major component : Israel &apos;s assent to the agreement . 
Israel &apos;s insistence in continuing its assassination policy led , predictably , to a violent reaction - a pattern of assassinations followed by revenge suicide bombings and then further assassinations , with neither side prepared to blink . 
But Israel &apos;s belief that one more assassination will cause the Palestinians to crumble , and the Palestinian belief that one more suicide attack will cause the Israelis to raise the white flag have led both sides to a dead end . 
India &apos;s Mahatma Ghandi once said that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth leaves the world blind and toothless . 
There must be a stop to this zero-sum game and a return to a sane policy based on reason , reciprocity , and compromise . 
The pattern of the past three years shows that the first order of business must be a ceasefire between the Israeli government ( and all its military and intelligence agencies ) and the Palestinian Authority ( including all the militant factions ) . 
Such an agreement must end all types of military and armed attacks as well as assassinations , and it needs to be monitored by a neutral third party - namely , the quartet ( the US , the UN , the EU , and Russia ) that drew up the road map , which already contains a provision for foreign monitors . 
Finally a ceasefire must be supported by round-the-clock negotiations ( preferably in secret with top-level US involvement ) aimed at ending the basic reason for the violence - the occupation of the Palestinian areas - and determining the issues of borders , settlements , refugees , and Jerusalem . 
In this context , Israel must put aside thoughts of choosing its negotiating partners . 
Palestinian President Yasir Arafat is the legitimately elected leader of the Palestinian people . 
No serious negotiations can take place and no results can last if one party vetoes the representatives of the other side . 
Real peace presupposes agreement between enemies , not friends . 
Everyone involved in attempting to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict knows what a peace agreement between the sides will most likely look like . 
In Taba , Palestinian and Israeli negotiators were very close to agreement on all the major issues early in 2001 . 
President Bush &apos;s vision of a state of a free and independent Palestine established in 2005 alongside a safe and secure state of Israel could also be used as a benchmark for fresh talks .
