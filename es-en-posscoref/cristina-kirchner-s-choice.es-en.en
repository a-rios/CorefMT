Cristina Kirchner &apos;s Choice 
BUENOS AIRES - Bolstered by Argentina &apos;s economic stability and widespread sympathy for her widowhood , President Cristina Kirchner &apos;s easy re-election has confirmed that she can , indeed , govern a complex , contentious , and at times self-destructive society without her husband , Néstor . 
His presidency paved the way for hers , but she is a leader in her own right . 
The question now is what kind of leader she will want to be in today &apos;s more difficult domestic and international context . 
The Kirchners lifted Argentina out of the deep crisis of 2001 , presiding over GDP growth rates similar to those of China . 
They partly restored Argentina &apos;s social and political fabric , which had been weakened by the brutal adjustments made during that crisis , which triggered a president &apos;s fall from power , default on the country &apos;s debts , and a dramatic decline in living standards that left more than half of the population below the poverty line . 
Their management of the economy , which included a deluge of subsidies , reduced unemployment and poverty . 
The opposition underestimates the Kirchners &quot; achievements , arguing that the international context , particularly high commodity prices - and thus strong export revenues - bailed them out . 
While that is true , high export prices alone were no guarantee for success . 
But that tailwind may have been squandered , because the Kirchners have yet to make the structural changes - in industry , in the country &apos;s energy policy , in education , and elsewhere - needed to free Argentina from extreme dependence on commodity prices . 
As a result , if the price of soy continues to fall , subsidies - a source of corruption and patronage - will be an increasingly heavy burden for public spending . 
According to unofficial figures , subsidies already represent 5 % of GDP , and only painful adjustments can reduce them . 
But what was an emergency remedy has become a long-term policy , because there is no economic activity to take its place . 
Few in Argentina , which is enjoying a consumer boom , are worried about inflation . 
Moreover , given the country &apos;s history of high inflation ravaging the economy , the problem needs to be addressed soon , before it gets out of hand . 
Relations with Brazil expose other difficulties . 
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff &apos;s government , which began its term this year with an understanding that economic growth will slow sharply , devalued the real in order to shore up the country &apos;s competitiveness . 
That was bad news for Argentina , because Brazil , its main trading partner , will now buy less and sell more , undermining Argentina &apos;s external position . 
In this difficult international context , Cristina Kirchner will need to rebuild relations with the United States and Europe , which have been impaired since the default in 2001 . 
Subsequent actions by her husband &apos;s administration and her own have blocked improvement . Néstor ridiculed President George W. Bush in front of the world : host to a summit of heads of state , he organized a parallel anti-summit with supporters of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . 
More recently , Cristina &apos;s foreign minister presided over the requisitioning of a US military plane on Argentinean soil . 
These spectacles were intended for national consumption , but the Americans deeply resented them . 
As for Europe , the Kirchner &apos;s have not yet paid off Argentina &apos;s debt - pending since the default - to the Paris Club of sovereign creditors . 
All of this hinders foreign investment and access to international credit . 
In the meantime , the US is opposed to concessionary loans for Argentina from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank . 
In this context , Argentina &apos;s rich and powerful vote with their wallets and send their dollars overseas . 
This year , the outflow is nearly $ 20 billion - almost a record . 
Argentina is a country that lives in an almost continual state of emergency . 
Its history has seen many coups , tens of thousands of people missing , a war with Great Britain , bouts of hyperinflation , a brutal economic crisis , default on foreign debt , and its most vulnerable citizens going hungry . 
But there is also a theatrical intensity about the Argentine character : we are dramatic like the tango and somber like the novels of Ernesto Sábato . 
That exceptional spirit benefited her husband , but the country &apos;s institutions paid a high price . 
Later , he took the liberty of manipulating official statistics in order to hide inflation . 
And , while building a system that would do whatever the government wanted , he began a struggle against critical journalism that continues under his wife . 
With hard times approaching , will Cristina try to be a twenty-first-century Evita and create an epic by exploiting Argentines &quot; flamboyant tendencies , armed with an exceptional power or will she adopt Rouseff &apos;s sensible attitude and combat inefficiency and corruption while strengthening governmental institutions ? 
If she chooses Rouseff &apos;s approach , she will first have to resist the temptation of perpetual re-election . 
She and her husband had hit upon a novel scheme : alternating power between them every four years . 
Now a widow , she is exposed to the lame-duck syndrome , since she can &apos;t be re-elected again . 
The same Peronist caudillos that have obeyed her until now could start a war of succession if she does not find a way to continue in office . 
If she wants to retain power four years from now , she might do just that . 
After all , she now holds absolute control over a docile parliament . 
In Argentina , as in many Latin American countries , presidents have so much power that other governmental institutions &quot; authority fades , eradicating the boundaries between the executive and the state . 
If the only limits on Cristina are her own , Argentina will not weather the coming storm well .
