Krugman &apos;s Anti-Cameron Contradiction 
NEW YORK - It is truly odd to read Paul Krugman rail , time and again , against the British government . 
His latest screed begins with the claim that &quot; Britain &apos;s economic performance since the financial crisis struck has been startlingly bad . &quot; 
He excoriates Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government for its &quot; poor economic record , &quot; and wonders how he and his cabinet can possibly pose &quot; as the guardians of prosperity . &quot; 
Hmm . 
In recent months , Krugman has repeatedly praised the US economic recovery under President Barack Obama , while attacking the United Kingdom &apos;s record . 
Consider , first , the unemployment rate . 
In the fourth quarter of 2007 , the UK &apos;s rate was 5.2 % . 
When Cameron &apos;s government took office in May 2010 , it was 7.9 % . 
In the most recent reporting period ( November 2014-January 2015 ) , it was 5.7 % . 
In the US , the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 4.8 % , 9.8 % in March-May 2010 , and 5.7 % in November 2014-January 2015 . 
In both countries , the unemployment rate is therefore slightly above the pre-crisis ( end-2007 ) level , with no significant net difference over the business cycle from the end of 2007 until now . 
Next , let &apos;s look at the employment rate , which in the UK stood at 72.9 % of the population aged 16-64 at the end of 2007 . 
It fell to 70.4 % by the time the Cameron government came to power , but since then has risen strongly , to 73.3 % in November 2014-January 2015 , an all-time high . 
In the US , by contrast , the employment rate was 62.8 % at the end of 2007 , 58.6 % in March-May 2010 , and then only slightly higher , at 59.2 % , during November 2014-January 2015 - still below the pre-crisis level . 
This suggests that there are more discouraged workers in the US than in the UK . 
Finally , there is output growth . 
It then rose by 8.1 % from that point until the fourth quarter of 2014 . 
In the US , real GDP fell by 1.6 % from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2010 , and then rose by 10.5 % from then until the fourth quarter of 2014 . 
Thus , both countries have experienced moderately high and broadly similar growth rates since May 2010 , when Cameron &apos;s government took power . 
Yes , UK growth has been slightly slower , but the British economy has also faced , among other factors , the headwind of sharply falling North Sea oil production during this period , whereas the US benefited from a shale-oil boom . 
Obviously , neither of these long-term trends can be fairly attributed to the governments currently in office . 
In any case , during the past two years , from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2014 , the US economy grew by a cumulative 5.6 % while the UK economy grew by 5.4 % , essentially the same as the US . 
Krugman seems to make much of the fact that the UK did not bounce back even more strongly from a larger output decline between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2010 - a fall that occurred before the Cameron government took office . 
That is true , and measured UK productivity growth has remained low , but nobody can be sure why . 
Perhaps the unsustainable pre-2008 bubble was larger in the UK ; perhaps the UK &apos;s structure ( particularly the larger share of finance in its GDP and the continued decline in energy output ) made the initial downturn less reversible . 
The UK has been more vulnerable than the US to the eurozone &apos;s prolonged crisis . 
Moreover , subtle differences between the US and UK in national income accounting should be taken into account in comparing productivity trends . 
The International Monetary Fund &apos;s estimate of the output gap ( see its World Economic Outlook database ) for both countries does not suggest that , as of 2014 , the UK is more cyclically depressed than the US . 
The IMF puts the UK output gap ( as a percent of potential GDP ) at 1.2 % , compared to 3.5 % in the US . 
The fact is that the US and UK economies look rather alike in their overall cyclical patterns , with sharp downturns from 2007 to 2010 followed by recoveries in both jobs and GDP since then , and with a fairly rapid pace of recovery in the past two years . 
So , if Krugman praises the Obama recovery , he should also praise the Cameron recovery . 
They are very similar . 
Perhaps more notable is that both the US and UK economies have cast considerable doubt on Krugman &apos;s oft-repeated view that a robust recovery would require further fiscal stimulus , a position that he maintained at least until 2013 . 
The post-2010 recoveries in both countries came despite significant cuts in the structural ( cyclically adjusted ) budget deficit , suggesting that both recoveries occurred in the face of fiscal contraction . 
According to the IMF estimates , the structural budget deficit was cut from 8.4 % of potential GDP in 2010 to 4.1 % in 2014 in the UK , and from 9.1 % to 4 % in the US during the same period . 
Rather than lambasting Cameron while lauding Obama , Krugman should be praising both countries for their recoveries . 
The truth is that - barring another Greek tragedy - both the UK and US are finally out of the post-2008 crisis . 
It is time for both countries to move beyond short-term macroeconomic policy and turn their attention to the challenges of long-term sustainable development .
