Missing Growth Multipliers 
PRINCETON - In April 2010 , when the global economy was beginning to recover from the shock of the 2008-2009 financial crisis , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s World Economic Outlook predicted that global GDP growth would exceed 4 % in 2010 , with a steady annual growth rate of 4.5 % maintained through 2015 . 
But the forecast proved to be far too optimistic . 
In fact , global growth has decelerated . 
In its most recent WEO , the IMF forecasts global GDP to grow by only 3.3 % in 2012 , and by 3.6 % in 2013 . 
Moreover , the downgrading of growth prospects is remarkably widespread . 
The forecast errors have three potential sources : failure to recognize the time needed for economic recovery after a financial crisis ; underestimation of the &quot; fiscal multipliers &quot; ( the size of output loss owing to fiscal austerity ) ; and neglect of the &quot; world-trade multiplier &quot; ( the tendency for countries to drag each other down as their economies contract ) . 
For the most part , the severity and implications of the financial crisis were judged well . 
Lessons from the October 2008 WEO , which analyzed recoveries after systemic financial stress , were incorporated into subsequent forecasts . 
As a result , predictions for the United States - where household deleveraging continues to constrain economic growth - have fallen short only modestly . 
The April 2010 report forecast a US growth rate of roughly 2.5 % annually in 2012-2013 ; current projections put the rate a little higher than 2 % . 
By contrast , the fiscal multiplier was seriously underestimated - as the WEO has now recognized . 
Consequently , forecasts for the United Kingdom - where financial-sector stresses largely resembled those in the US - have been significantly less accurate . 
The April 2010 WEO forecast a UK annual growth rate of nearly 3 % in 2012-2013 ; instead , GDP is likely to contract this year and increase by roughly 1 % next year . 
Much of this costly divergence from the earlier projections can be attributed to the benign view of fiscal consolidation that UK authorities and the IMF shared . 
Likewise , the eurozone &apos;s heavily indebted economies ( Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain ) have performed considerably worse than projected , owing to significant spending cuts and tax hikes . 
For example , Portugal &apos;s GDP was expected to grow by 1 % this year ; in fact , it will contract by a stunning 3 % . 
The European Commission &apos;s claim that this slowdown reflects high sovereign-default risk , rather than fiscal consolidation , is belied by the UK , where the sovereign risk is deemed by markets to be virtually nonexistent . 
The world-trade multiplier , though less widely recognized , helps to explain why the growth deceleration has been so widespread and persistent . 
When a country &apos;s economic growth slows , it imports less from other countries , thereby reducing those countries &quot; growth rates , and causing them , too , to reduce imports . 
The eurozone has been at the epicenter of this contractionary force on global growth . 
Since eurozone countries trade extensively with each other and the rest of the world , their slowdowns have contributed significantly to a decrease in global trade , in turn undermining global growth . 
In particular , as European imports from East Asia have fallen , East Asian economies &quot; growth is down sharply from last year and the 2010 forecast - and , predictably , growth in their imports from the rest of the world has lost momentum . 
Global trade has steadily weakened , with almost no increase in the last six months . 
The once-popular notion , built into growth forecasts , that exports would provide an escape route from the crisis was never credible . 
That notion has now been turned on its head : as economic growth has stalled , falling import demand from trade partners has caused economic woes to spread and deepen . 
The impact of slowing global trade is most apparent for Germany , which was not burdened with excessive household or corporate debt , and enjoyed a favorable fiscal position . 
To escape the crisis , Germany used rapid export growth - especially to meet voracious Chinese demand . 
Although growth was expected to slow subsequently , it was forecast at roughly 2 % in 2012-2013 . 
But , as Chinese growth has decelerated - owing partly to decreased exports to Europe - the German GDP forecast has been halved . 
And , given that this year &apos;s growth has largely already occurred , Germany &apos;s economy has now plateaued - and could even be contracting . 
In good times , the trade generated by a country &apos;s growth bolsters global growth . 
But , in times of crisis , the trade spillovers have the opposite effect . 
As the global economy has become increasingly interconnected , these trade multipliers have increased . 
Indeed , while less ominous and dramatic than financial contagion , trade spillovers profoundly influence global growth prospects . 
Failure to recognize their impact implies that export - and , in turn , growth - projections will continue to miss the mark . 
The projected increase in global growth next year will likely not happen . 
On the contrary , policy errors and delays in individual countries will seriously damage economies worldwide .
