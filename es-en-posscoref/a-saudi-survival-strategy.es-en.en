A Saudi Survival Strategy 
Did the bombings that rocked Riyadh shock the al-Saud royal family from its complacency at long last ? 
This rude interruption to their majesties &apos; indolence by their subjects incited rage and fury and something else - fear . 
Of course , alarm bells have rung before in Saudi Arabia , but the ruling family remained in denial - deniability and repression being the political arts at which the al-Saud excel . 
If the regime is to forge a survival strategy , it must now re-examine its foundations . 
As ruling families go , the al-Saud are spectacularly numerous - there are perhaps as many 22,000 of them . 
But vast bloodlines have not prevented hardening of the arteries . 
Indeed , the men now struggling to hold things together are the incapacitated King Fahd ( 84 years old ) , his half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah ( 79 years old ) , and his full brothers , Defence Minister Sultan ( 78 years old ) , and Interior Minister Naif ( 75 years old ) . 
Old men , unsurprisingly , find it hard to cope with the breakdown of the assumptions that have governed their entire lives . 
Perhaps the most shattering lost illusion is the fact that the bombings occurred in the heart of the al-Saud &apos;s home-base in the Najdi region , which indicates that the enemy within resides nearer to the throne than anyone suspected . 
This recognition is particularly unsettling because the al-Saud have alienated every group except their own . 
If some Najdi may now be mistrusted , where can the al-Saud turn ? 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s population is divided into distinctive regional , tribal , and sectarian groups . 
To the east , in the oil-rich province , are the Shia . 
Politically emboldened since the fall of Saddam &apos;s regime and the resurgence of their brethren in Iraq , the Shia wasted no time in petitioning Crown Prince Abdullah to end both their exclusion from Saudi politics and their demonization as heretics by the Wahhabi religious establishment . 
Their message to the rulers is that it will no longer suffice to identify being Saudi exclusively with being Wahhabi Najdi . 
Meanwhile , the Hijazis , who originate in Mecca and Medina , hold long-repressed resentments due to their humiliating partial inclusion in Saudi politics . 
Although the Hijazis , who are Sunnis but not Wahhabis , are not viewed as heretics , they are marginalized because the Islam they practice has Sufi leanings - and tolerant Sufiism is anathema to the austerely dogmatic Wahhabis . 
Educated Hijazis ask only for modest reforms . 
Yet even moderation is dismissed by the al-Saud . 
The tribes of the Asir region , which have a mixed sense of identity due to their close ties to Yemeni tribes , feel alienated from both the political and the economic center . 
The population of al-Jawf in the north has a similar sense of political and economic alienation . 
Despite long simmering feelings of resentment and dispossession , these &apos; minorities &apos; remain moderate in their demands for reform . 
Their leaders want to rescue the state , not raze it . 
They form the vast majority of people in Saudi Arabia , and have not yet embraced the uncompromising rage of Osama bin Laden &apos;s clones . 
The challenge facing the al-Saud is to include at the heart of the political system the peoples they have shunned for decades . 
Unless they begin to do so , these peoples will drift into the camp of the fanatics - if not as active terrorists than as passive supporters , much as the Catholic community in Northern Ireland passively embraced IRA terrorism as a way to end their exclusion from political life in the province . 
The danger in Saudi Arabia is that the IRA are no match for Muslim fundamentalists in their fanaticism . 
For the regime to embrace peoples it has excluded , it must agree on inclusiveness - and the tolerance of non-Wahhabi forms of Islam - as a survival strategy and stick to it . 
This is difficult because the ruling al-Saud are themselves divided . 
Crown Prince Abdullah is far more disposed to reform than Prince Naif , the powerful Interior Minister , who clings to the old narrow system of repression . 
The al-Saud will undoubtedly be ruthless in seeking out the individuals directly implicated in the terrorist bombings . 
Those captured face beheading in the traditional way . 
The problem for the regime is that the springs that nourish fanaticism will not be dammed by such exemplary punishment . 
Some royals recognize this and know that a more thorough housecleaning is needed . 
They realize that the al-Saud must choose : continue on the narrow path of repression and ethnic and religious intolerance , or adopt a more open and inclusive policy . 
Both choices are fraught with danger : open up , and they include people in Saudi public life hitherto considered unworthy for being either heretics ( the Shia ) or of impure blood ( the Hejazis ) or too primitive ( the border tribes ) . 
Remain closed , and they will find themselves hostage to the forces of intolerance that threaten the regime . 
The al-Saud religious alliance with the Wahhabis and the latter &apos;s control of a rigid religious educational system must change . 
&quot; Moderate &quot; elements among the population will support this change ( and the manhunt for terrorist fanatics ) if they secure inclusion in Saudi life . 
Alexis de Tocqueville warned that the most dangerous time for any authoritarian regime is when it reforms . 
The al-Saud have procrastinated so long that every choice they now face is risky . 
Inclusion is the less dangerous path . 
It puts at risk only the ethnically narrow and religiously intolerant structure of the regime . 
By contrast , the regime itself will be imperiled if it clings to its narrow base .
