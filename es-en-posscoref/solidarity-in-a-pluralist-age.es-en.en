Solidarity in a Pluralist Age 
VIENNA - Solidarity is essential to democratic societies ; otherwise , they fall apart . 
They cannot function beyond a certain level of mutual distrust or a sense on the part of some members that other members have abandoned them . 
Many view the development of an individualistic outlook as the greatest threat to solidarity nowadays . 
It is no accident , for example , that Europe &apos;s most successful welfare states were created in ethnically homogeneous Scandinavia . 
People in those countries had the sense that they could understand their neighbors and fellow citizens , and that they shared a close link with them . 
The challenge nowadays is to maintain that sense of intense solidarity amid diversifying populations . 
There are two ways to do this . 
One is to hark back to older modes of solidarity . 
French identity , for example , is based on the country &apos;s unique brand of republican secularism , known as laïcité . 
The other way to preserve solidarity is to redefine identity . 
All democratic societies today are faced with the challenge of redefining their identity in dialogue with some elements that are external , and some that are internal . 
Consider the influence of feminist movements throughout the West . 
These are not people who came from outside their countries . 
They are people who in some ways lacked full citizenship , who demanded it , and who redefined the political order by obtaining it . 
Today the great task is to calm the fears that our traditions are being undermined ; to reach out to people who are coming into our lands from other countries ; and to find a way of recreating our political ethic around the kernel of human rights , equality , non-discrimination , and democracy . 
If we succeed , we can create a sense that we belong together , even though our reasons for believing so may be different . 
But increasing individualism - a focus on one &apos;s own ambitions and economic prosperity - in many countries poses a stubborn obstacle to realizing this vision . 
Indeed , the utter lack of a sense of solidarity among so many people - horrifyingly evident in the US health-care debate - is now undermining the very basis of what a modern democratic society is . 
A society &apos;s sense of solidarity can be sustained only if all of its different spiritual groups recreate their sense of dedication to it : if Christians see it as central to their Christianity , if Muslims see it as central to their Islam , and if the various kinds of lay philosophies see it as central to their philosophies . 
Religion provides a profound and powerful base of solidarity , and to marginalize it would be a big mistake , just as marginalizing atheistic philosophies would be a mistake . 
Democratic societies , in their tremendous diversity , are powered by many different engines of commitment to a common ethic . 
They cannot afford to switch off any of these engines and hope to maintain a political community . 
Historically , the political ethic of confessional societies has been grounded in a single , basic foundation . 
In Europe , various kinds of laïque societies have tried to invent themselves out of the ruins of the Christian foundation , but they have made the same mistake in another way , with a kind of Jacobin insistence on the civil religionof the Enlightenment . 
Well , we can no longer have a civil religion - not one based on God , nor on laïcité and the rights of man , nor , indeed , on any particular view . 
We live , today , in uncharted territory . 
We face a challenge that is unprecedented in human history : creation of a powerful political ethic of solidarity self-consciously grounded on the presence and acceptance of very different views . 
This can succeed only if we engage in vigorous exchange with each other in order to create a kind of mutual respect for these different views . 
The advancing force of Islamophobia in Europe and the US , with its attempt to reduce Islam &apos;s complex and varied history to a few demagogic slogans , is the kind of utterly ignorant stupidity - there &apos;s no better description of it - on which democratic societies founder . 
But that is true of any kind of dismissive view of the &quot; other . &quot; 
Our societies will hold together only if we talk to each other with openness and frankness , and , in doing so , recreate a certain sense of solidarity from all our different roots .
