The Gold Bubble and the Gold Bugs 
NEW YORK - Gold prices have been rising sharply , breaching the $ 1,000 barrier and in recent weeks rising towards $ 1,200 an ounce and above . 
Today &apos;s &quot; gold bugs &quot; argue that the price could top $ 2,000 . 
But the recent price surge looks suspiciously like a bubble , with the increase only partly justified by economic fundamentals . 
Gold prices rise sharply only in two situations : when inflation is high and rising , gold becomes a hedge against inflation ; and when there is a risk of a near depression and investors fear for the security of their bank deposits , gold becomes a safe haven . 
The last two years fit this pattern . 
Gold prices started to rise sharply in the first half of 2008 , when emerging markets were overheating , commodity prices were rising , and there was concern about rising inflation in high-growth emerging markets . 
Even that rise was partly a bubble , which collapsed in the second half of 2008 , when - after oil reached $ 145 , killing global growth -the world economy fell into recession . 
As concerns about deflation replaced fear of inflation , gold prices started to fall with the correction in commodity prices . 
The second price spike occurred when Lehman Brothers collapsed , leaving investors scared about the safety of their financial assets - including bank deposits . 
That scare was contained when the G-7 committed to increase guarantees of bank deposits and to backstop the financial system . 
With panic subsiding towards the end of 2008 , gold prices resumed their downward movement . 
By that time , with the global economy spinning into near-depression , commercial and industrial gold use , and even luxury demand , took a further dive . 
Gold rose above $ 1,000 again in February-March 2009 , when it looked like most of the financial system in the United States and Europe might be near insolvency , and that many governments could not guarantee deposits and backstop the financial system , because banks that were too big to fail were also too big to be saved . 
That panic subsided - and gold prices started to drift down again - after US banks were subjected to &quot; stress tests , &quot; America &apos;s Troubled Asset Relief Program further backstopped the financial system by removing bad assets from banks &quot; balance sheets , and the global economy gradually bottomed out . 
So , with no near-term risk of inflation or depression , why have gold prices started to rise sharply again in the last few months ? 
There are several reasons why gold prices are rising , but they suggest a gradual rise with significant risks of a downward correction , rather than a rapid rise towards $ 2,000 , as today &apos;s gold bugs claim . 
First , while we are still in a world of global deflation , large , monetized fiscal deficits are fueling concerns over medium-term inflation . 
Second , a massive wave of liquidity , via easy monetary policy , is chasing assets , including commodities , which may eventually stoke inflation further . 
Third , dollar-funded carry trades are pushing the US dollar sharply down , and there is an inverse relation between the value of the dollar and the dollar price of commodities : the lower the dollar , the higher the dollar price of oil , energy , and other commodities - including gold . 
Fourth , the global supply of gold - both existing and newly produced - is limited , and demand is rising faster than it can be met . 
Some of this demand is coming from central banks , such as those of India , China , and South Korea . 
And some of it is coming from private investors , who are using gold as a hedge against what remain low-probability &quot; tail &quot; risks ( high inflation and another near-depression caused by a double-dip recession ) . 
Indeed , investors increasingly want to hedge against such risks early on . 
Given the inelastic supply of gold , even a small shift in the portfolios of central banks and private investors towards gold increases its price significantly . 
Finally , sovereign risk is rising - consider the troubles faced by investors in Dubai , Greece , and other emerging markets and advanced economies . 
This has revived concerns that governments may be unable to backstop a too-big-to-save financial system . 
But , since gold has no intrinsic value , there are significant risks of a downward correction . 
Eventually , central banks will need to exit quantitative easing and zero-interest rates , putting downward pressure on risky assets , including commodities . 
Or the global recovery may turn out to be fragile and anemic , leading to a rise in bearish sentiment on commodities - and in bullishness about the US dollar . 
Another downside risk is that the dollar-funded carry trade may unravel , crashing the global asset bubble that it , together with the wave of monetary liquidity , has caused . 
And , since the carry trade and the wave of liquidity are causing a global asset bubble , some of gold &apos;s recent rise is also bubble-driven , with herding behavior and &quot; momentum trading &quot; by investors pushing gold higher and higher . 
But all bubbles eventually burst . 
The bigger the bubble , the greater the collapse . 
The recent rise in gold prices is only partially justified by fundamentals . 
Nor is it clear why investors should stock up on gold if the global economy dips into recession again and concerns about a near depression and rampant deflation rise sharply . 
If you truly fear a global economic meltdown , you should stock up on guns , canned food , and other commodities that you can actually use in your log cabin .
