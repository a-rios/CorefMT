Our Double-Dip Future 
NEW YORK - We are at a moment when the range of uncertainties facing the global economy is unusually wide . 
We have just passed through the worst financial crisis since World War II . 
The only relevant comparisons are with the Japanese real-estate bubble , which burst in 1991 ( and from which Japan has not recovered ) , and the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s - except that this crisis has been quantitatively much larger and qualitatively different . 
Unlike the Japanese experience , this crisis involved the entire world , rather than being confined to a single country . 
In fact , the magnitude of the problem today is even greater than during the Great Depression . 
In 1929 , total credit outstanding in the United States was 160 % of GDP , and it rose to 250 % by 1932 . 
In 2008 , we started at 365 % - and this calculation leaves out the pervasive use of derivatives , which was absent in the 1930 &quot; s . 
Despite this , artificial life-support has worked . 
Barely a year after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , financial markets have stabilized , stock markets have rebounded , and the economy is showing signs of recovery . 
People want to return to business as usual - and to think of the Crash of 2008 as a bad dream . 
Unfortunately , the recovery is liable to run out of steam , and may even be followed by a second economic downturn , though I am not sure whether it will occur in 2010 or 2011 . 
My views are far from unique , but they are at variance with the prevailing mood . 
The longer the turnaround lasts , the more people will believe that it will continue . 
To complicate matters , the lag works in both directions . 
Most people have not yet realized that this crisis is different from previous ones - that we are at the end of an era . 
Others - including me - failed to anticipate the extent of the rebound . 
Overall , the international financial authorities have handled this crisis the same way as they handled previous ones : they bailed out failing institutions and applied monetary and fiscal stimulus . 
The failed rescue of Lehman Brothers was a game-changing event : financial markets actually ceased to function . 
This meant that governments had to effectively guarantee that no other institution whose collapse could endanger the system would be allowed to fail . 
That is when the crisis spread to the periphery of the world economy , because countries on the periphery could not provide equally credible guarantees . 
Eastern Europe was the worst hit . 
Countries at the center used their central banks &quot; strong balance sheets to pump money into the system and to guarantee the liabilities of commercial banks , while governments engaged in deficit financing to stimulate the economy on an unprecedented scale . 
But the growing belief that the global financial system has escaped collapse , and that we are slowly returning to business as usual , is a grave misinterpretation of the current situation . 
Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again . 
The globalization of financial markets that took place since the 1980 &quot; s allowed financial capital to move freely around the world , making it difficult to tax or regulate . 
This put financial capital in a privileged position : governments had to pay more attention to the requirements of international capital than to the aspirations of their own people . 
Individual countries found it difficult to offer resistance . 
But the global financial system that emerged was fundamentally unstable , because it was built on the false premise that financial markets can be safely left to their own devices . 
That is why it broke down , and that is why it cannot be put together again . 
Global markets need global regulations , but the regulations that are currently in force are rooted in the principle of national sovereignty . 
There are some international agreements , notably the Basel Accords on minimum capital requirements ; and there is also good cooperation among market regulators . 
This means that it is not enough to restart a mechanism that has stalled ; we need to create a regulatory mechanism that has never existed . 
As things stand now , each country &apos;s financial system is being sustained and supported by its own government . 
This gives rise to what may be called financial protectionism , which threatens to disrupt and perhaps destroy global financial markets . 
British regulators will never again rely on the Icelandic authorities , and Eastern European countries will be reluctant to remain dependent on foreign-owned banks . 
So regulations must become international in scope . 
Otherwise , global financial markets will be destroyed by regulatory arbitrage . 
Businesses would move to countries where the regulatory climate is the most benign , exposing other countries to risks that they cannot afford to run . 
Globalization was successful because it forced countries to remove regulations ; but the process does not work in reverse . 
It will be difficult to get countries to agree on uniform regulations . 
Different countries have different interests , which drive them towards different solutions . 
This can be seen in Europe , where the European Union &apos;s member states cannot agree among themselves on a uniform set of financial rules . 
How , then , can the rest of the world ? 
In the 1930 &quot; s , trade protectionism made a bad situation worse . 
In today &apos;s global economy , the rise of financial protectionism constitutes a greater danger .
