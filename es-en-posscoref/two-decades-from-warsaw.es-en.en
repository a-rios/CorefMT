Two Decades from Warsaw 
WARSAW - &quot; Poland - ten years , Hungary - ten months , East Germany - ten weeks , Czechoslovakia - ten days . &quot; 
So chirped many in Prague in November 1989 , reflecting the pride and the joy of the Velvet Revolution , but also the sustained effort that was needed to end communism , whose demise began in Warsaw the previous February . 
Indeed , communism &apos;s breakdown began ten years earlier in Poland , during Pope John Paul II &apos;s first pilgrimage to his homeland , a visit that shook communist rule to its foundation . 
Within a year , Polish workers were striking for the right to establish independent trade unions , staging two weeks of sit-ins at state-owned factories to achieve their goal . 
Karl Marx would have been proud of them , but it was the Pope &apos;s portrait that hung on the gate of Gdansk &apos;s Lenin Shipyard during the strike . 
The Solidarity union that was born in 1980 broke the Communist Party &apos;s monopoly on power . 
The movement united ten million people : workers and professors , peasants and students , priests and freethinkers among them - all of civil society . 
This infant democracy was harshly interrupted when martial law was imposed in December 1981 , with Solidarity outlawed and dissidents arrested . 
But this totalitarian blitzkrieg could not last . 
Democracy did not die ; it merely went underground . 
For the next seven years , Solidarity fought for re-legalization , building the biggest underground network of resistance Europe had seen since Hitler &apos;s war . 
But this was non-violent resistance . 
Its main weapon was the language of freedom . 
In the mid-1980 &quot; s , there were about 1,000 independent , uncensored journals in Poland . 
They represented a full range of ideas and editorial styles - from factory leaflets and bulletins to intellectual magazines . 
Hundreds of books prohibited by Communist censors ( for example , Gunther Grass &apos;s The Tin Drum ) came to light . 
Solidarity &apos;s leader , Lech Wałęsa , did not surrender in prison and retained his national esteem . 
With the economy in steep decline , Poland &apos;s rulers began to seek to stabilize the political system and reestablish relations with the West . 
In 1986 , the government released political prisoners - a precondition for talks with the opposition . 
But it took the Communists two more years to realize that they could not introduce economic reform without Solidarity &apos;s assent . 
So talks began . 
The reason they were possible at all was that the opposition &apos;s goal was not the violent overthrow of party rule . 
Instead , its democratic goals were to be fulfilled by a compromise with the authorities . 
Wałęsa and his closest advisers - Bronisław Geremek and Tadeusz Mazowiecki - pushed this moderate policy , demanding liberation while recognizing the political reality of Soviet domination . 
Two waves of strikes in 1988 forced General Jaruzelski &apos;s government to negotiate with Solidarity , which , after a few months of hedging , was legalized . 
The &quot; Roundtable &quot; talks to change the political system could begin . 
The haggling continued from February until April 1989 . 
The main issues were legalization of the opposition , partially free elections , and creating the office of president to replace the Communist Party chief . 
The Communists were guaranteed a majority in parliament . 
While the election to the newly created Senate was entirely free , the opposition could compete for only one-third of the seats in the Sejm ( the lower house ) . 
But the key point was that the party &apos;s monopoly on power was jettisoned . 
Solidarity gained the opportunity to create independent media and a grassroots political organization . 
Finally , the Communists agreed that the elections to be held in four years would be entirely free . 
The road to democracy was open . 
But the dictatorship &apos;s end came sooner then anyone expected . 
In June 1989 , the opposition won the parliamentary election in a landslide . 
It was impossible to form a government without its participation . 
Jaruzelski was elected president , but he had to accept the new division of power . 
The decisive political maneuver - building a coalition with allies of Communists - was carried out by Lech Wałęsa . 
A Solidarity representative , Tadeusz Mazowiecki , became prime minister . 
In September 1989 , Poland had the first government ever led by democratic parties in the Soviet bloc . 
It was a revolution , but with a difference : the political system changed without a body count . 
This was due , above all , to Solidarity &apos;s prudent policy . 
But it was civic activity - resistance movements , strikes , and other manifestations of social support - that buttressed Solidarity . 
Mikhail Gorbachev was important ; his non-intervention policy toward Eastern Europe meant that Soviet tanks would not annul the changes , as they had done with the Prague Spring . 
The Polish Communists did not intend to build democracy ; their plan was to absorb moderate opposition groups into a partially modified political system . 
Handing over power to Solidarity was the last thing they had in mind . 
Yet the Roundtable compromise turned out to be good even for them , as communist &quot; reformers &quot; began to build new careers in business and politics ( one , Aleksander Kwaśniewski , became Poland &apos;s second democratically elected president ) . 
The Roundtable also provided the Communists with a sense of safety that diminished their fear of democratic change . 
A hangman &apos;s noose did not await them . 
This was an important sign for Poland &apos;s neighbors in the Soviet bloc , which took its example to heart . 
In a few months , talks between Communist bosses and their democratic opponents ( often in the form of a roundtable ) paved the way to free elections and new democratic governments in Budapest , Prague , East Berlin , and Sofia . 
By 1989 &quot; s end , the post-Yalta Europe was free . 
Since then , the symbol of the great revolution of 1989 has been the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
But the Roundtable talks in Warsaw 20 years ago this month is where the Iron Curtain began to be dismantled .
