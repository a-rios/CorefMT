After the Golden Age of Finance 
LONDON - Even after the passage of new financial regulations in the United States , the Dodd-Frank Act , and the publication of the Basel Committee &apos;s new capital requirements , the financial sector &apos;s prospects over the next few years remain highly uncertain . 
There has been some recovery in prices for bank shares from the lows of 2008 , of course , but that rally faltered recently . 
Quite apart from their concerns about the robustness of the rebound in the economy , investors are uncertain about many financial firms &quot; business models , and about the future size , shape , and profitability of the financial sector in general . 
After all , banks remain deeply unpopular in all developed countries . 
Bankers are still social pariahs , as lowly valued by the public as drug dealers or journalists . 
They are reviled if they lose money , and assailed if they make it . 
For banks and their shareholders , it looks a case of heads they win , tails we lose . 
Thus , as banks return to profitability , politicians in North America and Europe have begun to talk again about new taxes that would skim those profits off to the benefit of taxpayers , whose support kept banks in business at the height of the crisis . 
This is a huge contrast with the financial sector &apos;s position in the previous three decades . 
From the late 1970 &quot; s until 2007 , the financial sector grew far more rapidly than the real economy . 
In 1980 , financial assets - stocks , bonds , and bank deposits - totaled around 100 % of GDP in the advanced economies . 
By 2007 , the figure was over 400 % in the US , the United Kingdom , and Japan . 
During this period , credit expanded rapidly as a share of GDP , reaching more than 300 % at the peak . 
In the UK , the profits of financial intermediaries , which had averaged around 1.5 % of the whole economy &apos;s profits in the 1970 &quot; s , reached 15 % in 2008 . 
In the US , bank profits were an even larger share of the total . 
This was the golden age of finance . 
Bankers &quot; pay soared alongside profits - indeed , it grew even faster . 
To paraphrase William Wordsworth , bliss was it in that dawn to be alive , and to be a derivatives trader was very heaven . 
But the expansion came to a shuddering halt in 2008 , the first year in decades in which aggregate financial assets fell , and there is still little sign of a sustained recovery . 
Is this a short-term phenomenon ? 
Will the financial sector return to pre-crisis growth rates when the economic situation has been fully stabilized ? 
Will financial &quot; deepening &quot; continue ? 
Will bank stocks once again outperform the market ? 
A recent study by Andy Haldane and others at the Bank of England casts doubt on the prospect of a return to the status quo ante . 
They note that the Golden Age was in fact an unusual period , if you look at the last two centuries of economic history . 
Haldane bases his analysis on the trend in the Gross Value Added ( GVA ) of the financial sector . 
Over the last 160 years , the GVA of finance has grown by two percentage points a year faster than that of the economy as a whole . 
But this excess growth has not been evenly spread . 
During the two decades leading up to World War I , the financial sector grew almost four times faster than the economy , in the first wave of financial deepening and globalization , but from 1918 until the 1970 &quot; s , finance expanded less rapidly than average economic growth . 
Only when markets were deregulated and liberalized from the early 1970 &quot; s onwards did finance once again leap ahead . 
In the US , financial sector GVA was only 2 % of the total in the 1950s , but stands at 8 % today . 
Haldane believes that this growth spurt is well and truly over . 
He argues that much of the apparent growth in value added has in fact been illusory , based on increased leverage , excess trading , and banks writing deep out-of-the-money options - for example , credit-default swaps ( a $ 60 trillion market in 2007 ) . 
&quot; What all these strategies had in common , &quot; writes Haldane , &quot; was that they involved banks assuming risk in the hunt for yield - risk that was often disguised because it was parked in the tail of the return distribution . &quot; 
From a regulator &apos;s perspective , this is a powerful argument for requiring higher capital to constrain the risk that banks can take on . 
Indeed , the Basel Committee plans to require more capital in the future , though the new requirements will be delayed , owing to concerns about the cost and availability of credit to sustain the recovery . 
Against that background , it is hard to believe that we will quickly return to the heady growth in financial assets , credit , and risk we saw from the 1970 &quot; s to 2007 . 
Financial-sector returns are likely to be lower . 
Returns of 20 % on equity targets are a thing of the past . 
And lower profitability will reduce pay more effectively than any direct regulatory controls . 
For most of us , unless we remain seriously overweight in financial stocks , this may not be a bad prospect . 
We do not want to inflate another asset-price bubble on the scale of the one that burst in 2007-2008 . 
But there is a risk for regulators and central banks . 
If they over-constrain the financial sector , risk may migrate outside the regulatory frontier , where it will be harder to measure and monitor . 
That is why it is important to maintain some flexibility , to allow currently unregulated institutions like hedge funds and private-equity funds to be swept into the regulatory net if they become large and systemically important . 
The tighter their controls on risk in banks , the more frontier police the regulators will need .
