The Politics of Psychiatry 
Worldwide , annual investments in scientific research to cure devastating mental pathologies such as bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , and clinical depression are huge - comparable to spending on finding a cure for any other disease . 
But while mental disorders are indeed medical diseases , with their own culprit molecules and aberrant anatomies , they are also different from &quot; physical &quot; diseases in important ways . 
For no matter how thoroughly &quot; medical &quot; mental illnesses are , they are also thoroughly social . 
The reasons for this stem from the nature of mental disorders themselves . 
There is no question that pathologies like heart disease , pneumonia , or diabetes have a large impact on a sufferer &apos;s sense of self and place in the community . 
But only in illnesses like schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , obsessive-compulsive disorder , and depression do we find disease processes that directly and profoundly transform a person &apos;s self , identity , and place in the community . 
A person with schizophrenia may experience his self as another , may experience his identity as controlled by others , and may regard the entire community as suspect and threatening . 
A person in the manic phase of bipolar disorder has , in addition to serious , even life-threatening lapses in judgment , an extraordinary sense of well-being that the mentally well rarely , if ever , experience . 
The individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder both dreads and is ashamed by irrational obsessions and compulsions , yet finds engaging in these thoughts and actions irresistible . 
The person with clinical depression finds his or her entire being dark and vapid , devoid of ordinary human feelings like anticipation , pleasure , and meaningfulness . 
Patients with mental pathologies commonly ask their doctors , &quot; Is it me or my illness ? &quot; 
The manifestations of illness and the expression of self are not so easily distinguished , and psychiatric treatment often focuses on disentangling the two . 
But this intermingling of the self with the manifestations of mental illness often leads patients to have mixed feelings about treatment . 
For example , treatment for a manic patient jeopardizes that extraordinary feeling of well-being and risks plunging the person into the dreaded depressive phase of the illness . 
The idiosyncratic beliefs of the schizophrenic are the target of pharmacotherapy , but at the same time they may be a source of personal pride and form a distinct sense of self that the patient wants to preserve . 
Because of this &quot; self-illness &quot; ambiguity , mental disorders are linked with personal values , belief systems , and interests in ways that are distinct from physical diseases . 
Physical symptoms are almost never positively valued , but some symptoms of mental disorders typically are . 
For example , almost everyone agrees that a broken leg or pneumonia are bad things to have . 
But many manifestations of mental disorders - such as the increased energy of mania , the euphoria of intoxication for the addict , or the smug satisfaction of the individual with a personality disorder - may not always be viewed that way . 
As a result , while many would-be patients might recognize the benefits that psychiatric treatment has to offer , they also may be deterred by the threat to what few sources of self-affirmation they have . 
When one adds to this the stigma and explicitly discriminatory practices against the mentally ill , it is a wonder that failure to keep appointments and take medications is not more common than it is . 
While the &quot; self-illness ambiguity &quot; in mental illness may not be explicitly appreciated , many societies have made accommodations , such as considering a criminal offender &apos;s state of mind in assessing legal culpability . 
Societies also often provide ways to encourage , even compel , a mentally ill person into treatment , while recognizing that , because psychiatry can potentially invade and overwhelm personal beliefs and values , mental health practices must be regulated in order to preserve civil liberties . 
As science unravels many of the puzzles concerning mental disorder , it may become tempting to argue that these problems with politics and diverse values will evaporate . 
According to this view , broad agreement about the causes of and cures for mental illness will make politics irrelevant , just as a broken leg or a heart attack are not really political in content today . 
I am skeptical that this can happen . 
Consider a bit of science fiction . 
Let us say that , at some point in the future , neurobiology will explain not only major mental disorders , but also criminality . 
Indeed , we will have perfected a biology of morality that allows us to explain typical morality as well as deviant morality . 
But even in such a science-fiction scenario , we are left with a serious political problem : on what moral terms can we base desirable and undesirable beliefs and behaviors ? 
Who will define the norms of criminality and mental illness , conditions for which science provides the explanation ? 
Will those norms be based upon my values , your values , prevailing scientific views , or perhaps the values of a political mastermind ? 
The politics of psychiatry are inescapable , which is why all societies must consider them with the greatest of seriousness .
