Nuclear Steps Undermine Peace 
By abandoning many of the nuclear arms agreements negotiated in the last 50 years , the United States has been sending mixed signals to North Korea , Iran , and other nations with the technical knowledge to create nuclear weapons . 
Currently proposed agreements with India compound this quagmire and further undermine the global pact for peace represented by the nuclear nonproliferation regime . 
At the same time , no significant steps are being taken to reduce the worldwide arsenal of almost 30,000 nuclear weapons now possessed by the US , Russia , China , France , Israel , Britain , India , Pakistan , and perhaps North Korea . 
A global holocaust is just as possible now , through mistakes or misjudgments , as it was during the depths of the Cold War . 
The key restraining commitment among the five original nuclear powers and more than 180 other nations is the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) . 
Its key objective is &quot; to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology ... and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament . &quot; 
In the last five-year review conference at the United Nations in 2005 , only Israel , India , Pakistan , and North Korea were not participating - the first three have nuclear arsenals that are advanced , and the fourth &apos;s is embryonic . 
The American government has not set a good example , having already abandoned the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty , binding limitations on testing nuclear weapons and developing new ones , and a long-standing policy of foregoing threats of &quot; first use &quot; of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states . 
These recent decisions have encouraged China , Russia , and other NPT signatories to respond with similar actions . 
Knowing since 1974 of India &apos;s nuclear ambitions , I and other American presidents imposed a consistent policy : no sales of nuclear technology or uncontrolled fuel to India or any other country that refused to sign the NPT . 
Today , these restraints are in the process of being abandoned . 
I have no doubt that India &apos;s political leaders are just as responsible in handling their country &apos;s arsenal as leaders of the five original nuclear powers . 
India &apos;s leaders should make the same pledges , and should also join other nuclear powers in signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty . 
Instead , they have rejected these steps and insist on unrestricted access to international assistance in producing enough fissile material for as many as 50 weapons a year , far exceeding what is believed to be India &apos;s current capacity . 
If India &apos;s demand is acceptable , why should other technologically advanced NPT signatories , such as Brazil , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Japan - to say nothing of less responsible nations - continue to restrain themselves ? 
Having received at least tentative approval from the US for its policy , India still faces two further obstacles : an acceptable agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , a 45-nation body that - until now - has barred nuclear trade with any nation that refuses to accept international nuclear standards . 
The non-nuclear NSG members are Argentina , Australia , Austria , Belarus , Belgium , Brazil , Bulgaria , Canada , Croatia , Cyprus , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Japan , Kazakhstan , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Slovakia , Slovenia , South Africa , South Korea , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , Turkey , and Ukraine . 
The role of these nations and the IAEA is not to prevent India &apos;s development of nuclear power or even nuclear weapons , but rather to assure that it proceeds as almost all other responsible nations on earth do , by signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepting other reasonable restraints . 
Nuclear powers must show leadership , by restraining themselves and by curtailing further departures from the NPT &apos;s international restraints . 
One-by-one , the choices they make today will create a legacy  -  deadly or peaceful  -  for the future .
