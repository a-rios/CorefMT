The Sources of Chinese Conduct 
BEIJING - Six decades ago , the American diplomat George Kennan wrote an article , &quot; The Sources of SovietConduct , &quot; that galvanized American and world opinion , which soon hardened into the rigid postures of the Cold War . 
Today , given China &apos;s decisive influence on the global economy , and its increasing ability to project military power , understanding the sources of Chinese conduct has become a central issue in international relations . 
Indeed , better understanding of China &apos;s foreign policy motivations may help prevent relations between China and the United States from hardening into rigid and antagonistic postures . 
Since 2008 , discussions among Chinese scholars and strategists on the nature of their country &apos;s foreign policy have focused on two issues : its ideological foundations , and China &apos;s international appeal and standing - its &quot; soft power . &quot; 
Mainstream thinking , known as the Chinese School , insists , with the government , on &quot; Marxism with Chinese characteristics &quot; as the bedrock principle of China &apos;s foreign policy . 
But a minority school argues that China should rely instead on the country &apos;s traditional political thought , emphasizing the universal value of traditional Chinese philosophy . 
While People &apos;s Daily , the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s official newspaper , consistently attacks that position , the Party itself has been rehabilitating Confucius , the central figure in Chinese traditional thought , going so far as to erect a statue of him in Tiananmen Square . 
The Chinese School insists on adhering to Deng Xiaoping &apos;s doctrine of maintaining a low profile in international diplomacy , while the traditionalist group advocates taking on greater international responsibility . 
The mainstream school defines China as a developing country , pointing to China &apos;s per capita GDP , which ranks only 104th in the world . 
The traditionalists argue that China should assume responsibility for world affairs consistent with its status as the world &apos;s second-largest economy , behind only the US . 
Today , the impact of the Chinese School seems to be limited mostly to official statements , while the traditionalists are gradually gaining policy influence . 
For example , the Chinese government reiterated its core diplomatic principle of non-intervention in other countries &quot; affairs during the Libya crisis , yet China accepted the imposition of United Nations &quot; sanctions on Muammar Qaddafi &apos;s government . 
Moreover , China dispatched a warship and four military aircraft to the Mediterranean to help evacuate 35,860 Chinese nationals and 2,100 others from Libya . 
That measure , the first projection of Chinese naval power so far from home , is consistent with Confucianism , which regards morality as the top priority of policymaking , rather than Marxism , according to which economic interests alone drive foreign policy . 
Early Confucian thinkers were writing in a world of small countries competing ruthlessly for territorial advantage . 
For them , the key to international power was political power , and the central attribute of political power was a morally informed leadership . 
Rulers , they believed , should act in accord with moral norms whenever possible . 
And the sphere of concern for any humane ruler should be the whole world , not just the people of one state . 
Thus , thinkers such as Mencius , Confucius &apos;s leading intellectual heir , argued that humane authorities should punish immoral rulers in other states who tyrannize their people . 
Rulers who rely mostly on military or economic might divorced from morality , he argued , cannot achieve long-term success on the international stage . 
Although China is building Confucius Institutes across the globe , China &apos;s traditional political philosophy does not often play decisive role in policymaking . 
China &apos;s policy toward Libya , which differs significantly from previous policy , may or may not have been shaped by it ; nevertheless , we cannot rule out the possibility of it becoming the mainstream of thinking in Chinese foreign-policy circles in the near future . 
Indeed , Henry Kissinger once told me that he believes that Chinese traditional thought has a greater chance than any foreign ideology ( say , Marxism or liberalism ) of becoming the dominant intellectual force behind Chinese foreign policymaking . 
Domestic politics is always an important factor influencing a country &apos;s foreign policy . 
At the recently concluded 11th People &apos;s National Congress , the word heard most often in policy discussions was &quot; happiness , &quot; which had suddenly replaced &quot; economic growth &quot; as the official mantra . 
This change may augur future adjustments in China &apos;s foreign policy as well , for &quot; happiness &quot; is a word used more frequently in Chinese traditional political thought than in Marxist political philosophy . 
According to early Confucian thinkers , a key task for rulers is to strive to improve a peoples &quot; happiness , which is itself grounded in a moral way of life . 
Because poverty was an obstacle to moral behavior , they believed that the state should be vitally concerned with eliminating it . 
The idea that the state should pursue economic growth without consideration for moral concerns was anathema to Confucius and his followers . 
In February 2010 , at &quot; Spring Festival &quot; - one of China &apos;s biggest holidays , marked by family reunions - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that the government should help people live with dignity and happiness . 
At a press conference this month , he said that economic reform cannot succeed without political reform , and that corruption currently poses the gravest danger to China . 
Such statements sounded new to Chinese ears , because they accentuated politics rather than trumpeting the Party &apos;s usual emphasis on economic determinism . 
Today , it is impossible to tell what impact and how much influence Chinese traditional political thought - the traditional concern with moral duty , happiness , and honor - will have on China &apos;s foreign policy . 
But it is certain that the influence of traditional ideas in Chinese public life is growing . 
Indeed , no force seems able to reverse this trend in the coming years .
