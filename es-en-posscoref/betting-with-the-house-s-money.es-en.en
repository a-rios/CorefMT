Betting With the House &apos;s Money 
Many people have been asking why the dollar hasn &apos;t crashed yet . 
Will the United States ever face a bill for the string of massive trade deficits that it has been running for more than a decade ? 
Including interest payments on past deficits , the tab for 2006 alone was over $ 800 billion dollars - roughly 6.5 % of US gross national product . 
Even more staggeringly , US borrowing now soaks up more than two-thirds of the combined excess savings of all the surplus countries in the world , including China , Japan , Germany , and the OPEC states . 
Foreigners are hardly reaping great returns on investing in the US . 
On the contrary , they typically get significantly lower returns than Americans get on their investments abroad . 
In an era in which stock and housing prices are soaring , the central banks of Japan and China are holding almost two trillion dollars worth of low-interest bonds . 
A very large share of these are US treasury bonds and mortgages . 
This enormous subsidy to American taxpayers is , in many ways , the world &apos;s largest foreign aid program . 
If America &apos;s competitive position is so weak , what magic is holding up the dollar ? 
Most sober analysts have long been projecting a steady trend decline in the dollar against the currencies of America &apos;s trading partners , especially in Asia and emerging markets . 
So why hasn &apos;t more adjustment taken place already ? 
The first answer , of course , is that the trade-weighted dollar has fallen - by more than 15 % in real terms since its peak in early 2002 . 
Yet the US deficits have persisted , and even risen , since then . 
The real driving force has been two-fold . 
First and foremost , America &apos;s government and consumers have been engaged in a never-ending consumption binge . 
On the consumer side , this is quite understandable . 
With over 80 % home ownership , the epic boom in housing prices of the last ten years has spread deep into the American middle class . 
Equity holdings are somewhat more concentrated , but many middle class Americans have still benefited indirectly through their pension funds . 
Overall , after almost 25 years of stunning prosperity , punctuated by only two mild recessions , most Americans feel pretty confident about their economic situation . 
Unemployment is at a cyclical low , and the economy appears to be less volatile than at any point in modern history . 
So it is not surprising that private consumption continues to hold up even as US economic growth has shifted into lower gear . 
People have enjoyed such huge capital gains over the past decade that most feel like gamblers on a long winning streak . 
By now , they see themselves as playing with the house &apos;s ( or their houses &quot; ) money . 
It is less easy to rationalize why the US government is continuing to run budget deficits despite a cyclical boom . 
When a fiscally responsible government launches a war , it typically cuts back on other domestic expenditures and raises taxes . 
The Bush administration did the opposite . 
It may not be good economics , but the strategy proved to be good politics , for a time . 
Unfortunately , it is unlikely the new Democratic majority in Congress will do much about it . 
Of course , it takes two to tango . 
Ben Bernanke , the US Federal Reserve chairman , once famously pinned the whole US current account deficit on a &quot; global savings glut . &quot; 
But it would be more accurate to say that there is global investment shortfall , with investment trending downwards despite the upward trend in global growth . 
This investment shortfall is due to many factors , but perhaps the main one is that there are substantial medium-term institutional roadblocks to investment in many developing countries , where long-term returns now seem to be by far the highest . 
The net result is that money is being parked temporarily in low-yield investments in the US , although this cannot be the long-run trend . 
What then is future of the dollar ? 
As long as the status quo persists , with strong global growth and stunning macroeconomic stability , the US can continue to borrow and run trade deficits without immediate consequence . 
Over time , the dollar will still decline , but perhaps by no more than a couple of percent per year . 
Nevertheless , it is not hard to imagine scenarios in which the dollar collapses . 
Nuclear terrorism , a slowdown in China , or a sharp escalation of violence in the Middle East could all blow the lid off the current economic dynamic . 
In principle , one can also think of scenarios in which the dollar shoots up , but overall these seem less likely . 
In sum , the fact that the US trade balance has defied gravity for so many years has made it possible for the dollar to do so , too . 
But some day , the US may well have to pay the bill for its spendthrift ways . 
When that day arrives , Americans had better pray that their creditors will be as happy to accept dollars as they are now .
