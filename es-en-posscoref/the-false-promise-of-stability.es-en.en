The False Promise of Stability 
France , Portugal and Germany are all flagrantly flaunting the Stability Pact , the agreement among Eurozone members to keep their deficits below a critical threshold ( 3 % of GDP today , but lower , supposedly , in the future ) . 
France &apos;s Prime Minister , Pierre Raffarin , defends his government &apos;s position by saying that France was not prepared to impose austerity on its own people . 
If France will not , other European leaders must wonder , why should they ? 
Telling the truth is something best left to academics , whose squabbles make it difficult to discern who is right and who is wrong . 
A few years ago , Alan Blinder , then Vice Chairman of America &apos;s Federal Reserve Board , was excoriated for stating the obvious : that monetary policy should target not only inflation , but also unemployment , and that , at least in the short run , there may be a trade-off between the two . 
There is a long list of central bankers &apos; homilies that are not supposed to be questioned ; do so and you are exiled from the small circle of those who supposedly know how the world &quot; really &quot; works . 
Here are three : 
An independent central bank is necessary for sound macro-economic policy . 
The truth : countries that do not have an independent central bank , like India , manage to contain inflation as effectively as those with independent central banks . 
In Russia , an independent central banker , Viktor Gerashencko , could not be removed for years , though he tolerated both inflation and corruption . 
More generally , there is little evidence that countries with independent central banks grow faster , have higher wages , or generate higher incomes - indeed , that they perform better in any real sense - than those that do not . 
Once inflation starts , it increases at a faster and faster rate , and the costs of reversing it are high . 
The truth : there is no evidence of an inflation precipice , or that the costs of reversing inflation ( in terms , say , of pushing unemployment to high levels ) are any greater than the benefits from inflation ( in terms , say , of allowing unemployment to fall to low levels ) . 
Inflation is bad for growth and productivity . 
The truth : below a critical threshold - a threshold far beyond the levels of inflation that now prevail in Europe and North America - there is no evidence of significant adverse effects from inflation . 
On the contrary , recent research by Nobel laureate economist George Akerlof and his colleagues suggests that pushing inflation too low may impede growth , and that the critical threshold is higher for countries , such as the post-communist transition economies , engaged in large structural changes . 
When an economy faces a downturn , one should engage in expansionary fiscal policies . 
But in a downturn tax revenues fall . 
But the EU &apos;s Stability Pact , as commonly interpreted , requires either that tax rates be raised ( always difficult , especially in a recession ) or that expenditures be cut . 
Either way , such policies will exacerbate the downturn . 
The Stability Pact put into place an automatic economic destabilizer . 
But the EU - indeed , every country - should seek automatic stabilizers , policies that automatically boost the economy in a downturn . 
The US is facing , albeit in somewhat weaker form , a similar problem . 
Most of America &apos;s 50 states have constitutional amendments that effectively impose a balanced budget . 
As tax revenues drop due to the economic downturn , the states are cutting back on expenditures , exacerbating America &apos;s slump - and the world &apos;s . 
I warned of this problem more than a year ago , and I suggested that the Federal government pick up the tab for the shortfall in state tax revenue , because the states did not cause the country &apos;s slowdown . 
At the time , there was some disagreement about how long the downturn would last ( I was a pessimist , and unfortunately I have been proved right ) . 
But I argued that this was irrelevant : making up the states &apos; shortfall would cost the government nothing if the optimists turned out to be right , but it would be just the right medicine if pessimists like me were correct . 
Instead , the Bush administration pushed ahead with tax cuts for the rich , tax cuts that were not designed to stimulate the economy and that , no surprise , have failed to stimulate the economy . 
The lesson for Europe is clear : the EU should redefine its Stability Pact in terms of the structural or full employment deficit - what the fiscal deficit would be if the economy were performing at full employment . 
To do otherwise is irresponsible . 
There does need to be a commitment to fiscal responsibility . 
In the long run , governments should run balanced budgets , with surpluses in good years making up for deficits in bad years . 
But to insist on an arbitrary budgetary position in an economic downturn is to ignore everything we have learned about economics in the past seventy years , risking the well being of millions of workers who are thrown out of employment . 
The Stability Pact holds another important lesson : casting in stone institutional arrangements designed to address the problems of the past is a recipe for failure in the future . 
In America in the 1990 &apos;s , the Clinton Administration fought demands by Republicans for a balanced budget amendment to the US constitution . 
US Democrats argued that if America faced an economic downturn , the government needed the flexibility to run a deficit . 
Is there any reason to believe that excessive policy inflexibility works better in Europe ?
