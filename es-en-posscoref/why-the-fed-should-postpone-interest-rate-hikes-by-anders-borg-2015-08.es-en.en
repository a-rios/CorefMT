Why the Fed Should Postpone Rate Hikes 
JACKSON HOLE , WYOMING - As central bankers from around the world gather this week in Jackson Hole for the Federal Reserve &apos;s annual Economic Policy Symposium , one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock-market turmoil . 
There are many reasons for these gyrations , but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates - perhaps as early as September - is clearly one of them . 
The arguments for a rate hike are valid . 
The United States &quot; economy is gaining traction . 
The International Monetary Fund forecasts 3 % annual growth in 2015 and 2016 , accompanied by inflation rates of 0.1 % and 1.5 % , respectively . 
When an economy is normalizing , it is reasonable to reduce expansionary measures , such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008 . 
Because the Fed has clearly communicated that it will move gradually toward less expansionary policies , its credibility would be damaged if it did not follow through . 
But there are strong reasons for the Fed to postpone interest-rate hikes and to keep monetary policy expansionary over the coming quarters . 
For starters , the US recovery remains weak . 
Historically , 3 % growth during a recovery is far from impressive . 
In other recent recoveries , growth often hit 4 % or even 5 % when increased capacity utilization pushed up productivity and investment . 
Over the past three decades , the US has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5 % . 
Some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors , which have reduced the labor force , as well as to weak productivity levels , which have been low . 
But America &apos;s potential output may be underestimated , and its inflation propensity exaggerated . 
The US labor market works well . 
Unemployment is down to 5 % , with no signs of overheating . 
The employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low . 
One reason for this is that labor-market flexibility increased during the recovery . 
Self-employment , short-term contracts , or part-time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years . 
Full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits are now much rarer . 
This ongoing &quot; Uberization &quot; of the US labor market means that the balance in the wage-setting process has shifted . 
As a result , it will take longer for demand to feed through to wages and inflation than in the past . 
Moreover , the economy is undergoing an ongoing technological shift stemming from digitization and globalization . 
Estimates from Citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades . 
Jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable ; but it is also clear that many other occupational categories - including administration , accounting , logistics , banking , and various service activities - are likely to be affected . 
Companies will be able to reduce their headcount and production costs while improving customer service , which , like Uberization , will affect the wage-setting process . 
Central bankers , I believe , are underestimating the impact of this structural shift . 
In the more tech-oriented economies , like the US , the United Kingdom , and the Nordic countries , there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor . 
Another reason why the Fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets , particularly China , could have a substantial impact on the global economy , with some clear implications for the US economy . 
When inflation is low for a long period , inflation expectations also tend to be low . 
Add falling commodity and energy prices to the mix and there is a risk that inflation expectations will remain too low to sustain a balanced recovery . 
The global implications of lower emerging-market currencies are also likely to be deflationary . 
The direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods . 
The indirect effect , which might be substantial , is that cost-competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases . 
There is also a risk of greater currency-market volatility if the Fed jumps the gun in raising rates . 
But , because they flooded global markets with liquidity , large portfolio flows have moved into emerging-market countries , whose currencies often are not as liquid as the dollar . 
When investment moves back into dollars , the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become excessive . 
The Fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system . 
Excessive currency volatility is not in America &apos;s interest , not least because large exchange-rate depreciations in emerging markets would amplify the effects of globalization on US jobs , wages , and inflation , particularly as weaker foreign currencies make outsourcing a more economically viable solution . 
Another reason for the Fed to reconsider hiking rates is that the legitimacy of the Bretton Woods institutions depends on a well-functioning global financial system . 
The global economy &apos;s center of gravity is moving to Asia , Latin America , and Africa , but the IMF and the World Bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s . 
If the Fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets , this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system . 
The Fed should regard lower commodity prices , reduced inflationary pressures , changes in the labor market , and further disruptive technological shifts as sufficiently convincing arguments to postpone a rate hike . 
Including the risk of excessive volatility in the global financial system tips the balance even further . 
There is plenty of time for the Fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted , and the conclave in Jackson Hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication . 
If the facts have changed , the policy implications must also change . 
The greatest loss of credibility always comes when policymakers try to ignore changing realities .
