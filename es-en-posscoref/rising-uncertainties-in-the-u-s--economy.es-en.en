Rising Uncertainties in the U.S. Economy 
CAMBRIDGE : America &apos;s economy is entering a risky phase . 
The conditions that underpinned its long boom are weakening . 
It is a fool &apos;s game to try to predict changes in public sentiments . 
Nonetheless , good economic reasoning can help us to anticipate the economic turbulence ahead . 
The US boom has been a mix of reality and wishful thinking . 
The reality is that technological advancement , combined with flexible and dynamic labor and capital markets , led to a rapid rise in productivity growth and the spread of new technologies . 
Lives in the US changed remarkably for the better recently , with improvements in the service economy , new medical technologies , access to information , and the like . 
Wishful thinking transformed economic gains into visions of easy wealth . 
The New Economy - which is real - became the &quot; invincible &quot; economy where risks are discounted , stocks always rise , world economic conditions are always beneficial , and budget surpluses continue forever . 
Optimism manifested itself in two ways . 
First , American stock markets rose giddily - adding $ 8 trillion in paper wealth to owners of US equities in a five-year period . 
Second , American consumers increased spending as a result of their paper wealth , reducing or eliminating their savings from income because their stock market wealth would protect them in the future . 
The combination of large business investments in new technologies , combined with high levels of consumer spending , fueled a spending boom . 
For every dollar of income produced in America , spending by consumers , businesses , and the government now equals one dollar and four cents . 
The extra four cents per dollar is paid for , in essence , by borrowing from abroad . 
Foreigners have been keen on buying US stocks and bonds , while American businesses and households used that capital to support their investment and spending . 
All of this will work out fine if the rosy scenarios continue . 
The problem is that many contrary economic signals are now appearing . 
Suddenly , doubts have arisen , and the cumulative effect of them could to turn a boom into slowdown , or even into recession . 
The first doubt is about the stock market . 
Euphoric investors acted as if profits would continue to grow at unprecedented rates . 
Recently , profits have not cooperated . 
As forecasts of profitability drooped , the stock market declined . 
The easy wealth of recent years has become less easy . 
Nobody is panicking yet , but nobody can rule out more declines . 
The second doubt concerns the world economy . 
Soaring oil prices will cut corporate profits and household purchasing power . 
Interest rates in the US might be raised to head off the inflationary effects of higher oil prices . 
Violence in the Middle East makes matters worse . 
The third doubt is about US economic management . 
While nobody can predict the outcome of the presidential election , we can be certain that a new , untested Administration will take over in January . 
George W. Bush &apos;s proposals for a massive tax cut are risky - gambling on large future budget surpluses that might never appear , and gambling that a sharp tax cut won &apos;t trigger a jump in interest rates . 
A Gore Administration would have more continuity with present policies , but first-year Administrations always create uncertainties and anxieties , and many of Gore &apos;s spending proposals will create uncertainties about future budget prospects . 
The great economist John Maynard Keynes taught that changes in market sentiments - which he called &quot; animal spirits &quot; - have a life of their own ; that swings in sentiment could swing an economy . 
Optimism turns to euphoria turns to pessimism turns to panic . 
America has had its share of euphoria ; pessimism is now setting in . 
Panic is by no means assured , but cannot be ruled out . 
What would happen if more shocks undermine the confidence that fueled America &apos;s boom ? 
Suppose oil prices remain high , profit forecasts continue to fall , and the new Administration unsettles the markets . 
Stock prices would fall ; interest rates would rise ; budget surplus projections would be cut . 
Trillions of dollars of paper wealth already factored into spending decisions by households , firms , and government would disappear . 
Households would cut spending , and investors would reduce their American holdings , driving the dollar down against the Euro and other currencies . 
American politics would dramatically heat up , with a fierce debate over priorities . 
This would incite even more economic uncertainties . 
Depending on how rapidly and deeply such a swing occurs , America could merely slow down ( the so-called &quot; soft landing &quot; ) , or fall into recession ( the increasingly feared &quot; hard landing &quot; ) . 
Normally , a cutback in optimism reduces interest rates , helping sustain investment and consumer spending . 
But here , who knows ? 
The Federal Reserve might keep interest rates high to fight the inflationary consequences of high oil prices . 
Or interest rates might remain high because of increased uncertainties about the size of future budget surpluses , or the risks of large tax cuts . 
For the rest of the world , economic maneuvering would be tricky . 
For many economies , exports to America would slow , and growth would depend either on finding new markets ( say , increased sales in Europe and Japan if those economies picked up ) , or on being able to increase domestic consumption and investment within those economies . 
If investors take money out of the US and park it in other markets , those economies would enjoy a boost of wealth and spending . 
No doubt , then , that the world could compensate for slower growth in US by faster growth abroad , but there is also no doubt that such transitions are hard to manage . 
This is especially true because financial systems in many countries have still not recovered from their own recent crises . 
Events in the world economy are notoriously hard to predict . 
America &apos;s economy could continue to charge ahead . 
More realistically , the combination of optimism and productivity growth that powered America &apos;s boom looks likely to be less robust in the coming year .
