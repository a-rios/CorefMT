Good and Bad Capitalism 
PARIS - The reality of market exchange - direct transactions between merchants and customers - appeared gradually 3,000 or 4,000 years ago . 
In this novel social relationship , the customer was free to buy whatever he wanted , whenever and from whomever he chose , often bargaining with the seller about the price . 
Because of these features , the free market is part of a basic freedom that is rooted in everyday life . 
It remains dominant today , as all efforts to establish an alternative , even totalitarianism , failed . 
Indeed , it has been 20 years since the former communist countries of Eastern Europe rejoined the world of market exchange , a step taken as early as 1946 by social democrats around the world . 
For several thousand years , the free market was comprised of individuals : craftsmen , traders , and consumers . 
Capitalism when it arose three centuries ago was simply the same activity on a larger scale . 
Because of steam engines and electricity , a large number of people were enabled to work together , and corporations could attract a large number of small savers , who became capitalists . 
This system is fantastic . 
By the time of the French Revolution , the standard of living had hardly doubled since the Roman Empire . 
Today , it is 150 times higher . 
But capitalism is also cruel . 
At its inception , people were compelled to work 17 hours a day without a day off or retirement . 
Thanks to democracy , social struggle , and workers &quot; unions , together with the political efforts of social democracy , the inhumanity of the system was partly softened . 
Nevertheless , left to itself , the system is unstable . 
It undergoes a crisis about once a decade . 
The twentieth century &apos;s worst crisis , between 1929 and 1932 , caused 70 million workers in Great Britain , the United States , and Germany to lose their jobs ( with no unemployment benefits ) in less than six months . 
It brought Adolf Hitler to power , leading to a war that left 50 million dead . 
After the war , the belief that the system needed to be stabilized became widespread . 
Eventually , a more balanced system emerged , based on three main institutions : health insurance , Keynesian fiscal and monetary policy to soften the impact of the business cycle , and , of utmost importance , a policy of high salaries and reduction of economic inequality in order to boost household consumption . 
The achievement was stunning : 30 years of consistent and rapid economic growth , full and permanent employment in all developed nations , and no financial or economic crisis . 
Standards of living rose nearly ten-fold during this period . 
Prosperity became the main weapon that ensured the West &apos;s victory over Soviet communism . 
The people of Eastern Europe were eager to embrace this kind of capitalism . 
Capitalism &apos;s political success , however , came at the very moment when the system was starting to deteriorate . 
High salaries drove growth but reduced earnings . 
Shareholders organized themselves into pension funds , investment funds , and hedge funds . 
Because of their pressure , employment fell , reducing the share of wages in total national income by 10 % over the past 30 years . 
In developed nations , the number of the working poor reached 10-15 % of the workforce , with another 5-10 % of unemployed workers and 5-10 % dropping out of the labor market altogether . 
Moreover , over the past 25 years , a severe financial crisis - regional or global - has erupted every four or five years . 
Annual growth fell below 3 % on average . 
Today &apos;s crisis was triggered by widespread concealment of bad loans within pools of securities sold all over the world . 
The spread of bankruptcies triggered a severe credit crunch , which triggered a deep recession and with it a brutal rise in unemployment . 
Capitalism &apos;s three stabilizing devices lost their efficacy . 
While rich countries reacted more quickly and more wisely in stimulating their economies than in 1929 , and the hemorrhaging of banks was stanched , this has not been enough to boost growth . 
We are now in a strange period in which governments , bankers , and journalists herald the end of the crisis just because large banks are no longer failing every week . 
But nothing has been solved , and unemployment continues to rise . 
Even worse , the banking sector is trying to take advantage of publicly financed rescue packages to protect its privileges , including immorally huge bonuses and extravagant freedoms to create speculative financial assets with no links to the real economy . 
Indeed , the so-called end of the crisis looks more like a reconstruction of the mechanisms that caused it . 
Everywhere , economic activity is painfully stabilizing at 5 % to 10 % below 2007 levels . 
The root of the crisis remains the fall in purchasing power on the part of the middle and lower classes , and the collapse of speculative bubbles created by the wealthy classes &quot; greed for more . 
But if we are to have a system where nearly everybody can become better off , the wealthy cannot become ever wealthier at the same time . 
Otherwise , we can expect a long period of stagnation , punctuated by periodic financial crises . 
In these circumstances , a majority of European voters have recently shown , once again , that they favor the right and its tendency to support the fortune seekers . 
A bleak future awaits us .
