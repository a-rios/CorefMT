A More Perfect Monetary Union 
WARSAW - The eurozone is often considered an experiment - a monetary union without political unification . 
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state , which possesses two relevant features : limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers . 
Those who claim that &quot; political union &quot; is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature , despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states . 
In this sense , they ignore the fact that the European Union &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union , not its substitute . 
Indeed , the eurozone &apos;s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget , but from weak enforcement of the Pact . 
More fundamentally , monetary unions - in a broader sense - have existed not only within single states , but also in groups of sovereign states , the gold standard being the most notable example in history . 
The experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons . 
First , they required fiscal discipline in the member states , which was true under the gold standard , with its informal norm of balanced budgets . 
Second , they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center , because such a center did not exist . 
Instead , a great deal of flexibility , including within their labor markets , facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks . 
It is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption . 
This would require an enhanced level of European identity , something which the Union &apos;s political elites cannot generate artificially . But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve , but rather that it would not address the main problem : the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states . 
Instead of looking at the wrong model - that of a single state - the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks . 
First , utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks . 
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt , with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles , which cause deep recessions - and thus sharp increases in budget deficits - when they burst . 
Likewise , the European Central Bank &apos;s monetary policy should &quot; lean against the wind &quot; by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles . 
As the ECB &apos;s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries , the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth . 
Meanwhile , the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced , which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions . 
To be sure , initiatives at the EU and / or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states , which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics . 
But EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states , and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries , which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone - and within the EU . 
Second , beyond strengthening economic institutions , EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks . 
The former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt , while the latter would help them to address unemployment . 
Of the many necessary measures in this area , the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market , coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs . 
Moreover , the Lisbon Agenda should be reinvigorated , with a focus on market reforms , and the EU should urgently reconsider measures - particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy - that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and / or hamper the flexibility of markets . 
In this respect , the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important . 
As EU members already have large tax burdens , further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth . 
Thus , fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments , which -given the aging of EU societies - must include raising the retirement age . 
Finally , rigid labor markets and , more generally , regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy , deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks , and contribute to the growth of unemployment . 
Therefore , labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon Agenda . 
European elites are fond of exclamations about &quot; European solidarity , &quot; &quot; social cohesion , &quot; and the &quot; European social model . &quot; 
But no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here - or obviate the need for them .
