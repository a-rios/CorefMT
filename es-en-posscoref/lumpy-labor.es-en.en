Lumpy Labor 
LONDON - As the world recovers from the Great Recession , it has become increasingly difficult to discern the true trend of events . 
On the one hand , we measure recovery by our success in regaining pre-recession levels of growth , output , and employment . 
On the other hand , there is a disquieting sense that today &apos;s &quot; new normal &quot; may be slower growth and higher levels of unemployment . 
So the challenge now is to formulate policies to provide work for all who want it in economies that , as currently organized , may not be able to do so . 
This issue is much more acute in developed than in developing countries , though interdependence makes it , to some extent , a common problem . 
The problem has two aspects . 
As countries become more prosperous , one would expect their growth rates to slow . 
In earlier times , growth was fueled by capital scarcity : capital investment attracted a high rate of return , and this created a virtuous circle of saving and investment . 
Today , capital in the developed world is abundant ; the saving ratio declines as people consume more ; and production shifts increasingly to services , where productivity gains are limited . 
So economic growth - the rise in real incomes - slows . 
This was already happening before the Great Recession , so generating full-time jobs that pay decent wages was becoming ever more difficult . 
Hence the growth of casual , discontinuous , part-time jobs . 
The other aspect of the problem is the long-term increase in technology-driven unemployment , largely owing to automation . 
In one way , this is a sign of economic progress : the output of each unit of labor is constantly rising . 
But it also means that fewer units of labor are needed to produce the same quantity of goods . 
The market &apos;s solution is to re-deploy displaced labor to services . 
But many branches of the service sector are a sink of dead-end , no-hope jobs . 
Immigration exacerbates both aspects of the problem . 
A large part of migration , especially within the European Union , is casual - here today , gone tomorrow , with none of the costs associated with full-time hiring . 
This makes it attractive to employers , but it is low-productivity work , and it increases the difficulty of finding steady employment for the majority of a country &apos;s workforce . 
So , are we doomed to a jobless recovery ? 
Is the future one in which jobs are so scarce that many workers will have to accept a pittance to find any employment , and become increasingly dependent on social transfers as market-clearing wages fall below the subsistence level ? 
Or should Western societies anticipate another round of technological wizardry , like the Internet revolution , which will produce a new wave of job creation and prosperity ? 
It would be foolish to rule out the last possibility a priori . 
Capitalism has a genius for reinventing itself . 
It has seen off all of its challengers , and there are no new ones in sight . 
Moreover , no one can predict the discovery of new knowledge ; if they could , it would already have been discovered . 
But there is also a more troubling possibility : if , by proceeding on our current profligate path , we succeed in making natural resources scarce , we will require a new wave of technology , regardless of the cost , to rescue us from calamity . 
But let &apos;s put these grim prospects aside , and ponder what a civilized solution to the problem of technology-driven unemployment would look like . 
The answer , surely , is work-sharing . 
To the Anglo-American economist , any such proposal is anathema , because it smacks of the dreaded &quot; lump of labor &quot; fallacy - the idea , once popular in trade-union circles , that there exists only a certain amount of work , and it should be shared out fairly . 
Of course , this is a fallacy when resources are scarce , but even economists never thought that growth would continue forever . 
The discipline &apos;s founders expected that , at some point in the future , mankind would attain a &quot; stationary state &quot; of zero growth . 
Then we would require only a certain amount of work - much less than we perform now - to satisfy all reasonable needs . 
The choice would then be between limitless technology-driven unemployment and sharing out the work that needed to be done . 
Only a workaholic would prefer the first solution . 
Unfortunately , such people seem to be in charge of policy in the United States and Britain . 
Many other European countries are adopting the second solution . 
Work-sharing schemes , in many different forms , are becoming the norm in Holland and Denmark , and have made inroads in France and Germany . 
The key element in any such approach is to separate work from income . 
A Danish law enacted in 1993 recognizes a right to work discontinuously , while also recognizing people &apos;s right to a continuous income . 
It allows employees to choose a &quot; sabbatical &quot; year , which could be divided into shorter periods , every four or seven years . 
Unemployed people would take the place of those on leave , who , for their part , would receive 70 % of the unemployment benefit they would get if they lost their jobs ( typically , 90 % of one &apos;s salary ) . 
Danish unions have managed to use such statutory individual rights to reduce the working hours of entire company workforces , and thus increase the number of permanent jobs . 
The idea of a universal basic income , paid to all citizens , independent of their position in the labor market , is a logical next step . 
This will not be everyone &apos;s cup of tea . 
And , as I suggested above , all schemes aimed at easing the burden of work and increasing the amount of leisure risk falling victim to our genius for conjuring up new disasters . 
After all , both capitalism and economics need scarcity to justify their existence , and will not give it up readily .
