Leaders for a Leaderless World 
PARIS - The newspaper commentaries that I write often have a dark perspective . 
Sadly , this one will be no different . 
First , the global significance of US President Barack Obama &apos;s reelection is clear : the world has escaped a disaster for international cooperation . 
The US was on the verge of sinking into isolationist nationalism , reinforced , perhaps , by xenophobic sentiment . 
Obama &apos;s victory , despite America &apos;s economic travails , clears the way for cooperation based on a sympathetic ear to others and on negotiations in which the US does not deny the legitimacy of a global public interest ( as it has done , unfortunately , on the issue of climate change ) . 
The other piece of good news concerns France , and thus is more &quot; local , &quot; but is crucially important nonetheless . 
Like everywhere else in the developed world , the global crisis has hit the French economy hard , with output stagnating , unemployment rising , job insecurity mounting , government debt soaring , and the stock market at risk of crashing . 
Manufacturing production has plummeted , the trade balance has deteriorated sharply , and corporate bankruptcies are increasingly frequent . 
For six months , France has had new leadership - a new president , government , and parliament . 
Many began to wonder whether Hollande was aware of the scope of the crisis that the recent downturn might trigger . 
In recent weeks , however , the government has introduced energetic and courageous measures to boost the competitiveness of French industries , including a huge â‚¬ 20 billion ( $ 26 billion ) tax break for businesses , to be financed by a hike in value-added tax , which means that the general public will pay for it . 
The VAT increase will hurt , but there was no other way . 
Awareness , boldness , and comprehensive policymaking have come as a relief to French investors , and have left them better positioned to face the crisis . 
The French government &apos;s new push to confront the country &apos;s economic plight matters not only to France , but to Europe and the world as well . 
After all , France is the eurozone &apos;s second-largest economy , and the fifth-largest economy in the world . 
And yet , despite these bright spots , international cooperation on issues ranging from regional conflicts to the protection of global public goods remains weak . 
Antarctica , the only land in the world that is administered directly by the international community , is a recent case in point . 
The Antarctic Treaty , negotiated in 1959 , prohibits any and all military activities in Antarctica and forbids the establishment of any borders . 
Three agreements - the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals ( 1972 ) , the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ( CCAMLR , 1980 ) , and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty ( PEP , 1991 ) , which prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources - have since been added to the treaty . 
The Antarctic Treaty System includes three annual meetings : one deals with the supervision and management of the Treaty itself , and the other two concern the CCAMLR and the PEP . 
In recent years , proposals have been considered that would establish marine reserves around the continent and end the risk of growing scarcity , or the outright disappearance , of a variety of species of fish and cetaceans . 
The principle that international cooperation is required to protect fishery resources , which are dwindling everywhere , was adopted at the 2011 CCAMLR meeting . 
At the 2012 CCAMLR meeting , which concluded at the beginning of November in Hobart , Australia , three proposals ( from the US , New Zealand , and France / Australia ) to establish marine reserves in three different areas were discussed . 
They were compatible and would reinforce one another . 
Yet the discussion foundered , and no decision was taken . 
Russia and Ukraine - and , to a lesser extent , China - blocked efforts to reach an agreement . 
This failure reflects the same dynamic at work in the breakdown of global climate-change conferences in recent years : a few cynical countries , whose cooperation is needed to save the planet , fuel the madness of those bent on destroying it . 
That will not change until a new consciousness emerges worldwide to persuade states to support binding international law . 
The US has now reelected a president who understands this . 
France has a president who understands the need for bold , far-reaching actions as well . 
Their active leadership , and that of others , is needed now more than ever to turn the tide .
