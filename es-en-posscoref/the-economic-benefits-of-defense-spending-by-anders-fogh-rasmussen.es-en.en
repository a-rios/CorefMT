The Defense Dividend 
BRUSSELS - On a hillside overlooking the Turkish city of Gaziantep , Patriot missile launchers are keeping watch under NATO command and control . 
This is just one of six Patriot batteries from three Allied countries - Germany , the Netherlands , and the United States - providing protection for millions of people along Turkey &apos;s southeastern border with Syria . 
The deployment shows NATO &apos;s enduring commitment to its core task : safeguarding its members &quot; security . 
It also shows that , when a crisis erupts , there is no substitute for effective deterrence and defense . 
Virtually every day brings fresh evidence that an arc of crisis - from terrorism and weapons proliferation to cyber-attacks and piracy - is spreading from the Middle East and the Sahel to Central Asia . 
These risks will not disappear while NATO members focus on fixing their finances . 
The fact is that our way of life is predicated on security and stability , without which investment withers , employment collapses , and economies shrink . 
In these tough economic times , we are all acutely aware that security comes at a price . 
Defense is our essential insurance policy in a complex and unpredictable world . 
Conflicts take a terrible human toll , while restoring peace and supporting reconstruction is extremely expensive . 
For example , the total cost of the Balkan wars of the 1990 &quot; s is estimated at $ 150 billion . 
Today , NATO continues to maintain a safe and secure environment for all of Kosovo &apos;s people , and is helping the entire region progress along the path of Euro-Atlantic integration . 
Another example is piracy , which can threaten vital trade and energy routes . 
The overall cost of piracy off the coast of Somalia in 2011 was estimated at $ 7 billion . 
Although the situation remains precarious , for the last eight months pirates off the Horn of Africa have been unsuccessful in their attacks against merchant vessels . 
Finally , we have seen cyber-attacks not just swamping Web sites , but targeting entire countries , such as NATO ally Estonia in 2007 . 
The Estonian presidency , parliament , government ministries , political parties , news organizations , banks , and communications companies were all hit . 
In fact , everything on which a modern democracy and knowledge-based economy relies was attacked . 
Today , as part of our continuing drive to improve the security of our members &quot; networks , Estonia &apos;s capital , Tallinn , hosts a NATO cyber-defense center of excellence . 
These examples show that hard power and soft power go together . 
To be effective , we need both . 
When dealing with international security challenges , diplomacy remains the primary tool ; but , by investing in defense , we can back up our statements with military strength and improve our chances of addressing challenges successfully . 
It is also an investment in our most innovative and technologically advanced industries . 
Indeed , research programs led by defense industries have already changed our lives , giving us the jet engine , the Internet , and satellite navigation . 
In the future , technology developed for military aerial surveillance could have major civilian benefits - for example , helping to control traffic and reduce road congestion , and assisting in the dispatch of rescue teams and humanitarian assistance . 
Expertise in the defense sector has been built up over generations . 
Like any other high-tech industry , it is constantly evolving . 
If we cut defense spending too much , for too long , we will sacrifice that hard-won expertise , which will be impossible to regenerate quickly when we need it most . 
A strong defense also helps to ensure that the benefits of security are shared across countries . 
NATO itself embodies that goal . 
Our 28 allies have more security together than they could achieve on their own . 
While this helps them to defend their own interests more effectively , it also allows them to play a much more active role in international crisis management , such as the protection of civilians in Libya in 2011 . 
So defense investment is also investment in security and stability , in diplomacy and cooperation , and in technology and innovation . 
It is an investment in a safer and more prosperous future for our own countries and for the rest of the world . 
Even though defense budgets are under pressure in this time of austerity , it is essential that NATO members hold the line on defense spending and are prepared to increase it when their economies recover . 
The decisions that we take on defense today will have a profound impact on our children &apos;s security tomorrow .
