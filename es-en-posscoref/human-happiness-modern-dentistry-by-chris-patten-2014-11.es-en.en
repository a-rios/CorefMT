Something to Smile About 
LONDON - As I put pen to paper , my wife threw out a seasonal challenge : &quot; Christmas is approaching - the time for peace and joy and all that . 
Can &apos;t you write about something that will make people happy ? &quot; 
What sounds like a light-hearted request is actually a formidable task . 
Ebola is decimating lives and livelihoods in West Africa . 
A legion of Islamist thugs is terrorizing Syria and Iraq . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s forces have invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine . 
Add to that a faltering global economy , and there seems to be little &quot; holiday cheer &quot; on offer . 
But happiness is a complex phenomenon . 
People living poorly may feel happier more often than their more &quot; fortunate &quot; counterparts . 
It is this kind of contradiction that has fueled research in the social sciences and neurology devoted to answering the age-old question : What is the secret to happiness ? 
Of course , the tools that scientists are using - from advanced imaging to examine the brain &apos;s pleasure centers to microeconomic happiness equations - are not proven in this area . 
Can an algorithm , however well researched and carefully crafted , ever really capture the relationship between happiness and factors like income , health , lifespan , and education ? 
In any case , it is clear that happiness is not dictated by one &apos;s job title or bank balance . 
The British comedian Spike Milligan may have wanted the chance to prove that money couldn &apos;t buy him happiness . 
But he undoubtedly would have conceded that other factors - like good health and close friends - did much to improve his state of mind . 
Even seemingly mundane activities can - and should - bring considerable happiness , as they can represent significant progress . 
My visit to the dentist last week , for example , was far superior to my childhood visits . 
As a child , the mere sight of the dentist chair would cause me to break out in a cold sweat , as I anticipated my forthcoming encounter with the battery of gleaming instruments seemingly designed for the principal purpose of causing excruciating pain . 
My most recent experience , by contrast , was uncomplicated , even comfortable . 
And I was not a child that long ago . 
Imagine a child &apos;s experience a century ago or earlier . 
Some 5,000 years ago , the Chinese used acupuncture , not dental care , to treat toothaches . 
Aristotle was preoccupied with dental issues , writing about treatments of decayed teeth and gum disease , extractions conducted with forceps , and the use of wire to stabilize fractured jaws . 
The classical Sanskrit writer Vagbhata described 75 oral diseases . 
And Shakespeare noted that tooth decay was a cause of awful pain and unpleasant odor . 
The pain affected rich and poor alike . 
Queen Elizabeth I of England used bits of cloth to plug the gaps in her teeth , in order to improve her appearance . 
Louis XIV of France had all of his upper teeth removed after a dentist fractured his jaw trying to extract a lower molar . 
So many people lost their teeth that dead people &apos;s teeth were recycled . 
The teeth of the 50,000 soldiers killed at Waterloo in 1815 were extracted and used until the 1860s as replacements for the toothless . 
Even in my own lifetime , tooth loss was commonplace . 
My grandmother lost all of her teeth during her life , and my parents lost many of theirs . 
They used to pop their dentures into a mug of whitener every night . 
Of course , dental maladies have not been eliminated . 
Today , 30 % of those aged 65-75 worldwide are toothless , with poor and disadvantaged groups recording the highest rates . 
But the overall rate is falling . 
My friend &apos;s young daughter , who recently asked if she would ever have &quot; in and out &quot; teeth like her grandparents , can be relatively confident that she will not . 
Even if she did , however , she would not face the barriers that people with poor dental health confronted in the past . 
Potential army recruits were turned away if they had tooth decay or missing teeth , because they would be unable to bite open a powder cartridge for a musket or use their teeth to remove a grenade &apos;s safety clip ; they would also struggle to eat properly . 
During the Boer War , the British had to send mincing machines to South Africa , so that soldiers were not forced to choke down unmasticated lumps of meat . 
It seems that the American writer and journalist P.J. O &apos;Rourke had a point when he argued that the best thing about living in the twenty-first century , versus some &quot; golden age &quot; of the past , is modern dentistry . 
Why not take teeth - their relative cleanliness and health - as a mark of economic progress and human happiness ? 
It is , of course , unlikely that dental health will ever secure a place on the United Nations development agenda . 
But it does offer a straightforward indicator of relative wellbeing . 
And given how painful a dental condition can be , dentistry deserves a place of honor on next spring &apos;s UN-sponsored International Day of Happiness . 
Whatever political horrors may be afflicting the world , there is something for many of us to smile about : a clean , healthy , and pain-free set of pearly whites .
