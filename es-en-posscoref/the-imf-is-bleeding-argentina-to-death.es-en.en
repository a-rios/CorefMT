The IMF Is Bleeding Argentina to Death 
When Argentina &apos;s financial crisis first exploded , I pinned the primary responsibility on Argentina itself , rather than on international institutions such as the IMF . 
Now , half-a-year later , the balance of responsibility needs to be reconsidered . 
Even though Argentina is , in the last analysis , mainly responsible for its fate , the IMF is not helping . 
The problem is not only , or even mainly , the IMF &apos;s delay in providing money to Argentina . 
The bigger problem is the paucity of correct ideas coming from the IMF . 
The IMF lacks a clear idea about what to do in Argentina . 
It continues to pound on one theme alone : that Argentina &apos;s economic crisis is the result of fiscal profligacy , the result of a government living beyond its means . 
So it emphasizes the need for Argentina to cut budget expenditures . 
As Argentina &apos;s crisis worsens , indeed with output possibly collapsing by 10 to 15 % this year and with unemployment soaring , the IMF keeps asking for deeper cuts . 
This is something like the 18 th century medical practice in which doctors &quot; treated &quot; feverish patients by drawing blood from them , weakening the patients further and frequently hastening their deaths . 
This IMF approach was abandoned in rich countries about seventy years ago during the Great Depression . 
When output crumbled due to a profound banking and financial crisis ( linked to the collapse of the gold standard ) , tax revenues plummeted in the US and Europe , and conservative governments tried to cut budget spending to limit budget deficits . 
As they cut , output fell further and economic misery deepened . 
In 1936 , John Maynard Keynes demonstrated the futility of trying to balance the budget in the midst of an economic depression . 
The IMF is tragically ignoring this logic in Argentina . 
Argentina &apos;s widening budget deficit is mainly the result of its economic collapse since 1999 , not the cause of it . 
The deficit was relatively mild until 1999 , when the economy went into recession . 
Yes , budgetary waste exists , but it is not the cause of an extreme macroeconomic crisis . 
The recession was mainly caused not by budgetary spending , but rather by Brazil &apos;s sharp devaluation of its currency in February 1999 , a step which made Argentina &apos;s own Peso uncompetitive and led investors ( rightly , it turned out ) to expect a similar devaluation in Argentina . 
As investors fled the country because of fear of devaluation ( in a period in which the Argentine Government was promising never to devalue the peso , fixed at one-to-one with the US dollar ) , interest rates rose and bank deposits fell . 
This deepened the recession in 2000 and 2001 and led to a rising budget deficit because of declining tax revenues . 
Argentina &apos;s Government of the time ( under President de la Rua ) and the IMF tried the Depression-era false &quot; cure &quot; of budget cuts , but there was no way that austerity could keep up with falling tax revenues . 
The budget deficit continued to widen as the economy collapsed . 
The correct approach to solving Argentina &apos;s problems in 2001 , and now , would have been to end speculation over devaluation . 
I favored the approach of &quot; dollarization , &quot; or replacing the Peso by the US dollar and thereby ending the fear of a future change of the exchange rate . 
Instead , the government closed down the banking system , so that depositors could no longer convert their pesos into dollars ! 
Closure of the banking system led to a full collapse of confidence in the country . 
Now , Argentines are emigrating to Europe and the US in large numbers and are trying to convert Pesos to dollars at any opportunity . 
The Peso is collapsing in value , and the bank system remains frozen . 
The economy is &quot; dead in the water . &quot; 
The correct move now is to restore confidence in the banking system and the currency . 
This can best be accomplished by dollarizing the economy , just as Argentina should have done last fall . 
In addition , the international community should offer emergency funding to help provide deposit insurance for the banking system , thereby re-establishing a modicum of confidence in financial institutions . 
International banks in Argentina should work with the Government to restore banking functions within days , not months . 
Argentina should be given a year &apos;s full suspension of payments on its foreign debts , to be followed by a deep reduction in overall indebtedness . 
With banks reopened , a currency that works , and suspension of debt servicing , some short-term IMF loans could boost confidence and help the country overcome its crisis of confidence . 
Only then should the Government pledge a responsible path of budget spending , but not extreme cuts . 
Instead , the IMF recommends antiquated and phony solutions . 
By focusing on the budget deficit , it is chasing symptoms , not causes . 
It is putting forward economically and politically impossible recommendations , telling Argentina to cut public services to the extreme , when schools and hospitals are already on the verge of collapse . 
For centuries , doctors weakened or killed their patients in large numbers through bleeding , until medicine became a science . 
It is high time that the IMF approach its mission scientifically and recognize that it is on the wrong track in Argentina . 
As a result , the IMF must increasingly share responsibility and blame for Argentina &apos;s havoc .
