The Union and the Dragon 
This month , China and the European Union mark 30 years of official relations . 
During that period , changes within China , and in the nature of those relations , have been dramatic . 
Will China and the EU be competitors or partners ? 
Many challenges face both China and the EU . 
The first are economic . 
China &apos;s development in recent years has been magnificent . 
As it integrates into the world economy , it must seek to sustain growth while protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality . 
These are daunting tasks , and China cannot address them alone . 
Indeed , sustainable development is a challenge for both China and Europe . 
After all , by far the most important factor determining whether our children and grandchildren will enjoy secure , healthy , and productive lives is whether the world &apos;s natural ecosystems survive the pressures put on them by modern civilization . 
A recent UN report warned that we have already entered the danger zone . 
Numerous land and sea ecosystems are in danger of being destroyed forever , with effects that are hard to predict . 
One downside to China &apos;s rapid growth is its rising demand for energy and the increased CO2 emissions that accompany it . 
China is quickly turning into one of the world &apos;s largest importers of oil and gas . 
The International Energy Agency &apos;s World Energy Outlook 2004 predicts that , between now and 2030 , global demand for energy will rise by roughly 60 % , with China and India accounting for nearly two-thirds of that increase . 
Huge investments - worth trillions of euros - will be needed to meet global energy requirements . 
The same report warns that , if we do not change our ways , worldwide CO2 emissions will rise exponentially . 
Of course , China clearly has a right - like any country - to seek the energy , minerals , and other resources it needs . 
This means that China must treat climate change and intelligent energy use as priorities in its national policies . 
Beyond economics , China must reassure others that its awakening will not make the world tremble . 
Thus , in formulating its policies , China must also sell those policies to a global audience . 
Most Europeans believe that China wants to be a shaper of - not a challenger to - a balanced world order , a strong United Nations , and an effective multilateral system . 
China &apos;s important role concerning North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions is a good example of exercising responsibility for international security and stability . 
The international community counts on China to pursue that role with vigor . 
If necessary , it must use its influence even more assertively to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table . 
Obviously , that solution must be in line with Chinese proposals and interests : a denuclearized Korean peninsula , which has the support of the EU . 
Opportunities exist for a constructive Chinese role elsewhere . 
Having concluded a ten-year energy agreement with Iran , China is in a position to support the EU &apos;s efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation , as the Union supports China &apos;s efforts concerning North Korea . 
This is not just about Iran , but also about the threat of a nuclear arms race across the entire Middle East . 
Chinese interests are served by a Middle East marked by regional cooperation . 
We count on China &apos;s continued support for European and American efforts in making sure that Iran &apos;s nuclear program remains limited to purely civilian purposes . 
Europe and the world are also watching China &apos;s handling of domestic human rights issues . 
The EU welcomed the inclusion last year of the following clause in the Chinese Constitution : &quot; The government respects and protects the human rights of the people . &quot; 
But it is deeds that matter . 
At the EU-China Summit , we discussed the Chinese government &apos;s plans for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
One subject China should address is freedom of belief . 
The obligation of prior registration of religious communities is discriminatory . 
Ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - and the resulting changes in Chinese laws and practice - would help to secure social and political stability in China , boost dialogue between China and the EU , and increase China &apos;s moral authority . 
It is time to replace the old cooperation agreement between the Union and China , dating from 1985 . 
Our relationship has evolved from a predominantly economic one into one that includes fighting terrorism , piracy , and organized crime , as well as many other issues . 
A structured dialogue - including the private sector , which is so intimately involved in China &apos;s development - is needed on energy , sustainable development , and the environment . 
We must see environmental problems and energy scarcity for what they are : threats to mankind as a whole . 
China will undoubtedly find the EU a tough negotiating partner . 
The EU sets all kinds of conditions for cooperation with other countries . 
Some issues are non-negotiable , because they are pillars of the European model that we seek to share with the world . 
These include democracy and the rule of law , respect for human rights and the environment , non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery , and the campaign against terrorism . 
The EU &apos;s political standards are high , but the fruits of cooperation are sweet . 
If we tackle our common problems together , China and Europe can be instrumental in turning the twenty-first century into a century of hope .
