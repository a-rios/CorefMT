Running in Place on Trade 
NEW YORK - Meetings of G-20 leaders regularly affirm the importance of maintaining and strengthening openness in trade . 
June &apos;s G-20 summit in Toronto , although not very effusive on trade , did not back away from it . 
Yet talk is cheap , and the open-mouth policy of ( generally pro-trade ) pronouncements has not been matched by action . 
The paradox is that this has been good for holding the line on protectionism . 
After all , actions are also necessary to &quot; roll back &quot; open trade . 
So we have largely stood still , in trade jargon . 
But lack of trade activism has also meant that we are not moving forward with trade liberalization . 
The long-standing Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations seems to have been put on indefinite hold . 
That governments did not break out into protectionism after the global financial crisis hit surprised many . 
In retrospect , it is easy to see why . 
Policy is driven by three &quot; I &apos;s &quot; : ideas , institutions , and interests ( i.e. , lobbies ) . 
On all three dimensions , protectionist policy was hemmed in . 
Progress in economic thought after 1929 initially led to the argument that , in a depression , tariffs are justified because they would divert insufficient aggregate world demand to one &apos;s goods at the expense of others . 
But all could play this game , saddling the world economy with tariffs that would likely hurt all while failing to revive growth . 
The solution was obviously to forgo protectionism and increase aggregate demand instead . 
This lesson has been well learned . 
Institutions have also helped . 
Following the passage of America &apos;s Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930 , countries raised trade barriers in a tit-for-tat frenzy , with no rules to constrain their behavior . 
The architects of the postwar global order therefore established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in 1947 , which embodied such rules - as does the World Trade Organization , which absorbed and expanded the GATT in 1995 . 
Indeed , no country has defied WTO rules in the current crisis . 
Of course , we might still have yielded to pressure for protectionist measures , especially as WTO rules leave open the possibility of such a response . 
Thus , for instance , bound tariffs ( i.e. , agreed ceilings ) allow countries to raise actual tariffs , which are often lower , without restraint . 
What has prevented the eruption of WTO-compliant trade wars has been the changed structure of the world economy , which has created strong anti-protectionist interests . 
Thus , when the United States Congress enacted &quot; Buy America &quot; provisions for public procurement , many US firms , such as Boeing , Caterpillar , and General Electric - all fearing retaliation in their foreign markets - lobbied successfully to moderate the legislation . 
The Doha Round ought to profit from some of these fundamental forces that favor open trade and impede protectionism . 
Indeed , conventional wisdom holds that , during a depression , citizens become risk-averse and will not support liberalization . 
But , with many people now aware that their jobs depend on trade in a closely integrated world economy , polls in the US and elsewhere show continued majority support for free trade . 
While the Doha negotiators have settled many important issues , the final negotiations first stalled last year , owing to America &apos;s refusal to cut its agricultural subsidies further and India &apos;s insistence on special safeguards to prevent exposing its millions of subsistence farmers to unfairly subsidized US competition . 
Today , domestic politics in the US and India has left America as the only stumbling block to progress . 
The last election freed India &apos;s Congress Party of its coalition with the Communists , who opposed trade , and thus increased the flexibility of pro-trade Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . 
But the last election in the US ushered in a Democratic congressional majority that is indebted to trade-fearing unions , thus constraining the pro-trade President Barack Obama . 
Obama also faces falling support from business lobbies in manufacturing and services - sectors that are demanding more concessions from other nations . 
Were he to opt to close the Doha Round as it has been negotiated to date , he could become a general without any troops . 
His silence on Doha at the recent G-20 summit was deafening . 
So , how do we move forward on trade ? 
One solution , favored by some Washington think tanks , is to go along and ask for more . 
But that would mean several years of re-negotiation . 
The Doha Round would then be de facto dead . 
The other option is to close the Round by resolving the US-India discord on agriculture . 
Mutual concessions can be crafted that ensure negligible political fallout for both leaders . 
This would also require marginal improvements in concessions by the major developing countries , and by the US and the European Union on services . 
The problem is that lobbyists in Washington would reject this modest solution if the Doha Round were the end game . 
So , part of the solution would have to be declaration of another Round to negotiate new aspirations and demands . 
We could even call this the Obama Round . 
After all , Obama should have to live up to his Nobel Prize as a multilateralist !
