Missiles , Mickey Mouse , and North Korea 
PYONGYANG : The most predicable thing about North Korea is its unpredictability . 
One day last week saw the son of its &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong Il arrested while entering Japan on a false passport ( supposedly to take his son to Tokyo &apos;s Disneyland ) , the next day brought a promise to maintain its moratorium on missile testing until 2003 as well as continue sales of missile technologies to countries like Iran . 
But there is a second , unchanging element in North Korean affairs : its basket-case economy . 
One million people may have died in the North Korean famine of 1995 to 1997 . 
Now the World Food Program fears that another famine is looming - the country &apos;s agricultural output will likely fall to 1.8 million tons of grain , far short of the 4.8 million tons needed to supply the meagre ration of 7ounces a day ( half the daily allowance for those in UN refugee camps ) ordinary North Koreans receive . 
Making matters worse , national food stocks ran out in January and South Korean food aid will run out this month . 
While the World Food Programme feeds North Korea &apos;s six million children , 17 million adults must fend for themselves . 
( A &quot; military first &quot; programme ensures diverts most supplies to North Korea &apos;s huge standing army and bureaucracy . ) 
To survive , many North Koreans forage for edible roots and leaves and make soups from cabbage stalks and vegetable waste . 
Those who survive will be more malnourished than ever , and the percent of children whose growth is stunted will increase from today &apos;s two thirds . 
North Korea &apos;s next mini-harvest is not due until late June . 
But that harvest will not even be as good as last year &apos;s abysmal one . 
At the same time , South Korea will reduce the amount of fertiliser it provides for rice planting from 300,000 tons to 200,000 tons . 
But even that reduced level of aid was disputed by people in Seoul , who argued that conditions on improved North / South relations needed to be attached . 
These appalling conditions result from North Korea &apos;s bizarre form of socialism known as &quot; juche . &quot; 
Invented by Kim Jong Il &apos;s father , North Korea &apos;s current leader has continued to promote &quot; juche &quot; in almost 900 books and articles . 
Despite shunning Marxism / Leninism in favour of &quot; juche &quot; in 1967 , the Soviet subsidies kept North Korea &apos;s economy above water until 1991 . 
Weakened by the collapse of the USSR , the economy was sent into a tailspin after successive floods and droughts in 1995 , 1996 and 1997 . 
Although he avoids talking about it at home , even Kim Jung Il may now believe that &quot; juche &quot; is a losing philosophy . 
So he has turned to China for advice . 
Specific &quot; how to &quot; advice is what Kim wants from China . 
During his first of two missions to China last year , Kim Jung Il asked President Jiang Zemin about how to move towards a market economy yet maintain an authoritarian dictatorship . 
My pleasure , said President Jiang . 
First , firmly suppress political dissent as soon as it emerges . 
Second , examine our stock exchanges and special economic zones . 
On his second trip to China , which followed Kim Jung Il &apos;s historic meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea last June , North Korea &apos;s leader was taken to Shanghai by Premier Zhu Rongji and shown its stock exchange and the vast Pudong development zone . 
No one doubts that Jiang Zemin knows how to maintain an authoritarian regime . 
But is he the best source of advice on how to turn North Korea &apos;s economy around ? 
Probably not : North Korea is not China . 
The policies that transformed in China over the last two decades are unlikely to work in North Korea . 
It will be along time before the &quot; Dear Leader &quot; will be able to convince his followers that a stock market , with its demand for corporatization and even privatisation , is at all connected to the primary stage of &quot; juche . &quot; 
Convincing themselves that reform was unavoidable was one of the major feats of China &apos;s leadership under Deng . 
In China , economic zones - especially the five Special Economic Zones and the Pudong area of Shanghai - work because , from their inception , they were envisioned as laboratories for economic , social , and even political experiments . 
The main contribution of the zones was to experiment with market forces in a limited , and therefore politically acceptable , way before applying their lessons across the country . 
Deng Xiao Ping , who gave the zones the go-ahead , understood that by opening China &apos;s economy to the outside world , the zones would inevitably permit &quot; mosquitoes &quot; to fly into China . 
He accepted this risk as the price to be paid in order to improve the economic welfare of ordinary Chinese . 
He was right : mosquitoes did fly in , bringing corruption , criminal activities , progressive and liberal ideas and - perhaps most importantly - an awareness of what life is like in the rest of the world . 
Life in North Korea , however , is hermetically sealed . 
The only radios permitted in North Korea can only be tuned to North Korean stations . 
Few North Koreans are permitted to visit Pyongyang , their country &apos;s capital , whereas millions of Chinese travel and study abroad each year . 
Indeed , when North Korea approached Swedish academics to request training in business management , they insisted that the training take place in conditions as near to those prevailing in North Korea as possible . 
So the training will take place , not in Stockholm or some other open city , but in communist Hanoi . 
From Kim Jong Il down , North Korea &apos;s leadership shows little or no awareness of the &quot; mosquitoes &quot; that opening up the economy and will bring in . 
Unlike Deng , they will not find them acceptable . 
Cabbage stalk soup and grass salad , sad to say , are likely to dominate the diet of North Korea &apos;s long-suffering people for a long time yet .
