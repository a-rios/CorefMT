Europe &apos;s New Mission in Africa 
The EU &apos;s military mission to ensure free and fair elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) has shown what the European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) can achieve in Africa . 
A contingent of roughly 2,500 troops from 22 countries went to the DRC in mid-2003 to support United Nations troops , and provided a rapid reaction force that snuffed out disorder in Kinshasa before it could erupt into full-blown mayhem . 
Three years later , Operation Artemis , a comparable EU mission in the eastern province of Ituri , again demonstrated Europe &apos;s resolve to use its military capability to underpin a long-term peace process . 
For some people , raw military might is the only true measure of power . 
But the 16 EU military missions that have now been carried out in support of the ESDP have much more to commend them . 
Large parts of Africa need support , and Europe can and must lend a hand . 
Nor is the EU &apos;s new style of political-military engagement in Africa a throwback to colonialism . 
True , many African countries currently suffer from instability , state failure , regional strife , violent internal political competition , and other assorted ills , including , massacres and large-scale brutality , civil war , massive movements of refugees , economic disruption , and environmental damage . 
Yet the big picture in Africa is not uniformly bleak . 
Some African countries are comparatively stable and prosperous , and the Continent possesses a youthful population that will soon top one billion people , abundant mineral reserves , and an inherent dynamism . 
At the same time , we in Europe cannot afford to dismiss Africa &apos;s troubles as if they had no impact on our own societies . 
The European project has been built on values that we deem to be universal , and we must make a very real effort to uphold them , not only as a moral imperative , but also because it is in our strategic interest . 
The EU is by far the largest export market for African goods , and it also offers a home to large communities from almost every African country . 
Likewise , a large number of European citizens and dependents are scattered throughout Africa . 
In the early stages of a crisis , European intervention - through political and financial assistance , diplomatic intervention , and even military action - can prevent it from erupting into violence . 
Moreover , when a crisis is winding down and there are openings for moderating influences , outside intervention can prove instrumental in enforcing peace and bringing warring factions to the negotiating table . 
In countries that have experienced the horrors of civil war , the arrival of an effective military force from outside is generally welcomed , as was the case in both the 2003 and 2006 Congo operations . 
Just by virtue of being there , the force shows the goodwill and commitment of the nations that sent it , and , by projecting a sense of law and order , it provides valuable leverage for honest brokers trying to mediate a peace deal . 
Europe &apos;s policy toward Africa may suffer shortcomings , but at least there is a policy , which is based on supporting African states and regional organizations like the African Union whenever practicable , necessary and , above all , requested . 
The ESDP takes into account the larger European policy , and aims to provide assistance in planning , training , and logistical support to missions and forces created by African states or groups of states . 
For example , the recent concept of &quot; European reinforcement of African capabilities in prevention , crisis response and conflict resolution &quot; ( which is known as &quot; Recamp &quot; ) openly calls for African ownership of this process . 
Europe has never claimed to have the means of redressing all the strategic imbalances that exist in Africa - nor does it have any intention of doing so . 
Yet , taken together , the EU countries possess a considerable array of assets , including the military capability needed to conduct decisive operations . 
Yet their most valuable asset is cultural : soldiers who are willing and able to interact with the local population , who are cautious in their use of lethal force , and who are ready to accept the many shades of gray that exist between conflicting parties . 
Nevertheless , European military capabilities are limited , requiring that European planners look for &quot; minimal &quot; options , with the drawback that smaller commitments generally require a long-term perspective . 
The ESDP has not functioned long enough to establish a clear track record . 
Yet our modest ongoing endeavors in Congo − a police advisory mission known as EUPOL and a defense reform mission called EUSEC − and in Sudan , where 60 Europeans are providing staff support to the African Union &apos;s AMIS II mission in Darfur , offer grounds for hope . 
The EU &apos;s members must above all recognize that Africa &apos;s ills have to be dealt with by Africans . 
This is as much a matter of principle as of cold , strategic calculation , and it is here where the ESDP has much to offer : a long-term view , supported by a powerful economy with the assets needed to carry out humanitarian operations , conflict prevention , crisis management , and security support . 
Foremost among the ESDP &apos;s advantages is Europe &apos;s cultural knowledge and understanding of Africa . 
Today , former colonial powers have evolved significantly , just as have their former colonies . 
On both shores of the Mediterranean , generations have passed and new connections have been formed . 
It is the knowledge , understanding , and mutual respect that remain , and that are the cornerstones on which Europe &apos;s policy for Africa must be built .
