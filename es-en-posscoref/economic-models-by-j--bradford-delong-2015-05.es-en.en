Putting Economic Models in Their Place 
BERKELEY - When policymakers turn to economists for guidance , they expect the advice they receive to be grounded in science , not academic factionalism or political presuppositions . 
After all , the policies they will be putting in place will have real implications for real people . 
Unfortunately , however , sound science is not always the driving force behind economic analysis and policy recommendations . 
In a recent critique of what he calls the &quot; mathiness &quot; of modern economics , Paul M. Romer of New York University argues that economists should take measures to exclude academic factionalism and politics from the dismal science . 
Romer grounds his case in an ongoing debate in his field about the role that ideas play in promoting economic growth . 
Romer seems to be worried principally about some economists &quot; tendency to claim that what is true about certain types of theories is true of all theories and thus applicable to the real world . 
As an example of this tendency , Romer cites the work of the University of Chicago economist Robert Lucas , who , in his 2009 paper &quot; Ideas and Growth , &quot; dismisses the role that books or blueprints can play in driving growth . 
&quot; Some knowledge can be &quot; embodied &quot; in books , blueprints , machines , and other kinds of physical capital , and we know how to introduce capital into a growth model , &quot; Lucas argued , &quot; but we also know that doing so does not by itself provide an engine of sustained growth . &quot; 
The problem is that Lucas &apos;s statement is true only for models of economic growth that are specified in such a way that the return on &quot; embodied &quot; capital drops to zero as capital accumulates . 
As Romer notes , there are many models for which this is simply not true . 
What Lucas makes out to be a general truth - that the path to economic growth cannot lie in creating and acquiring the kind of knowledge that is &quot; embodied &quot; in books , blueprints , and machines - rests on a barely examined decision to restrict attention to only a few kinds of models . 
Lucas &apos;s decision might be somewhat justifiable if the models he chose were the only ones that were correct . 
But of course that is not the case . 
In addition to criticizing those that draw general conclusions from specific cases , Romer takes aim at those who claim that economic models permit only one mode of interaction and only one mode of individual decision-making . 
Romer &apos;s principle objection is to the assumption that the only interaction allowable in economic growth models is what is known as &quot; price taking , &quot; the buying or selling of goods and services at the price currently offered by the market . 
I would add to that my objection to the assumption that individual decision-making is always characterized by rational expectations . 
Assumptions like these might be adequate as foundations on which to build models to help us understand the world , but only if market processes were structured exactly right , smoothing out at the aggregate level all the deviations from price-taking and rational expectations that are clearly evident at the individual level . 
Asking whether , which , and when market processes meet such criteria is an empirical question . 
Claiming that all market processes must be so structured is theoretical malfeasance . 
And it is widespread . 
In the field of growth theory , Romer sees the current generation of neoclassical economists grind out paper after paper imposing the theoretical restrictions necessary for a price-taking equilibrium . 
As he correctly notes , such papers are useless for any purpose other than advancing their authors &quot; positions in academic status games . 
Meanwhile , in my field , macroeconomics , I see economists , bankers , industrialists , technocrats , and politicians make the claim that the policies governments could implement to speed an economic recovery must be , if not counterproductive , at least too risky . 
After all , that is what a model with a very restricted class of rational expectations would predict . 
At the same time , we should recognize that the problem Romer pinpoints is not a new one . 
Just the other day , I came across critiques of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy made by the Canadian economist Jacob Viner and the French economist Ã‰tienne Mantoux . 
They both argued in the 1930s ( in the middle of the Great Depression ! ) that government efforts to boost employment would always result in undesirable and unwarranted inflation , and would probably reduce output in the long run . 
What is most depressing about Romer &apos;s argument is how unlikely it is to be heeded . 
Romer may be able to convince academic economists to be more cautious about making claims concerning the generality of theories of economic growth . 
But it is less than clear that bankers , industrialists , technocrats , and politicians - who are responsible for the policies that impact people &apos;s lives - will do the same .
