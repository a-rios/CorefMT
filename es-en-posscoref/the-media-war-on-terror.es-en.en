The Media War on Terror 
&quot; More than half of this battle is taking place on the battlefield of the media , &#91; for &#93; we are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of &#91; Muslims &#93; . &quot; 
The speaker was not some public relations executive , but Osama bin Laden &apos;s chief lieutenant , Ayman al-Zawahiri . 
Terrorists have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in today &apos;s media age , but , for the most part , America and the governments of the other democracies have not . 
Consider that the violent extremists have their own &quot; media relations committees &quot; aimed at manipulating elite opinion . 
They plan and design headline-grabbing attacks using every means of communications to intimidate and break the collective will of free people . 
They know that communications transcend borders , and that a single news story , handled skillfully , can be as damaging to our cause - and as helpful to theirs - as any military attack . 
Today we are fighting the first war in the era of e-mail , blogs , blackberries , instant messaging , digital cameras , the Internet , mobile phones , talk radio , and 24-hour news . 
In Tunisia , the largest newspaper has a circulation of roughly 50,000 in a country of 10 million people . 
A few years ago , under Saddam Hussein , an Iraqi could have his tongue cut out if he was found in possession of a satellite dish or used the Internet without government approval . 
Today , satellite dishes are ubiquitous in Iraq as well . 
Regrettably , many of the news channels being watched through these dishes are hostile to the West . 
Media outlets in many parts of the world often serve only to inflame and distort - rather than to explain and inform . 
While al-Qaeda and extremist movements have used this forum for many years , further poisoning the Muslim public &apos;s view of the West , we in the West have barely even begun to compete . 
We saw this with the false allegations of the desecration of a Koran last year . 
First published in a weekly news magazine , the story was then posted on Web sites , sent in e-mails , and repeated on satellite television and radio stations for days before the facts could be discovered . 
That false story incited deadly anti-American riots in Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
The United States military , appropriately and of necessity , took the time needed to ensure that it had the facts before responding that the charges were untrue . 
In the meantime , innocent lives were lost . 
But we have begun to adapt . 
In Iraq , for example , the US military , working closely with the Iraqi government , has sought non-traditional means to provide accurate information to the Iraqi people . 
Yet this has been portrayed as &quot; buying news . &quot; 
The resulting explosion of critical press stories then causes everything - all activity , all initiative - to stop . 
Consider for a moment the vast quantity of column inches and hours of television devoted to the allegations of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib . 
Compare that to the volume of coverage and condemnation associated with , say , the discovery of Saddam Hussein &apos;s mass graves , which were filled with hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis . 
Free governments must make communications planning a central component of every aspect of this struggle . 
Indeed , the longer it takes to put a strategic communications framework into place , the more the vacuum will be filled by the enemy . 
There are nonetheless signs of modest progress . 
Soon after the devastating earthquake in Pakistan , a public affairs team was deployed with our sizable military forces in the disaster area . 
They worked to help focus media attention on America &apos;s commitment to help the Pakistani people . 
Public opinion surveys conducted by private groups before and after the earthquake suggest that attitudes in Pakistan regarding the US changed dramatically because of this new awareness . 
Government public affairs and public diplomacy efforts are slowly beginning to reorient staffing , schedules , and bureaucratic culture to engage the full range of today &apos;s media . 
Still , government must develop the institutional capability to anticipate and act within the same news cycle . 
It will require less reliance on the traditional print media , just as the publics of the US and the world are relying less on newspapers . 
This also will mean embracing new ways of engaging people throughout the world . 
During the Cold War , institutions such as Radio Free Europe proved to be valuable instruments . 
We need to consider the possibility of new organizations and programs that can serve a similarly valuable role in the War on Terror . 
We are fighting a war in which the survival of our way of life is at stake . 
It is a test of wills and it will be won or lost in the court of global public opinion . 
While the enemy is skillful at manipulating the media and using the tools of communications to their advantage , we have an advantage as well : truth is on our side , and , ultimately , truth wins out .
