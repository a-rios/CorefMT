The Press versus Privacy 
LONDON - Privacy has become a big issue in contemporary jurisprudence . 
The &quot; right to privacy &quot; is enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights , and guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights . 
But Article 8 is balanced by Article 10 , which guarantees &quot; free expression of opinion . &quot; 
So what right has priority when they conflict ? 
Under what circumstances , for example , is it right to curtail press freedom in order to protect the right to privacy , or vice versa ? 
The same balance is being sought between the right of citizens to data privacy and government demands for access to personal information to fight crime , terrorism , and so on . 
Freedom of speech is a fundamental democratic liberty . 
It is a necessary protection against abuses of power and cover-ups of wrongdoing by public officials . 
It was never more effectively displayed than in the Watergate investigation , which brought down Richard Nixon in 1974 . 
So it is no surprise that press freedom is the freedom that authoritarian governments are keenest to curtail . 
Indeed , provided they can sufficiently muzzle the media they can even allow ( relatively ) free elections , as in Putin &apos;s Russia . 
With the press heavily shackled in large parts of the world , freedom of speech is still a worthy slogan . 
But one can have too much press freedom . 
Over the years , the tabloid press has become increasingly intrusive , claiming the right not just to expose corruption and incompetence in high places , but to titillate readers with scandalous revelations about the private lives of the famous . 
What started off as entertaining gossip about royalty and film stars has burgeoned into a massive assault on privacy , with newspapers claiming that any attempt to keep them out of the bedroom is an assault on free speech . 
The issue has just been tested in Britain &apos;s High Court . 
In March , Britain &apos;s leading scandal sheet , The News of the World published an &quot; exclusive &quot; front page story , under the headline &quot; F1 BOSS HAS SICK NAZI ORGY WITH 5 HOOKERS . &quot; 
It told how Max Mosley , President of the Federation Internationale de l &apos;Automobile ( FIA , the body that oversees world motoring and racing ) and son of the former British fascist leader , Sir Oswald Mosley , had , two days earlier , taken part in a sadomasochistic &quot; orgy &quot; with a &quot; Nazi theme &quot; in a private apartment in London . 
The story was accompanied by photographs taken clandestinely by one of the women in cooperation with the News of the World , which readers were invited to download from the paper &apos;s Web site . 
Max Mosley admitted participating in this ( not illegal ) happening , but sued the News of the World for breach of privacy ; the newspaper argued that it was in the &quot; public interest &quot; that Mosley &apos;s sexual activities be disclosed . 
The presiding judge , Mr. Justice Eady , rejected the newspaper &apos;s defense , and awarded Max Mosley Â£ 60,000 ( $ 115,000 ) compensation for the invasion of his privacy , the highest damages so far given for a complaint brought under Article 8 . 
There is a curious aspect to Eady &apos;s judgment . 
He rejected the News of the World &apos;s &quot; public interest &quot; defense , because he found no evidence that the sadomasochistic party had a &quot; Nazi theme . &quot; 
This implies that had there been a Nazi theme , it could have been legitimate to publish it , given Mosley &apos;s position as FIA president . 
But surely the particular nature of Mosley &apos;s private fantasies is irrelevant to the case . 
It is hard to see why I am less entitled to privacy because I am turned on by a Nazi uniform than I would be if I were excited by a pair of knickers . 
What Eady &apos;s judgment did accomplish was to highlight the crucial distinction , necessary for all clear thinking about privacy , between what interests the public and what is in the public interest . 
So how can this distinction be made effective ? 
France has a privacy law that explicitly defines both the scope of privacy and the circumstances in which the law applies . 
By contrast , in Britain it is left to judges to decide what the &quot; right to privacy &quot; means . 
There is a natural fear that specific legislation designed to protect privacy would muzzle legitimate press inquiries . 
At the same time , it is widely acknowledged ( except by most editors and journalists ) that a great deal of media intrusion is simply an abuse of press freedom , with the sole aim of boosting circulation by feeding public prurience . 
A law that curtails the abuse of press power while protecting its freedom to expose the abuse of political power would be difficult , but not impossible , to frame . 
The essential principle is that the media should not be allowed to pander to the public &apos;s prurience under cover of protecting the public interest . 
What famous people - indeed ordinary people , too - do in private should be off limits to the media unless they give permission for those activities to be reported , photographed , or filmed . 
The only exceptions would be if a newspaper has reasonable grounds for believing that the individuals concerned are breaking the law , or that , even if they are not breaking the law , they are behaving in such a way as to render them unfit to perform the duties expected of them . 
Thus , a pop star &apos;s consumption of illegal drugs may be reported , but not his or her sexual habits ( if they are legal ) . 
The private life of a politician may be revealed if it is expected to have consequences for the way the country is being governed ; that of a top executive of a public company if it may affect the returns to shareholders . 
This should be the only &quot; public interest &quot; defense available to a media outlet that is sued for invasion of privacy . 
The media might become a bit drearier , but public life would be far healthier .
