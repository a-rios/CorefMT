The Globalization of Mass Politics 
Globalization has assumed a new form : global mass politics . 
Of course , political protests have been global for decades , as past marches against the Vietnam War , nuclear weapons , and globalization itself demonstrated . 
The revolutions of 1989 and 1991 in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union blanketed a huge region within months . 
But the anti-Iraq War protests reveal a new dynamic . 
Up to 10 million protestors in some 60 countries and 600 cities took to the streets on schedule on a single day , February 15 , showing that mass politics can now be approached globally . 
Communications and mass media have long enabled &quot; copycat &quot; effects - protests in one place ignite similar actions elsewhere . 
The overthrow of King Louis Phillipe in France in 1848 was carried by the recently introduced telegraph to Germany , igniting revolution . 
Television images of the fall of the Berlin Wall spurred revolutionary changes throughout the former Soviet bloc . 
On other occasions , protests such as May Day marches were transformed into widespread social mobilization , as happened in France on May 1 , 1968 . 
What is distinctive about the recent mass protests against US plans for a war against Iraq is that the February 15 event was planned ahead of time , at short notice , for a specific date , and with an explicit goal of worldwide scale . 
The decision to launch February 15 as a day of mass protest was apparently taken at a meeting of activists at the European Social Forum in Florence in November last year . 
In ninety days , these organizers turned out more than 5 million protestors worldwide . 
There are three keys to this phenomenon : 
The Internet allowed for a rapid worldwide dissemination of organizational plans at an extraordinarily low cost to the organizers . 
Mass action depended on local organizations seizing the initiative , based on a loose global plan . 
This is what network theorists call &quot; self-organizing &quot; behavior . 
As each unit took its own steps , these local actions were communicated to the rest of the world through Web sites that tracked and disseminated global plans , as well as offering information , advice , and encouragement . 
A worldwide common concern : the prospect of an Iraq War . 
There was a fourth specific feature fuelling the global protests , too : the exceptionally high level of arrogance and ineptitude displayed by the Bush Administration . 
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld provoked the world &apos;s ire through a mocking disdain for global public opinion . 
Rumsfeld &apos;s juvenile attack on &quot; old Europe &quot; no doubt helped bring millions into the streets . 
Indeed , it &apos;s no longer possible in an age of mass communication to &quot; play to the home audience &quot; without the world also listening . 
Bush &apos;s swaggering style plays well in Texas , but not in Paris and Berlin . 
It is unlikely that worldwide protests will stop the Bush Administration &apos;s war plans , but they will help shape the political , security , and economic ramifications of such a war . 
The war is likely to proceed because the US can carry out the military phase of the war largely on its own , and because the Bush Administration has no easy way to back down from its military mobilization . 
Moreover , the uncertainties over war are hurting America &apos;s economy ( and economies elsewhere ) , by causing a postponement of business plans and falling consumer confidence . 
If today &apos;s stalemate drags on , the weak economy will threaten Bush &apos;s re-election bid in November 2004 . 
His political advisors may well advise him that it will soon be &quot; now or never &quot; to launch the war . 
But America will pay dearly for launching a war against global public opinion . 
Unless the Bush administration is vindicated in its actions - for example , if Saddam Hussein launches weapons of mass destruction that unite the world against him , or if the US discovers hidden nuclear weapons in the Iraqi desert - anti-American sentiments , and terrorism , unleashed by war , are likely to be massive . 
America &apos;s people have never been told about the huge financial and political burdens that lie ahead , and they are not ready to bear them . 
Already the US is facing huge fiscal deficits and a squeeze on popular programs , even before the costs of war and its aftermath are taken into account . 
Cheap and instantaneous means of global communication are here to stay . 
February 15 demonstrates that people throughout the world will use them to demand their right to help shape global political decisions .
