North Korea and Asia &apos;s Widening Arms Race 
North Korea &quot; test of a long range missile may have failed , but that will not relieve regional jitters . 
Indeed , it will only confirm what is already underway - an arms race across the region . 
Southeast Asia &apos;s return to prosperity since the financial crisis of 1997 has brought a region-wide splurge on new weapons . 
Most Southeast Asian countries are busily modernizing their armed forces . 
So far , most have done so without compromising their autonomy in security matters . 
But , with China &apos;s military build-up causing nervousness everywhere , and with North Korea a perpetual source of insecurity , many governments in the region are starting to work with outside powers . 
Indonesia &apos;s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has perhaps been the most assertive . 
In addition to becoming more active in world diplomacy , Yudhoyono will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month to discuss buying Russia &apos;s newest fighter jets . 
Indonesia is seeking to form an air-defense squadron of 12 jets , with eight Russian fighters to complement the two Russian Su-27SK &apos;s and Su-30MKM &apos;s that it has already bought . 
Elsewhere in the region , Singapore has apparently opted to purchase 12 new F-15SG fighter aircraft from the United States . 
Thailand &apos;s Prime Minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , met Putin late last year and tentatively agreed to purchase 12 Su-30MKM &apos;s . 
Malaysia has agreed to buy 18 Su-30MKM &apos;s over the next two years , while Vietnam has purchased 36 SU-27SK &apos;s , 12 of which are already in service . 
With the exception of Singapore , it seems that Russian fighter-attack aircraft are the region &apos;s weapon of choice at the moment . 
Russia &apos;s growing slice of the local arms market worries the US , the world &apos;s biggest weapons supplier and still Asia &apos;s greatest military power . 
Thus , for example , last November , the US lifted its six-year embargo on military sales to Indonesia , imposed in 1999 in response to human rights abuses in East Timor . 
Indonesia immediately expressed its intention to purchase C-130 transport aircraft , as well as fast patrol boats to conduct &quot; anti-terrorism and anti-piracy measures . &quot; 
Yet Indonesia is also trying to align itself with Asia &apos;s rising power , China , by seeking greater defense and security cooperation . 
As a result of these improved relations , Indonesia has received Chinese short-range missile technology . 
The possibility that Southeast Asia &apos;s governments might begin to play America and China off against each other is one of the concerns that most animates the latest US quadrennial defense review , which is intended to &quot; focus on the Pacific Ocean &quot; in awareness of China &apos;s growing naval power . 
Undoubtedly , the US will try to build closer ties with Indonesia through greater military cooperation , because Indonesia borders the region &apos;s key sea lines of communications . 
In particular , Indonesia will inevitably become involved in the tug of war between the US and China for influence over the vitally important Malacca Strait . 
Because China must import vast quantities of oil through the Malacca Strait , that sea lane has become a central element in the country &apos;s security strategy . 
For this reason , China is attempting to use economic and military aid as leverage to improve relations even with countries with which it has had military confrontations with in the past , most prominently Vietnam and the Philippines . 
India , too , is now joining the military build-up . 
It has actively led regional multilateral joint exercises , such as the naval joint exercise that India &apos;s navy hosted in the Andaman Sea , in the eastern Indian Ocean , earlier this year . 
Nine Asian-Pacific countries took part , including Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , and Thailand . 
Both India and China are each seeking greater influence over the strategically important country of Myanmar . 
For example , after Myanmar signed an agreement with China in 2005 to supply natural gas , India responded by cutting its own gas deal with Myanmar . 
South Korea has also , of course , joined the scramble . 
President Roh Moo-hyun visited Malaysia and agreed to expand mutual economic cooperation mainly in information technology , bio-technology , and resources and energy . 
Roh reportedly also discussed exporting defense materials worth $ 2.3 billion , including training aircraft , destroyers , and armed vehicles . 
Moreover , in January 2006 , Korean Defense Minister Yoon agreed with the Philippines to deliver two used patrol boats . 
In this crowded power play , only Japan is left out , choosing for the most part to remain aloof and cultivate its relations with the US , which is now to supply anti-missile technology to counter the North Korean threat . 
But , despite deep historical animosity over World War II , there are increasing calls in the region for Japan to expand its influence to counterbalance China . 
In reality , Japan is not ready for this , because it still strongly adheres to &quot; self-imposed restraints &quot; against &quot; influence over other countries in security and defense , &quot; including weapons exports . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , as its economic takeoff was proceeding , Japan initiated a serious dialogue with regional players , aiming to build stronger relations with countries that it had once conquered and occupied . 
It is no overstatement to say that those efforts , which boosted trade and investment in the region , formed the foundation of Japan &apos;s national power today . 
But now Japan &apos;s political and economic influence in South East Asia is gradually declining , owing in part to its failure to exert influence over security and defense matters . 
At a time of regional uncertainty about North Korea and China - including the looming prospect of China &apos;s first aircraft carrier - Japan &apos;s participation in the evolving Asian security framework is fundamental to stability . 
The time when Japan could remain on the sidelines is over .
