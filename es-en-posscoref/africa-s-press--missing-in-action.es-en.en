Africa &apos;s Press : Missing in Action 
In much of Africa , the challenge for journalists , editors , and readers goes beyond freedom of the press , and involves its very survival . 
Under Nigeria &apos;s various dictatorships , for example , many journalists underwent a rite of passage that most prefer to forget : routine harassment , beatings , torture , frame-ups on spurious charges , and incongruously long prison sentences . 
Among the numerous victims , perhaps the most bizarre case was that of a young journalist named Bagauda Kaltho . 
His body was found in a hotel toilet in the city of Kaduna with the remains of a parcel bomb after an explosion that no one heard . 
Yet there he lay , and with a copy of my book The Man Died beside him . 
The implication , encouraged by the regime , was that Kaltho was a recruit of mine who blew himself up while preparing his next bomb in a campaign of terror aimed at Sanni Abacha &apos;s dictatorship . 
This unconscionable fabrication was fully exposed only after Abacha &apos;s death and the spate of confessions that followed it by the police agents who actually committed the crime . 
The press fought back tenaciously , despite casualties . 
Journalists adopted tactics of underground publication , in the best tradition of East European samizdat . 
When police raided one place , copies emerged from other secure depots , to be sold in the streets by kamikaze youths who darted in and out of traffic offering the subversive contraband . 
It did not matter that these youthful hawkers , some no more than seven or eight years old , were often arrested , beaten , and locked up for weeks , occasionally months . 
When they emerged from prison , they returned to their dangerous work . 
But Nigeria does not offer the premier example of the awesome power of the press . 
That honor belongs to a different history and region . 
If benchmarks such as focus , mobilization , commitment , organization , and sheer impact are any guide , then the prize goes to the media &apos;s baleful role in preparing the Rwandan massacre of 1994 , and in directing , overseeing , and stoking the fervor of the g√©nocidaires once the extermination of Tutsis began . 
It remains a sobering lesson , one that presents the media in the role of aggressor and violator , in contrast to their normal position as victim . 
Those events are too familiar to require re-hashing . 
What matters now is the role that the rest of the African media should have played , and the questions that this raises about their capacity to function as a watchdog . 
Not many Africans , even among those who are knowledgeable in world affairs , had ever heard of Radio Milles Collines , the most blatant instrument of the Rwandan genocide . 
It is chastening that events primarily concerning Africans enter the public domain mainly owing to the intervention of the foreign media . 
It was they who exposed the complicity of certain foreign powers in an ongoing crime against humanity . 
And it was the foreign press that detailed the parallel failure of the United Nations , whose agents were on the ground but whose inability to call genocide by its proper name led to a comatose response . 
Simply put , the African media failed to reach beyond immediate borders and serve as a voice for the continent in its encounters with the world . 
The African media &apos;s response to the massacres and rapes in Darfur has been equally muted . 
Once again , African readers are being shortchanged , remaining dependent on foreign reportage in order to grasp the enormity of what is transpiring . 
African civil society , whose mouthpiece is the press , cannot escape some measure of reproach for its failure to urge leaders to rescue fellow Africans . 
From Liberia to the Congo , the predicament of the African continent today demands that the press act not only as a watchdog , but as a goad . 
It is to the media that the continent must look for an example of solidarity . 
Such solidarity should not be understood as something to be exercised only in times of convulsion . 
The cheap recourse to dismissive invectives such as &quot; outside interference , &quot; &quot; jaundiced reporting , &quot; and &quot; imperial mouthpiece &quot; - so beloved by corrupt and / or repressive regimes - is recognized as self-serving cant even by those who routinely mouth them . 
Africa &apos;s media must respond with its own analyses , explanations , and narratives . 
Unfortunately , in repressive conditions such as those in , say , Zimbabwe , Third-World journalists tend to take their cues from the conduct of their national leaders and close ranks around the continent &apos;s rogue elephants . 
This reflex has left Zimbabwe practically a journalism-free zone , with only the foreign press seeking to hold President Robert Mugabe to account . 
Imitation appears to be a hallmark of tyrants in their exercise of power , so the absence of solidarity among Africa &apos;s journalists and Africa &apos;s peoples has created a dangerous vacuum . 
Today it is Zimbabwe &apos;s press that is under the gun . 
Tomorrow ? 
We should all bear this in mind , for territorial ambition often goes hand in hand with the censor &apos;s creed .
