Graft or Growth in China ? 
BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s anti-corruption campaign , which has already brought down many high-ranking &quot; tigers &quot; in the government , has been widely touted as a key component of the deep structural reforms that China needs if it is to build a more sustainable , inclusive , and market-based economy . 
But worries abound that , in a country where government officials play a major role in promoting economic growth , rooting out corruption might undermine prosperity . 
Some have cited the recent struggles of luxury hotels and restaurants ( which , in China , are supported largely by government spending ) as evidence that the anti-corruption campaign is discouraging growth-enhancing activity . 
But the decline is likely to be temporary , with new customers emerging after a period of adjustment . 
A more credible concern is whether efforts to root out corruption weaken the incentive for government officials to promote growth . 
After all , high levels of growth translate into large rents that can , through corrupt practices , be distributed to the officials themselves , as well as to their friends and protégé . 
Eliminate such practices , the logic goes , and officials will be unable to reap large rewards from economic growth - and thus will be less motivated to encourage it . 
But this argument is far from airtight . 
Among the most common forms of corruption is the &quot; sale &quot; of government positions - a practice that has little to do with growth , especially when it is conducted by high-ranking officers in the army , such as the Peoples &quot; Liberation Army generals who have been arrested during the campaign for trading promotions for bribes . 
Another major concern is that , if businesses are no longer able to &quot; grease the wheels &quot; - that is , bribe officials to allow them to circumvent excessive regulations - their performance could suffer . 
And , indeed , even after 30 years of reform , China &apos;s economy remains bound by red tape , which drags down productivity considerably . 
But there are holes in this logic , too . 
Most important , for such bribery to boost economic growth in any significant or sustainable way , it would have to be conducted by a wide range of businesses - not just the wealthiest and best connected . 
That is not the case today ; most Chinese officials who have been charged so far have taken bribes from a single businessman , thereby allowing his business to acquire a monopoly position . 
So , while bribery in China may facilitate growth to some extent , it does not produce the kind of competitive business environment that supports long-term gains . 
Indeed , the reality is that corruption imposes a large , often random , tax on businesses , not least by discouraging officials from cutting red tape for all firms - a move that really would boost growth . 
The conclusion is clear : the costs of corruption far outweigh the benefits - and not only in China . 
Since World War II , many countries have attempted the transition from low- to high-income status , but only 13 have succeeded - and all had relatively low levels of official corruption . 
Given this , one might ask how China managed to achieve such impressive growth over the last 20 years , despite rampant corruption . 
The answer probably lies in its &quot; selectocracy . &quot; 
Unlike in a democracy , where citizens elect their government officials based on whatever criteria they choose , in China &apos;s selectocracy , the Chinese Communist Party chooses officials for promotion based on their ability to advance the party &apos;s main objectives - especially growth . 
Of course , political connections and loyalty also factor into promotion decisions , especially at higher levels of government . 
But , as the US-based political scientist Pierre Landry and his colleagues have observed , economic growth is key , particularly among officials at the county and municipal levels , where much of the government &apos;s growth-enhancing activities - such as infrastructure investment - take place . 
Promotions provide officials with a strong positive incentive to boost growth . 
Consider Liu Zhijun , the former railway minister , who propelled China &apos;s frenzy of high-speed rail construction . 
His yearning for professional achievement - and , especially , his desire to be promoted - motivated his significant contributions to China &apos;s GDP growth . 
But Liu also engaged in massive abuses of power - including accepting more than $ 10 million in bribes by the time he was arrested in 2011 - that resulted in significant economic losses for the state . 
His ( suspended ) death sentence should help to deter other officials from choosing the same path . 
If corrupt officials can make such significant contributions to growth , imagine what law-abiding officials could do . 
All they need are strong incentives to be proactive . 
In this sense , China &apos;s &quot; selectocracy , &quot; which promises promotions to the officials who prove most effective in promoting growth , could be the key to explaining the country &apos;s impressive economic track record .
