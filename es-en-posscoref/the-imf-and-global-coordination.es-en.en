The IMF and Global Coordination 
NEW YORK - Before the crisis of 2008 , the International Monetary Fund was in decline . 
Demand for loans was low , leaving it short of revenue . 
Asia remained leery of the Fund a full ten years after the currency crises of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Its analytical talents remained high but downsizing placed them at risk . 
The crisis changed all that . 
It became clear that the IMF has a crucial role to play in dealing with crisis-induced instability . 
Moreover , because of the Fund &apos;s broad and deeply embedded multinational expertise , its activities are central to achieving globally cooperative solutions to economic and financial problems . 
Without such solutions , the system will tend to become periodically unstable , and to go off on unsustainable paths that end destructively . 
We have just lived through one of these episodes . 
The IMF is needed for several key purposes . 
One involves crisis response . 
In a global financial upheaval like our most recent one , capital flows shift abruptly and dramatically , causing credit , financing , and balance-of-payments problems , as well as volatile exchange rates . 
Left unattended , these problems can cause widespread damage in a wide range of countries , many of which are innocent bystanders . 
The system needs circuit-breakers in the form of loans and capital flows that dampen the volatility and maintain access to financing across the system . 
A well capitalized IMF , much better capitalized than pre-crisis , should be able to fill this backstop - similar to what central banks do ( and did in the crisis ) to prevent a credit freeze and the inevitable and excessive economic damage that would result . 
The new IMF Flexible Credit Line performs this function for what amount to AAA-rated countries . 
A program that meets the needs of the more vulnerable countries is under construction . 
The challenge is to find the right mix of pre-approval , limited conditionality , and speed . 
At the same time , while getting the crisis-response mechanisms right is important , it is not the whole story . 
The IMF is at the epicenter of large-scale global coordination challenges . 
Having initially been shunned , it has assumed a key role in financing - and , more importantly , implementing - fiscal-stabilization programs for the European Union &apos;s peripheral countries . 
These programs are needed to limit contagion and restore stability to the eurozone , pending deeper institutional reforms that address fiscal interdependency in the context of monetary union . 
The most important issue on the global economic agenda - rebalancing and restoring global demand - is a coordination challenge par excellence . 
The sudden reduction in excess consumption in the United States as a result of the crisis makes meeting this challenge all the more urgent . 
Without an effective rebalancing program , growth will be sub-par , and employment difficult to restore on a sustainable basis . 
Government stimulus programs are limited in their ability to restore demand . 
The global economy needs the surplus countries to sustain growth and reduce excess savings - no easy task . 
It also needs deficit countries ( and the advanced countries more generally ) to develop and enact credible growth strategies that involve structural change as well as fiscal stabilization . 
The G-20 is now the priority-setting and decision-making body for this kind of challenge , the crisis having made it clear that the G-7 could no longer perform this function . 
The major emerging economies are too large and too important to be left out of the search for globally cooperative outcomes . 
The crisis also convinced most of us that non-cooperative outcomes are likely to be distinctly sub-optimal in terms of growth , stability , and sustainability . 
The G-20 can say the right things about cooperation . 
That is the IMF . 
The Mutual Assessment Process to which the G-20 countries have agreed is a crucial component of the rebalancing program , for it is where the pieces of a cooperative strategy for growth will be identified , evaluated , and assembled . 
If it works , what will emerge will be commitments from G-20 countries to undertake policies that are globally beneficial - on the condition that others are keeping their commitments . 
The US may reduce its deficits faster than it would in the non-cooperative case , but only if surplus countries are working to reduce their excess savings . 
Rebalancing is not the only cooperative imperative . 
The international exchange-rate system is at least partially broken . 
The old hybrid - in which advanced countries operated with floating exchange rates and open capital accounts , while developing countries managed the exchange rate via capital controls and reserve accumulation as part their growth strategies - worked as long as emerging markets &quot; systemic effects were relatively small . 
Those days are gone . 
The distortions and distributional issues are set to become more pressing as the size and impact of the major emerging economies increases , owing to their return to rapid growth , and as the advanced countries experience an extended period of sluggish performance . 
To accommodate the needs of the emerging economies , as well as the interests of advanced countries , a new system will be needed , in which exchange rates are managed but adjusted according to criteria that balance domestic growth and global stability . 
The IMF will be at the center of the design and implementation of any new system , by reason of mandate and expertise . 
The IMF is already playing a constructive role in Europe in cooperation with the EU , and its leadership is rebuilding relations with Asia . 
It is much better capitalized than before the crisis , and its governance structures are being reformed to give emerging-market members a larger voice in strategy and policy . 
All of this is needed to enable the Fund to support the global coordination functions for which it is uniquely well equipped . 
Even with an authoritative IMF , the problems we face are daunting .
