The Ethics of Citizenship Tests 
PRINCETON - Can citizenship really be tested ? 
An increasing number of countries - especially , but not only , in Europe - seem to think so . 
Over the last decade , tests and exams for immigrants have proliferated - but so have controversies about what they may legitimately ask . 
Recently , the revelation that the &quot; Life in the UK &quot; test tries to instill respect for the practice of queuing - standing in line , that is - caused as much ridicule as indignation . 
The British minister responsible for the test justified the idea by claiming that &quot; the simple act of taking one &apos;s turn is one of the things that holds our country together . 
It is very important that newcomers take their place in queues whether it is for a bus or a cup of tea . &quot; 
While this might sound like an excerpt from a Monty Python sketch , it raises an important issue : should there be limits as to what prospective citizens are tested for ? 
Can testing become counter-productive ? 
Critics of the spreading practice of citizenship testing certainly think so ; in fact , they go so far as to lament the rise of a new &quot; repressive liberalism &quot; - Western states &quot; efforts to achieve democratic and liberal ends with increasingly illiberal means . 
Making &quot; integration courses &quot; and language instruction compulsory , prohibiting headscarves in schools , as in France , or restricting the rights of immigrants to marry foreigners , as in Denmark , are just some instances of coercive measures adopted in the name of supposedly universal liberal values . 
Such measures have the appearance of a ( seemingly self-contradictory ) program to force men and women to be free . 
Citizenship tests are an integral part of this program ; and , in the eyes of critics , they resemble &quot; loyalty oaths &quot; and other intolerant measures traditionally associated with the anti-communist witch-hunts of McCarthyism in 1950 &quot; s America . 
But do countries somehow automatically turn illiberal just because they make certain measures mandatory ? 
If that were true , &quot; progressive legislation &quot; would inevitably be a contradiction in terms . 
The real question is whether states purposefully target or even exclude certain groups - while ostensibly applying universal standards . 
Think , for example , of a German ( oral ) test which was to apply only to immigrants from states belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( the test in question was later withdrawn ) , and which asked , among other things , the applicant &apos;s opinion about the fact that in Germany homosexuals hold high public office . 
Similar tendencies appeared in the Netherlands , which was once committed to multiculturalism , but more recently has sought to confront would-be citizens with images of men kissing and of bare-breasted women emerging from the North Sea - presumably all to get across the point that a true Dutch citizen had better be tolerant . 
It is clearly helpful for immigrants to get hints about how to navigate daily life practically - such as norms about standing in line . 
Most people acquire survival skills - if not more sophisticated forms of savoir-faire - informally , as a quick glance at the immigration experience in the United States demonstrates . 
They will also come to get the point of more informal social norms - against homophobia , for instance . 
The lesson is that national governments should not test the attitudes of immigrants to moral and cultural questions that remain controversial even among established members of the host country . 
It would be hypocritical , for example , to pretend that everyone in Western liberal democracies is enthusiastic about gay people or nudists - what matters is that their rights be respected , not that everyone like them . 
Tests should communicate lessons about rights and democracy , that is , politics - not about lifestyles or the supposed core content of a &quot; national culture &quot; ( on which established members of a host country themselves would probably be hard pressed to reach consensus ) . 
Of course , it is true that birthright citizens live their lives - and retain their citizenship - without ever being tested on the basics of their political systems . 
So , citizenship tests - rather than being repressive - can actually be empowering , if they make immigrants aware of rights and possibilities for participation . 
They are akin to language requirements - except that the language here is a civic , not a national one , which in the best case allows new citizens to voice their concerns with perfect political grammar . 
Tests might also make the passage to citizenship meaningful , a ritual similar to the solemn swearing of an oath of allegiance , which can be integrated as a major event into the story of one &apos;s life ( to be sure , some will always dismiss such ceremonies as political kitsch ) . 
What these kinds of exams cannot do - and should not attempt to do - is test people &apos;s political convictions . 
For one thing , such convictions can always be faked by those determined to dissimulate . 
At the same time , most would-be citizens will probably feel alienated from a state that suspects political danger emanating from newcomers and consistently sends a message of distrust . 
In the end , citizenship exams , rather than really being &quot; tests &quot; in any meaningful sense at all , are tools for communication .
