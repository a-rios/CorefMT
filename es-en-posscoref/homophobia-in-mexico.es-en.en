Homophobia in Mexico 
It never fails . 
After I &apos;ve given a lecture or a course on homosexuality , explaining at length why it can no longer be considered an illness , the questions are always the same : &quot; What are the symptoms ? &quot; 
&quot; Can it be cured ? &quot; 
&quot; How can one prevent it in one &apos;s children ? &quot; 
Even , occasionally , &quot; Is it contagious ? &quot; 
I encounter these questions everywhere : in Mexico City and the provinces ; on radio programs and university campuses ; among ordinary people , psychology students , and health professionals . 
In Mexico there is still the assumption that homosexuality is a disease , as well as a social problem to be eradicated . 
Always there is the presumption that gay people are fundamentally different from &quot; us normal people . &quot; 
These views translate readily into action . 
With an average of 35 reported murders a year ( unofficial estimates run three times higher ) , Mexico ranks second in the world , after Brazil , for anti-gay crimes . 
Attempts to legalize a limited form of gay marriage were quashed three times by the local congress of Mexico City , by parties of the left and right alike . 
For years I &apos;ve tried to discover the underpinnings of this homophobia , which remains deeply rooted despite the progressive liberalization of public opinion in most areas of morality : contraception , premarital cohabitation , divorce , single motherhood , women &apos;s rights , have all gradually ( if grudgingly ) been assimilated into the spectrum of &quot; normal &quot; behavior . 
Yet homosexuality remains outside the pale . 
Why ? 
To begin , the presumed causes of homosexuality are shrouded in pseudo-scientific theories and psycho-babble : homosexuals supposedly suffer from hormonal imbalances , or were sexually abused as children , or constitute an indeterminate &quot; third sex &quot; that is neither male nor female , or had absent fathers and over-protective mothers . 
Although science disproved these explanations decades ago , they still prevail in Mexican popular culture because they all fit into that culture &apos;s rigid , polarized definitions of masculinity and femininity . 
In this deeply held view , men and women are not only different , but opposite . 
A man who has any &quot; feminine &quot; traits is &quot; poco hombre &quot; : boys who dislike soccer , men who enjoy the opera or express unmanly feelings such as sadness or tenderness , husbands who help with the housework or tend to their children , are considered effeminate . 
A woman who does &quot; man &apos;s work , &quot; shows too much independence , or stands up to men is overly masculine , &quot; hombruna . &quot; 
It is easy to take the next step and declare her a man-hater and a lesbian . 
&quot; Effeminate &quot; men and &quot; masculine &quot; women coincide perfectly with the popular view of homosexuals as men who are not &quot; real &quot; men and women who are not fully &quot; feminine . &quot; 
The fact that most gay men are not effeminate , and that most lesbians are not masculine , does not affect this belief , mainly because that kind of gay individual is invisible within the culture . 
The mass media , for instance , pick up on the flamboyant queens and dykes who participate in gay pride parades . 
The vast majority of homosexuals , who are indistinguishable from straight men and women , simply don &apos;t enter into the picture . 
But homophobia is not just about homosexuality ; it is also about what it means to be a man or a woman . 
Anything that violates traditional gender stereotypes is severely sanctioned in Mexican society ; therein lies the true foundation of homophobia . 
But this has implications that go far beyond the rejection of homosexuality , because heterosexuals are also affected by it . 
As a psychotherapist specializing in homosexuality , I have been consulted many times by anxious parents terrified that their little boy is gay ( at age five ! ) : he likes to play with dolls , enjoys the company of girls , refuses to play soccer . 
He must be homosexual . 
When I ask them what they would think if their child was a little girl who liked to play baseball , enjoyed playing with boys and refused to play with dolls , they answer , &quot; Oh , that would be fine . 
It &apos;s OK for a girl to be active and enjoy sports . &quot; 
This is logical : in a machista society , masculinity is the central value . 
That is why , in Mexico today , little boys ( and not little girls ) are subjected to hormonal and psychological treatment , are removed from mixed schools , and are forbidden to play with girls , all in an effort to prevent them from turning out homosexual . 
Thus , homophobia , far from involving only homosexuals , affects everybody who does not fit into traditional gender roles . 
Homosexual couples prove that it is possible to have relationships on an equal footing . 
Almost always , in a gay couple both men work , because men do so as a matter of course ; and both women in a lesbian relationship work , simply because they don &apos;t have men to support them . 
The fact that both members of a couple have an income , and the autonomy that comes with work , produces an equality that is rarely seen in heterosexual Mexican marriage . 
Similarly , homosexual partners are generally best friends - which is rarely the case between husband and wife in a machista society . 
For all of these reasons , homosexuality poses a serious threat to the ideas that underlie Mexican society . 
Homophobia serves not only to discriminate against homosexuals , but to keep everybody - men and women , gay and straight alike - firmly in their place .
