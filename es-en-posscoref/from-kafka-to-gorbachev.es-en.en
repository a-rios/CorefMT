From Kafka to Gorbachev 
NEW YORK - On August 2 , 1914 , Franz Kafka wrote in his diary : &quot; Germany has declared war against Russia . 
In the afternoon , swimming . &quot; 
Kafka , the reclusive and visionary Central European writer , gave his name to the twentieth century . 
Seventy-five years had to pass after Kafka &apos;s swim before Central and Eastern Europe would return to the broader European civilization . 
A Kafkaesque pause , some might say . 
Central and Eastern Europe was never only a place of right and left dictatorships , of ethnocentrism and xenophobia , of perpetual and frozen conflicts , as some now caricature it . 
It was also the birthplace of a spiritual heritage , of thinkers and artists , of a specific mode of creativity and search for meaning beyond pragmatic negotiations with daily life . 
In 1989 the region &apos;s peoples brought with them in their &quot; return to Europe &quot; their diversity and richness ; their vivacity , mysteries , and memories ; and their old and new aspirations . 
And they brought the lesson that moving from a closed society to an open one is both possible and extremely difficult . 
As Thomas Mann once wrote : &quot; Freedom is more complicated than power . &quot; 
Freedom changes the frame and substance of choice , and of individual and collective responsibility . 
It highlights the contrast between initiative and apathy , enterprise and obedience , competition and total dependence on a state that embodies a kind of unshakable fate . 
Just as slavery must be learned , step-by-step , in order to survive its terror and tricks , so freedom must be learned in order to face its risks and opportunities . 
At that fluid border between old and new people craved most what they had never had : freedom of thought and expression , information , the tools to debate and define their own happiness . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification , surprisingly accepted by Mikhail Gorbachev , meant immediate and direct support in reconstructing East Germany &apos;s institutions and economy . 
Yet , even in Germany , the situation was far from ideal , with many &quot; Ossies &quot; frustrated by their seeming second-class status , and many &quot; Wessies &quot; resenting the financial burden of annexation . 
Elsewhere , change proved far more complicated . 
Many of the new post-communist societies - consumed with revenge , resentment , and raw struggles for power and status - became breeding grounds for aggressive nationalism . 
Ethnocentricism , xenophobia , and anti-Semitism flourished , together with corruption , nepotism , hypocrisy , and opportunism . 
The post-communist turmoil led to the dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Czechoslovakia , fueled Yugoslavia &apos;s wars and ethnic atrocities , and brought forth authoritarian rule and imperial revanchism in Russia . 
In this chaotic freedom , suddenly revealed secrets destroyed families and friendships and a common sense of togetherness ; it shattered social stability , as insecure or falsified as that was . 
Sometimes it even replaced the old hypocrisy and opportunism with new ones as many former officials and secret-police employees thrived . 
Public debates across Eastern Europe soon started to exhibit a fierce confrontation between two different hidden memories : the memory of the Holocaust and that of the communist terror and crimes . 
A stupid competition arose between two nightmares , the Holocaust and the Gulag , totalitarian Nazism and totalitarian communism . 
Unavoidably , old-new clich√©s emerged . 
In Romania , some leading intellectuals publicly condemned the so-called &quot; Jewish monopoly of suffering &quot; - part of an &quot; international conspiracy &quot; that had reached , once again , the territory between the Danube and the Carpathians . 
In the notorious Walser Debate of 1998 in Germany about the &quot; unbearable &quot; way Germans had been portrayed after the Holocaust , I proposed that every country should complement its monuments of heroism with monuments of shame to recall the wrong done to other countries , other peoples , and also to its own people . 
A decade later , that proposal still seems meaningful . 
Would not monuments to shame be as instructive , if not more so , than monuments to heroism ? 
While admission to the European Union appeared to draw a line under the post-communist period ( at least in Central and Eastern Europe ) , the rupture of 1989 did not mark the beginning of an era of perfect cooperation by the people and for the people . 
But that did not stop some from proclaiming that the triumph of liberal capitalism meant the end of ideological struggle - and thus of History . 
It requires a large reserve of imagination , optimism , or plain stupidity to believe that one &apos;s fellow human beings will ever live beyond history and ideology . 
As the religious terrorists of September 11 , 2001 , proved , the human story and mankind &apos;s history go on , as before , through ideas and conflicts , through projects of absolute happiness , through cruelty and disasters , revolutions and revivals . 
And liberal capitalism itself - with its mediocre political leaders and cartoonish public discourse - has become a poor advertisement for the Absolute Idea . 
Indeed , some now wonder if the recent financial crisis has done to liberal capitalism what the fall of the Berlin Wall did to communism . 
There is an unnerving similarity between many economists &quot; naive premise of a perfectly rational market and the &quot; dialectical materialism &quot; of scientific socialism . 
By hijacking &quot; rationality &quot; in the belief that human behavior can be predicted ( and thus potentially controlled ) , today &apos;s arrogant General Staff of economists , bankers , and bureaucrats have compromised not only themselves , but the basic notion of freedom . 
We have no real alternative to the market , just as we have no real alternative to freedom . 
None of the defects or shortcomings of market economies are as bad as the remedies ranged against them . 
But , just as every act of individual and collective freedom threatened &quot; real socialism , &quot; so we must acknowledge that human freedom - the emancipation of creativity - means the end of certainty . 
This uncertainty does not weaken liberal capitalism - on the contrary , it is the system &apos;s primary source of strength . 
But it does extend to what economists &quot; can know about human behavior and the market . 
In this regard , the most important lesson of 1989 and its aftermath is that society &apos;s evolution can never be perfectly prophesied . 
Despite great difficulties and tensions , today &apos;s post-communist capitalism is still better than the degenerate and tyrannical &quot; real socialism &quot; of yesterday .
