The Decline of the West Revisited 
LONDON - The terrorist slaughter in Paris has once again brought into sharp relief the storm clouds gathering over the twenty-first century , dimming the bright promise for Europe and the West that the fall of communism opened up . 
Given dangers that seemingly grow by the day , it is worth pondering what we may be in for . 
Though prophecy is delusive , an agreed point of departure should be falling expectations . 
As Ipsos MORI &apos;s Social Research Institute reports : &quot; The assumption of an automatically better future for the next generation is gone in much of the West . &quot; 
In 1918 , Oswald Spengler published The Decline of the West . 
Today the word &quot; decline &quot; is taboo . 
Our politicians shun it in favor of &quot; challenges , &quot; while our economists talk of &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
The language changes , but the belief that Western civilization is living on borrowed time ( and money ) is the same . 
Why should this be ? 
Conventional wisdom regards it simply as a reaction to stagnant living standards . 
But a more compelling reason , which has seeped into the public &apos;s understanding , is the West &apos;s failure , following the fall of the Soviet Union , to establish a secure international environment for the perpetuation of its values and way of life . 
The most urgent example of this failure is the eruption of Islamist terrorism . 
On its own , terrorism is hardly an existential threat . 
What is catastrophic is the collapse of state structures in many of the countries from which the terrorists come . 
The Islamic world contains 1.6 billion people , or 23 % of the world &apos;s population . 
A hundred years ago it was one of the world &apos;s most peaceful regions ; today it is the most violent . 
This is not the &quot; peripheral &quot; trouble that Francis Fukuyama envisioned in his 1989 manifesto &quot; The End of History . &quot; 
Through the massive influx of refugees , the disorder in the Middle East strikes at the heart of Europe . 
This movement of peoples has little to do with the &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; foreseen by Samuel Huntington . 
The more mundane truth is that there have never been any stable successors to the defunct Ottoman , British , and French empires that used to keep the peace in the Islamic world . 
This is largely , though not entirely , the fault of the European colonialists who , in the death throes of their own empires , created artificial states ripening for dissolution . 
Their American successors have hardly done better . 
I recently watched the film &quot; Charlie Wilson &apos;s War , &quot; which relates how the United States came to arm the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan . 
At the end of the film , as America &apos;s erstwhile clients turn into the Taliban , Wilson , the American politician who got them the money , is quoted as saying &quot; We won a great victory , but fouled up the end game . &quot; 
This &quot; fouling up &quot; is a continuous thread running through American military interventions since the Vietnam War . 
The US deploys overwhelming firepower , either directly or by arming opposition groups , shatters local governmental structures , and then pulls out , leaving the country in shambles . 
It is unlikely that US policymaking reflects the grip of some ideal view of the world , in which getting rid of dictators is the same thing as creating democracies . 
Rather , the belief in ideal outcomes is a necessary myth to cover an unwillingness to use force persistently and intelligently enough to achieve a desired result . 
However much military hardware a superpower owns , decay of the will to use it is the same thing as a decay of effective power . 
After a time , it ceases to overawe . 
That &apos;s why Robert Kagan &apos;s 2003 neo-conservative proposition , &quot; Americans are from Mars , Europeans from Venus , &quot; offered such a misleading guide . 
True enough , the European Union has gone farther down the pacifist road than the US . 
But America &apos;s sporadic , erratic , and largely ineffective deployment of power is hardly of Martian quality . 
The decline of the West is juxtaposed with the rise of the East , notably China . 
( It is hard to tell whether Russia is rising or falling ; either way , it is disturbing . ) 
Fitting a rising power into a decaying international system has rarely occurred peacefully . 
Perhaps superior Western and Chinese statesmanship will avert a major war ; but this , in historical terms , would be a bonus . 
The increasing fragility of the international political order is diminishing the global economy &apos;s prospects . 
This is the slowest recovery from a major slump on record . 
The reasons for this are complex , but part of the explanation must be the weakness of the rebound in international trade . 
In the past , trade expansion has been the world &apos;s main growth engine . 
But it now lags behind the recovery of output ( which is itself modest ) , because the kind of global political order hospitable to globalization is disappearing . 
One symptom of this has been the failure after 14 years to conclude the Doha Round of trade negotiations . 
Trade and monetary agreements are still reached , but they increasingly take the form of regional and bilateral deals , rather than multilateral arrangements , thereby serving broader geopolitical goals . 
The US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership , for example , is directed against China ; and China &apos;s New Silk Road initiative is a reaction to its exclusion from the 12-country TPP . 
Perhaps these regional bargains will prove to be a step toward wider free trade . 
But I doubt it . 
A world divided into political blocs will become a world of trade blocs , sustained by protectionism and currency manipulation . 
And yet , even as trade relations become increasingly politicized , our leaders continue to urge us to gear up to meet the &quot; challenges of globalization , &quot; and few question the benefits of cost-cutting through automation . 
In both cases , politicians are trying to force adaptation on reluctant populations who crave security . 
This strategy is not only desperate ; it is also delusive , for it seems obvious that , if the planet is to remain habitable , competition in economic growth must give way to competition in quality of life . 
In short , we are far from having developed a reliable set of precepts and policies to guide us toward a safer future . 
Small wonder , then , that Western populations look ahead with foreboding .
