Will Hamas Win the Peace ? 
WASHINGTON , DC -For generations to come , the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness . 
Whether Hamas can claim a victory - and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed , if a formal one is eventually agreed . 
The end game - for both Israel and Hamas - is thus crucially important . 
For the moment , Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender . 
After all , Hamas was democratically elected , but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in Gaza . 
At the same time , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of siding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaza . 
The war exposed flaws in Hamas &quot; judgment . 
With Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege , Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce , since the old one had &quot; failed to lift the siege on Gaza . &quot; 
Other leaders were quoted as saying that Hamas would &quot; lift the siege by force . &quot; 
If Hamas is to survive the war , it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of Gaza &apos;s border crossings , especially in Rafah . 
For Palestinians , these are signs of victory . 
With open borders , Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank , putting enormous pressure on Abbas , the leader of the rival Fatah movement , to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas . 
Members of Fatah &apos;s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting , of wanting to &quot; return to Gaza on an Israeli tank . &quot; 
Radical groups within Fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with Hamas . 
If Hamas comes out ahead , Abbas &apos;s allies in other Palestinian factions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the PLO . 
Egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of Hamas in order to recover its image among the Arabs and to reduce tensions within Egyptian society . 
Pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals , particularly Paris and London , where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war . 
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire , Hamas &apos;s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged . 
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price . 
Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns , but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation . 
One indicator to watch for : the length of that ceasefire . 
Palestinians will recognize Hamas &apos;s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat , which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment . 
Hezbollah , despite its rhetoric , has taken no steps to support Hamas , and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat . 
It is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase . 
Abbas , supported by the United States and the European Union , may have control over significant funding . 
The test for him will be to deliver quickly . 
Hamas will also have resources for reconstruction . 
Qatar , a Hamas supporter , has already announced an investment fund for Gaza and contributed $ 250 million . 
Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza &apos;s near destruction is a price that had to be paid . 
Many Palestinians believe that Israel inflicted this damage on Gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the &quot; resistance . &quot; 
There is a precedent for this argument : Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut &apos;s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006 . 
More importantly , Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war , sharing Palestinian suffering ; many have been killed , along with their families . 
The biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas &quot; political goals . 
Two weeks ago , Musa Abu Marzouk , a senior Hamas official , praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East . 
This is a radical departure from Hamas rhetoric , which has always portrayed the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betrayal of the Islamic world . 
It remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk &apos;s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas , or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two-state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel .
