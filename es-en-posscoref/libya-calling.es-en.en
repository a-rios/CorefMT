Libya Calling 
VALLETTA , MALTA - The recent signing in Tripoli of &quot; a comprehensive claims settlement &quot; between the United States and Libya marks a new beginning not only in US-Libya relations , but between Libya and the rest of the world . 
The agreement provides a process for compensating the victims of attacks ranging from the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , to the US air strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986 . 
It thus removes a final hurdle to Libya establishing normal diplomatic and economic relations with the West and opens the way for US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice &apos;s visit to Tripoli this week . 
The Joint Statement , while clinically welcoming the agreement , states that both parties &quot; thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship , &quot; underscoring &quot; the benefits an expansion of ties would provide for both countries as well as for the American and Libyan peoples . &quot; 
This is a far cry from recent years , when staying at a Libyan-owned hotel would make you subject to a US felony charge ! 
Clearly , the way is now open for US-Libya relations to move forward in the same way that the release of a group of Bulgarian nurses , who were jailed in Libya on charges of deliberately infecting Libyan children with AIDS , unblocked European Union-Libya relations . 
Indeed , Libya has also just strengthened its relations with the EU : Seif al-Islam Gaddafi , the son of Libya &apos;s long-serving ruler , Muammar al-Gaddafi , recently declared that soon the two sides should be able to sign an Association agreement , giving Libyan goods access to European markets . 
In his effort to restore seemingly irreparably damaged relations with the West , Gaddafi has played the oil and gas cards that he holds extremely well . 
Indeed , the West &apos;s hunger for energy brought invitations for Libya &apos;s leader to visit France , Spain , and Portugal within the past year . 
This opening is welcome , because Libya remains heavily engaged with the other countries of the Sahel , and across Africa in general , as well as with Arab states . 
A more development-minded Libya could help dampen tensions in these vital regions . Indeed , Gaddafi &apos;s emphatic call for Libya to embrace the market economy could have a sort of revolutionary domino effect among North Africa &apos;s &quot; dirigiste &quot; economies , improving the chances for a revitalization of plans to open and integrate the Maghreb Union economies . 
Libya &apos;s newfound engagement with the US and the EU represents not only a major shift in its international policies and diplomatic posture , but also a major internal reorientation , because the country now wants to develop an economy that is not exclusively based on oil . 
Indeed , like so many post-communist countries over the past 20 years , Libya is now making the gradual and at times painful transition to a market economy . 
Given that Islamic fundamentalism breeds in economic despair , Libya &apos;s rulers seem to want to take particular care that this process does not create an underclass of victims who might fall prey to the call of religious fanatics . 
Of course , it is unrealistic and na√Øve to expect that the changes now underway in Libya will result in a rapid transition to European-style democracy . 
Libyan politics will undoubtedly continue to be based on Gaddafi &apos;s &quot; Green Book &quot; and &quot; people power , &quot; as expressed in its People &apos;s Congress . 
But Gaddafi now seems to want to reconcile his teachings and rule with a more open economy , including foreign direct investment and market-based competition . 
Internally , Libya has launched a &quot; Go East &quot; policy , so that development does not become clustered only in its oil and gas regions and around the capital of Tripoli . 
It wants , in particular , to ensure that the people and tribes in its Eastern &quot; Cyrenaica &quot; territories centered in Benghazi have a chance to develop equally with the rest of the country . 
A bulwark of secular government and anti-fundamentalism in a North Africa that is struggling to contain the spread of Islamic extremism , Libya is of strategic importance to Europe and the US beyond its oil riches , notwithstanding the overwhelming significance of its energy resources . 
Fully aware of its growing importance in an oil-starved world , Libya will use that advantage to the full and it will no doubt guard , with Gaddafi at the forefront , its sovereign rights vociferously and assiduously . 
Nevertheless , drawing Libya deeper into international discourse , despite the possibility of roadblocks along the way , is a strategic decision that , now that it has been taken , the West must pursue with patience , perseverance , and constant nurturing . 
In that process , underestimating Libyan diplomacy , shrewdness and negotiating skills is the folly of the ignorant .
