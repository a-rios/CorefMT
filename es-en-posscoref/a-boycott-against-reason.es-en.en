A Boycott Against Reason 
&quot; It could happen here &quot; is the shorthand phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypothetical scenarios . 
&quot; How could this happen here ? &quot; was the question more pertinently asked in Great Britain recently , as its universities witnessed the unfolding of an all-too-real and perplexing action . 
In early June , the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education ( NATFHE ) , Britain &apos;s largest academic union , with 67,000 members , passed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dissociate themselves from &quot; continuing Israeli apartheid policies . &quot; 
The motion was subsequently revoked ; but the fact that it was put forward at all is astonishing enough . 
Indeed , the union &apos;s call for a wholesale boycott contravened its most fundamental values : the principle of academic freedom , openness , and exchange ; protection of research from state politics ; and the fundamental right to free speech . 
The motion implicitly adopted the yardstick of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyite tone , demanding a sort of &quot; disloyalty oath &quot; from Israeli academics . 
What led scholars who are putatively the guardians of democratic freedoms to embrace measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics ? 
Unfortunately , the NATFHE effort is part of a larger phenomenon . 
In 2005 , the Association of University Teachers ( AUT ) called for a more limited boycott , singling out Bar Ilan and Haifa Universities for opprobrium . 
Before that , a petition , signed by roughly 80 prominent British intellectuals and a few from other European countries , demanded the cessation of European Union funding for Israeli cultural projects and institutions . 
These campaigns , encouraged by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organizations , have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism , and an informal boycott of Israeli scholars , publications , and cultural projects already exists in some European circles . 
Such developments suggest an advanced and deeply disturbing trend , whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are willing to violate their own beliefs in order to target one state for unique stigmatization ; and whereby insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state &apos;s citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable . 
In a certain ideological mind-set 
In the putatively &quot; radical &quot; interpretation , the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposed interests . 
Rather , the stubborn complexities of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness , the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed . 
The rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme , and conducive to hatred . 
Phrases like &quot; apartheid state &quot; and &quot; Zionism is racism , &quot; unthinkable in liberal discourse a few years ago , have become routine . 
At the same time , the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications - one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen , prior to a meeting , draped in a Palestinian flag - and unwitting condescension . 
They are seen as the last pure cause , the entirely innocent &quot; Other , &quot; unimplicated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice . 
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions , that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation , or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence , is , in this framework , never admitted . 
Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions &quot; motions . 
This is Manicheanism of the left , and , like Manicheanism of the political right , it can distort reality to the point of becoming divorced from it . 
Certainly , the boycott efforts ignored basic facts . 
Unless British academics are ill informed , they know that Israel , far from being an &quot; apartheid state , &quot; has a large proportion of Arab citizens ; that Israeli universities are well integrated , in some cases with considerable numbers of Arab students , as well as a number - admittedly small and insufficiently representative - of Arab faculty ; that many universities sponsor collaborative projects with Palestinian and Arab colleagues ; that they are often sites of dissidence against government policies ; and that such dissidence , even in radical forms , is tolerated . 
Advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with stifling legitimate criticism of Israel . 
This argument is both disingenuous and dishonest . 
Many of the boycotts &quot; critics are also critical of Israel . 
But credible criticism must be based on evidence - and on generally applicable criteria of judgment . 
If the British unions wanted to be ethically consistent , they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brutally abused and free speech suppressed . 
Some see this hostility to Israel as camouflaging old-fashioned anti-Semitism . 
It is always risky to speculate about hidden motives ; nevertheless , systematic disparagement of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that anti-Semitism , too , is a permitted prejudice . 
It is always easier to see a group or nation as a malevolent &quot; Other &quot; when this impulse is fed by an old , and still potent , prejudice . 
There is a deeper issue at stake . 
Democratic societies depend not only on the foundational principle of free speech , but on the character of political thought and conversation among various constituencies . 
When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of those constituencies resorts to illiberal discourse and intolerant measures , tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality are reinforced . 
The actions of the British academic unions have Israel as their obvious target . 
But their main effect may be an erosion of reasoned debate and civil conduct , without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism .
