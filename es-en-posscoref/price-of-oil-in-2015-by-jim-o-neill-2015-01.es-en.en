The Price of Oil in 2015 
LONDON - In late 1979 , I began work on my PhD thesis , an empirical investigation of the OPEC surplus and its disposal . 
It was the end of a decade in which oil prices had undergone two dramatic increases , and most of the various geniuses of the day were confidently predicting that they would continue to soar , from under $ 40 per barrel - a historic high at that time - to above $ 100 . 
By the time I finished my research in 1982 , the price of oil had begun what would become a 20-year plunge . 
It would not hit $ 100 per barrel until January 2008 . 
I used to joke that the most important thing I learned from my research was never to attempt to forecast the price of oil . 
As 2014 comes to a close , the price of oil has just crossed the $ 100 threshold again - this time headed down . 
One of the big questions for 2015 is whether the decline will continue . 
Despite my earlier cynicism , I think I know the answer . 
Over the past 33 years , I have had plenty of opportunity to study both oil prices and foreign exchange rates , including overseeing a research department of talented people trying to predict their movements . 
The experience has left me with a good deal of skepticism - not to mention bruises . 
But I do believe that it is possible to make a broad prediction as to where oil prices are headed . 
Over the course of my career , I have tried to determine whether there is such a thing as an equilibrium oil price . 
I have spent many hours trying to guide , cajole , and beg my energy analysts to create a model that might identify it , just as we have for currencies , bond yields , and equities . 
I have also discussed the idea with industry experts , most of whom believe that one exists , but that it moves around a lot , because it is greatly influenced by the marginal cost of oil production - itself an unstable variable . 
My conclusion is that a good indication of this moving equilibrium does exist : the five-year forward oil price , or the amount paid for guaranteed delivery of oil five years from now . 
In my ongoing quest to become better at forecasting , I began , a few years ago , to pay attention to the five-year forward oil price as it compares to the Brent crude oil spot price , the price of a barrel of oil today . 
I suspect that the five-year forward price is much less influenced by speculation in the oil market than the spot price , and more representative of true commercial needs . 
So when the five-year price starts moving in a different direction than the spot price , I take notice . 
In 2011 , after both prices had recovered from the collapse induced by the 2008 credit crisis , the five-year price started to come down gradually , while the spot price continued to surge for a while . 
This jibed with what I had identified as two big factors fundamentally driving the price of oil : the early days of the exploitation of shale oil and gas in the United States , and the shift in China &apos;s economic focus from quantity to quality , which implied that the Chinese economy would no longer be consuming energy at the frenetic rate it had been . 
I concluded that there was a fair chance that oil prices were peaking and that before too long spot prices would reverse and start to decline . 
I thought it was probably the beginning of a move back down to $ 80 per barrel - precisely where the price has landed at the end of 2014 . 
The spot price has even recently slipped below that level . 
It was one of my better forecasts . 
I no longer make predictions for a living , but I do know one thing : Oil prices will either rise or fall . 
I recently read an article that suggested that , if oil prices remain at recent levels , US production of shale oil and gas next year could be 10 % below recent projections . 
That seems plausible ; and , given how important shale oil and gas has become to America &apos;s economic recovery , it also seems like something that US policymakers would be eager to avoid . 
They may very well get their wish . 
Oil prices may not start rising in the coming months , but , as 2014 comes to a close , forces that will eventually halt their decline are beginning to appear . 
The drop in the spot price of oil has taken it significantly below the five-year forward price , which remains close to $ 80 per barrel . 
My hunch for 2015 is that oil prices may continue to drop in the short term ; unlike in the past four years , however , they are likely to finish the year higher than they were when it began .
