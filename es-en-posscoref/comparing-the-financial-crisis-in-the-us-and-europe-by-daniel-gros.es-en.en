Getting to Normal 
BRUSSELS - A financial crisis erupts when a large volume of assets in the financial system suddenly appears to be risky and investors want to get rid of their holdings . 
These assets become &quot; toxic &quot; - not simply risky , but carrying a risk that cannot be quantified . 
Toxic assets are not traded according to a normal risk-return calculus . 
Given that their risk cannot be calculated , their owners just want to sell them - sometimes at any price . 
In 2007-2008 , this was the case for a class of securities based on residential mortgages in the United States ( RMBS , or residential mortgage-backed securities ) . 
During the boom phase , these securities were sold as risk-free , on the assumption that US house prices could not decline , as this had never happened before in peacetime . 
But this assumption was shattered when a broad-based decline in real-estate prices began in 2007 and loss rates on mortgages suddenly increased . 
As a result , RMBS were found to be much riskier than anticipated . 
Initially , there was little basis for re-pricing them rationally , because the event ( a peacetime decline in US house prices ) was unprecedented . 
Moreover , banks and other financial institutions , which held large volumes of RMBS , were ill-equipped to measure the risk , and in some cases would have been bankrupted had they been forced to sell their holdings at the fire-sale prices prevailing at the height of the crisis . 
The euro crisis followed a similar pattern . 
Until recently , public debt was considered the ultimate safe asset . 
Indeed , its risk-free status was embedded in the European Union regulatory framework , which allows banks to hold large volumes of any eurozone country &apos;s public debt without having to put aside any capital to cover potential losses . 
As with RMBS , this view that public debt was totally safe was underpinned by the &quot; fact &quot; that no advanced country , at least in the post-1945 era , had ever defaulted . 
Investors thus assumed that they did not need to assess the credit risk of eurozone countries &quot; ( national ) public debt . 
The de facto default by Greece early this year ended investors &quot; complacency . 
The government bonds of peripheral eurozone countries thus became toxic . 
Given the unprecedented nature of the Greek default , the market valuation of peripheral debt has been fluctuating widely , still searching for &quot; fundamentals , &quot; such as deficit or debt levels , that could explain the evolution of risk premia over time . 
Moreover , many banks had so much public debt on their balance sheets that they would have been bankrupted in the event of a full-blown default . 
This led to extreme instability in the eurozone &apos;s banking system . 
A financial crisis ends when the doubtful debt either has been socialized , or its valuation has stabilized , and it has migrated to investors who are solvent enough to bear the risk . 
This was the case in the US . 
The authorities acquired some of the &quot; toxic &quot; assets , which over time became easier to value , as a few years of data on mortgage delinquency rates allowed investors to find ways to measure the risk . 
The market prices of most RMBS rebounded as losses due to homeowners simply abandoning their properties were much lower than had been feared at the height of the crisis . 
Moreover , holdings of RMBS migrated to institutions that were able to support and manage the remaining risk . 
Today , RMBS are no longer considered toxic , allowing the market to function normally again . 
In the end , the US authorities even made a small profit on the assets that they had acquired at the height of the crisis . 
This pattern can be only partly repeated in the eurozone , where both debt socialization and a return to normal risk assessment appear more difficult . 
Limited capacity for debt socialization reflects the EU Treaty &apos;s no-bailout clause , which bars outright mutualization at the eurozone level of ( national ) public debt . 
Moreover , the lending capacity of the new rescue fund , the European Stability Mechanism , is capped at â‚¬ 700 billion ( $ 905.6 billion ) , which represents only a fraction of the total public debt of the countries potentially needing financial assistance . 
Only the European Central Bank could implement true socialization of national debt in the eurozone . 
But EU law expressly forbids any form of ECB financing of deficits . 
A return to normal risk assessment is also more difficult in Europe . 
The European Council has solemnly declared that Greece &apos;s de facto default ( orchestrated through so-called &quot; private-sector involvement &quot; ) remains an exceptional and unique case . 
But the promise of a return to the status quo ante of risk-free public debt is not compatible with the continuing limits on the socialization of national debt . 
Indeed , the risk has become more concentrated as banks in the periphery have increased their investment in their own countries &quot; bonds . 
A sovereign default in Europe will never be a mere value to be plugged into some statistical risk model . 
These differences imply that the return to normal market conditions will be slower in the case of the euro crisis . 
Nevertheless , the crisis should abate somewhat , because the most risk-averse institutions have by now sold their holdings of peripheral countries &quot; sovereign debt . 
Moreover , the ECB has clearly stated that it will not allow the euro to disintegrate . 
That guarantee has insured investors against their biggest risk .
