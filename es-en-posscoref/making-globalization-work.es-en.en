Making Globalization Work 
I have written repeatedly about the problems of globalization : an unfair global trade regime that impedes development ; an unstable global financial system that results in recurrent crises , with poor countries repeatedly finding themselves burdened with unsustainable debt ; and a global intellectual property regime that denies access to affordable life-saving drugs , even as AIDS ravages the developing world . 
I have also written about globalization &apos;s anomalies : money should flow from rich to poor countries , but in recent years it has been going in the opposite direction . 
While the rich are better able to bear the risks of currency and interest-rate fluctuations , it is the poor who bear the brunt of this volatility . 
Indeed , I have complained so loudly and vociferously about the problems of globalization that many have wrongly concluded that I belong to the anti-globalization movement . 
But I believe that globalization has enormous potential - as long as it is properly managed . 
Some 70 years ago , during the Great Depression , John Maynard Keynes formulated his theory of unemployment , which described how government action could help restore full employment . 
While conservatives vilified him , Keynes actually did more to save the capitalist system than all the pro-market financiers put together . 
Had the conservatives been followed , the Great Depression would have been even worse and the demand for an alternative to capitalism would have grown stronger . 
By the same token , unless we recognize and address the problems of globalization , it will be difficult to sustain . 
Globalization is not inevitable : there have been setbacks before , and there can be setbacks again . 
Globalization &apos;s advocates are right that it has the potential to raise everyone &apos;s living standards . 
But it has not done that . 
The questions posed by young French workers , who wonder how globalization will make them better off if it means accepting lower wages and weaker job protection , can no longer be ignored . 
Nor can such questions be answered with the wistful hope that everyone will someday benefit . 
As Keynes pointed out , in the long run , we are all dead . 
Growing inequality in the advanced industrial countries was a long-predicted but seldom advertised consequence of globalization . 
Full economic integration implies the equalization of unskilled wages everywhere in the world , and , though we are nowhere near attaining this &quot; goal , &quot; the downward pressure on those at the bottom is evident . 
To the extent that changes in technology have contributed to the near stagnation of real wages for low-skilled workers in the United States and elsewhere for the past three decades , there is little that citizens can do . 
But they can do something about globalization . 
Economic theory does not say that everyone will win from globalization , but only that the net gains will be positive , and that the winners can therefore compensate the losers and still come out ahead . 
But conservatives have argued that in order to remain competitive in a global world , taxes must be cut and the welfare state reduced . 
This has been done in the US , where taxes have become less progressive , with tax cuts given to the winners - those who benefit from both globalization and technological changes . 
As a result , the US and others following its example are becoming rich countries with poor people . 
But the Scandinavian countries have shown that there is another way . 
Of course , government , like the private sector , must strive for efficiency . 
But investments in education and research , together with a strong social safety net , can lead to a more productive and competitive economy , with more security and higher living standards for all . 
A strong safety net and an economy close to full employment provides a conducive environment for all stakeholders - workers , investors , and entrepreneurs - to engage in the risk-taking that new investments and firms require . 
The problem is that economic globalization has outpaced the globalization of politics and mindsets . 
We have become more interdependent , increasing the need to act together , but we do not have the institutional frameworks for doing this effectively and democratically . 
Never has the need for international organizations like the IMF , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization been greater , and seldom has confidence in these institutions been lower . 
The world &apos;s lone superpower , the US , has demonstrated its disdain for supranational institutions and worked assiduously to undermine them . 
The looming failure of the Development Round of trade talks and the long delay in the United Nations Security Council &apos;s demand for a ceasefire in Lebanon are but the latest examples of America &apos;s contempt for multilateral initiatives . 
Enhancing our understanding of globalization &apos;s problems will help us to formulate remedies - some small , some large - aimed at both providing symptomatic relief and addressing the underlying causes . 
There is a broad array of policies that can benefit people in both developing and developed countries , thereby providing globalization with the popular legitimacy that it currently lacks . 
In other words , globalization can be changed ; indeed , it is clear that it will be changed . 
The question is whether change will be forced upon us by a crisis or result from careful , democratic deliberation and debate . 
Crisis-driven change risks producing a backlash against globalization , or a haphazard reshaping of it , thus merely setting the stage for more problems later on . 
By contrast , taking control of the process holds out the possibility of remaking globalization , so that it at last lives up to its potential and its promise : higher living standards for everyone in the world .
