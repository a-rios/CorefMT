The Techno-Political Transformation 
GENEVA - It would be an understatement to say that our world is undergoing rapid and far-reaching change . 
The global economy , the geopolitical landscape , the environment , and technology are subject to constantly shifting conditions that reinforce and transform one another in a web of complex interactions . 
In such an unpredictable and interconnected setting , effective leadership must be based on a radical outlook , a multifaceted skillset , and an understanding of technology and talent . 
The trends that are shaping the twenty-first-century world embody both promise and peril . 
Globalization , for example , has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty , while contributing to social fragmentation and a massive increase in inequality , not to mention serious environmental damage . 
Likewise , big data offers untold benefits to companies and consumers , but poses a real threat to privacy and personal freedom . 
A similar dichotomy applies to many other critical issues , including adaptation to climate change , efforts to improve resource management , urbanization and the rise of megacities , increased labor mobility , and human-capital expansion . 
The scale and complexity of the challenges that lie ahead are undoubtedly daunting . 
But rapid , far-reaching change can also present great opportunities . 
To make the most of them , the world needs technologically literate leaders - call them &quot; techno-politicians &quot; - who have an intuitive understanding of how to shape progress in this new , unpredictable environment . 
Within the framework of techno-politics , economic growth and technological innovation are the two most important factors shaping the global landscape . 
How we adapt to and guide their trajectories will determine our collective future . 
In economic terms , the world is entering an era of diminished expectations . 
If , as predicted , average annual GDP growth amounts to 3 % in the foreseeable future , it will take 25 years for the world economy to double in size - ten years longer than it took before the global economic crisis , when average GDP growth stood at 5 % . 
Learning to live with slower growth will not be easy . 
Given that debt-fueled consumption has run its course , productivity gains will become an increasingly critical driver of economic growth . 
But , at a time when rising inequality is undermining social cohesion , it is far from certain that the conditions required to support such gains - that is , improved education and stronger incentives to innovate - can be met . 
Perhaps most important , even as economic growth slows , technological change continues at a breakneck pace , raising seemingly unanswerable questions about its potential impact on the global economy . 
While some warn that technological progress will leave many unemployed , others remain convinced that displaced workers will find new jobs that do not yet exist , as has occurred in the past . 
All that is certain is that technology and innovation are disrupting virtually every aspect of life . 
How can we adapt to such a world ? 
What underpins success in this new and challenging environment ? 
In a techno-polity , two inextricably linked factors are crucial : talent and innovation . 
Talent is now the key factor driving competitiveness ( or the lack thereof ) for companies and countries alike . 
Indeed , &quot; talentism &quot; will be the prevailing economic credo , with human or intellectual capital becoming the most critical asset - and the one most difficult to acquire and retain . 
Innovation , spurred by talent , will determine success . 
In the future , the distinction between high- and low-income countries , or between emerging and mature markets , will no longer matter . 
The question will be whether or not an economy can innovate . 
A techno-polity also recognizes the critical role of cooperation , strategic thinking , and adaptation . 
The biggest challenges nowadays are global in nature , and thus can be addressed only by engaging decision-makers and interest groups from various spheres . 
New partnerships must be forged , even among actors with seemingly disparate interests . 
Those who struggle to cope with change must be supported , not scorned . 
But effective techno-politicians must go beyond firefighting to think about the long term . 
They must be able to respond to new and impending developments without delay , constantly experimenting with new ideas and processes . 
Moreover , they must to be able to understand and react simultaneously to multiple competing realities . 
The role of the techno-polity is to steer the world toward positive outcomes . 
It will demand that decision-makers use their heads and hearts - and it will also test their nerves .
