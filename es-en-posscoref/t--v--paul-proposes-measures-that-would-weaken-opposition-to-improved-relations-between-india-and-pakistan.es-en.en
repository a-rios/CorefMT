Overcoming South Asia &apos;s Peace Spoilers 
MONTREAL - Long-anticipated peace negotiations between India and Pakistan appear to have been delayed until after India &apos;s May parliamentary elections , and the prospects for subsequent talks are not clear . 
Victory for Narendra Modi &apos;s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , a resurgent Taliban in the wake of the United States &quot; impending troop withdrawal from Afghanistan , and Pakistan &apos;s continuing failure to negotiate with or suppress the Pakistani Taliban , point to a period of intense uncertainty and potential conflict . 
But this is no reason to give up trying for peace . 
True , Modi &apos;s peacemaking credentials are already highly questionable , both at home and in Pakistan . 
He was Gujarat &apos;s chief minister in 2002 when riots killed more than a thousand Muslims . 
Many fear that , as Prime Minister , he would polarize the entire country along communal lines . 
And , thus far , he has taken an uncompromising position on Pakistan , and will probably continue to talk tough , at least for the time being . 
But Modi is likely to take cues from his BJP predecessor , Atal Bihari Vajpayee , who visited Lahore in 1999 to talk peace with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif ( who returned to power in 2013 ) . 
There are good reasons for Modi to do so . 
Peace with Pakistan would strengthen his personal standing nationally and internationally , thus constituting a step toward fulfilling the BJP &apos;s great-power ambitions for India . 
It would also help revive India &apos;s weakened economy by spurring foreign investment , the benefits of which Modi has already seen in Gujarat . 
Sharif has offered India olive branches of his own , and with good reason : Rapprochement with India is essential to strengthening his position in Afghanistan and improving his capacity to suppress violence at home . 
Peace with India would also allow him to undercut the power of Pakistan &apos;s military and its intelligence wing , the ISI . 
Although entering peace talks with a future Modi government would risk provoking a domestic backlash , Sharif might still be willing to break the ice if the main political parties support his moves . 
Unfortunately , many in South Asia do not want peace . 
Numerous attempts by India &apos;s current Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to re-start talks with Pakistan have been thwarted by violations along Kashmir &apos;s line of control or as a result of cross-border artillery fire - episodes that seem to occur at the slightest provocation . 
For now , Indian policymakers regard Sharif &apos;s overtures with suspicion . 
They are wary of what his negotiations with the Pakistani Taliban might bring , and they doubt that he retains control over Pakistan &apos;s policies on Kashmir or Afghanistan . 
Indeed , the biggest obstacle to India-Pakistan peace negotiations is their vulnerability to spoilers . 
As soon as the process begins , powerful vested interests are likely to disrupt it - violently - because a peace agreement would undermine their power base and the political support that they derive from continuing the conflict . 
There are plenty of precedents for this . 
In 1999 , Pakistan &apos;s General Pervez Musharraf destabilized the Lahore peace process by sending rangers to occupy the Kargil Heights on Kashmir &apos;s Indian side . 
In December 2001 , the attack by the Pakistan-based militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba ( LeT ) and Jaish-e-Mohammed ( JeM ) on India &apos;s parliament wrecked unofficial discussions between the BJP government and Musharraf &apos;s military regime . 
India also has its spoilers . 
The February 2007 bombing - apparently by Hindu fundamentalists - of the Samjhauta Express , a biweekly train service connecting New Delhi and Lahore , occurred just before a visit by Pakistan &apos;s foreign minister , killing 68 people , both Pakistanis and Indians . 
The fact that both countries have weak governments that lack popular support strengthens the spoilers &quot; position . 
India &apos;s Congress-led coalition may view a tough stance toward Pakistan as the only way to ward off domestic criticism from the BJP and other opposition parties . 
And many Indians doubt the value of negotiating with a Sharif government that , given civil-military tensions , may not serve its full term . 
The appointment of the pliable general Raheel Sharif as army chief has helped defuse the situation ; but , with Pakistan and India backing opposing sides in Afghanistan , the military and the ISI could reassert themselves should tensions there rise . 
Fortunately , violence inside Kashmir has decreased for now , though it could easily flare up again if the Taliban were to consolidate its power in Afghanistan , and the ISI were to ratchet up support for groups like LeT and JeM . 
Though current political volatility in both India and Pakistan rules out full peace talks for the time being , that should not prevent the two sides from initiating confidence-building measures by trying to resolve lower-level disagreements , including territorial disputes over Siachen , Sir Creek , and the Wullar barrage / Tulbul navigation project . 
Differences over water rights and dam construction could be negotiated at diplomatic levels or through back channels . 
The two countries could also develop economic and commercial cooperation , work together to combat terrorism and drug trafficking , and promote friendly exchanges in various social and cultural fields . 
Increased trade relations might also create countervailing economic interests in favor of peace . 
Recent agreements to establish more border trading posts and bank branches are good starting points , and Pakistan has already made some moves to reciprocate India &apos;s offer of Most Favored Nation trading status under a different name . 
This alone may not guarantee the success of negotiations , if and when they take place , but it could remove incentives to spoil them . 
And if the two countries can find ways to prevent smaller disputes from escalating , it would generate a more conducive atmosphere in which to address Kashmir , the largest source of conflict of all .
