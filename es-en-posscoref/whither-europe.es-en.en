Whither Europe ? 
BEIJING - With the likelihood of a contagious sovereign-debt implosion and European bank failures greatly reduced by the Greek debt deal and the European Central Bank &apos;s lending program , it is time to look ahead . 
Where do the European Union , the eurozone , and the EU &apos;s highly indebted countries go from here ? 
Will Europe be able to roll back its welfare states &quot; biggest excesses without economic distress and social unrest toppling governments and , in the peripheral countries , undermining already-tenuous agreements with creditors ? 
Some good news globally will have an impact on how these questions are resolved . 
The United States &quot; economy is gradually reviving , albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession . 
China , Brazil , and India have not decoupled from their customers in Europe and North America , and so are slowing , though a relatively soft landing is likely if Europe &apos;s recession is as short and mild as predicted . 
The EU &apos;s economic output and population are larger than that of the US , so the fate of the 27 EU countries is everyone &apos;s business , from New York to New Delhi , SÃ£o Paulo to Shanghai . 
Formed originally as a free-trade area , the eurozone comprises 17 of the countries . 
Knitting together 17 disparate economies , cultures , and institutions was a monumental undertaking , fraught with risk . 
The Lisbon Treaty emphasizes unanimity in decision-making . 
With some members inside of the eurozone , and others remaining outside of it , and with disparate economic interests and monetary and fiscal traditions even within the eurozone , agreement is difficult . 
That sets the stage for three broad scenarios , each with implications for the European and global economy , the financial and banking system , and relations between the member states and EU institutions . 
In the first scenario , a more united and homogeneous Europe emerges from the crisis , enforcing greater restrictions on member states &quot; budgets to reduce apparent risk . 
Accompanied by a strong , broad eurozone , risk of a future currency crisis remains . 
In the second scenario , a two- or three-tiered Europe includes a two-tiered euro , with the weaker countries using a separate &quot; euro-B &quot; currency that can float against the stronger economies &quot; &quot; euro-A . &quot; 
This arrangement would hold out the promise to fiscally stressed economies that , if they get their act together , they could rejoin euro-A - and do so more readily than they could from their own currency . 
In the final scenario , what emerges is a more decentralized Europe , with less top-down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller , more homogeneous eurozone composed of the EU &apos;s core economies . 
Such a construct would be far more popular with citizens who are unhappy with the accretion of EU power in Brussels and the loss of traditional sovereignty . 
Some current euro members - Greece ( and perhaps others ) - would revert to national currencies . 
None of these options is easy ; each entails serious difficulties and great risks . 
Episodic muddling through may be the best that can be hoped for . 
For example , how would Greece ( or any country ) exit the euro in order to cushion the extreme downward wage adjustment required to regain competitiveness , and to avoid the severe social unrest that could result from reining in debt too rapidly ? 
As soon as word got out that Greece was seriously considering such a move - well before it could even generate a new drachma currency - euro bank deposits would flee Greece . 
As a result , Greece would be forced to impose capital controls . 
Some contracts denominated in euros would be subject to Greek law , some to European law , and others - for example , derivatives contracts - to British or US law . 
Legal chaos would result . 
Yet sticking to the euro and forcing all of the adjustments in wages risks greater unrest ; indeed , it might merely postpone the inevitable . 
Governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines ( if they are ratified ) . 
While talk is tough now , the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism . 
Before the financial crisis , even Germany violated the EU Stability and Growth Pact &apos;s ( SGP ) deficit limits . 
In the US , the 1980 &quot; s deficit limits set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law were not met , and , like the SGP , were revised and extended . 
Agreements with , and access to , the International Monetary Fund and Europe &apos;s new bailout fund provide ( soft ) constraints . 
Regardless of how these governance and fiscal issues are resolved , or muddled through , Europe &apos;s banks remain a thorny issue . 
With the time afforded by the ECB &apos;s three-year cheap loans , they have some breathing room to rebuild their capital and clean up their balance sheets . 
But , while doing so , they are not likely to be expanding private-sector lending to support economic growth . 
European banks are far more thinly capitalized , and account for a much larger share of credit extended , than banks in the US , where much more lending originates in capital markets . 
Most large US banks - Citi is an exception - passed US Federal Reserve stress tests recently , with enough capital to withstand a hypothetical deep recession ( 13 % unemployment , a 21 % further fall in home prices , and a 50 % stock-market decline ) . 
Europe &apos;s stress tests have been much weaker . 
Some sort of Brady bond to reduce and extend excessive sovereign debt will be necessary . 
We can expect further European turmoil - from banks , sovereign debt , and social unrest in response to even modest welfare-state rollbacks - and clashing visions , within and among countries , concerning the desirability of deeper European integration . 
Europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders prophesied that the euro would quickly rival the dollar as a global reserve currency . 
Yet no one should write off Europe . 
It still has great strengths , and , with sensible reforms , the EU can survive and eventually return to greater prosperity and stability . 
But Europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renewal than to the end .
