A Decade of Hugo Chávez 
SAN JOSE - We should have known that something was amiss when , during President Hugo Chávez &apos;s inauguration on February 2 , 1999 , he swore on Venezuela &apos;s 40-year-old Constitution by declaring it &quot; moribund . &quot; 
Under &quot; the moribund , &quot; as the Constitution came to be known , Venezuela not only had eight peaceful presidential transitions , but also enjoyed the fruits of democratic pluralism and strong civil and political liberties . 
Of course , during this period Venezuela produced as much corruption and political irresponsibility as it did barrels of oil . 
It wasn &apos;t Switzerland , but , by anyone &apos;s measure , it was a genuine democracy . 
Not anymore . 
Elections are still held , but the legacy of Chávez &apos;s decade in power consists , first and foremost , in the demolition of democratic institutions . 
Elected in a landslide to clean up the political vices of the previous establishment , Chávez chose to throw the baby out with the bathwater . 
The previous regime , including its system of checks and balances and its tradition of political tolerance , did disappear , but its vices - particularly graft and demagoguery - became worse than ever . 
Pretty much like 10 years ago , Venezuela , once a destination for immigrants from around the world , remains under-developed . 
More fundamentally , Chávez represents ideas that have long stifled Latin America &apos;s political and economic growth . 
This includes the notion that social justice can be achieved only by abandoning the path of reform and rejecting &quot; bourgeois &quot; democratic forms in favor of &quot; real &quot; democracy , born of revolutionary purity and the leader &apos;s millenarian dreams . 
That &apos;s simply false . 
Though the Chávez revolution has made progress against poverty and inequality , it is hardly sustainable and reeks of patronage . 
In fact , one can find similar achievements in Chile and Brazil , which have not given up on democratic checks and balances , political pluralism , or freedom of the press , and have not enjoyed the luxury of $ 300 billion in oil revenue in the space of one decade . 
Moreover , it ought not to be forgotten that between 1950 and 1980 , Venezuela itself reduced extreme poverty from 43 % to 8 % of the population , one of the lowest figures in Latin America . 
It did so with democracy and freedom . 
Chávez also repeats , 
It is obvious that Yankee imperialism cannot be blamed for Venezuela &apos;s emaciated tax system , dismally bad schools , rampant corruption , high crime rate , and feeble political institutions . 
In all of these areas , Venezuela is faring poorly even by Latin America &apos;s low standards . 
This is particularly true in the case of institutional weakness . 
When Chávez declares &quot; moribund &quot; a legitimate constitution , or when he proclaims 
None of these ideas would fly , of course , in a contented nation . 
In this sense , Venezuela &apos;s experience speaks to all of Latin America . 
The combination of economic growth ( now in reverse because of the global crisis ) and atrocious levels of inequality and social segmentation will continue to breed the same unmet expectations and social resentment that cleared Chávez &apos;s path to power . 
As long as Latin America &apos;s democracies fail to take seriously the tasks of reducing inequality , spreading opportunity , and nurturing more cohesive societies , they will continue to court disaster . 
To avoid this outcome , it is vital to purge certain reactionary and numbing beliefs , including the idea that reducing poverty obviates the need to address inequality , or that development is possible without introducing modern and progressive tax systems . 
If the tenth anniversary of Chávez &apos;s tenure can serve as a reminder of the perils that beset unjust democracies - especially now that a new electoral cycle in Latin America looms - then Venezuela &apos;s agonizing recent history would , at least , be redeemed .
