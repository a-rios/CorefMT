A Post-Crisis World of Risk 
MILAN - The global economy &apos;s most striking feature nowadays is the magnitude and interconnectedness of the macro risks that it faces . 
The post-crisis period has produced a multi-speed world , as the major advanced economies - with the notable exception of Germany - struggle with low growth and high unemployment , while the main emerging-market economies ( Brazil , China , India , Indonesia , and Russia ) have restored growth to pre-crisis levels . 
This divergence is mirrored in public finances . 
Emerging economies &quot; debt-to-GDP ratios are trending down toward 40 % , while those of advanced economies are trending up toward 100 % , on average . 
Neither Europe nor the United States has put in place credible medium-term plans to stabilize their fiscal positions . 
The volatility of the euro-dollar exchange rate reflects the uncertainty about which side of the Atlantic faces higher risks . 
In Europe , this has led to several ratings downgrades of the sovereign debt of the most distressed countries , accompanied by bouts of contagion spilling over to the euro . 
More seem likely . 
As for the US , Moody &apos;s recently issued a warning on the country &apos;s sovereign debt in the face of uncertainty about Congress &apos;s willingness to raise the debt ceiling amid highly partisan debate about the deficit . 
Both issues - the debt ceiling and a credible deficit-reduction plan - remain unresolved . 
Moreover , economic growth in the US is modest , and appears to come mainly from segments of the tradable sector that are exposed to and benefit from emerging-market demand . 
The non-tradable sector , which created virtually all of the new employment in the two decades prior to the crisis , is stagnating , owing to a shortfall in domestic demand and seriously constrained government budgets . 
The result is persistent unemployment . 
Meanwhile , the tradable side is not large enough in competitive terms to take up the slack in growth and employment . 
By contrast , emerging markets &quot; rapid growth and urbanization are delivering a global investment boom , documented in a recent McKinsey Global Institute study . 
A likely consequence is that the cost of capital will rise in the next few years , putting pressure on highly leveraged entities , including governments that have grown accustomed to a low interest-rate environment and may not see this shift coming . 
Countries with persistent structural current-account deficits will incur additional external-financing costs , and eventually will reach the limits of leverage . 
At that point , the weak productivity and competitiveness of their tradable sectors will become clear . 
Adjustments will need to be made . 
The options are higher investment levels financed by domestic savings , productivity growth , and increased competitiveness , or stagnant real incomes as rebalancing occurs through the exchange-rate mechanism ( or a large dose of domestic deflation in the debt-distressed eurozone countries , since they do not control their own exchange rates ) . 
Many of these structural problems were hidden from view before the crisis , thereby delaying both market and policy responses . 
In the US , excess domestic consumption , based on a debt-fueled asset bubble , helped to sustain employment and growth , though the current account held worrying signs . 
In several European countries , governments , aided by low interest rates , filled in the gap created by lagging productivity . 
In all cases , assessments of fiscal balance were mistakenly predicated on the assumed stability and sustainability of the existing growth paths . 
The assumption that a benign growth and interest-rate environment was a permanent state of affairs led to a massive failure of fiscal counter-cyclicality in the advanced economies , as budget deficits became chronic , rather than a response to depressed domestic demand . 
In emerging markets , China &apos;s growth is crucial , owing to its size and importance as an export market for Brazil , India , South Korea , Japan , and even Germany . 
But inflation is a dual threat to China , jeopardizing both economic growth and internal cohesion . 
Housing has become unaffordable for many young people entering the work force . Reining in price and asset inflation without undermining growth will be a delicate balancing act . 
Moreover , China shares with the US the challenge of limiting growth in income inequality . 
In both cases , the employment engines need to keep running or be restarted , in order to prevent political volatility and social unrest . 
Protectionism on a large scale is not a likely outcome - at least not yet - but that could change if employment and distributional issues are not handled well . 
For Asia , which is relatively poor in resources compared to the Middle East , Latin America , and Africa , the rising cost of commodities , driven in part by emerging-market growth , is a cause for concern . 
Energy security is also a notable risk factor , especially given the uncertain outcomes of the popular uprisings in the Middle East . 
Emerging-market growth is the world &apos;s bright spot and looks to be sustainable even as the advanced countries experience an extended period of rebalancing and slow growth . 
A major downturn in Europe or America would have a significant negative impact on these economies , which can generate enough incremental demand to sustain their own growth , but not enough to make up for a large drop in advanced-country demand . 
Markets may have factored in the combined effect of these macro risks , which nowadays are pervasive and correlated , but I doubt it . 
Nonetheless , all countries share a strong and immediate interest in reducing them . 
Let &apos;s hope that an awareness of this will add a much-needed sense of urgency to national policy responses , as well as to efforts by the G-20 and other international bodies to improve international policy coordination .
