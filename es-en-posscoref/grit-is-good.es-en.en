Grit is Good 
PARIS - The United States is widely recognized as possessing the deepest , most liquid , and most efficient capital markets in the world . 
America &apos;s financial system supports efficient capital allocation , economic development , and job creation . 
These and similar phrases have been common currency among American legislators , regulators , and financial firms for decades . 
Even in the wake of the financial crisis that erupted in 2008 , they trip off the word processors of a hundred submissions challenging the so-called Volcker rule ( which would bar banks from making proprietary investments ) . 
The casual reader nods and moves along . 
But there are signs that these assumptions are now being challenged . 
Prior to the crisis , regulatory authorities focused mainly on removing barriers to trading , and generally favored measures that made markets more complete by fostering faster , cheaper trading of a wider variety of financial claims . 
That is no longer the case . 
On the contrary , nowadays many are questioning the assumption that greater market efficiency is always and everywhere a public good . 
Might such ease and efficiency not also fuel market instability , and serve the interests of intermediaries rather than their clients ? 
Phrases like &quot; sand in the machine &quot; and &quot; grit in the oyster , &quot; which were pejorative in the prelapsarian days of 2006 , are now used to support regulatory or fiscal changes that may slow down trading and reduce its volume . 
For example , the proposed Financial Transactions Tax in the European Union implies a wide-ranging impost generating more than â‚¬ 50 billion a year to shore up the EU &apos;s own finances and save the euro . 
The fact that 60-70 % of the receipts would come from London is an added attraction for its continental advocates . 
Opponents argue , in pre-crisis language , that the FTT would reduce market efficiency and displace trading to other locations . 
&quot; So what ? &quot; supporters reply : maybe much of the trading is &quot; socially useless , &quot; and we would be better off without it . 
The Volcker rule ( named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker ) provoked similar arguments . 
Critics have complained that it would reduce liquidity in important markets , such as those for non-US sovereign debt . 
Defending his creation , Volcker harks back to a simpler time for the financial system , and refers to &quot; overly liquid , speculation-prone securities markets . &quot; 
His message is clear : he is not concerned about lower trading volumes . 
There is more grit on the horizon . 
In a penetrating analysis of the &quot; Flash Crash &quot; of May 6 , 2010 , when the Dow lost $ 1 trillion of market value in 30 minutes , Andy Haldane of the Bank of England argues that while rising equity-market capitalization might well be associated with financial development and economic growth , there is no such relationship between market turnover and growth . 
Turnover in US financial markets rose four-fold in the decade before the crisis . 
Did the real economy benefit ? 
Haldane cites a striking statistic : in 1945 , the average investor held the average US share for four years . 
By 2000 , the average holding period had fallen to eight months ; by 2008 , it was two months . 
There appears to be a link between this precipitous drop in the average duration of stock holdings and the phenomenon of the so-called &quot; ownerless corporation , &quot; whereby shareholders have little incentive to impose discipline on management . 
That absence of accountability , in turn , has contributed to the vertiginous rise in senior executives &quot; compensation and , in financial firms , to a shift away from shareholder returns and towards large payouts to insiders . 
But Haldane &apos;s main concern is with the stability of markets , particularly the threats posed by high-frequency trading ( HFT ) . 
He points out that HFT already accounts for half of total turnover in some debt and foreign-exchange markets , and that it is dominant in US equity markets , accounting for more than one-third of daily trading , up from less than one-fifth in 2005 . 
The rapid , dramatic shifts brought about by HFT are likely to continue . 
It is only a decade since trading speeds fell below one second ; they are now as fast as the blink of an eye . 
Technological change promises even faster trading speeds in the near future . 
Indeed , HFT firms talk of a &quot; race to zero , &quot; the point at which trading takes place at close to the speed of light . 
Should we welcome this trend ? 
Will light-speed trading deliver us to free-market Nirvana ? 
The evidence is mixed . 
It would seem that bid-offer spreads are falling , which we might regard as positive . 
But volatility has risen , as has cross-market contagion . 
Instability in one market carries over into others . 
As for liquidity , while on the surface it looks deeper , the joint report on the Flash Crash prepared by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that HFT traders scaled back liquidity sharply , thereby exacerbating the problem . 
The liquidity that they apparently offer proved unreliable under stress - that is , when it is most needed . 
There are lessons here for regulators . 
First , their monitoring of markets requires a quantum leap in sophistication and speed . 
There is a case , too , for looking again at the operation of circuit-breakers ( which helped the Chicago markets in the crash ) , and for increasing the obligations on market makers . 
Such steps must be carefully calibrated , as greater obligations , for example , could push market makers out of the market . 
But Haldane &apos;s conclusion is that , overall , markets are less stable as a result of the sharp rise in turnover , and that &quot; grit in the wheels , like grit on the roads , could help forestall the next crash . &quot; 
So the traditional defense of US and , indeed , European capital markets is not as axiomatic as it once seemed . 
Market participants need to engage more effectively with the new agenda , and not assume that claims of greater &quot; market efficiency &quot; will win the day . 
Without more sophisticated arguments , they might well find themselves submerged under a pile of regulatory sandbags .
