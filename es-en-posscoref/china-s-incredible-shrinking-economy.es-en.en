China &apos;s Incredible Shrinking Economy 
ITHACA , NY  -  
Since these are the fastest-growing large economies , the Bank &apos;s revision has clipped half a percentage point off world growth over the last five years , according to the IMF . 
The new numbers set off a firestorm of debate , and have brought conspiracy theorists out in force . 
But when the dust settles , the new data may be less revolutionary than some people believe . 
They may also have the unintended benefit of shifting a key policy debate in a more productive direction . 
The new data are based on improved estimates of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) . 
The basic idea is that , when comparing incomes across countries , variations in purchasing power should be taken into account . 
Market exchange rates are not a good indicator of these differences , because they can fluctuate for other reasons . 
The World Bank and some other organizations have , collectively , gathered a massive amount of data - covering 1,000 similar products in 146 countries - to construct comparable international prices . 
Price levels in China and India , among other developing countries , turn out to be much higher than previously estimated . 
Hence , their real per capita incomes are lower relative to other countries . 
Despite this massive shrinkage , the reality on the ground is unchanged . 
Indeed , people in Beijing and Delhi are showing more equanimity than most would if their incomes were cut by 40 % . 
The bottom line is that China and India are still large economies , growing rapidly , and consuming massive amounts of resources . 
All that has changed is that both countries have been downgraded to smaller roles on the world stage . 
But size is not all that matters . 
The new PPP data also have implications for evaluating the extent of poverty and the level of a currency &apos;s exchange rate . 
This is where the conspiracy theories come in . 
The reduction in income levels at international prices means that many more people in China and India are now classified as poor - an automatic boon for the World Bank , whose primary business is to end poverty . 
And the fact that China &apos;s market exchange rate was far lower ( i.e. , more yuan per dollar ) than the earlier PPP exchange rate had been interpreted as evidence of huge undervaluation . 
The new data , by contrast , show that the exchange rate of the renminbi relative to the dollar is about right . 
The calculations can be tweaked , but it is difficult to generate anything close to the dramatic figures of 40-50 % undervaluation that had been bandied about by some researchers . 
This has fomented accusations that China apologists have cooked the new numbers . 
But the conspiracy theories are off the mark . 
The World Bank has engaged in a good faith effort to make progress on a hugely complicated matter . 
Of course , there remain gaping holes in the data . 
For example , the data for China are based on surveys in just 11 cities . 
Prices for rural areas - where two-thirds of China &apos;s population still resides - are based on extrapolations from these data . 
There is guesswork involved , but at least it &apos;s been done in a systematic way . 
In any case , earlier calculations depended on an even greater amount of guesswork . 
Whatever one makes of the data , the number of people leading lives of quiet desperation in these countries is unconscionably large . 
As for the exchange rate , PPP is only one of many ways to calculate its equilibrium level . 
Given China &apos;s massive current account surplus ( 12 % of GDP ) , the renminbi is still undervalued . 
But the degree of undervaluation is not the point . 
What China needs is a more flexible exchange rate that can respond freely to market forces . 
Otherwise , China &apos;s central bank must focus on keeping the exchange rate stable and doesn &apos;t have a truly independent monetary policy . 
More flexibility would help attain more balanced and sustainable growth . 
It would allow the central bank to raise interest rates aggressively to control runaway credit and investment growth , and keep inflation in check . 
Raising interest rates on bank deposits , which are now negative in real terms , would reduce incentives for individuals to pour money into equity markets or real estate , mitigating the risk of asset market bubbles and boom-bust cycles in the economy . 
Trying to determine the &quot; right &quot; level of the renminbi , by contrast , is a fool &apos;s game , and the proposal of a step revaluation to get to that level has become a polemical distraction . 
Perhaps the new data will cool the heated rhetoric about undervaluation and currency manipulation , and instead generate a substantive discussion about exchange-rate flexibility and its benefits for China and the world .
