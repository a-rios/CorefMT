Moving on From the Euro 
SAINT-PIERRE-D &apos;ENTREMONT , FRANCE - European Monetary Union was never a good idea . 
I remember my surprise when , as a young assistant professor , I realized that I was opposed to the Maastricht Treaty . 
I believed then - and still do - that European integration is a very good thing . 
Nothing that has happened since has convinced me that the textbook was excessively pessimistic . 
On the contrary : it was far too optimistic . 
Life is strewn with banana skins , and when you step on one you need to be able to adjust . 
And adjustment - that is , currency devaluation - was not an option . 
And no textbooks predicted that European cooperation would impose pro-cyclical austerity on crisis-struck countries , creating depressions that in some cases have rivaled those of the 1930s . 
It has been obvious for some years that the &quot; actually existing EMU &quot; has been a costly failure , both economically and politically . 
Trust in European institutions has collapsed , and political parties skeptical not just of the euro , but of the entire European project , are on the rise . 
And yet most economists , even those who were never keen on EMU in the first place , have been reluctant to make the argument that the time has come to abandon a failed experiment . 
A famous article by Barry Eichengreen pointed out that an anticipated EMU breakup would lead to the &quot; mother of all financial crises . &quot; 
It is hard to disagree with him . 
That is why economists of all stripes , whether or not they supported the introduction of the common currency , have spent the last five years developing and promoting a package of institutional reforms and policy changes that would make the eurozone less dysfunctional . 
In the short run , the eurozone needs much looser monetary and fiscal policy . 
It also needs a higher inflation target ( to reduce the need for nominal wage and price reductions ) ; debt relief , where appropriate ; a proper banking union with an adequate , centralized fiscal backstop ; and a &quot; safe &quot; eurozone asset that national banks could hold , thereby breaking the sovereign-bank doom loop . 
Unfortunately , economists have not argued strongly for a proper fiscal union . 
Even those who consider it economically necessary censor themselves , because they believe it to be politically impossible . 
The problem is that silence has narrowed the frontier of political possibility even further , so that more modest proposals have fallen by the wayside as well . 
Five years on , the eurozone still lacks a proper banking union , or even , as Greece demonstrated , a proper lender of last resort . 
Moreover , a higher inflation target remains unthinkable , and the German government argues that defaults on sovereign debt are illegal within the eurozone . 
Pro-cyclical fiscal adjustment is still the order of the day . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s belated embrace of quantitative easing was a welcome step forward , but policymakers &quot; enormously destructive decision to shut down a member state &apos;s banking system - for what appears to be political reasons - is a far larger step backward . 
And no one is talking about real fiscal and political union , even though no one can imagine European Monetary Union surviving under the status quo . 
Meanwhile , the political damage is ongoing : not all protest parties are as pro-European as Greece &apos;s ruling Syriza . 
And domestic politics is being distorted by the inability of centrist politicians to address voters &quot; concerns about the eurozone &apos;s economic policies and its democratic deficit . 
To do so , it is feared , would give implicit support to the skeptics , which is taboo . 
Thus , in France , Socialist President Fran√ßois Hollande channels Jean-Baptiste Say , arguing that supply creates its own demand , while the far-right National Front &apos;s Marine Le Pen gets to quote Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz approvingly . 
No wonder that working-class voters are turning to her party . 
A victory for the National Front in 2017 or 2022 , which is no longer unthinkable , would destroy the European project . 
Citizens of smaller eurozone member states will have noted the brutal way the ECB was politicized to achieve Germany &apos;s goals in Greece , and the conclusion that the eurozone is a dangerous &quot; union &quot; for small countries will seem inescapable . 
If centrist parties remain on the sidelines , rather than protesting what has happened , the political extremists will gain further valuable territory . 
As for economists like me , who have balked at advocating an end to the failed euro experiment and favored reform , perhaps it is time to admit defeat and move on . 
If only anti-Europeans oppose EMU , the EU baby could end up being thrown out with the euro bathwater . 
An end to the euro would indeed provoke an immense crisis . 
If not it will end , and the timing of that end will never be &quot; right . &quot; 
Better , then , to get on with it before more damage is done .
