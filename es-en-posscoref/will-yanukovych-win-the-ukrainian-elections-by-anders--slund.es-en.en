Ukraine &apos;s Revolt of the Oligarchs 
KYIV - Ukraine &apos;s parliamentary election on October 28 will be neither free nor fair . 
After eight unproductive years since the 2004 Orange Revolution , the democratic opposition is depressed and demoralized . 
Even so , the elections may check President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s power . 
Yanukovych came to power in February 2010 , in elections that were rated free and fair ( and at a time when Freedom House still ranked Ukraine as democratic ) . 
But he quickly consolidated power and turned Ukraine into a mildly authoritarian state . 
A dozen prominent opposition politicians have been sentenced to prison , including former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and the former interior minister , Yuri Lutsenko . 
Tymoshenko , who was and remains the leader of the liberal and pro-Western opposition , was sentenced to seven years in prison for a gas deal with Russia in which she was not even accused of having benefited personally . 
Without her , the democratic opposition has no strong leader . 
But Yanukovych has not stopped there . 
He exerts heavy pressure on private television channels , and has blocked licenses and cable access for the independent television channel TVi , which has exposed the most serious corruption cases of his administration . 
Moreover , he uses the civil service and law-enforcement authorities extensively to repress the opposition and promote his protégés . 
And yet the upcoming election matters . 
Ukraine has a vibrant civil society and excellent free Internet media . 
But the opposition , which comprises half the country , is badly demoralized after five years of stalemate among the Orange Revolution &apos;s leaders , for which the largest share of blame falls on former President Viktor Yushchenko , who by almost all accounts has betrayed the democratic breakthrough that he represented . 
He now leads a party that supports Yanukovych , who has even allowed Yushchenko to remain in the presidential residence since leaving office . 
Ukrainian voters are fickle . 
They voted against the incumbent powers in the presidential elections of 1994 , 2004 , and 2010 . 
They may do so again . 
The most recent public-opinion poll suggested that Yanukovych &apos;s Party of Regions would obtain 28 % of the vote , and that its only ally to surpass the 5 % electoral threshold would be the communists , with 11 % , giving them a total of 39 % , compared to 36 % for two opposition parties , Tymoshenko &apos;s Fatherland party ( 19 % ) and the heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko &apos;s UDAR ( 17 % ) . 
The predatory nature of Yanukovych &apos;s rule is not exactly well hidden ; his family members and loyalists control the entire security apparatus and the main economic agencies . 
He is rightly scared by the democratic opposition , which he is emasculating by all reasonably soft means . 
Anticipating that his party might lose the upcoming election if Ukraine &apos;s proportional voting system were maintained , Yanukovych has reverted to the electoral system of 2002 , with only half of the 450 seats to be distributed proportionally . 
The remaining 225 seats will be filled in winner-take-all single-member constituencies - a change that gives regional tycoons a great opportunity to buy seats . 
But Yanukovych failed to anticipate that tycoons would dare to be disloyal to him . 
Initially , his government contained nine groups of big businessmen , but that number has fallen gradually , and even top businessmen have been marginalized by his core loyalists , who are widely rumored to be enriching themselves at the expense of both the state and private business . 
Unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin , Yanukovych seems to have steamrolled too many too fast , overestimating his power and narrowing his base . 
Indeed , he appears to have turned all of Ukraine &apos;s top oligarchs into his enemies . 
Each summer , the prominent Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk organizes a major international conference , the Yalta European Strategy , attended by the Ukrainian elite and prominent foreigners . 
This September , the lesson of the conference was that Yanukovych has isolated himself not only from the West and Russia , but also from his main backers at home . 
The Ukrainian tycoons are no fools . 
They view the upcoming election as their last chance to stand up against Yanukovych . 
The many parliamentarians to be elected in single-member constituencies are more likely to obey them than Yanukovych . 
Under the electoral system in place in 2002 , the ruling party quickly disintegrated into nine oligarchic party factions . 
Something similar is likely to happen this time around . 
The tycoons might not oust Yanukovych , but they will check his power . 
Their most vocal public representatives are First Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy and the economy minister , Petro Poroshenko , who was a major force behind the Orange Revolution . 
The businessmen &apos;s main objection to Yanukovych is that he prefers to keep Tymoshenko in prison rather than obtain an Association Agreement with the European Union . 
The already-concluded free-trade agreement with the EU would offer Ukraine badly needed market access and increased exports , but the EU will not ratify it unless Tymoshenko is released and repression of the opposition and media ceases . 
Similarly , the tycoons advocate restored cooperation with the International Monetary Fund , because they want access to credit at reasonable interest rates . 
But Yanukovych refuses to liberalize gas prices , a key IMF demand . 
Concern that the West &apos;s pro-reform stance will push Ukraine into Russia &apos;s embrace is largely unfounded . 
Yanukovych &apos;s personal relations with Putin are so poor that Putin all but refuses to talk to him - other than to make preposterous demands . 
The West thus has an important role to play in the election , and is providing two thousand election monitors to help to ensure a free and fair vote . 
Indeed , the United States and the EU , in particular , have a large stake in the outcome . 
Ukraine is a friendly country - one that always joins Western &quot; coalitions of the willing . &quot; 
But it is a lapsed democratic country . 
They must help to change that .
