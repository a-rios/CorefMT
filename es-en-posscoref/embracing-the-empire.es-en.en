Embracing the Empire 
Bernard Kouchner , France &apos;s new foreign minister , has a long and distinguished record as an advocate of intervention in countries where human rights are abused . 
As a co-founder of Doctors Without Borders , he stated that &quot; we were establishing the moral right to interfere inside someone else &apos;s country . &quot; 
Saddam Hussein &apos;s mass murder of Iraqi citizens is why he supported the war in Iraq . 
One should always be careful about attributing motives to other people &apos;s views . 
But Kouchner himself has often said that the murder of his Russian-Jewish grandparents in Auschwitz inspired his humanitarian interventionism . 
One may or may not agree with Kouchner &apos;s policies , but his motives are surely impeccable . 
The fact that many prominent Jewish intellectuals in Europe and the United States - often , like Kouchner , with a leftist past - are sympathetic to the idea of using American armed force to further the cause of human rights and democracy in the world , may derive from the same wellspring . 
Any force is justified to avoid another Shoah , and those who shirk their duty to support such force are regarded as no better than collaborators with evil . 
If we were less haunted by memories of appeasing the Nazi regime , and of the ensuing genocide , people might not be as concerned about human rights as they are . 
And by no means do all those who work to protect the rights of others invoke the horrors of the Third Reich to justify Anglo-American armed intervention . 
But the term &quot; Islamofascism &quot; was not coined for nothing . 
It invites us to see a big part of the Islamic world as a natural extension of Nazism . 
Saddam Hussein , who was hardly an Islamist , and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is , are often described as natural successors to Adolf Hitler . 
And European weakness , not to mention the &quot; treason &quot; of its liberal scribes , paving the way to an Islamist conquest of Europe ( &quot; Eurabia &quot; ) is seen as a ghastly echo of the appeasement of the Nazi threat . 
Revolutionary Islamism is undoubtedly dangerous and bloody . 
Yet analogies with the Third Reich , although highly effective as a way to denounce people with whose views one disagrees , are usually false . 
No Islamist armies are about to march into Europe - indeed , most victims of Revolutionary Islamism live in the Middle East , not in Europe - and Ahmadinejad , his nasty rhetoric notwithstanding , does not have a fraction of Hitler &apos;s power . 
The refusal of many Muslims to integrate into Western societies , as well as high levels of unemployment and ready access to revolutionary propaganda , can easily explode in acts of violence . 
But the prospect of an &quot; Islamized &quot; Europe is also remote . 
We are not living a replay of 1938 . 
So why the high alarm about European appeasement , especially among the neo-conservatives ? 
Why the easy equation of Islamism with Nazism ? 
Israel is often mentioned as a reason . 
But Israel can mean different things to different people . 
To certain evangelical Christians , it is the holy site of the Second Coming of the Messiah . 
To many Jews , it is the one state that will always offer refuge . 
To neo-conservative ideologues , it is the democratic oasis in a desert of tyrannies . 
Defending Israel against its Islamic enemies may indeed be a factor in the existential alarmism that underlies the present &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
A nuclear-armed Iran would certainly make Israel feel more vulnerable . 
But it is probably overstated as an explanation . 
Kouchner did not advocate Western intervention in Bosnia or Kosovo because of Israel . 
If concern for Israel played a part in Paul Wolfowitz &apos;s advocacy of war in Iraq , it was probably a minor one . 
Both men were motivated by common concerns for human rights and democracy , as well as perhaps by geopolitical considerations . 
Still , Islamist rhetoric , adopted by Ahmedinejad among others , is deliberately designed to stir up memories of the Shoah . 
So perhaps the existential fear of some Western intellectuals is easier to explain than their remarkable , sometimes fawning trust in the US government to save the world by force . 
The explanation of this mysterious trust may lie elsewhere . 
Many neo-cons emerged from a leftist past , in which a belief in revolution from above was commonplace : &quot; people &apos;s democracies &quot; yesterday , &quot; liberal democracies &quot; today . 
Among Jews and other minorities , another historical memory may also play a part : the protection of the imperial state . 
Austrian and Hungarian Jews were among the most fiercely loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor , because he shielded them from the violent nationalism of the majority populations . 
Polish and Russian Jews , at least at the beginning of the communist era , were often loyal subjects of the communist state , because it promised ( falsely , as it turned out ) to protect them against the violence of anti-Semitic nationalists . 
If it were really true that the fundamental existence of our democratic Western world were about to be destroyed by an Islamist revolution , it would only make sense to seek protection in the full force of the US informal empire . 
But if one sees our current problems in less apocalyptic terms , then another kind of trahison des clercs comes into view : the blind cheering on of a sometimes foolish military power embarked on unnecessary wars that cost more lives than they were intended to save .
