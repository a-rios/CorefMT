India &apos;s Olympic Also-Rans 
NEW DELHI - As the world awaits the Beijing Olympics , many wonder whether China &apos;s grand coming-out party will also mark the occasion when it wrests dominance of the medal tally from the United States . 
China &apos;s dedicated athletes are widely assumed to have dozens of gold and silver medals in their grasp . 
Whether or not they overtake the US , however , one thing is certain : China &apos;s neighbor and regional geopolitical rival , India , will be lucky to win even a single medal . 
International sport is , of course , an exercise in national chauvinism by other means . 
At some level , we all pretend to tune into the Olympics to admire human athleticism . 
Every Indian who follows the Olympics has cringed scanning the daily list of medal winners , eyes traveling down past dozens of nations big and small before alighting on a solitary Indian bronze in tennis or wrestling . 
Worse yet , we have all known the shame of waiting day after day for India to appear on the list at all , as countries a hundredth our size record gold upon gold and Indian athletes are barely mentioned among the also-rans . 
Indians like to think we can hold our own against the best in the world in any field : our Kalidasa can stand up to their Shakespeare , our Ramanujan to their Einstein , our Bollywood to their Hollywood and , these days , our Infosys to their Microsoft . 
In sport , however , it is a different story . 
Our cricketers have come close to being considered the best in the world , but cricket is not an Olympic sport . 
Our sole world champion in any sport is the chess grandmaster Vishwanathan Anand - in another non-Olympic sport , and one that calls for brain , not brawn . 
In fact , in the Olympics , India &apos;s record has declined over time . 
The one gold medal we had become used to winning since the 1920 &quot; s , in field hockey , has proved elusive in recent Games , as our players have stumbled on Astroturf . 
This year , India &apos;s hockey players failed even to qualify for the Games . 
In everything where simple human prowess is at stake - running , jumping , swimming , lifting , throwing - Indians simply don &apos;t have what it takes . 
An Indian beauty queen , Madhu Sapre , once became an unwitting victim of Indians &quot; sense of national shame at our sporting insignificance . 
She was unjustly denied a Miss World title in 1992 because of her answer to the final-round question , &quot; What is the first thing you would do if you became the ruler of your country ? &quot; 
Her response - &quot; I would build a sports stadium &quot; - was considered stupid by the judges , and the almost-certain crown ( she was the overwhelming favorite ) slipped from her grasp . 
Sapre &apos;s answer might not have been the brightest , but if the judges had any idea of how desperate Indians are for sporting success , they would have understood that she was not expressing such an absurd priority . 
Why do Indian athletes perform so badly ? 
The explanations range from the anthropological to the borderline racist : Indians don &apos;t have the genes , the build , the stamina , the climate , whatever . 
There are structural and infrastructural explanations : lack of training facilities , gymnasiums , running tracks , equipment , financial resources . 
We are a developing country , it is said ; after all , it is not just your eye against his , your legs against hers , but what you can do against their trainer , their running shoe , their ergodynamic costume , their titanium archer &apos;s bow . 
Our talent pool isn &apos;t really a billion , some argue ; it &apos;s only the well off and middle class , maybe 300 million strong , who can afford to play sports . 
On the other hand , the incentives for success are not great ; the years of sacrifice and effort it takes to become a world-class athlete are simply not a realistic option to an Indian who needs to make a living , and sponsors are few and far between ( and they are all spending their sponsorship money on cricket ) . 
Finally , there &apos;s the usual Indian problem : sports administrative bodies and government departments are ridden with patronage and petty bossism , with officials more interested in protecting their turf ( and enjoying paid vacations to sporting events ) than in promoting athletes . 
With all these factors , failure in the Olympics , it is suggested , is encoded in our national DNA . 
Yet success or failure still depends on the individual athlete . 
Indian genes in a developing country did not prevent Vijay Singh emerging from Fiji to rival Tiger Woods as the best golfer in the world . 
The newly globalized India can no longer content itself with mediocrity in this global competition . 
For a land with world-class computer scientists , mathematicians , biotech researchers , filmmakers , and novelists , sporting excellence is the last unconquered frontier .
