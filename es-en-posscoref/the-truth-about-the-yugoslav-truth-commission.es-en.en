The Truth About the Yugoslav Truth Commission 
When dictatorships fall , how can societies heal the wounds ? 
Truth commissions are increasingly seen as the way forward . 
But when do they work best and what structures and rules make them work most effectively ? 
When are they a means to unearth the truth and restore social peace and when are they merely a clever way for politicians to avoid responsibility and a reckoning with the past ? 
Serbia is a test case for all of these issues . 
In one respect , the body appointed by President Vojislav Kostunica to examine the crimes of Yugoslavia &apos;s recent past is like South Africa &apos;s successful model : it is called a &quot; Truth and Reconciliation Commission . &quot; 
The resemblance ends there . 
South Africa &apos;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established by legislation after careful consideration by parliament and extensive discussion across the country . 
Fourteen months elapsed between the time Justice Minister Dullah Omar announced the government &apos;s intention to establish a commission and its signature into law by President Nelson Mandela . 
The mandate and the operating procedures of the Commission were clearly spelled out . 
A timetable for the Commission to report was specified . 
Measures were incorporated to ensure that the Commission would obtain the testimony of perpetrators as well as victims . 
Though the South African Cabinet decided that the hearings at which perpetrators would disclose their crimes should be closed , Parliament amended this to require that they should do so in public . 
Funds were appropriated for the Commission &apos;s operations . 
After the law was signed President Mandela appointed a committee to assist him in identifying those who should serve . 
299 names were submitted . 
The committee held public hearings and selected 25 to forward to President Mandela . 
He chose 17 , appointing Archbishop Desmond Tutu , a man widely acknowledged as South Africa &apos;s moral conscience , to chair the Commission . 
The contrast in Yugoslavia is stark . 
Yugoslavia &apos;s Commission was appointed by President Kostunica with only the vaguest of mandates , and with no procedures , no budget , no timetable , and no Chairman . 
Parliament was not involved . 
The Yugoslav President acted on his own . 
The Commission &apos;s appointment has been little noted in the Yugoslav press . 
Kostunica &apos;s off-hand way of creating the Commission signaled to the public that this is not serious . 
The recent resignations of two of the Commission &apos;s most respected members exposed the body &apos;s fundamental flaws . 
It brought into question whether a commission lacking the authority to secure testimony from victims can make any progress towards a real understanding of the crimes committed , and the roots of the wars , in neighboring Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina , and Kosovo . 
The resignations also showed that prominent Serbs have their own doubts about President Kostunica &apos;s ill-conceived approach . 
A real truth commission could play a useful role in Yugoslavia . 
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague has publicly indicted Slobodan Milosevic and a small number of other Serbs for crimes committed on a large scale . 
Like it or not , President Kostunica will probably not escape his obligation to turn them over for trial . 
He should not be misled by the certification granted to Yugoslavia by President Bush following the arrest of Milosevic on corruption charges . 
Indeed , international and domestic support for the Hague Tribunal are increasing and Milosevic , General Ratko Mladic and other indictees now sheltered by the Yugoslav government will have to face charges for the horrendous crimes committed under their leadership in the wars they started over the past decade . 
Yet a broader-ranging inquiry by a well-conceived truth commission could do much to supplement criminal trials in helping their fellow Serbs to confront their own political responsibility for those crimes . 
It is not self-evident how a Yugoslav truth commission should operate . 
Its most difficult task will be to obtain the testimony of the victims . 
Why would Croats , Bosnian Muslims and Kosovar Albanians go to Yugoslavia to talk about the crimes committed against them by the military and paramilitary forces controlled by Belgrade ? 
What incentives could be provided to induce them to testify ? 
Could the Commission obtain their testimony outside Yugoslavia ? 
If it cannot obtain the testimony of the victims , what other means could be used to document the crimes that it should consider ? 
Truth commissions in a few Latin American countries played a valuable role even though they were not able to obtain testimony from perpetrators but there is no precedent for a commission performing usefully without hearing from the victims . 
In mid-May , a public conference on truth commissions will be held in Belgrade under the sponsorship of Radio B-92 , a Belgrade station that distinguished itself by its outspokenness during the Milosevic years and continues in its independent ways . 
Some of those who played key roles in the South African Commission and in truth commissions from all over the world will attend that conference . 
President Kostunica is also slated to participate . 
He would be well advised to shelve the commission he appointed as a false start , listen to the participants in B-92 &apos;s conference and then start again .
