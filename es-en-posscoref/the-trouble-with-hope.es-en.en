The Trouble with Hope 
PARIS - America &apos;s presidential election campaign is being followed in Europe with passionate interest . 
It is seen as a long saga full of surprises . 
The human and intellectual qualities of the three remaining candidates are even viewed with some envy on this side of the Atlantic , where you can hear statements such as : &quot; Could we borrow just one of your candidates ? &quot; 
Many Europeans feel all three candidates are superb , and that , contrast to previous elections , America is suffering from an embarrassment of riches . 
But Europeans &quot; interest in this presidential election cannot mask the fact that what they expect from it is far from clear . 
Europeans may want a more &quot; normal &quot; America , closer to their own values , but they simultaneously worry that a more modest America would demand more of them in the realm of &quot; hard &quot; military power . 
America as a model or America as a protector - this &quot; European dilemma &quot; is in itself new . 
For , in the immediate aftermath of World War II , most Europeans viewed the United States as both its defender against the Soviet Union &apos;s expansionist aims and the key external actor for their deeply wounded continent &apos;s moral and economic reconstruction . 
This is no longer the case . 
The collapse of the USSR , America &apos;s self-inflicted wounds - particularly in Iraq - and the spectacular rise of Asia have changed European perceptions of the US . 
America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be , nor is it alone in terms of influence and power . 
One can even say that the European Union has slowly become a &quot; normative &quot; force in the world in reaction to the evolution of America &apos;s power . 
Europe has long known that it could never balance America in the realm of &quot; hard power &quot; ; but , with the decline of America &apos;s &quot; soft power , &quot; it became more important than ever to incarnate the &quot; humane &quot; and law-abiding face of the West . 
In this sense , Europe has come to see itself , at least in part , as an alternative dream for everyone who had stopped dreaming about America . 
But , seen from within , the EU model often appears less convincing . 
Thus , many Europeans continue to be nostalgic for America as a model . 
For these Europeans , Barack Obama , campaigning under the banner of &quot; hope , &quot; is the ideal choice to restore , as if by magic , America &apos;s soft power . 
After all , he himself incarnates the American Dream . 
But some Europeans prefer Hillary Clinton or even John McCain , because they are apprehensive about the consequences for America &apos;s European partners of a more restrained and less experienced president . 
They worry about not only competence , but also the old transatlantic issue of &quot; burden sharing . &quot; 
The implicit question behind some European reservations about Obama may be formulated in one question : &quot; Will we have to do more in Afghanistan and beyond ? &quot; 
Could the restoration of America &apos;s international reputation turn out to be bad for Europe , by eroding its new monopoly on representing Western values and calling it back to its hard power duties ? 
Could it be that a candidate of fear - McCain or , increasingly , Clinton - really serves Europe &apos;s interests better than a candidate of hope ? 
With Obama in power , it would become - at least initially - more difficult for Europeans to denounce America , even if the &quot; New France &quot; of Nicolas Sarkozy has already moved away from this easy temptation . 
But it would also be less easy to reject a call for greater burden sharing in the world . 
This &quot; defensive &quot; view of transatlantic relations is problematic . 
The best America for Europe and the world is a confident America - an America that sheds its culture of fear and rediscovers the roots of its culture of hope . 
This is Obama &apos;s America . 
Of course , the greater your expectations are , the greater the risk of disappointment . 
But , after eight years of America &apos;s self-imposed isolation under Bush , it is a risk worth taking . 
Even if America is no longer the world &apos;s only superpower , it still remains the &quot; indispensable nation . &quot; 
So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America &apos;s presidential election . 
Regardless of who wins , the consequences of the outcome will reverberate throughout the world .
