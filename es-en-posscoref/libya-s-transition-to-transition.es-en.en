Libya &apos;s Transition to Transition 
SIRTE , LIBYA - Although Libyans are now celebrating the first anniversary of the revolution that toppled Muammar el-Qaddafi , they are increasingly frustrated with their new leaders . 
Libyans complain that the interim government , known as the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) , has not moved quickly enough to purge and prosecute senior Qaddafi officials , or to rein in the militias that overthrew his regime . 
Though the NTC is dedicated to implementing Libyans &quot; demands , it lacks the technical capacity and time necessary to do so before the elections tentatively scheduled for this coming summer . 
Facing such constraints , it must concentrate on a small number of important initiatives , before turning power over to an elected government . 
Political experience has never been a prerequisite for NTC membership . 
One representative was named to the Council because he defected with his MIG fighter plane 20 years ago . 
Other members were previously political prisoners or exiled dissidents . 
Unseasoned in the art of politics , the NTC frequently lacks the foresight needed to make critical decisions . 
During last year &apos;s eight-month revolution , the NTC concentrated on overthrowing Qaddafi , gaining international recognition , and securing access to frozen Libyan assets . 
Those tasks left little room for attention to planning a post-Qaddafi Libya . 
Today , the NTC simply does not have the human resources to consolidate the transition . 
Libya has never been blessed with a professional bureaucracy like that of neighboring Egypt . 
Qaddafi frequently farmed out power to municipalities and citizens in an attempt to bypass the civil servants who consistently thwarted his grandiose plans . 
And almost two decades of international sanctions prevented a generation of Libyans from gaining the necessary technical skills by studying at Western universities . 
Even the oil sector - the lifeline of the Libyan economy , accounting for 95 % of the country &apos;s foreign-currency earnings - suffers from a shortage of professional managers . 
According to an American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks , &quot; Libyans put forward for employment with foreign ( oil ) companies often lack formal qualifications or applicable practical experience . &quot; 
Instead of injecting new blood into senior government posts during his 42 years in power , Qaddafi merely shuffled cronies between ministries . 
His last foreign-intelligence chief , Abu Zayd Dorda , epitomizes this trend . 
During his 30-year political career , Dorda held numerous cabinet portfolios , ranging from agriculture to economics to municipalities . 
Dorda later served as Speaker of Parliament , Prime Minister , and Ambassador to the United Nations . 
Today , the NTC is hard-pressed to find competent , politically untainted bureaucrats to fill its ministries . 
But that does not concern most Libyans , who are clamoring for the dismissal of Qaddafi loyalists . 
One name on the tip of many tongues here is Central Bank Governor Sadiq al-Kabir . 
Others , such as Libya &apos;s former ambassador to France , Omar Brebesh , were found dead , apparently tortured by a militia that spearheaded the campaign to overthrow Qaddafi . 
Lack of skilled civil servants is also making it difficult for the NTC to push through the changes that Libyans are demanding . 
The Council is not ready to try senior Qaddafi officials , many of whom are now in the custody of militias , because the existing justice system was never tasked with prosecuting political cases . 
Such trials were held in revolutionary courts staffed by Qaddafi zealots and operating outside the formal judiciary . 
With no prospect for a fair trial in the foreseeable future , Qaddafi officials languish in jails . 
Such bureaucratic inertia does not sit well with the many Libyans who are still undecided about the revolution . 
But it is not only a shortage of capable public servants that hamstrings the NTC . 
Just as pressing are the time constraints under which it is operating . Since its inception last February , the NTC has consistently declared itself to be a transitional body that would cede power to an elected government once the country was liberated . 
With elections set to be held no later than June 23 , the Council has less than four months to prepare Libya for its first free vote in sixty years . 
As a result , the NTC simply does not have the time necessary to implement the changes the Libyan people expect . 
It will not be able to disband the myriad militias that are destabilizing the country , because it cannot find their fighters the vocational training that it hopes will entice them to return to civilian life . 
It will fall on an elected government to carry out these reforms . 
With the NTC confronting so many dilemmas with so little time , it must concentrate on a small number of key issues that can be resolved before it hands over power . 
The Council needs to focus on establishing some degree of rule of law , and on curbing militia abuses . 
It must respect and protect individual rights in order to demonstrate to Libyans that the type of arbitrary justice that characterized the Qaddafi era will not be tolerated . 
The NTC may not be able to solve all of Libya &apos;s problems . 
But , by chipping away at the mountain of challenges that the country faces , it can ease the burdens that will confront the elected government that emerges from the popular vote in June .
