Put Up or Shut Up 
NEW YORK - In public policy , peace talks , election campaigns , or corporate strategy , laying out intentions , promises , and commitments is never enough . 
It is merely a first step toward a desired end - and entirely meaningless unless the second , third , and all subsequent necessary steps are taken . 
Moreover , taking the first step starts the clock on others &apos; trust and confidence that the next steps will in fact be taken , or else risks creating the false impression that the failure to achieve a particular goal reflects mistaken ( or irrelevant ) intentions , not inadequate execution . 
We can see examples of this virtually everywhere we look . 
Consider the European Central Bank &apos;s announcement in January that it would implement quantitative easing . 
At the time , many leaders seemed to think that the ECB &apos;s move would be enough : Announcement made , money printed , economies back on track . 
Unfortunately , that is not how monetary policy works : QE will not be enough , and no one should be naive about that . 
In order to get economies back on track , QE is a useful step , but only as part of a larger package of measures . 
In the absence of other economic reforms , QE on its own cannot effect the changes needed to kick-start growth . 
Now consider free speech . 
Following the massacre at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris last month , world leaders dashed to the scene , locked arms , and marched in support of freedom of expression as a bedrock principle of civilized societies . 
The natural next step for many of them should have been to return home and immediately implement that principle . 
True , Egypt &apos;s military regime - whose foreign minister , Sameh Shoukry , raised eyebrows when he appeared near the head of the march in Paris - released the Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste from prison , and has since freed two other journalists , Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed , on bail . 
In another arena , peace negotiations , the recent ceasefire agreement in Ukraine is but the latest attempt to end the war between the country &apos;s government and Russian-backed separatists that has been raging for much of the past year in the eastern Donbas region . 
Throughout the fighting , attempts to stop the killing have come and gone , and the war &apos;s innocent victims - not to mention much of the international community - have grown weary and cynical . 
The most effective peace agreements are part and parcel of a peace process . 
The first step - signing the agreement - represents the parties &apos; commitment to take the necessary subsequent steps . 
Everyone walks away knowing exactly what they are supposed to do , what to expect others to do , and what the consequences will be if they do not . 
When agreements fail , it is usually not because of what they contain , but because of what is missing , or because of what the signatories do despite what they have agreed . 
A roadmap to peace is useful only if everyone follows it . 
Otherwise , the goal is lost . 
Election campaigns are the example par excellence of the phenomenon , and the world is now entering another &quot; Season of the First Step . &quot; 
At least seven general elections will be held in European Union member countries this year ( and France will hold regional elections in March ) . 
Greece has already voted ( electing a government that so far seems unable to move beyond intentions and commitments ) , and the coming months will bring elections in Estonia , Finland , the United Kingdom , Denmark , Portugal , Poland , and Spain . 
Add to this the US presidential election next year - preceded by a campaign that has already started - and we can expect a lot of promises floating around . 
As voters in these countries are inundated with good intentions , ringing assurances , and solemn commitments , they will expect parties and candidates to follow through if they are elected . 
Certainly , parties and candidates attempt to persuade voters on the basis of their track records ( and by impugning their opponents &apos; track records ) . 
If they do not follow through on their intentions , promises , and commitments , access to information and instant communication is such that empty promises simply will no longer persuade most people . 
Companies campaign , too . 
They send their leaders before law-making bodies to express contrition for grave malfeasance and promise future good behavior . 
Unfortunately , too many corporate leaders persist in viewing the world as &quot; us &quot; versus &quot; them , &quot; rather than attempting to understand why , in the absence of vigorous action , no one trusts them . 
Beginnings are vital ; but they are just that . 
There is no easy solution for the eurozone economy , for Greece , for Ukraine , or for any of the other major challenges we face today .
