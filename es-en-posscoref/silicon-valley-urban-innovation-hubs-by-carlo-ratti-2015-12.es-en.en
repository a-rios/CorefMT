Silicon Valley Everywhere 
CAMBRIDGE - During the last decades of the twentieth century , Silicon Valley was the unparalleled epicenter of high-tech innovation . 
Other regions tried to imitate its success , but none succeeded . 
France &apos;s Sophia Antipolis , a top-down attempt by the government to create an innovation hub near Cannes , never evolved beyond its origins as a relatively tranquil technology park - notwithstanding its mythological name , California-like weather , and the surrounding area &apos;s unbeatable gastronomy . 
In the twenty-first century , however , Silicon Valley &apos;s competition has gotten fiercer - as reflected by the increasing number of locations affixing the chemical element to their names : Silicon Alley ( New York ) , Silicon Wadi ( Tel Aviv ) , Silicon Sentier ( Paris ) , etc . 
In London , for example , the emergence of Silicon Roundabout in the late 2000s caught the British government almost by surprise . 
Now rebranded Tech City , the innovation hub in the old Shoreditch neighborhood has evolved into one of London &apos;s key economic engines and talent magnets . 
Similar scripts are playing out around the world . 
In Berlin , a new startup is said to be founded every 20 minutes . Paris is busy building what will be Europe &apos;s largest incubator at Halle Freyssinet . 
And in Tel Aviv , the phrase &quot; Startup Nation &quot; has gone from a political slogan to economic reality . 
For the first time , &quot; unicorns &quot; ( startups that reach a valuation of more than $ 1 billion ) are no longer the exclusive preserve of the United States - a reality that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago . 
A bright generation of global youth - from Mumbai to Prague to Kenya to Singapore - is betting on innovation , and American venture capital funds , sustained by access to cheap financing , are sating their investment appetites overseas . 
There are several factors behind this phenomenon . 
In a globalized world , capital flows have accelerated and extended their reach . 
Innovators around the world are able to muster support from traditional venture capitalists or from crowd-funding platforms such as Kickstarter . 
Ideas move even faster - propelled , sustained , and strengthened by the Internet . 
Meanwhile , the Great Recession that followed the 2008 global financial crisis has disrupted traditional industries , while creating a large surplus of creative talent and affordable workspaces . 
As a highly mobile , well educated , risk-taking workforce converges on urban hubs , the excitement of city life , coupled with the availability of co-working spaces and a variety of supporting mechanisms , helps to sustain innovative momentum . 
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg provided what is perhaps the pithiest summary of the attraction of urban life . 
Speaking at Stanford University &apos;s 2013 commencement , he quipped , &quot; I believe that more and more Stanford graduates will find themselves moving to Silicon Alley , not only because we &apos;re the hottest new tech scene in the country , but also because there &apos;s more to do on a Friday night than go to the Pizza Hut in Sunnyvale . 
Bloomberg is generally credited as one of the major forces behind Silicon Alley . 
During his tenure in office , he funded early-stage technology companies , hired the city &apos;s first chief digital officer , and launched a new university to develop high-tech talent . 
Similar policies are now being implemented in many urban areas , in order to attract a critical mass of creative , technologically savvy people . 
Cities , as a recent World Economic Forum report highlights , are rapidly becoming not just drivers of innovation , but also testing grounds for new technologies , such as reprogrammable space , self-driving mobility , urban farming , and intelligent street lighting . 
Meanwhile , vehicle-hailing apps like Uber and apartment-sharing platforms like Airbnb are demonstrating how cities have become some of the most fertile environments for technological development . 
That is yet another reason why many new startups are putting down roots in urban centers . 
Most likely , this proliferation of innovation is just the beginning . 
As the Internet continues its penetration of all aspects of our lives , we are entering what the computer scientist Mark Weiser has called the era of &quot; ubiquitous computing &quot; - a time when technology is so prevalent that it &quot; recedes into the background of our lives . &quot; 
Before long , the digital world and the physical world will be indistinguishable . 
The era of &quot; Silicon Everywhere &quot; is upon us - and it is taking shape in the world &apos;s cities .
