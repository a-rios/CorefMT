The Asian Sleepwalkers 
SEOUL - Whether East Asia &apos;s politicians and pundits like it or not , the region &apos;s current international relations are more akin to nineteenth-century European balance-of-power politics than to the stable Europe of today . 
Witness East Asia &apos;s rising nationalism , territorial disputes , and lack of effective institutional mechanisms for security cooperation . 
While economic interdependence among China , Japan , South Korea , and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations continues to deepen , their diplomatic relations are as burdened by rivalry and mistrust as relations among European countries were in the decades prior to World War I. 
One common characteristic , then and now , is a power shift . 
Back then , Great Britain &apos;s relative power was in decline , while Germany &apos;s had been rising since German unification in 1871 . 
Similarly , at least in terms of economic , if not military , capability , the United States and Japan seem to have begun a process of decline relative to China . 
Of course , this process is not irreversible : Effective political leadership and successful domestic reforms in the US and Japan , together with China &apos;s failure to manage political pressure from below , could yet halt this seemingly inexorable power shift . 
Major power shifts define eras in which key political leaders are likely to make serious foreign-policy mistakes . 
Indeed , poor management of international relations at such critical junctures has often led to major wars . 
Rising powers tend to demand a greater role in international politics , declining powers tend to be reluctant to adjust , and key policymakers are likely to misunderstand the intentions of other countries &quot; leaders and overreact to their actions . 
Historically , rising powers tend to become too confident too soon , leading them to behave imprudently , which frightens their neighbors . 
For example , Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Otto von Bismarck as chancellor in 1890 , less than 20 years after the formation of the Second Reich , and began to destroy Bismarck &apos;s carefully crafted alliance network . 
His rough diplomacy frightened France , Britain , and Russia , making it easier for them to unite against Germany . 
China &apos;s new diplomatic assertiveness in 2010 - closely following the eruption of the worst financial crisis since the 1930 &quot; s - recalled that of Wilhelmine Germany . 
In both cases , insecurity resulted not from an external threat , but from top policymakers &quot; own actions . 
In late 2010 , I was relieved - somewhat - when a key Chinese leader , State Councilor Dai Bingguo , announced that China would adhere to the path of peaceful development . 
But the rhetoric of some Chinese , particularly in the military , concerning the South China Sea and other disputed Chinese sovereignty claims suggests that not everyone in the country &apos;s leadership is committed wholeheartedly to such a path . 
The extent to which policymaking by the country &apos;s new leader , Xi Jinping , takes into account the insecurity felt by China &apos;s neighbors - and abandons a quest for absolute security for China - will be one of the key variables influencing East Asia &apos;s security environment in the years ahead . 
America &apos;s foreign policy will be another key factor . 
If the US pursues a predominantly confrontational approach , East Asian politics will inevitably become polarized , just as multipolar nineteenth-century Europe gave way to an increasingly bipolar order in lockstep with rising tensions between Germany and Britain . 
America &apos;s so-called &quot; pivot to Asia &quot; might have been necessary from its point of view , given the concerns of its Asian allies about China . 
But , unless the US wants a Cold War-style confrontation in Asia , it must try harder to engage China in shaping a viable regional security structure . 
A confrontational US approach toward China , moreover , would imply an additional destabilizing factor : Japan might become much bolder than necessary in its foreign policy . 
After Wilhelm II stopped engaging Russia in the 1890 &quot; s , bilateral relations worsened , which provided his ally , Austria , diplomatic carte blanche in dealing with Serbia - and , more important , Serbia &apos;s Russian patron . 
Thus , Wilhelm unintentionally contributed to the outbreak of war in 1914 . 
There are already some worrying signs of a Japanese miscalculation . 
Japan &apos;s new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , reportedly said that he is considering renouncing the Kono Statement of 1993 , which acknowledged that the Japanese military had raped and enslaved Asian and European women during World War II . 
If Abe does so , Japan &apos;s relations with South Korea and China will suffer serious damage . 
That is in no one &apos;s interest , including Japan &apos;s , given that the Japanese share many security concerns with South Korea . 
So US diplomacy will need to be dexterous . 
It must ease Japan &apos;s sense of insecurity in the wake of China &apos;s rise , while persuading Japan &apos;s new leaders to behave prudently and refrain from excessively nationalist behavior . 
Frankly , with two decades of economic stagnation already behind it , Japan has more important matters to pursue . 
In contrast to its multilateral efforts in Europe , the US created a hub-and-spoke security framework - formed by US-centered bilateral alliances - in Asia following WWII . 
One result is that no direct channel for security cooperation among Asian countries was ever established , which has contributed to the low level of trust in East Asia , even among close US allies like Japan and South Korea . 
And it is precisely here that South Korea , a medium-sized ally of the US , will be in a better position than Northeast Asia &apos;s bigger powers to act as a facilitator . 
There is much to learn from the diplomatic failures that led to WWI . 
A new history , by Christopher Clark , of the diplomatic prelude to that war is called , fittingly , The Sleepwalkers . 
The question for the US and East Asia &apos;s leaders today is whether they will wake up and develop effective multilateral mechanisms for security cooperation before doing themselves serious harm .
