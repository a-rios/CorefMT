Europe &apos;s Attack on Greek Democracy 
NEW YORK - The rising crescendo of bickering and acrimony within Europe might seem to outsiders to be the inevitable result of the bitter endgame playing out between Greece and its creditors . 
In fact , European leaders are finally beginning to reveal the true nature of the ongoing debt dispute , and the answer is not pleasant : it is about power and democracy much more than money and economics . 
Of course , the economics behind the program that the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) foisted on Greece five years ago has been abysmal , resulting in a 25 % decline in the country &apos;s GDP . 
I can think of no depression , ever , that has been so deliberate and had such catastrophic consequences : Greece &apos;s rate of youth unemployment , for example , now exceeds 60 % . 
It is startling that the troika has refused to accept responsibility for any of this or admit how bad its forecasts and models have been . 
But what is even more surprising is that Europe &apos;s leaders have not even learned . 
The troika is still demanding that Greece achieve a primary budget surplus ( excluding interest payments ) of 3.5 % of GDP by 2018 . 
Economists around the world have condemned that target as punitive , because aiming for it will inevitably result in a deeper downturn . 
Indeed , even if Greece &apos;s debt is restructured beyond anything imaginable , the country will remain in depression if voters there commit to the troika &apos;s target in the snap referendum to be held this weekend . 
In terms of transforming a large primary deficit into a surplus , few countries have accomplished anything like what the Greeks have achieved in the last five years . 
And , though the cost in terms of human suffering has been extremely high , the Greek government &apos;s recent proposals went a long way toward meeting its creditors &quot; demands . 
We should be clear : almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to Greece has actually gone there . 
It has gone to pay out private-sector creditors - including German and French banks . 
Greece has gotten but a pittance , but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries &quot; banking systems . 
The IMF and the other &quot; official &quot; creditors do not need the money that is being demanded . 
Under a business-as-usual scenario , the money received would most likely just be lent out again to Greece . 
But , again , it &apos;s not about the money . 
It &apos;s about using &quot; deadlines &quot; to force Greece to knuckle under , and to accept the unacceptable - not only austerity measures , but other regressive and punitive policies . 
But why would Europe do this ? 
Why are European Union leaders resisting the referendum and refusing even to extend by a few days the June 30 deadline for Greece &apos;s next payment to the IMF ? 
Isn &apos;t Europe all about democracy ? 
In January , Greece &apos;s citizens voted for a government committed to ending austerity . 
If the government were simply fulfilling its campaign promises , it would already have rejected the proposal . 
But it wanted to give Greeks a chance to weigh in on this issue , so critical for their country &apos;s future wellbeing . 
That concern for popular legitimacy is incompatible with the politics of the eurozone , which was never a very democratic project . 
Most of its members &quot; governments did not seek their people &apos;s approval to turn over their monetary sovereignty to the ECB . 
When Sweden &apos;s did , Swedes said no . 
They understood that unemployment would rise if the country &apos;s monetary policy were set by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation ( and also that there would be insufficient attention to financial stability ) . 
The economy would suffer , because the economic model underlying the eurozone was predicated on power relationships that disadvantaged workers . 
And , sure enough , what we are seeing now , 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized those relationships , is the antithesis of democracy : Many European leaders want to see the end of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras &apos;s leftist government . 
After all , it is extremely inconvenient to have in Greece a government that is so opposed to the types of policies that have done so much to increase inequality in so many advanced countries , and that is so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth . 
They seem to believe that they can eventually bring down the Greek government by bullying it into accepting an agreement that contravenes its mandate . 
It is hard to advise Greeks how to vote on July 5 . 
A yes vote would mean depression almost without end . 
Perhaps a depleted country - one that has sold off all of its assets , and whose bright young people have emigrated - might finally get debt forgiveness ; perhaps , having shriveled into a middle-income economy , Greece might finally be able to get assistance from the World Bank . 
All of this might happen in the next decade , or perhaps in the decade after that . 
By contrast , a no vote would at least open the possibility that Greece , with its strong democratic tradition , might grasp its destiny in its own hands . 
Greeks might gain the opportunity to shape a future that , though perhaps not as prosperous as the past , is far more hopeful than the unconscionable torture of the present . 
I know how I would vote .
