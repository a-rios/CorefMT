The American World Turned Upside Down 
PARIS - From Washington , the enthusiasm of the French for intervention in Libya is seen with a mixture of relief and puzzlement . 
The Americans do not want the job and are happy that someone else does . 
Indeed , President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s willingness to intervene ( alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron ) helped close a dangerous gap between the world of &quot; values , &quot; which would call for direct American intervention against Muammar el-Qaddafi , and the world of &quot; interest , &quot; which impelled President Barack Obama to restraint . 
America &apos;s strategy seems to be to squeeze Qaddafi &apos;s regime out of power through a combination of financial , economic , and even &quot; psychological &quot; pressure aimed at isolating the Colonel from his sources of support within his own inner circle . 
That is a wise approach , one that may ultimately work . 
While Americans are relieved by France &apos;s display of determination , they cannot refrain from expressing a sense of bemusement : Do the French really know what they are up against ? 
What has happened to them ? 
We know what war means , but they seem to have forgotten ! 
Indeed , France and the United States seem to have switched roles from just a few years ago . 
Listening to Obama &apos;s reflexive and distant speeches on Libya , one can nearly hear French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin &apos;s flamboyant intervention at the United Nations on the eve of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . 
And , though the circumstances and the &quot; legal &quot; environment are very different - there is a UN resolution for the Libya intervention , and a vague declaration of support by the Arab League - Sarkozy &apos;s stance reminds some of George W. Bush &apos;s enthusiasm for war . 
The British , too , seem to be regarding the French with some perplexity . 
Even though they are fighting side-by-side in Libya , with their armies expressing a deep confidence in each other , there are distinct nuances in each country &apos;s position on military intervention . 
The view from London contains the same element of &quot; distance &quot; - if not slight apprehension - found in the view from Washington . 
To explain this difference in perspective , perhaps one should venture further into the past than the Iraq War and consider the divergence that already existed traditionally between the United Kingdom &apos;s pragmatic approach to its imperial role and the French Empire &apos;s missionary zeal . 
A duty to accumulate wealth catalyzed the former ; a duty to civilize inspired the latter . 
The spectacular inversion of the French and US roles on the issue of intervention has different causes . 
Some are linked to the personalities of Obama and Sarkozy ; others reflect the nature of their political imperatives . 
Obama &apos;s priority is not to be dragged into another conflict . 
Afghanistan is already such a costly quagmire . 
Sarkozy &apos;s goal is to &quot; exist &quot; as much as possible on the global stage . 
But , beyond personalities and political calculus , what we are witnessing is a fundamental shift in the international system . 
At the crossroads of this question stands NATO , an organization perceived as American by Europeans and international ( i.e. , not American ) by the average US citizen . 
It is this specific &quot; marriage of reason &quot; between France and the UN that is essential to understanding the French position on Libya . 
Indeed , the same relationship between France and the UN that led to the country &apos;s resistance to intervention in Iraq in 2003 has now pushed France to intervene in Libya in 2011 . 
Yet it is dangerous to believe that the world has found in this new-model Coalition of the Willing the solution that it was seeking in today &apos;s increasingly chaotic post-American order . 
Neither France nor Britain - not to mention the European Union , which is more divided than ever when it comes to military interventions - can be seen as substitutes for the US . 
Despite Sarkozy &apos;s exceptional activism , they have neither the means nor , in reality , the will . 
Confronted with the world &apos;s increasing complexity and America &apos;s decreasing appetite for international responsibilities , the need for adequate rules - and for a referee to enforce them - is greater than ever . 
In the face of growing risks of global anarchy , the courageous but risky activism of France and Britain should not be seen as a substitute for an engaged US . 
But does such an engaged America still exist ? 
The answer is probably no .
