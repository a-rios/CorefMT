Stay the Course in North Korea 
NEW YORK - Barack Obama &apos;s election was historic on many levels . 
Between now and his inauguration on January 20 , he will need to hone his policies . 
Much of the early focus of the Obama administration will undoubtedly be on the economy and the war in Iraq . 
But it is critically important that the new administration pay serious attention to other foreign-policy issues right from the start . 
American relations with North Korea , and the ongoing six-party talks , certainly belong at the top of the list . 
Here , the United States must not only stay the course , but also build on the efforts of the last few years . 
The risks of changing course cannot be overstated . 
Not long after President George W. Bush came into office , his administration took a hard-line stance against the North Korean regime , calling for a review of the Clinton administration &apos;s policy , and eventually tagging North Korea as a member of the &quot; axis of evil . &quot; 
While North Korea had done much over the preceding years to warrant a more critical eye , in retrospect these policies set back prospects for peace and stability in the region . 
After all , North Korea &apos;s reaction to the Bush administration &apos;s policies was to drop out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , restart its nuclear program , and further develop its weapons production . 
Indeed , it is believed that North Korea during this time increased its stockpile of nuclear weapons . 
Moreover , while there is plenty of blame to go around on all sides , America &apos;s change of policy stalled for years the potential for progress in relations between the six parties . 
It is only more recently , under the watch of US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill , that the Bush administration &apos;s policy toward North Korea has become more pragmatic . 
After North Korea threatened to restart its nuclear facility at Yongbyon , the Bush administration in early October removed the country from its terrorism blacklist . 
In exchange , North Korea promised to allow access to its facilities for inspections , while also dropping its opposition to Japanese and South Korean participation in inspections . 
At this point , the road forward is fraught with peril and uncertainty . 
As a presidential candidate , Obama spoke of the need for &quot; sustained , direct , and aggressive diplomacy &quot; to deal with North Korea . 
At the same time , Obama &apos;s advocacy of direct diplomacy caused concern during the campaign , with some questioning whether this meant that he would meet a leader such as Kim Jong-il without preconditions . 
While it is difficult to predict how far he might move in this direction , it would be politically difficult for Obama to meet the North Korean leader in such a manner , something that he is likely to learn early in his presidency . 
The on-again , off-again talks on North Korea can fluster even the most experienced of negotiators . 
That being the case , Obama needs to build a strong team of experienced Korea hands to push the agenda forward . 
While trying to build on the limited progress of recent years , they will have to confront a number of additional obstacles in building a cohesive and sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula . 
North Korea &apos;s leader , Kim Jong-il , is reportedly ill . 
What this means for continuing the negotiations remains to be seen . 
Relations between North and South Korea have taken a turn for the worse this year , following the election of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak , who has taken a more hard-line approach toward the North . 
And then there is Japan , a member of the six-party talks and a steadfast US ally , which was angered by the recent delisting of North Korea , because the North has yet to satisfy fully Japanese inquiries into the abduction of its citizens by North Korean agents decades ago . 
These are just a few of the issues that will complicate US relations with North Korea and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . 
But America must stay the course . 
As Obama &apos;s new administration takes over , the choice is between making some progress , as has occurred in recent years , and facing a nuclear North Korea . 
The choice is now Obama &apos;s . 
The future of peace and stability in Northeast Asia hangs in the balance .
