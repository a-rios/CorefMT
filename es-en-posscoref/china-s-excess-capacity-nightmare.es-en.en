China &apos;s Excess-Capacity Nightmare 
SHANGHAI - Back in 1958 , the year of China &apos;s ill-fated &quot; Great Leap Forward , &quot; Chairman Mao had big plans for the steel industry . 
While production had been just over five million tons in 1957 , he expected the country to catch up with or even surpass the United States by 1962 , producing 80-100 million tons per year , and to reach 700 million tons per year by the mid-1970 &quot; s , making China the undisputed world leader . 
All this was to be accomplished using small &quot; backyard steel furnaces &quot; operated by ordinary people with no particular technical expertise . 
Today , Mao &apos;s dream of catching up with the rest of the world has been realized , albeit a bit behind schedule , not only in steel making , where annual capacity has reached 660 million tons , but in many other sectors as well . 
In 2008 , China ranked first in steel ( about half of world production ) , cement ( also about half ) , aluminum ( about 40 % ) , and glass ( 31 % ) , to take just a few examples . 
The country topped the US in auto production in 2009 , and remains second only to South Korea in shipbuilding , with 36 % of global capacity . 
For Beijing &apos;s central planners , however , the size of China &apos;s industrial base has become a cause for alarm rather than celebration . 
In a document approved by the State Council on September 26 , the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) warned of serious excess capacity in a wide variety of sectors . 
( The State Council , which includes the premier , vice premiers , and heads of ministries and commissions , is China &apos;s highest executive authority . ) 
Based on the NDRC &apos;s figures , 2008 capacity utilization rates were just 76 % for steel , 75 % for cement , 73 % for aluminum , 88 % for flat glass , 40 % for methanol , and 20 % for poly-crystalline silicon ( a key raw material for solar cells ) . 
The current project pipeline also implies less than 50 % utilization for wind-power equipment manufacturers in 2010 . 
Excess capacity has been a priority for the State Council since 2005 , when it issued industry-by-industry restrictions on new projects and targets for shutting down inefficient production . 
Since that time , however , the situation has in many cases only gotten worse . 
The problem is that much of the so-called &quot; blind &quot; and &quot; redundant &quot; investment that Beijing would like to eliminate has the strong support of local governments , whose primary concern is with generating GDP growth in their jurisdictions , regardless of whether the means of achieving it make any economic sense . 
Consider cement production , where , according to the China Cement Association , 38 % of capacity consists of &quot; shaft &quot; kilns . 
These have been obsolete in most of the rest of the world for over a century , and accounted for less than 3 % of production even in 1957 , when most of China &apos;s cement plants were imports from Eastern Europe . 
Nowadays , however , shaft kilns are a favorite of local governments because they can be built cheaply and quickly and generate growth and employment . 
Achieving economies of scale and lessening environmental impacts simply are not priorities . A similar situation exists in the steel industry , where the central government has made repeated unsuccessful attempts to close small furnaces . 
In 2006 , for example , the NDRC produced a list of plants that were required to cease operations by the end of the following year . 
As the deadline approached in December 2007 , a correspondent from Mysteel , a leading local source of information on the sector , visited a number of these mills to see first-hand how they were progressing with the government-mandated dismantling of their equipment . 
What he found was a great example of how any such program is likely to work in practice . 
One site was still operating 24 hours a day ; in others production had been temporarily halted until the deadline passed . 
In only a very few cases had any machinery actually been removed . 
Local officials and managers had a variety of reasons for not complying with the NDRC &apos;s order . Some expected to expand their plants so that they would no longer be counted as inefficient - a stratagem explicitly prohibited by the regulations . 
Where facilities were privately owned , it was felt , perhaps not unreasonably , that removing assets would violate China &apos;s property-rights law . 
One formerly state-run enterprise was being operated under a 2001 lease specifying that no workers could be laid off for the next ten years . 
And there were also jurisdictions that had canceled the licenses of the operators in question , so that , as one regulator put it , they simply &quot; didn &apos;t exist . &quot; 
China &quot; s excess-capacity problem reveals a serious defect in its &quot; socialist market economy . &quot; 
In many industries , neither market forces nor central planning are strong enough to bring about the &quot; creative destruction &quot; of inefficient producers . 
As a result , the dream of catching up with the developed countries has to a surprising extent been realized much as Mao imagined - by lower-level cadres using small-scale technology . 
If simply leading the world in output is the goal , the Chairman &apos;s vision has been resoundingly vindicated . 
But if product quality , environmental protection , and economic efficiency are important as well , this state of affairs is little short of nightmarish .
