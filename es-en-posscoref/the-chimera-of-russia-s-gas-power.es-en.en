The Chimera of Russia &apos;s Gas Power 
Russia began 2006 by cutting off natural gas exports to Ukraine after its government refused to pay a fourfold increase in the subsidized price . 
The crisis in Ukraine , many of whose Soviet-era industries depend on cheap Russian gas , soon spread to Europe , which consumes 80 % of Russian gas exports , when Ukraine began to divert gas from the pipeline that crosses its territory . 
Ironically , 2006 is also the year that Russia takes over the chair of the Group of Eight industrialized countries , which is set to meet in Moscow this spring . 
The improbable theme that Russian President Vladimir Putin chose for the conference is energy security . 
Even though it is no longer a global superpower , Russia &apos;s vast oil and gas reserves make it an energy superpower , and Putin seems intent on playing that card . 
Oil provides somewhat less economic power than gas because it is a fungible commodity , and interruptions of supply can be made up by purchases on world markets . 
But gas is expensive to transport , for it depends on costly pipelines or gas liquefaction facilities that cannot be replaced quickly when flows are interrupted . 
Gas provides a tempting form of leverage , and Russia had already used it against Georgia , Latvia , Lithuania , and Moldova . 
But when Gazprom , the Russian state gas monopoly , followed Putin &apos;s instructions to turn off the spigot to Ukraine , Russia crossed a new threshold . 
At first glance , this looks like a classic case of a large country bullying a small country into submission . 
As Thucydides put it in his history of the Peloponnesian War , &quot; The strong do as they will and the weak suffer what they must . &quot; 
Russia had supported the losing side in Ukraine &apos;s &quot; Orange Revolution &quot; a year ago , and it was time for payback . 
But , as it turned out , Putin miscalculed . 
He underestimated both Ukraine &apos;s leverage as the primary conduit for Russian gas exports to Europe and Europe &apos;s influence as the major consumer of Russian gas . 
In the process , he damaged Russia &apos;s reputation as a reliable supplier of natural gas . 
The result was a hastily patched together deal in which Russia and Ukraine each gave ground on price , and a shadowy Swiss-based company half-owned by Gazprom rolled supplies of cheap gas from Turkmenistan into the equation . 
Some analysts , as well as former Ukrainian prime minister Yuliya Tymoshenko , raised accusations of corruption against the company , RosUkrEnergo . 
But , charges of corruption aside , this outcome indicates that gas is not such an easy source of hard economic power as it would first appear . 
Some economists argue that there is little power in relationships where buyers and sellers consent to a price that clears a market . 
However , in cases where buyers and sellers are not equally dependent upon the relationship , the greater vulnerability of the more dependent party can be used as a source of coercive power by the less dependent party . 
Russia thought it was less dependent than Ukraine , and decided to exercise that power . 
But it is one thing to hold the high hand in a game that you play only once . 
In other words , the shadow of the future suggests that a moderate strategy is best . 
Russia quickly discovered that its threats against Ukraine were too costly to its reputation as a reliable supplier for Europe . 
When considered in this wider European context , there was more symmetry in the Russia-Ukraine energy relationship than the simple numbers on energy dependence implied at first glance . 
Where does this leave Europe &apos;s energy security ? 
Germany &apos;s Economics Minister , Michael Glos , has said that Russia &apos;s questionable dependability means that the time has come to explore other energy sources . 
That will not be easy . 
Gas provides nearly a quarter of Europe &apos;s energy , compared to 14 % for nuclear power . 
Even if governments rethink their ban on new nuclear plants , accelerate development of windmills and solar panels , and search for new gas supplies , Europe will remain dependent on Russian gas for more than a decade . 
At the same time , as Europe &apos;s largest consumer of Russian gas , Germany has built its hopes for energy security on developing a rich web of economic ties with Russia . 
Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder even became chair of a Russian-German consortium to build a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany . 
But , as the Ukraine episode indicates , pipelines dedicated to a single country may be less reliable than those that run through several countries . 
If Russia is going to throw its weight around , it is better to have allies among those affected . 
The key to energy security is diversity - of pipelines as well as sources of supply . 
Small neighbors without options will suffer , but Europe may not . 
In the end , the next decade will be marked by a delicate balance in which Europe remains dependent on Russian gas , but Russia &apos;s need for export revenues will also make it dependent on Europe . 
The lesson from the Ukraine episode is that while Russia is less of a gas superpower than it would appear , Europe would be wise for to start building greater diversity into the energy relationship .
