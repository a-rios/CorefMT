Fishy Conservation Efforts 
NAIROBI - If you happen to be a salamander known as the Iranian Kaiser spotted newt , chances are that things may be looking up . 
Governments at the recent meeting in Doha of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) voted for a trade ban on Iranian Kaisers , alongside tougher protection for a host of land-living creatures . 
But if you are a blue-fin tuna of the western Atlantic stock , your mood will be decidedly more pessimistic . 
It is a similar story for several species of shark , including the oceanic white-tip , scalloped hammerhead , and the great and spiny dogfish . 
Despite strong scientific evidence showing sharp declines in the populations of all three , every proposal for tougher trade controls on these marine species - along with more than 30 species of coral - failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority . 
In the case of the western Atlantic stock of blue-fin tuna , several countries argued that the existing management body - the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ) - is best placed to manage the stock . 
Others who proposed tougher trade rules were not convinced - and with good reason . 
Stocks of this highly prized fish have declined by up to 80 % since the dawn of industrialized fishing , and this has been on ICCAT &apos;s watch . 
In the case of sharks and rays , a recent survey indicates that close to one-third of the 64 ocean-living species are on the verge of extinction . 
Their decline is linked to over-exploitation of other once-common species . 
For example , spiny dogfish is partly substituting for cod in many European fish-and-chip shops . 
Sharks , too , are suffering from rapidly rising demand for shark-fin soup , which is considered a delicacy in many parts of Asia . 
But saving endangered and near-endangered species is not just about conservation ; it is also about defending millions of people &apos;s livelihoods , which depend on healthy oceans . 
Today &apos;s marine environment is truly under siege . 
When the explorer John Cabot sailed off the coast of Newfoundland more than 500 years ago , vast shoals of cod slowed down his ships ; crews could lower buckets over the side and fill them with fish . 
By 1992 , however , over-fishing had forced the total closure of this once highly productive fishery , and , despite all efforts , Newfoundland &apos;s Grand Banks has never recovered . 
Similarly , over-fishing of sharks in the Caribbean has triggered a rise in octopus and a drastic drop in spiny lobsters and scallops - two major sources of revenue for neighboring coastal communities . 
The outcome at CITES has brought into sharp relief increasing tensions between industrial and environmental interests , as if these were diametrically opposed . 
Surely a twenty-first-century fisherman does not want to see the basis of his or her living degraded and destroyed , nor does a modern conservationist want to ring-fence the environment and stop people from making a living . 
So if governments want existing agreements to rule the waves , they must start acting on the sobering science and real-world numbers . 
For example , with respect to sharks , existing sanctions against &quot; finning &quot; under Regional Fisheries Management Organizations should be enforced , backed up by an independent system of on-board observers to ensure that trawlers comply . 
Moreover , an international action plan for sharks , including a ceiling on catches , should be created . 
And proper fishing methods that catch only target species should be used , with others caught accidentally as so-called by-catch returned to the sea alive . 
Where fisheries agreements are not succeeding , conservation agreements must be tried and applied . 
After all , these are not competing regulatory regimes , but complimentary ones . 
In the case of the western Atlantic blue-fin tuna , the ball is now firmly back in ICCAT &apos;s court . 
Governments that support the ICCAT option must now prove that it is up to the job . 
They have three years to do so , before CITES next meets in Thailand . 
If there is no dramatic action and improvement , governments should instead give CITES , as a well established conservation and trade agreement , a chance to reverse the species &quot; current plight . 
Blue-fin tuna is heading for commercial , if not outright , extinction , as are a host of other economically and ecologically important marine species . 
They are swimming in the last-chance lagoon .
