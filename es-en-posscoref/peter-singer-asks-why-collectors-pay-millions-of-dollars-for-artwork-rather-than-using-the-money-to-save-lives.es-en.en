The Ethical Cost of High-Price Art 
MELBOURNE - In New York last month , Christie &apos;s sold $ 745 million worth of postwar and contemporary art , the highest total that it has ever reached in a single auction . 
Among the higher-priced works sold were paintings by Barnett Newman , Francis Bacon , Mark Rothko , and Andy Warhol , each of which sold for more than $ 60 million . 
According to the New York Times , Asian collectors played a significant part in boosting prices . 
No doubt some buyers regard their purchases as an investment , like stocks or real estate or gold bars . 
In that case , whether the price they paid was excessive or modest will depend on how much the market will be willing to pay for the work at some future date . 
But if profit is not the motive , why would anyone want to pay tens of millions of dollars for works like these ? 
They are not beautiful , nor do they display great artistic skill . 
They are not even unusual within the artists &quot; oeuvres . 
Do an image search for &quot; Barnett Newman &quot; and you will see many paintings with vertical color bars , usually divided by a thin line . 
Once Newman had an idea , it seems , he liked to work out all of the variations . 
Last month , someone bought one of those variations for $ 84 million . 
A small image of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol - there are many of those , too - sold for $ 41 million . 
Ten years ago , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York paid $ 45 million for a small Madonna and Child by Duccio . 
Subsequently , in The Life You Can Save , I wrote that there were better things that the donors who financed the purchase could have done with their money . 
I haven &apos;t changed my mind about that , but the Met &apos;s Madonna is beautifully executed and 700 years old . 
Duccio is a major figure who worked during a key transitional moment in the history of Western art , and few of his paintings have survived . 
None of that applies to Newman or Warhol . 
Perhaps , though , the importance of postwar art lies in its ability to challenge our ideas . 
That view was firmly expressed by Jeff Koons , one of the artists whose work was on sale at Christie &apos;s . 
In a 1987 interview with a group of art critics , Koons referred to the work that was sold last month , calling it &quot; the &quot; Jim Beam &quot; work . &quot; 
Koons had exhibited this piece - an oversize , stainless steel toy train filled with bourbon - in an exhibition called &quot; Luxury and Degradation , &quot; that , according to the New York Times , examined &quot; shallowness , excess and the dangers of luxury in the high-flying 1980s . &quot; 
In the interview , Koons said that the Jim Beam work &quot; used the metaphors of luxury to define class structure . &quot; 
The critic Helena Kontova then asked him how his &quot; socio-political intention &quot; related to the politics of then-President Ronald Reagan . 
Koons answered : &quot; With Reaganism , social mobility is collapsing , and instead of a structure composed of low , middle , and high income levels , we &apos;re down to low and high only ... 
My work stands in opposition to this trend . &quot; 
Art as a critique of luxury and excess ! 
Art as opposition to the widening gap between the rich and the poor ! 
How noble and courageous that sounds . 
When Christie &apos;s put Koons &apos;s work up for auction , the toy train filled with bourbon sold for $ 33 million . 
If artists , art critics , and art buyers really had any interest in reducing the widening gap between the rich and the poor , they would be focusing their efforts on developing countries , where spending a few thousand dollars on the purchase of works by indigenous artists could make a real difference to the wellbeing of entire villages . 
Nothing I have said here counts against the importance of creating art . 
Drawing , painting , and sculpting , like singing or playing a musical instrument , are significant forms of self-expression , and our lives would be poorer without them . 
In all cultures , and in all kinds of situations , people produce art , even when they cannot satisfy their basic physical needs . 
But we don &apos;t need art buyers to pay millions of dollars to encourage people to do that . 
In fact , it would not be hard to argue that sky-high prices have a corrupting influence on artistic expression . 
As for why buyers pay these outlandish sums , my guess is that they think that owning original works by well-known artists will enhance their own status . 
If so , that may provide a means to bring about change : a redefinition of status along more ethically grounded lines . 
In a more ethical world , to spend tens of millions of dollars on works of art would be status-lowering , not status-enhancing . 
Such behavior would lead people to ask : &quot; In a world in which more than six million children die each year because they lack safe drinking water or mosquito nets , or because they have not been immunized against measles , couldn &apos;t you find something better to do with your money ? &quot;
