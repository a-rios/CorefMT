Depression &apos;s Psychedelic Solution ? 
ZURICH - According to the World Health Organization , depression affects an estimated 350 million people worldwide , making it one of the most prevalent psychiatric conditions . 
But only about half of those who try antidepressant drugs respond to them , and those who do may have to wait several weeks or even months before experiencing relief - a critical failing for people at immediate risk of suicide . 
Fast-acting antidepressants are thus urgently needed . 
Ketamine - a drug primarily used as an anesthetic in veterinary medicine and as a short-term anesthetic and analgesic in hospitals during surgery or other painful procedures - is currently the rising star of depression research . 
It appears to ease depression &apos;s most severe symptoms within minutes or hours , even in patients who have a dismal track record with other treatments . 
In the first controlled study , researchers reported a 50 % decline in symptoms of depression within two hours of a ketamine infusion , and one-third of patients were virtually symptom-free within a day . 
Moreover , patients reported diminished thoughts of suicide a mere 40 minutes after receiving an intravenous infusion of the drug . 
In some patients , the effects of a single dose can last more than a week . 
Clinicians are not alone in studying ketamine &apos;s potential . 
Neuroscientists have hailed it as the first breakthrough in depression-drug research in 50 years . 
Unlike conventional antidepressants - which are used to elevate concentrations of the neurotransmitters serotonin , dopamine , or noradrenaline - ketamine influences the glutamate system . 
Glutamate , the major excitatory neurotransmitter , plays a central role in mediating nearly all forms of brain function , including learning , memory , cognition , and emotion . 
By blocking glutamate from binding to the NMDA receptor , ketamine leads to an augmented glutamate release , which activates other types of glutamate receptors and enhances the function and density of synapses ( the junctions between neurons ) in areas of the brain where stress or depression has caused cells to atrophy . 
Increased synaptic plasticity - the ability of synapses to adjust their strength , which is essential to healthy brain function - could be the neurobiological reason for the apparent therapeutic effect in patients . 
But , though ketamine &apos;s promise has stirred excitement among clinicians and neuroscientists , it has also sparked controversy , owing to the drug &apos;s potentially harmful side effects . 
Depending on the dose , a patient may experience altered physical , spatial , and temporal states ; larger quantities may induce hallucinations and dissolution of the self . 
Intriguingly , ketamine &apos;s psychoactive properties may be responsible for its mood-enhancing effect . 
Psychedelic and psycholytic treatments - popular in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , before research was severely restricted and interest in the clinical use of psychedelics faded - were based on the notion that the drug-induced psychological experience was essential to facilitating the psychotherapeutic process . 
According to this view , the altered state of consciousness produced by ketamine - particularly the dissolution of the self &apos;s boundaries and the experience of union with the world - might constitute a profound and meaningful experience for a patient . 
Integrating this experience into the psychotherapeutic process might facilitate subsequent behavioral changes . 
In other words , drugs like ketamine that quickly increase neuroplasticity might be particularly clinically efficient in combination with psychotherapeutic interventions . 
Unfortunately , research on ketamine addicts and those who take it in large doses as a party drug has revealed that its use may lead to learning and perception problems , as well as memory disorders . 
Another concern is that ketamine &apos;s benefits may be relatively fleeting . 
As a result , ketamine may never develop into an accepted treatment for depression in its current form . 
In fact , ketamine &apos;s future as a therapy for depression would be uncertain even if its efficacy were more strongly established . 
Because ketamine has been available for decades , there is no patent for it , so pharmaceutical companies have little financial incentive to carry out research on the drug and seek approval for its use as an antidepressant . 
Nonetheless , research on ketamine &apos;s chemistry might help to identify mechanisms for addressing treatment-resistant depression that are based on glutamate-driven neuroplasticity . 
Indeed , pharmaceutical companies have already begun to investigate other NMDA-receptor antagonists , together with drugs that act on a different part of the glutamate system , as possible treatments for depression . 
This research could eventually lead to an entirely new class of antidepressant - and relief for millions of people worldwide .
