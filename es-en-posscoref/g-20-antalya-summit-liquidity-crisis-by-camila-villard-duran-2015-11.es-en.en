Confronting the Coming Liquidity Crisis 
SAO PAULO - This month , G-20 leaders will meet in Antalya , Turkey , for their tenth summit since the 2007 global financial crisis . 
But , despite all of these meetings - high-profile events involving top decision-makers from the world &apos;s most influential economies - no real progress has been made toward reforming the international financial architecture . 
Indeed , the group has not seriously engaged with the subject since the 2010 summit in Seoul . 
Put simply , the G-20 is failing in its primary and original purpose of enhancing global financial and monetary stability . 
A big part of the problem is that the G-20 agenda has become increasingly congested over the years . 
At a time of looming financial upheaval , the G-20 must stop attempting to tackle a broad array of issues simultaneously - a goal that has proved impossible - and go back to basics . 
The United States Federal Reserve is now preparing to raise interest rates , which it has kept near zero since the crisis . 
While monetary-policy tightening may be necessary , it risks triggering a serious liquidity crisis in developing countries , with a major impact on economic growth and development . 
That is why , at this month &apos;s G-20 summit , participants must focus on providing a credible institutional backstop for the difficult times ahead . 
Specifically , the G-20 should move to empower the International Monetary Fund , both by pushing it to do more with its existing powers and by championing institutional reform . 
Raghuram Rajan , the governor of India &apos;s central bank , emphasized this at the recent annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Lima , Peru , when he called for the Fund to build a sustainable global safety net to help countries in future liquidity crisis . 
The necessary institutional arrangement already exists : the IMF &apos;s Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) department . 
Within this department , official entities can exchange SDRs - the IMF &apos;s own international reserve asset - for other currencies . 
Moreover , the IMF can designate a country with a strong balance-of-payments position to provide the liquidity that another member needs . 
Through this so-called &quot; designation mechanism &quot; - which has never been used - the IMF can ensure certainty of access to global currencies in times of crisis . 
Of course , if the IMF &apos;s SDR department is to become a global liquidity hub capable of mitigating future crises , reform is vital . 
Ideally , major powers would support efforts to strengthen the IMF . 
While the G-20 should not give up on IMF-strengthening reforms , it should hedge its bets . 
Specifically , it should work with a &quot; coalition of the willing &quot; - including the major emerging economies , concerned advanced countries , and other developing countries - to create an institutional mechanism with which to respond effectively to the next global liquidity crisis . 
One obvious option would be to replicate the institutional design of the SDR department by incorporating it in an agreement among the coalition countries . 
The Bank for International Settlements , which was the counterparty in currency swaps under the Bretton Woods par value system in the 1960s , could be the manager of this system . 
This approach undoubtedly has major shortcomings . 
Indeed , the key advantage of the IMF &apos;s SDR department - that it is a quasi-universal and government-driven system whereby currencies are exchanged with reliable &quot; collateral &quot; ( the SDR ) - would be lost . 
But the perfect should not be made the enemy of the good . 
As long as an ideal system is out of reach , an imperfect option will have to do . 
With the risk of a liquidity crisis intensifying , and the existing international financial architecture ill-equipped to respond to such a crisis , doing nothing is not an option . 
In recent years , the international financial system has become increasingly fragmented , exemplified in the proliferation of bilateral and multilateral currency-swap arrangements . 
For example , the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization involves the ASEAN countries , plus China , Japan , and South Korea . 
And the Contingent Reserve Arrangement ( CRA ) was created by the BRICS countries ( Brazil , China , India , Russia , and South Africa ) . 
Swap contracts involve pre-committed resources , which are not transferred to an international organization with a specific institutional mission . 
Instead , foreign-exchange reserves - that is , liquidity in currencies accepted for international payments - are held in national agencies until a swap &apos;s activation . 
This means that there is no guarantee that , in the event of a crisis , a central bank will actually provide the swap line it has pledged , at least not without attaching political strings . 
In the CRA , for example , members can opt out of providing support - and can request early repayment if a balance-of-payments need arises . 
Clearly , the world &apos;s ever-expanding network of currency-swap arrangements is far from a reliable mechanism for responding to crisis . 
This is particularly problematic for the emerging economies , which are especially vulnerable now . 
Turkey , which currently holds the G-20 presidency , and China , which will take over next year , should have plenty of motivation to demand action to create safeguards against today &apos;s liquidity risks . 
Beyond urging the US to approve IMF governance reforms , both countries should be hard at work building a coalition of the willing and designing an effective crisis-response mechanism . 
So far , Turkey seems to be falling short , promoting an overcrowded and ineffective agenda . 
One hopes that its leaders come to their senses fast , so that the upcoming summit can produce the results that past summits have failed to provide - and that the world needs more than ever .
