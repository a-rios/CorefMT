Palestine &apos;s State of Mind 
RAMALLAH - The idea of Palestine becoming a permanent member of the United Nations originated , say Palestinians , with none other than US President Barack Obama . 
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on September 23 , 2010 , Obama said that he hoped that &quot; when we come back here next year , we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations - an independent , sovereign state of Palestine , living in peace with Israel . &quot; 
Palestinians decided to take Obama at his word . 
Obama &apos;s efforts to rekindle the Middle East peace process began with Israel &apos;s refusal to carry out a temporary settlement freeze . 
The United States was even willing to offer a $ 3 billion arms deal to Israel in return for the suspension of building Jewish-only settlements in areas earmarked for the Palestinian state . 
Nine months later , Obama made another effort to kick-start the talks . 
&quot; The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps , so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states , &quot; he said in May . 
Once again , Palestinians accepted Obama &apos;s formula , while Netanyahu publicly rejected it , leaving Palestinians with no other nonviolent alternative but to go to the UN to seek a state based on the 1967 borders . 
In 1967 , it should be recalled , Israel occupied the remainder of historic Palestine and other Arab territories following the June War . 
Shortly after the war , the UN Security Council declared in the preamble to Resolution 242 that &quot; it is inadmissible to occupy land by force . &quot; 
This is not the first time that the UN has been called upon to arbitrate the intractable Middle East conflict ; nor have only Palestinians approached . 
Back in 1947 , when the UN General Assembly voted to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state , Jews of the British Mandatory state of Palestine danced in the streets of Tel Aviv . 
Today &apos;s Israelis are rejecting recognition of Palestinian statehood on a much smaller territory than that assigned to Arabs by the original partition . 
In more recent history , since 1991 &quot; s Madrid Conference , direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians have taken place in various formats . 
Palestinians made one compromise after another , hoping that partial agreements would lead to statehood . 
The 1993 Oslo accords set in motion a peace process that was supposed to last five years , with the end goal being an independent Palestinian state and a safe , secure , and recognized Israel . 
But the peace process exposed a permanent inability to agree on anything of real substance . 
Worse , direct talks have not only failed to produce the desired results ; their continuation has also helped to mask widespread construction of Israeli colonies on Palestinian territory . 
Palestinian lands continue to be confiscated , Jewish-only settlements continue to be built , and Israel &apos;s so-called &quot; security wall &quot; has strangled the Palestinians socially and economically . 
The International Court of Justice at The Hague has ruled that the wall built inside Palestinian territory is illegal under international law , yet nothing has been done to enforce that ruling . 
Mahmoud Abbas , the chairman of the PLO and President of the Palestinian Authority , who has vowed not to run for re-election , has chosen to take the path of UN recognition rather than continue with the charade of useless - indeed , harmful - direct talks . 
And , clearly , that change in tactics has hit a raw nerve with Israelis and frustrated the US . 
Few Palestinians see anything wrong with the move , although many are not certain that it will produce much in the way of immediate and tangible results . 
Nonetheless , the Palestinian public is pleased for now with a leadership that has found the backbone to stand up to pressure from Israel and the US . 
This will certainly help Abbas in the short term . 
But if the UN move does not bear fruit within a reasonable timeframe , the public might turn against its political leaders - as well as against the Israeli occupiers . 
The UN General Assembly , unlike the Security Council , cannot declare a state , and the US has vowed to veto any Security Council resolution that recognizes Palestine &apos;s independence . 
But , if two-thirds of its members agree , the General Assembly can recognize Palestine as a state with observer status , similar to the Vatican . 
At that point , the international community would be obliged to begin acting against any party that was denying Palestine the right to behave as a fully functional and sovereign state . 
Moreover , as a state ( even with observer status ) , Palestine could seek legal relief from the International Court of Justice . 
It might also try , within the General Assembly , to invoke the rarely used Uniting for Peace resolution ( the last time was against South Africa &apos;s apartheid regime ) . 
Palestinians &quot; desire to obtain a UN vote on statehood ( in whatever form ) does not mean that they cannot have direct negotiations with Israel . 
Palestinian spokesmen , including Abbas , have said that they see no reason why representatives of the newly recognized state cannot negotiate with representatives of Israel . If the UN vote succeeds , however , it will not be a people talking with their occupiers , but two states negotiating about how to manage their relations in peace and harmony .
