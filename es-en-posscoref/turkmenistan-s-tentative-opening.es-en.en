Turkmenistan &apos;s Tentative Opening 
ASHGABAT - Turkmenistan , a country rich in natural gas and strategically located on the borders of Iran and Afghanistan , may be on the brink of transformation . 
By reforming its educational system and giving its citizens access to global sources of information , the country could emerge as a leader of change in post-Soviet Central Asia , setting an example of openness for other closed societies , including North Korea . 
Turkmenistan &apos;s president , Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov , has repeatedly and publicly announced his reformist intentions . 
The world needs to welcome this possibility and back his efforts . 
For 15 years , Turkmenistan was held hostage to the personality cult of former leader Saparmurat Niyazov , who styled himself Turkmenbashi ( &quot; father of the Turkmen &quot; ) . 
Niyazov destroyed the country &apos;s health-care system and neglected its endemic poverty , while spending billions to turn its capital , Ashgabat , into a Las Vegas-style wonder of white marble and gold . 
Niyazov forced students , from grammar school to the post-graduate level , to make his idiosyncratic book , the Ruhnama , the primary focus of their studies . 
He also isolated Turkmenistan from the outside world , forbidding access to the Internet and discouraging international travel . 
Since Niyazov &apos;s death in December 2006 , Berdymukhamedov has expressed his desire for reform , especially in the areas of health care , education , and information technology . 
Berdymukhamedov is also courting private foreign investment . 
Progress is slow . 
All students must still spend one or two class periods per week on the Ruhnama , and , although many classrooms in Ashgabat are now equipped with the latest computers , Internet access remains available only to a few government officials and foreign guests . 
Yet change is seeping in . 
Last month the Ministry of Education invited a delegation from Columbia University &apos;s Harriman Institute to visit the country to discuss educational practices in the United States and exchange views about educational reform . 
The two sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding to hold a series of joint conferences and faculty and student exchanges over the next two years . 
In the past , the US has insisted on trying to impose its own models of development and democratization on foreign countries . 
But events in Iraq have demonstrated that this approach often backfires . 
Now Berdymukhamedov &apos;s small opening provides an opportunity to build a different kind of reform-minded relationship not only with the US , but also with the entire West , particularly the European Union . 
Educational reform could be the first step in an evolutionary process of significant change . 
Western analysts have tended either to dismiss Turkmenistan as a human rights pariah , or to approach the country simply as a source of natural gas in the ongoing pipeline competition involving Western Europe and Russia . 
Both human rights and natural gas should remain on the international agenda . 
But , with this exchange of visits , a wedge has been opened for dialogue on more neutral ground . 
The opportunity to bolster Berdymukhamedov &apos;s reform efforts , however halting they may be , should be seized . 
Both the timing and the nuance of approaches to Turkmenistan will be crucial : a new natural gas pricing deal between Turkmenistan and Russia will likely bring windfall profits to Ashgabat in the near future , and this extra cash could make an authoritarian backslide tempting . 
Western diplomats should encourage Turkmenistan &apos;s government to follow through on its educational exchange plans , and urge Berdymukhamedov to enable wider Internet access for his population . 
If more information circulates freely in the country , and more individuals experience other ways of life by traveling abroad , authoritarianism &apos;s grip will loosen . 
But change in Turkmenistan will probably be slow . 
There are interest groups who benefit from the current system and the opportunities for corruption that it provides . 
Even the most well intentioned of today &apos;s government officials will undoubtedly fear the uncertainties of what a more educated and informed population might demand of them . 
Nevertheless , by publicly lauding educational reform and informational exchange , Berdymukhamedov has provided a means for the outside world to help him open his country . 
The world should use that door before it closes again .
