MEMO TO ECB : DON &apos;T FOLLOW THE FED 
The current dilemma of the US Federal Reserve of having to continue raising interest rates despite the hurricane-wounded US economy holds a powerful message for the European Central Bank . 
After a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates , there are dangerous consequences of waiting too long to raise rates to more normal and appropriate levels . 
The Federal Reserve , having taken interest rates down to spectacularly low levels - in part , because of misplaced fears about deflation -  started the interest rate normalization process too late . 
Now it must continue to raise rates even though there are signs  - like declining US consumer confidence - that America &apos;s economy may be faltering . 
The ECB must not make the same mistake . 
Warning signs of impending inflation abound in the euro-zone economy . 
Money supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now , indicating a condition of excess liquidity . 
October headline inflation at 2.5 % is above the 2 % ECB target  -  as is the latest forecast for 2006 inflation ( updated forecasts come out the first of December ) . 
Soaring energy prices threaten to work their way into the general inflation process . 
Why wait ? 
Further procrastination on interest rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation . 
This would be disastrous , in particular , for Europe &apos;s economic recovery . 
The ECB , in such circumstances , would have no choice but to slam the monetary brakes down hard . 
No one wants this . 
Better a 50 basis point increase now that allows the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check , than triple or quadruple that figure down the road  -  which could stop the recovery cold in its tracks . 
&quot; An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure &quot; applies with particular force to issues of monetary policy . 
Judging from the November meeting of the Governing Council , that &quot; ounce of prevention &quot; appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy . 
There has been a quickened pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation in recent months - from we are &quot; particularly vigilant &quot; in September to &quot; strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted &quot; at the October meeting in Athens . 
Moreover , ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet recently adopted a more hawkish tone in Athens . 
For the first time , he was willing to publicly declare the Governing Council had discussed the pro &apos;s and cons of a rate hike . 
He appeared to be calling for a pre-emption of second-round effects when he said , &quot; We must not allow second-round effects to materialize . &quot; 
Despite this , at its most recent meeting in November , the ECB continued to describe current interest rates as &quot; still appropriate &quot;  -  signaling that the bank has not reached the required threshold for action . 
However , Trichet warned , &quot; we clearly can move at any time . 
We are making no promises . &quot; 
At a minimum , the ECB has made it clear to one and all - politicians , trade unions , and the markets -  that its &quot; long period of monetary inactivity is coming to an end . 
Not everyone is happy with this news . 
Politicians - like President Jacques Chirac in France , Premier Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and a number of European finance ministers  -  continue to press for fixed , even lower , interest rates . 
It &apos;s easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy . 
They are not the ones who will be blamed for inflationary indiscretions . 
Nor are they the ones who will have to put the inflation genie back in the bottle once it escapes . 
So what if they are unhappy that rates are on the rise . 
Wim Duisenberg &apos;s celebrated comment on politicians and central bankers -  &quot; I hear but I do not listen &quot;  -  is as relevant today as when he spoke those words . 
But the ECB must act in its own uniquely European way and not follow the Fed as it exits its prolonged period of monetary inactivity . 
The Federal Reserve proceeded to raise rates in 25 basis points increments for 13 straight meetings  - with still more to come - after it exited from its prolonged period of low interest rates . 
A simple increase of 50 basis points could do the job at this point for the ECB - after which rates could be kept on hold for some time . 
The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process , and because it was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the interest rate cycle , has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase . 
This is not the type of volatile monetary policy Europe wants or needs .
