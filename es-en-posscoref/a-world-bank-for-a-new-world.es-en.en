A World Bank for a New World 
NEW YORK - The world is at a crossroads . 
Either the global community will join together to fight poverty , resource depletion , and climate change , or it will face a generation of resource wars , political instability , and environmental ruin . 
The World Bank , if properly led , can play a key role in averting these threats and the risks that they imply . 
The global stakes are thus very high this spring as the Bank &apos;s 187 member countries choose a new president to succeed Robert Zoellick , whose term ends in July . 
The World Bank was established in 1944 to promote economic development , and virtually every country is now a member . 
Its central mission is to reduce global poverty and ensure that global development is environmentally sound and socially inclusive . 
Achieving these goals would not only improve the lives of billions of people , but would also forestall violent conflicts that are stoked by poverty , famine , and struggles over scarce resources . 
American officials have traditionally viewed the World Bank as an extension of United States foreign policy and commercial interests . 
With the Bank just two blocks away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue , it has been all too easy for the US to dominate the institution . 
Now many members , including Brazil , China , India , and several African countries , are raising their voices in support of more collegial leadership and an improved strategy that works for all . 
From the Bank &apos;s establishment until today , the unwritten rule has been that the US government simply designates each new president : all 11 have been Americans , and not a single one has been an expert in economic development , the Bank &apos;s core responsibility , or had a career in fighting poverty or promoting environmental sustainability . 
Instead , the US has selected Wall Street bankers and politicians , presumably to ensure that the Bank &apos;s policies are suitably friendly to US commercial and political interests . 
Yet the policy is backfiring on the US and badly hurting the world . 
Because of a long-standing lack of strategic expertise at the top , the Bank has lacked a clear direction . 
Many projects have catered to US corporate interests rather than to sustainable development . 
The Bank has cut a lot of ribbons on development projects , but has solved far too few global problems . 
For too long , the Bank &apos;s leadership has imposed US concepts that are often utterly inappropriate for the poorest countries and their poorest people . 
For example , the Bank completely fumbled the exploding pandemics of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria during the 1990 &quot; s , failing to get help to where it was needed to curb these outbreaks and save millions of lives . 
Even worse , the Bank advocated user fees and &quot; cost recovery &quot; for health services , thereby putting life-saving health care beyond the reach of the poorest of the poor - precisely those most in need of it . 
In 2000 , at the Durban AIDS Summit , I recommended a new &quot; Global Fund &quot; to fight these diseases , precisely on the grounds that the World Bank was not doing its job . 
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria emerged , and has since saved millions of lives , with malaria deaths in Africa alone falling by at least 30 % . 
The Bank similarly missed crucial opportunities to support smallholder subsistence farmers and to promote integrated rural development more generally in impoverished rural communities in Africa , Asia , and Latin America . 
For around 20 years , roughly from 1985 to 2005 , the Bank resisted the well-proven use of targeted support for small landholders to enable impoverished subsistence farmers to improve yields and break out of poverty . 
More recently , the Bank has increased its support for smallholders , but there is still far more that it can and should do . 
The Bank &apos;s staff is highly professional , and would accomplish much more if freed from the dominance of narrow US interests and viewpoints . 
The Bank has the potential to be a catalyst of progress in key areas that will shape the world &apos;s future . 
Its priorities should include agricultural productivity ; mobilization of information technologies for sustainable development ; deployment of low-carbon energy systems ; and quality education for all , with greater reliance on new forms of communication to reach hundreds of millions of under-served students . 
The Bank &apos;s activities currently touch on all of these areas , but it fails to lead effectively on any of them . 
Despite the excellence of its staff , the Bank has not been strategic or agile enough to be an effective agent of change . 
Getting the Bank &apos;s role right will be hard work , requiring expertise at the top . 
Most importantly , the Bank &apos;s new president should have first-hand professional experience regarding the range of pressing development challenges . 
The world should not accept the status quo . 
A World Bank leader who once again comes from Wall Street or from US politics would be a heavy blow for a planet in need of creative solutions to complex development challenges . 
The Bank needs an accomplished professional who is ready to tackle the great challenges of sustainable development from day one .
