Mitt and the Moochers 
WASHINGTON , DC - The Republican Party has some potentially winning themes for America &apos;s presidential and congressional elections in November . 
Americans have long been skeptical of government , with a tradition of resistance to perceived government overreach that extends back to their country &apos;s founding years . 
This tradition has bequeathed to today &apos;s Americans a related rejection of public subsidies and a cultural aversion to &quot; dependence &quot; on state support . 
But Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other leading members of his party have played these cards completely wrong in this election cycle . 
Romney is apparently taken with the idea that many Americans , the so-called 47 % , do not pay federal income tax . 
He believes that they view themselves as &quot; victims &quot; and have become &quot; dependent &quot; on the government . 
But this misses two obvious points . 
First , most of the 47 % pay a great deal of tax on their earnings , property , and goods purchased . 
They also work hard to make a living in a country where median household income has declined to a level last seen in the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
Second , the really big subsidies in modern America flow to a part of its financial elite - the privileged few who are in charge of the biggest firms on Wall Street . 
Seen in broad historical perspective , this is not such an unusual situation . 
In their recent bestselling economic history , Why Nations Fail , Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson cite many past and current cases in which powerful individuals attain control over the state and use this power to enrich themselves . 
In many pre-industrial societies , for example , control over the state was the best way to assure wealth . 
And , in many developing countries endowed with valuable natural resources , fighting to gain control of the government has proved a very attractive strategy . 
( I have worked with Acemoglu and Robinson on related issues , though I was not involved in writing the book . ) 
The traditional mechanism of state capture in much of the world is violence . 
But that is not true in the United States . 
Nor is it the case that US government officials are typically bribed in an open fashion ( though there have been some prominent exceptions ) . 
Instead , special interests compete for influence through campaign contributions and other forms of political donations . 
They also run large , sophisticated media campaigns aimed at persuading policymakers and the public that what is good for their special interest is good for the country . 
No one has succeeded in the modern American political game like the biggest banks on Wall Street , which lobbied for deregulation during the three decades prior to the crisis of 2008 , and then pushed back effectively against almost all dimensions of financial reform . 
Their success has paid off handsomely . 
The top executives at 14 leading financial firms received cash compensation ( as salary , bonus , and / or stock options exercised ) totaling roughly $ 2.5 billion in 2000-2008 - with five individuals alone receiving $ 2 billion . 
But these masters of the universe did not earn that money without massive government assistance . 
By being perceived as &quot; too big to fail , &quot; their banks benefit from a government backstop or downside guarantee . 
They can take on more risk - running a more highly leveraged business with less shareholder capital . 
They get bigger returns when things go well and receive state support when fortune turns against them : heads they win , tails we lose . 
And the losses are colossal . 
According to a recent report on the aftermath of the 2008 crisis , prepared by Better Markets , an advocacy group that pushes for stronger financial reforms , the cost to the US economy of the financial crisis - caused by financial institutions &quot; reckless risk-taking - amounts to at least $ 12.8 trillion . 
A big part of this cost has come in the form of jobs lost and lives derailed for the bottom 47 % of the American income distribution . 
Former Utah Governor and Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman addressed this issue clearly and repeatedly as he sought - unsuccessfully - to win his party &apos;s nomination to challenge President Barack Obama . 
Force the banks to break up , he argued , in order to cut off their subsidies . 
Make these financial institutions small enough and simple enough to fail - then let the market decide which of them should sink or swim . 
That is an argument around which all conservatives should be able to rally . 
After all , the emergence of global megabanks was not a market outcome ; these banks are government-sponsored and subsidized enterprises , propped up by taxpayers . 
( This is as true in Europe today as it is in the US . ) 
Romney is right to raise the issue of subsidies , but he badly misstates what has happened in the US during the last four years . 
The big , nontransparent , and dangerous subsidies are off-budget , contingent liabilities generated by government support for too-big-to-fail financial institutions . 
These subsidies do not appear in any annual appropriation , and they are not well measured by the government - which is part of what makes them so appealing to the big banks and so damaging to everyone else . 
If only Romney had turned popular disdain for subsidies against the global megabanks , he would now be coasting into the White House . 
Instead , by going after the hard-pressed 47 % of America - the very people who have been hurt the most by reckless bank behavior - his prospect of victory in November has been severely damaged .
