Africa , Climate Change , and the G-8 Summit 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the G-8 Summit this July will be African poverty and global climate change . 
These may seem to be distinct issues . 
A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why . 
One morning , I was taken to a dry riverbed at the village &apos;s edge . 
Farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed , down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level . 
They explained that until recently this was a perennial river - one that flows throughout the year - but now the river stops flowing during the dry season . 
Only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed . 
Until then , water-starved communities dig for water , if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out . 
In northern Ethiopia , as in much of Africa , the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years . 
Ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops , one during a short rain in March and April , and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months . 
In recent years , the short rains have failed entirely , and long rains have been erratic . 
Hunger is omnipresent . 
Perhaps half of the children are severely underweight . 
Much of arid sub-Saharan Africa , notably in the Sahel ( the region just south of the Sahara desert ) , has experienced a pronounced drop in rainfall over the past quarter-century . 
This decline coincided with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighboring Indian Ocean , a hint that the decline in rainfall is in fact part of the longer-term process of man-made global warming . 
Failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger , but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water . 
When violence erupts in water-starved regions such as Darfur , Sudan , political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms . 
If they act at all , they mobilize peacekeepers , international sanctions , and humanitarian aid . 
But Darfur , like Tigre , needs a development strategy to fight hunger and drought even more than it needs peacekeepers . 
Soldiers cannot keep peace among desperately hungry people . 
One course of action must be to help impoverished African regions to &quot; adapt &quot; to climate change and to escape the poverty trap . 
Water-stressed regions like Ethiopia and Sudan can adapt , at least in part , through improved technologies such as &quot; drip irrigation , &quot; rainwater harvesting , improved water storage facilities , deep wells , and agro-forestry techniques that make best use of scarce rainfall . 
Better land-management practices ( the re-planting of degraded forests , for example ) can recharge underground water aquifers . 
Poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own . 
Nor should they have to . 
Help for poor countries in Africa and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as charity or aid , but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet . 
Greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered . 
In addition to adapting to climate change , the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases , which are the source of man-made climate change . 
While adaptation to climate change is necessary - because it is already occurring - this is not enough . 
If the world fails to mitigate future climate change , the effects of rising temperatures , increasing droughts , more numerous and severe tropical storms , rising sea levels , and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet . 
The famines in Ethiopia and the violence in Darfur suggest what can lie ahead . 
The best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions . 
There are at least three options : shift to non-carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy ; capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide emitted at carbon-based power plants ; economize on energy use , for example by shifting to hybrid automobiles and trucks . 
Most likely , all three of these methods will have to play a role . 
The effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action , but , given the long lead times in overhauling the world &apos;s energy systems , we must start now . 
Rich countries need to lead the way . 
It is ironic that the United States , which portrays itself as a friend of democracy and impoverished countries , gives the smallest share of its GNP in aid among the rich countries , and also refuses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . 
This is especially ironic because African countries like Ethiopia stand steadfastly and bravely with the US in the fight for freedom and against terrorism , even as they struggle with hunger , disease , and famine . 
Moreover , countries like Ethiopia are making valiant , indeed remarkable , efforts to overcome their problems , despite the lack of adequate , and long-promised , help from the world &apos;s richest countries . 
Africans suffering from hunger and drought , and indeed poor people everywhere , have a right to ask much more of the US and other rich countries . 
Tony Blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises .
