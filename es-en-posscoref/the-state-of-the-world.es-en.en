The State of the World 
NEW YORK - We all recognize today &apos;s perils . 
A global financial crisis . 
A global energy crisis . 
A global food crisis . 
Trade talks have collapsed , yet again . 
There are new outbreaks of war and violence . 
Climate change ever more clearly threatens our planet . 
We say that global problems demand global solutions . 
And yet , do we act ? 
In truth , today , we also face a crisis of a different sort - the challenge of global leadership . 
New centers of power and leadership are emerging - in Asia , Latin America and across the newly developed world . 
In this new world , the challenges are increasingly those of collaboration , not confrontation . 
Nations can no longer protect their interests , or advance the well-being of their people , without the partnership of the rest . 
Yet I see a danger of nations looking inward rather than toward a shared future . 
I see a danger of retreating from the progress we have made , particularly in the realm of economic development and fairness in sharing the fruits of global growth . 
Yes , global growth has raised billions of people out of poverty . 
Yet if you are among the world &apos;s poor , you have never felt poverty so sharply . 
Yes , international law and justice have never been so widely embraced . 
Yet those living in nations where human rights are abused have never been so vulnerable . 
Yes , most of us live in peace and security . 
Yet violence is deepening in many nations : Afghanistan , Somalia , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Iraq , and Sudan . 
Their problems are part of the development emergency we face . 
Over the past year , the price of fuel , food , and commodities rose alarmingly . 
Wealthy countries worry about recession , while the poor can no longer afford to eat . 
The Millennium Development Goals are part of the solution . 
But progress here has been uneven . 
Pledges have not been honored . 
Yet we have achieved enough to know that the goals are within reach . 
The United Nations is the champion of the most vulnerable . 
When disaster strikes , we act . 
We did so this year in Haiti and other Caribbean nations hit by hurricanes . 
We did so after Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar , where the challenge now is to push for political progress , including credible steps on human rights and democracy . 
We have helped people affected by severe flooding in Southeast Asia , and by drought in the Horn of Africa , where 14 million need emergency help . 
Since taking office , I have called for more strenuous action in Somalia . 
Must we wait - and see more children die in the sand ? 
The global food crisis will not go away by itself . 
It may now have faded from the headlines . 
Last year at this time , rice cost $ 330 a ton . 
Today it is $ 730 . 
People who used to buy rice by the bag now do so by the handful . 
Those who ate two meals a day now get by on one . 
The UN has focused on getting seeds and fertilizers into the hands of small farmers . 
We seek a new &quot; green revolution &quot; in Africa . 
But we lack new resources . 
The international community has not matched words with deeds . 
In Burundi and Sierra Leone , Liberia and Timor Leste , our resources are under strain because UN peacekeepers are helping nations turn the corner to peace . 
Yet the UN &apos;s preventive diplomacy is often critical . 
We see the fruits in Nepal , Kenya and , we hope , Zimbabwe . 
Likewise , there is a real chance to reunify Cyprus . 
In Georgia , the UN can help ease the tensions resulting from the recent conflict . 
In Cote d &apos;Ivoire , we will help organize elections before year &apos;s end - a major stride toward recovery and democracy . 
But it is dangerous to think that the UN can address today &apos;s complex problems without the full backing of its member states . 
In Darfur , for example , we face a continuing challenge in meeting deployment deadlines . 
We lack critical assets and personnel . 
If not matched by resources , mandates are empty . 
And now all of our work - financing for development , social spending in rich nations and poor , the Millennium Development Goals , peacekeeping - is endangered by the global financial crisis . 
We need to restore order to international financial markets . 
We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time . 
Those realities call for continuous UN action on countless fronts : combating malaria and AIDS , reducing maternal and child mortality , fighting global terrorism , and ensuring nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation . 
On the Korean Peninsula , all the agreements of the six-party talks must be implemented , and Iran must comply with Security Council resolutions and cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
The area of human rights , above all , demands our vigilance . 
Justice must be treated as a pillar of peace , security , and development . 
We must advance the &quot; responsibility to protect . &quot; 
Despite the real political difficulties , we cannot let crimes against humanity go unpunished . 
Climate change remains the defining issue of our era . 
We must regain our momentum . 
Our first test comes in three months in Poznan , Poland . 
By then , we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol , which runs out in 2012 . 
The foundation of all the UN &apos;s work is accountability . 
We need to change the UN &apos;s culture . 
We must become faster , more flexible , and more effective - more modern . 
We must replace our current system of contracts and conditions of service , which are dysfunctional and demoralizing . 
But the UN &apos;s Member States must be accountable as well . 
Resolutions mandating peace operations cannot continue to be passed without the necessary troops , money , and materiel . 
We cannot send brave UN staff - 25 of whom died this year - around the world without assuring their security . 
We cannot reform this organization without the required resources . 
Today &apos;s uncertainties will pass , but only if we act wisely and responsibly . 
By doing so , we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity , more widely and equitably shared .
