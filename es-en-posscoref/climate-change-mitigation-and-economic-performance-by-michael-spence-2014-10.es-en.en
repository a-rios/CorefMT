Growth in the New Climate Economy 
MILAN - Action to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change has long been viewed as fundamentally opposed to economic growth . 
Indeed , the fragility of the global economic recovery is often cited as a justification to delay such action . 
But a recent report , &quot; The New Climate Economy : Better Growth , Better Climate &quot; released by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , refutes this reasoning . 
Far from being a detriment to economic growth , the report concludes that efforts to combat climate change could boost growth considerably - and relatively soon . 
Anyone who has studied economic performance since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 , understands that damage to balance sheets - such as excess debt and unfunded non-debt liabilities - can cause growth slowdowns , sudden stops , or even reversals . 
And those familiar with growth in developing countries know that underinvestment in human capital , infrastructure , and the economy &apos;s knowledge and technology base eventually produces balance sheets that cannot support continued growth . 
Climate change is not very different from these unsustainable or defective growth patterns . 
It , too , is essentially a balance-sheet problem , based on the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere 
On its current trajectory , the world has only 3-4 decades ( or less ) before atmospheric CO2 reaches levels that disrupt climate patterns , with catastrophic consequences for the environment and , in turn , economic and social systems . 
Allowing the world &apos;s &quot; natural capital &quot; - the resources and ecosystems that underpin these systems - to be depleted is essentially another form of destructive underinvestment . 
The massive amount of scientific evidence supporting current climate projections makes it unlikely that the world will forego adjustment entirely . 
But solving the complex coordination and distributional problems that such adjustments will generate will not be easy , and , convinced that we cannot afford an aggressive mitigation strategy at a time when we are faced with so many other pressing challenges , policymakers could be tempted to defer action on the ground . 
&quot; The New Climate Economy &quot; argues that this would be a very bad idea . 
The report &apos;s thorough assessment of recent research , experience , and innovation led to the unambiguous conclusion that acting now would be far less costly than waiting . 
In fact , acting now is barely costly at all . 
Low-carbon paths of economic growth do not look all that different from high-carbon paths - until the latter veers sharply to the precipice of catastrophic failure . 
Put another way , the net costs of reducing CO2 emissions - in terms of growth , income , and other measures of economic and social performance - are not all that high in the short and medium term . 
Given what we know now about the consequences of the high-carbon path for the natural environment and , in turn , health outcomes and quality of life , those costs could actually be negative . 
But there is an important proviso : action must be taken urgently . 
The economic costs of action to mitigate climate change rise non-linearly as action is delayed . 
If those costs are deferred for 15 years or more , mitigation targets will be impossible to achieve , at any cost . 
So how do we move onto the low-carbon path ? 
The report points out the benefits of constructing the energy-efficient buildings and infrastructure needed to underpin the low-carbon global economy of 2050 , incorporating low-carbon strategies into municipal-planning processes , and tapping the efficiency-enhancing potential of the Internet . 
Add to that the declining costs of alternative energy sources and relentless technological advancement , and the world &apos;s carbon-reduction goals do not seem so distant - or costly . 
After evaluating the technologies , policy options , and analysis included in the report , one might conclude that low-carbon growth paths may be slightly flatter in the short term than their high-carbon counterparts , with higher investment and lower consumption . 
Nonetheless , it would be difficult to deem them inferior , given their medium-to-long-term advantages . 
The report also sheds light on another important question in the climate debate : Is global cooperation critical to mitigate climate change ? 
For a given economy , does acting alone yield distinctly inferior growth paths - say , by damaging the competitiveness of its tradable sector ? 
If the answer is yes , international policy coordination would seem to be a necessary precondition for progress . 
This does not appear to be the case . 
A substantial portion of a national policy agenda that supports an individual country &apos;s shift to a low-carbon growth path ( boosting energy efficiency , for example ) will not produce an economic slowdown ; such an effort might even lead to higher growth rates than remaining on a high-carbon path would have delivered . 
On a first approximation , low-carbon paths are the dominant strategies , implying a completely different and far more favorable view of the incentive structures at work . 
This means that , though international coordination will be an important factor in the long-term success of action to mitigate climate change , its complications need not - and should not - hold progress hostage . 
Given the difficulty of developing and implementing a global strategy , that is good news . 
Scientific evidence has eliminated legitimate doubts about the scale of the risks that climate change poses . 
Now , the Global Commission &apos;s analysis has largely refuted the economic arguments for inaction .
