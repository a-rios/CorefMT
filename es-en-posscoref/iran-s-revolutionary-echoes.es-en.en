Iran &apos;s Revolutionary Echoes 
STONY BROOK , NY - Iran &apos;s continued unrest , now extending through the 30th anniversary of the revolution that toppled the Shah , raises the question of whether the Islamic Republic is about to fall . 
As in 1979 , millions of Iranians have taken to the streets , this time to protest electoral fraud in the presidential vote last June . 
The cheated presidential candidates , both veterans of the revolution , instinctively thought of a replay of history . 
Mir Hossein Moussavi saw the green symbols of the demonstrators as representing the color of the House of the Prophet , and urged his supporters to continue their nightly rooftop chants of &quot; God is Great ! &quot; 
Thus , the first slogan of the opposition invoked the religious credo of the 1979 revolutionaries . 
More recently , protesters chanted it during the funeral demonstrations for Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri in the closing days of 2009 . 
And yet we risk being led astray by memories of 1979 . 
It is far too soon to predict another revolution . 
But t he divide between Iran &apos;s society and its government is much greater today than it was under the Shah 30 years ago . 
Change seems just as inevitable . 
Technological advances greatly favor the 2009 protesters . 
Text messages , Twitter , and the Web are infinitely superior to the smuggled cassettes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &apos;s speeches that fueled the opposition in 1979 . 
What &apos;s missing this time , however , is a charismatic leader comparable to Khomeini . 
Indeed , the striking feature of the Iranian opposition movement is the lack of effective leadership , despite the astonishing persistence of protests . 
As Moussavi has readily acknowledged , neither he nor the other presidential candidate , Ahmad Karroubi , feels in charge by now . 
The greatest difference between 2009 and 1979 was created by the revolution itself . 
R evolutions give birth to a new political class , and Iran &apos;s Islamic revolution was no exception . 
The Iranian leadership formed after the revolution consisted of a narrow ruling stratum and a much broader supporting group that was given charge of administration and political mobilization . 
In the 20 years since Khomeini &apos;s death , the composition of this political class has changed drastically . 
The clerical elite has gradually lost power to the military-security groups , from whose ranks President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad emerged . 
Bureaucratic and security services dominated by the Revolutionary Guards and its militia , the Basij ( Mobilization Corps ) , are now firmly in command . 
The leader of the Islamic Republic , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , blessed the Revolutionary Guards &quot; decision to steal the presidential election . 
By identifying squarely with the military-security apparatus headed by Ahmadinejad , Khamenei has alienated an important segment of the ruling clerical elite . 
He has also reduced his own status as the ultimate arbiter in Iranian society , a role that was central to Khomeini &apos;s dominance of the system . 
As a result , he has produced a rupture between the two pillars of the revolutionary regime : the clerical elite and military-security structure . 
The growth of Khamenei &apos;s personal , extra-constitutional power introduces a strong element of uncertainty into Iran &apos;s future . 
Political regimes that rely on personal power , commonly known as dictatorships , prove to be fragile in crisis . 
This was the weakness of the Shah &apos;s regime , which collapsed as he became paralyzed in his decision-making . 
There was nothing behind him supporting the system . 
Khamenei &apos;s backing of the June 2009 putsch now appears to be a costly mistake . 
With this single error , he has undermined what had appeared to be a robust post-revolutionary course for the first and only theocracy in modern history . 
The cries of &quot; God is Great ! &quot; have now been overtaken by chants of &quot; Death to the Dictator ! &quot; in recent demonstrations in Tehran , Tabriz , Shiraz , and other Iranian cities . 
The Iranian regime is now critically dependent on decisions made by one man , the Leader . 
For that reason , it is demonstrating a degree of fragility that is comparable to the Shah &apos;s regime in the latter part of the 1970 &quot; s . 
Most spokespersons of the Green protest movement advocate civil disobedience instead of revolution . 
Earlier this month , Ezattolah Sahabi , who was a member of the revolutionary provisional government in 1979 , issued a statement in Tehran stating categorically that &quot; a revolution in today &apos;s Iran is neither possible nor desirable . &quot; 
At roughly the same time , five prominent opposition intellectuals living in exile released a reformist , not revolutionary , manifesto directed against the &quot; despotic guardians . &quot; 
But there is little chance that these children of the Islamic revolution - now graying reformists - will remain in control of the Green movement , which now reflects the aspirations of a post-revolutionary generation of young women and men and students . 
The ayatollah-dictator and the Revolutionary Guards have tried their best to discredit their opponents by concocting , through forced confessions at show trials , a conspiracy of regime change based on a &quot; velvet revolution &quot; produced by &quot; Western social sciences . &quot; 
Deep down , they know there is no conspiracy . 
Their fear is grounded in what they see in front of them : the forward march of history .
