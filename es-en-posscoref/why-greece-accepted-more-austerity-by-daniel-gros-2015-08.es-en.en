Why Greece Declined a Euro Holiday 
BRUSSELS - For the entire first half of this year , since the far-left , anti-austerity Syriza party came to power in January , the Greek saga virtually monopolized the attention of European policymakers . 
Even as their country &apos;s economy crashed , Greece &apos;s new government remained adamant in demanding debt relief without austerity - that is , until mid-July , when they suddenly agreed to the creditors &quot; terms . 
Indeed , as of July 13 , Greece &apos;s staunchly anti-austerity government has been obliged to impose even tougher austerity and pursue painful structural reforms , under its creditors &quot; close supervision . 
Why did the Greek government concede to terms that not only controverted its own promises , but also closely resembled those that voters had overwhelmingly rejected in a popular referendum barely a week earlier ? 
Many believe that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was responding to an ultimatum from his European partners : Accept our demands or leave the euro . 
The question is why a Greek exit from the euro ( &quot; Grexit &quot; ) amounted to such a potent threat . 
In fact , from an economic perspective , Grexit no longer represents the potential catastrophe that it once did . 
After all , the main short-term cost - financial-system disruption - has already materialized in Greece : banks and the stock market have been shut down , and capital controls have been imposed . 
While those actions were needed to stem large-scale capital flight and prevent the banking system &apos;s collapse , they also caused the Greek economy to contract sharply . 
In this context , Greek negotiators might have considered another proposal , circulated informally by the German finance ministry , recommending that Greece receive immediate debt forgiveness , in exchange for leaving the euro temporarily . 
If Greece remained in the euro , no relief would be granted - a proviso consistent with the German position that debt restructuring for eurozone countries would be illegal . 
While the legal argument is probably spurious , an outright debt reduction for a eurozone country remains politically impossible . 
The German proposal , spearheaded by Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch채uble , highlights the fundamental change that has occurred in Greece &apos;s relationship with its European partners since its last bailout package three years ago . 
In 2012 , Greece was offered hundreds of billions of euros in financial support , and its creditors , including Greek commercial banks , were pushed to accept substantial &quot; voluntary &quot; haircuts . 
Tellingly , when George Papandreou , Greece &apos;s prime minister at the time , proposed a referendum on the existing adjustment program and his country &apos;s continued eurozone membership in 2011 , he was warned off in no uncertain terms by France &apos;s then-President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
Though Papandreou would have campaigned for the adjustment program and the euro , a referendum was a risk that his European partners were unwilling to take . 
Tsipras &apos;s government , by contrast , was able to hold its referendum , and even campaign against the creditors &quot; proposed adjustment program ( which , it should be noted , was no longer on the table ) . 
Even the resounding &quot; no &quot; delivered by Greek voters could not strengthen the government &apos;s negotiating position , for a simple reason : Grexit is no longer considered a threat to the euro &apos;s stability . 
That is why German officials - especially Sch채uble - have been encouraging Greece to leave . 
One can only speculate about Sch채uble &apos;s motivation in pushing for Grexit . 
He seems to believe that a more integrated eurozone , though certainly desirable , is not feasible with a country that cannot be trusted to abide by the terms to which its government has agreed . 
Whatever Sch채uble &apos;s reasons , his proposal could have represented a way out for Greece , whose economy had been squeezed dry by austerity and whose banking system was already closed . 
Immediate debt reduction and the recovery of economic sovereignty - even at the expense of exiting the euro , at least temporarily - would seem to have offered significant long-term benefits . 
In a sense , it amounted to a golden opportunity , with Germany offering to pay for something that many believe Greece should be doing anyway . 
Nonetheless , the Greek government rejected an exit , and instead accepted the creditors &quot; tough terms . 
This suggests that , during the negotiations , Greece &apos;s leaders were driven by more than economics . 
Perhaps , contrary to popular belief , countries &quot; political attachment to Europe via the euro remains very strong , even where , as in Greece , people have endured unprecedented hardship since joining the monetary union . 
The monetary union &apos;s rationale , as many have noted , was always more political than economic . 
For precisely that reason , it may well be too early to write off the single currency .
