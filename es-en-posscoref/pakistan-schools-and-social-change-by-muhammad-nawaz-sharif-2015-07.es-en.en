Schooling and Social Change in Pakistan 
ISLAMABAD - The importance of education - and especially schooling - cannot be overestimated . 
Not only has the expansion of primary and secondary education been linked to accelerated economic growth , poverty eradication , and improved income equality , but education also appears to be closely associated with social enrichment and inclusion , the upgrading of human capital , increased opportunities , and enhanced freedom and welfare . 
That is why , as Pakistan &apos;s prime minister , I have placed universal access to education very high on the national agenda . 
Education influences the way people perceive the world around them , understand issues , and find solutions to their problems . 
It makes them more aware of their rights and duties and affects how they interact within their communities and with the state and its institutions . 
Above all , it enables them to think critically and question established wisdom , thereby enabling them to rise above prejudice , myth , and restrictive historical legacies . 
In this sense , education is a major driver of social progress . 
And it is the key to fulfilling my promise , made when I took office two years ago , to create a new framework for social change in Pakistan , one that ensures equal opportunities and social justice for everyone and stops the exploitation of the poor and harnesses their potential . 
As the Oslo Summit on Education for Development approaches , I remain firm in my commitment to securing the right to a high-quality education for every child in Pakistan - especially for girls , who have long faced high barriers to education . 
But there remain considerable obstacles to fulfilling that commitment . 
Indeed , nearly six million Pakistani children are currently out of school , and many more are not learning even basic mathematics or reading skills . 
Dropout rates are high . 
And , perhaps worst of all , terrorists and extremists have been targeting schools , blowing up their buildings and threatening their teachers , particularly in the northern part of the country . 
In a particularly tragic incident last December , terrorists attacked young students and teachers at a school in Peshawar . 
I now reiterate the promise that I made after that attack . 
My government will not allow Pakistan &apos;s schools - so vital to our country &apos;s future - to become targets of terrorism . 
Education is the most important investment we can make in our most precious assets - our children - and we will not tolerate even the slightest threat to it . 
Protecting schools from extremists today will help to stem the rise of extremism tomorrow . 
Indeed , given the contribution of ignorance , lack of choice , and socioeconomic deprivation to the rise of extremism in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan , ensuring that future generations have better education , improved capabilities , and more opportunities will ensure that the next generation will not become easy prey for terrorist organizations . 
In addition to the risk that a few would be tempted by extremism is the certainty that , if we fail to meet our commitment to universal education , millions of children would be relegated to a life of poverty and struggle , with their hopes , dreams , and potential squandered , undermining the country &apos;s development potential . 
More than half of Pakistan &apos;s population is under the age of 25 ; theirs is the generation with the potential to drive progress and prosperity in the country - if , of course , they receive the education they deserve . 
Given how unlikely it is that a free-market approach would lead to the equitable provision of education , my government has committed to increase the public resources allocated for education , which averaged only 2.4 % of GDP from 2004 to 2013 , to 4 % percent of GDP over the next three years . 
Such funding will support the steps needed to fulfill the promise , contained in our country &apos;s constitution , that the state will &quot; provide free and compulsory secondary education within minimum possible period . &quot; 
Those steps include cooperation with provincial governments - which bear the primary responsibility for primary and secondary education in Pakistan - to devise a roadmap for universal enrollment . 
In order to improve the quality of teaching and learning , we are working not only to expand facilities for teacher training , but also to draw more talented people to the profession by recognizing and honoring the service of teachers . 
And we are investing in computers and other advanced learning tools to ensure that our children can compete internationally . 
We have also launched several new initiatives to make education more widely accessible . 
One such initiative is the National Endowment Scholarships for Talent , which finances the education of poor students . 
Finally , we are strengthening the institutional scaffolding of Pakistan &apos;s education system . 
For example , we have created the National Curriculum Council , which will standardize school curricula throughout the country , while ensuring that they are consistent with national requirements and international benchmarks . 
Reforms to the examination system are being introduced to complement this effort . 
My pledge is being turned into action . 
But my government cannot do it alone . 
To overcome the challenges we face and fulfill our promise to our children , we need active support from the international community . 
The Millennium Development Goal ( MDG ) of achieving universal primary education was expected to reach its target this year ; it has not . 
And so now is the ideal moment for the world to renew its commitment to education . 
We must approach the Sustainable Development Goals , which aim to carry on the work of the MDGs , with a clear direction , a sense of purpose , and strong resolve . 
For our part , we have created a SDG unit in our Ministry of Planning , Development , and Reform to coordinate their timely achievement . 
We hope that other countries will show the same commitment . 
For Pakistan , education is not merely a priority - it is a policy imperative .
