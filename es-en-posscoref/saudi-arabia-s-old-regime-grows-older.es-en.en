Saudi Arabia &apos;s Old Regime Grows Older 
LONDON - The contrast between the deaths , within two days of each other , of Libya &apos;s Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz is one of terminal buffoonery versus decadent gerontocracy . 
And their demise is likely to lead to very different outcomes : liberation for the Libyans and stagnation for the Saudis . 
But the death of Sultan , at 86 , marks the beginning of a critical period of domestic and foreign uncertainty for the Kingdom . 
After all , Sultan &apos;s half-brother , King Abdullah , 87 , is still hospitalized in Riyadh , following a major operation last month . 
The regime is aging and ailing , and is perceived by the population as being on life support . 
Meanwhile , the succession is still being argued . 
Sultan &apos;s death is the first time that the burial of a Saudi royal has been delayed to give the ruling family time to decide on the next in line - a sign of internal discord ( and concord on the continuation of dynastic rule ) . 
The Saudi regime &apos;s stability now depends on its ability to maintain unity and establish clarity in its system of succession . 
With the Crown Prince &apos;s death , schisms are particularly threatening to the Kingdom &apos;s stability ( and that of oil exports ) , because the ruling Al Saud have swelled to 22,000 members , which has given rise to factional clashes among increasingly numerous claimants to power . 
Sultan had already been dead - politically , that is - for the last three years ; indeed , since June 2011 , when he left for New York for medical treatment , young Saudis speculated on numerous Web sites that this was also literally the case . 
Abdullah &apos;s octogenarian line of successors recalls the final years of the Soviet Union , when one infirm leader after another succeeded to power for a brief period of inert rule . 
Many Saudi subjects feel the same pattern of continuous uncertainty and torpor . 
Making matters worse , the rule of succession is ambiguous . 
After Abdullah succeeded his brother Fahd , who ruled for 23 years until his death in 2005 , he created an Allegiance Council , an ambiguous and mysterious family body that resembled the Vatican &apos;s College of Cardinals . 
The Council included the surviving royal princes of the 43 sons of Ibn Saud , the Kingdom &apos;s founder , and the sons of their deceased brothers - for example , the late King Faisal &apos;s brood . 
But , as Sultan &apos;s health deteriorated , Abdullah bypassed his own creation and appointed Prince Naif , the interior minister , as a second deputy . 
But , befitting this increasingly exsanguinous imperium , Naif , 82 , is known to suffer from leukemia . 
Sultan &apos;s fortune is estimated at $ 270 billion , which he distributed between his sons prior to his death in order to shore up their political position in the competitive princely arena . 
The reality is that every senior prince has placed his favorite sons in important positions in the Kingdom . 
Sultan secured the defense ministry for his son Khaled , and brought back Khaled &apos;s notorious brother , Bandar to head the Intelligence Security Council . 
Abdullah guaranteed his son Mitaeb &apos;s position as head of the National Guard . 
The new Crown Prince-in-waiting , Naif , has established his son Mohammed as the next interior minister . 
In short , despite Abdullah &apos;s innovations in the succession process , it is an open secret that nothing guarantees a transition to a younger generation of leaders - or that an effective ruler will emerge . 
The story of the Al Saud &apos;s succession struggle is no longer whispered behind closed doors . 
The Al Saud resembles a family business , established in 1932 . 
Ibn Saud managed to conquer and unite the vast territory of the Arabian Peninsula , give it his family name , and alienate , divide , and control his cousins and brothers in order to establish a clear and undisputed line of succession through his sons . 
After Ibn Saud &apos;s death , his sons , though never entirely united , maintained enough coherence to keep the store running . 
That is no longer true of the thousands of princes that they produced . 
As the older generation dies off , the new generation has fallen to fighting in front of the customers . 
Indeed , with the ratio of royals to commoners now at one to a thousand ( compared to one to five million in the United Kingdom ) , the challenge of managing princely privileges , salaries , and demand for jobs has never been more intense . 
Royal perks include lifetime sinecures and domination of the civil service , which enable the princes to award contracts and receive commissions on top of their salaries . 
So the Saudi regime is divided , its legitimacy is questioned , and sectarian tensions are growing . 
Moreover , while oil-export revenue is booming , the neighborhood is in revolutionary flames . 
In the short term , the iron-fisted Naif , as Crown Prince , will push the Kingdom into greater repression , in part by strengthening the hardline Wahhabi clerics &quot; place in the country &apos;s power nexus . 
Magnificent sums of money , backed by Wahhabi dogma , will be deployed to ensure popular submission and silence . 
Whereas Abdullah at least talked about reform ( though with no real consequences ) , Naif can barely bring himself to utter the word . 
Denial remains the Saudi rulers &quot; dominant mindset . 
The royals believe that custodianship of Islam &apos;s holy places gives them a special status in the Arab world , and that no revolution can touch them . 
And , if anyone tries , they will follow Naif &apos;s counsel : &quot; What we took by the sword we will hold by the sword . &quot; 
Throughout the region , newly mobilized ( and thus empowered ) Arab youth are trying to move their countries towards reform and liberalization . 
Saudi Arabia , unfortunately , is moving in the opposite direction .
