Saudi Arabia &apos;s Democratic Baby Step 
This month &apos;s elections in Iraq and for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority may be claiming all the world &apos;s headlines , but another potentially far-reaching ballot is also underway , albeit to far less acclaim : the registration process for the municipal elections in Saudi Arabia in mid-February . 
As the heartland of some of the strongest Islamist forces anywhere , this Saudi effort - if successful and a harbinger of other needed changes - may have an even more profound impact than the elections in Iraq and Palestine . 
Roughly 40,000 Saudis are expected to compete for 1,700 seats in 178 municipal councils . 
The enthusiasm is obvious , and the campaign is already under way and highly spirited . 
Members of the Saudi royal family are not entering the race , as they already enjoy ultimate political power . 
But , sensing the public &apos;s excitement , they have made sure to be photographed by local and international media while registering to get their electoral ID card . 
By the standards of Western , and even emerging Third World democracies , the Saudi municipal elections are an extremely modest affair . 
But in the Saudi context they are a real breakthrough . 
For Saudi Arabia is a country in which both rulers and ruled are equally arch- conservative , adhering , for the last two centuries , to the puritanical Wahhabi doctrine of Islam . 
During the last fifty years , repeated attempts by reform-oriented elements to open up Saudi Arabia &apos;s society and polity had failed . 
But recent democratic trends worldwide have now reached the shores of this medieval desert kingdom and can no longer be ignored . 
To begin with , members of the small but steadily growing Saudi middle class have increasingly expressed their discontent publicly . 
Despite legal prohibition , Saudi women have defiantly driven their cars in the streets of Riyadh , while prominent intellectuals have published open letters to King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah demanding social and political reform . 
This pressure for change has been building for years . 
The first Gulf War ( 1990-91 ) , brought nearly one million foreign fighters from 35 countries to the Arabian Peninsula , along with their modern weapons systems , communications gear , and different lifestyles . 
Such a massive foreign influx into so hermetic a country could not but have a significant domestic impact . 
Nearly all countries neighboring Saudi Arabia already practice one form of electoral participation or another , although most of these nods toward democracy are defective in some way . 
For years , ordinary Saudis watched with envy parliamentary debates on Arab satellite channels , in countries richer than theirs , such as Kuwait , as well as in poorer ones , such as Yemen and Jordan . 
Even the tiny state of Qatar has the rabble-rouser Al-Jazeera television channel , which is watched by more viewers in Saudi Arabia than in any other Arab country . 
Messages by their dissident compatriot Osama Bin Laden are periodically beamed from that channel , inciting Saudis against the royal family . 
Bin Laden &apos;s constantly highlights the House of Saud &apos;s corruption and repugnant connections with the United States . 
While democracy is not part of his agenda , his messages , as well as his followers &quot; periodic armed attacks inside the country , have no doubt contributed to the erosion of the regime &apos;s legitimacy . 
But it was the terrorist attacks on the US in September 2001 that brought a sea change in the thinking , if not yet the practice , of at least part of the Saudi regime . 
The fact that most of the perpetrators of the attacks were identified as Saudis highlighted the country &apos;s backward realities and provoked mounting international pressures for change . 
No doubt some of these pressures were motivated by sincere concerns , but others were driven by the desire of anti-Saudi groups in the US to settle old scores . 
The call for democratizing the Middle East has become a battle cry for the Bush administration , especially after the invasion and occupation of Iraq . 
Despite its reluctance to change , the Saudi royal family is obviously yielding to these multiple pressures from within , from neighbors , and from the wider world , although the extent of change is still nominal and obviously leaves much to be desired . 
Thus , for example , Saudi women , but not convicts , are barred from participating in the forthcoming municipal elections . 
Moreover , tens of human rights activists are currently in prison or on trial . 
To be sure , the Saudi system is still worlds away from being a Westminster-style democracy ; indeed , it will probably never become one . 
All the same , this municipal election should be looked upon as a giant first step in the arduous journey toward Saudi democracy . 
Despite many misgivings regarding its conduct in other areas , the Saudi regime should be commended for this initiative .
