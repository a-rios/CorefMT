The Ransom Dilemma 
PRINCETON - Anyone who does not share the ideology of the so-called &quot; Islamic State &quot; in Iraq and Syria is likely to agree that it is wrong for the group &apos;s adherents to behead some of those they have held hostage . 
Much more controversial , however , are the secret decisions by European governments to pay such groups ransoms for the release of their nationals . 
Although the Islamic State &apos;s hostages have come from several countries , so far it has beheaded only those from the United States and the United Kingdom . 
The only European hostage reported to have been executed directly by the Islamic State appears to have been a Russian , Sergey Gorbunov , but little is known about him . 
No friend or relative has come forward , and no video of his death has been released . 
Russian officials have publicly doubted that he was a Russian citizen . 
On the other hand , the Islamic State has released 15 hostages , including citizens of Italy , France , Switzerland , Denmark , and Spain . 
Rukmini Callimachi , reporting for the New York Times , has explained the difference in treatment . 
The US and UK governments have a long-standing policy of refusing to pay ransoms to terrorist organizations . 
Moreover , when Michael Foley , brother of James Foley , one of the hostages , received a ransom demand , the FBI warned him that under US law , to pay money to terrorists is a crime . 
Foley was later executed . 
By contrast , for more than a decade several European governments have been willing to pay terrorists millions of euros for the release of their captive citizens , or have facilitated the payment of ransoms by relatives and friends of hostages . 
This is notwithstanding the United Nations Security Council &apos;s unanimous adoption in January of a resolution opposing payment of such ransoms , and a similar declaration at last year &apos;s G-8 summit - which was signed by some of the governments that have continued to pay . 
France has , according to Callimachi , paid more ransom money than any other country - a total of $ 58 million since 2008 , including a single payment of $ 40 million in 2013 for four French citizens captured in Mali . 
But French policy may be changing . 
After France participated in airstrikes against the Islamic State in September 2014 , an Algerian jihadist group captured Herv√© Gourdel , a French tourist , and threatened to execute him unless France renounced its participation in the operations . 
This time France stood firm , with Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying that to retreat one inch would be to hand victory to the militants . 
Gourdel was beheaded . 
The pressure on governments to pay ransoms , or at least facilitate the payment of ransoms by families desperate to save their loved ones &quot; lives , is understandable . 
It is an application of the so-called &quot; Rule of Rescue &quot; : our perceived duty to spend almost any amount to save an identifiable victim , such as a trapped miner , an injured mountain climber , or an extremely premature baby . 
We are far less willing to invest in saving lives when the victims cannot be identified in advance , even when the number of lives saved would be higher - for example , by providing better road safety or education in preventive health measures . 
The Rule of Rescue should be understood as a rule about human psychology , not about morality . 
Applying it can seem justifiable if we put ourselves in the position of a captive , or imagine that our child , parent , or spouse has been captured by terrorists who make a credible offer to release our loved one for a ransom . 
But this argument trades on our inability to put ourselves in the position of any of the larger number of people killed by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups . 
They have become victims only because the estimated $ 125 million in ransom money paid to such groups over the past six years has enabled them to arm more militants to carry out lethal attacks . 
We ought to use our resources to save the most lives ; and , overall , paying ransoms is likely to lead to more lives being lost . 
Moreover , the additional military strength that terrorists gain from ransom revenue is not the only harm caused by paying ransoms . 
Ransoming one Western hostage creates an incentive for militants to capture another . 
Graeme Wood , a journalist who spent four years working in the Middle East , notes that journalists in dangerous areas were always at risk of being kidnapped or killed for ideological reasons ; but it does not help that a Western journalist could be worth millions of dollars , a sum he calls &quot; universally motivating . &quot; 
General John Allen , a former US commander in Afghanistan and now President Barack Obama &apos;s special envoy to the international coalition fighting the Islamic State , argues that we cannot know how many Americans have not been kidnapped because the group knows that it will not receive ransoms for them . 
He points out that &quot; the fact that there are Americans in the region who were never taken because &#91; the Islamic State and its allies &#93; knew there was no advantage to doing so needs to be factored in . &quot; 
Governments that pay ransoms are saving the lives of some of their citizens , but putting the remainder of their citizens - and others - at greater risk . 
The refusal to pay ransoms to terrorists can seem callous , but in truth it is the only ethical policy . 
Every government should adhere to it .
