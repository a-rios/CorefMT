Renminbi Rising ? 
SHANGHAI - China is increasingly debating whether or not the renminbi should be internationalized , possibly joining the US dollar and the euro as an international vehicle currency ( IVC ) - that is , a currency that other countries use to denominate the prices of their traded goods and international loans . 
Related to this is a debate about whether Shanghai can become a first-tier international financial center ( 1-IFC ) like London and New York . 
Financial history can help to answer these questions . 
First , a city can become a 1-IFC only if its national currency is an IVC . 
But , as London &apos;s status shows , a longtime 1-IFC can retain its position in the international financial system even if its currency is no longer an IVC . 
Second , the transaction cost of using a foreign currency as a medium of exchange is inversely proportional to the extent to which that currency is used globally . 
Similar economies of scale characterize foreign investors &quot; use of a particular international financial center . 
As a result , there cannot be more than three or four IVCs and 1-IFCs . 
Third , a country &apos;s financial sector must be both open , with no capital-flow restrictions , and sophisticated , with a wide range of instruments and institutions . 
It must also be safe , with a central bank maintaining economic stability , prudential regulators keeping fraud and speculation in check , macro-prudential authorities displaying adequate financial fire-fighting capabilities , and a legal system that is predictable , transparent , and fair . 
Last - and most important - successful convergence to IVC and 1-IFC status requires the national economy to be strong relative to other economies for a substantial period of time . 
The United Kingdom occupied a position of global economic leadership for more than a century . 
In 1914 , the US / UK GDP ratio was 2.1 , but the US dollar was not an IVC , suggesting that America &apos;s relative economic strength was inadequate . 
A decade later , in 1924 , the ratio was 3.2 and rising - and the US dollar had eclipsed the British pound as the most important IVC . 
Relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC , and why Tokyo - whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements - failed to become a 1-IFC . 
With its GDP reaching only about 60 % of America &apos;s at its peak in 1991 , Japan never attained the critical mass required to induce foreigners to use the yen to lower transaction costs . 
Determining the future international status of the renminbi and Shanghai must begin with a calculation of China &apos;s expected relative economic strength vis-Ã -vis the US under two plausible scenarios . 
In the first scenario , China becomes caught in a middle-income trap , with per capita GDP stuck at 30 % of America &apos;s - an outcome that has characterized Latin America &apos;s five largest economies since at least 1960 , and Malaysia since 1994 . 
This would put China &apos;s economic strength relative to the US at 1.1 - well below the necessary ratio . 
In the second , more favorable scenario , China &apos;s per capita GDP would reach 80 % of America &apos;s - higher than the 70 % average rate for the five largest Western European countries since 1960 - and its economic strength relative to the US would amount to roughly 2.8 . 
This would make the renminbi eligible for IVC status and enable Shanghai to choose whether to become a 1-IFC . 
But China &apos;s economy still would not be strong enough relative to the US for natural market forces to ensure the renminbi &apos;s international success . 
Given this , the Chinese government would have to implement decisive measures to encourage international traders and creditors to price their transactions in renminbi . 
Specifically , China would have to use its market power to promote pricing in renminbi for relevant manufactured exports and raw-material imports , and encourage renminbi denomination of foreign financial assets that China purchases ( which the country &apos;s status as a net creditor should facilitate ) . 
But there are serious pitfalls to avoid in this process . 
As the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 demonstrated , capital-account liberalization could lead to financial meltdowns - a danger that opponents of internationalizing the renminbi often cite . 
But these risks do not outweigh the potential benefits of financial openness , and they can be minimized with effective monitoring and regulation , including requirements for large capital buffers and low leverage ratios , together with strong crisis-response mechanisms , like a resolution trust corporation . 
In fact , effective financial-monitoring and prudential-regulation systems do not have to precede opening the capital account . 
On the contrary , developing and enacting financial regulation must be a gradual process , shaped by both existing knowledge and firsthand experience . 
After all , no financial market is either completely open or completely closed forever ; the degree of openness at a given moment depends on policy choices . 
The recent establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone will allow for the emergence of an offshore international financial center that offers real-world training to China &apos;s regulators . 
This will give them the tools they need to recognize the signs of a developing crisis , defuse the threat , and efficiently handle the recapitalization and reorganization of failed financial institutions . 
China &apos;s pursuit of an IVC and a 1-IFC city would serve not only its own interests . 
Allowing the renminbi to help meet global demand for international reserves and risk diversification would also strengthen global financial stability . 
There is little time to waste in internationalizing the renminbi . 
Given the limited number of currencies that can serve as IVCs , the failure of the renminbi to achieve IVC status before , say , the Indian rupee , the Russian ruble , or the Brazilian real could mean that the renminbi is denied IVC status - and that Shanghai fails to achieve 1-IFC status - for generations , if not forever .
