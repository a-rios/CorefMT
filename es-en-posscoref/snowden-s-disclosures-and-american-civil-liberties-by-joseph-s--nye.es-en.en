Surveillance and American Liberty 
CAMBRIDGE - Ever since Edward J. Snowden disclosed the National Security Agency &apos;s ongoing collection of massive amounts of electronic-communications data generated by United States citizens and non-citizens alike , attention has been lavished on his personal status . 
But the more important issue , even before Russia granted him temporary asylum , is the status of American civil liberties . 
Is the US guilty of hypocrisy , as Russia , China , and others have charged ? 
To answer that question , it is important to distinguish between two issues that have become conflated in public debate : electronic espionage against foreign entities and domestic surveillance of a government &apos;s own citizens . 
Before Snowden &apos;s disclosures , cyber espionage had become a major point of contention in US-China relations . 
The US accuses China of using cyber espionage to steal intellectual property on an unprecedented scale . 
Among other public sources , it could point to a study by the cyber-security firm Mandiant , which traced many such attacks to a People &apos;s Liberation Army facility in Shanghai . 
China counters that it is also the victim of innumerable cyber intrusions , many originating in the US . 
Both countries have a point . 
If a proverbial Martian were watching the flow of electrons between East Asia and North America , he would probably notice robust two-way traffic . 
American policy is not to steal intellectual property , while China &apos;s policy appears to be the opposite . 
At the same time , both governments constantly hack into each other &apos;s computers to steal traditional political and military secrets . 
Spying is not a violation of international law ( though it often violates various domestic laws ) , but the US argues that theft of intellectual property violates both the spirit and letter of international trade agreements . 
China is not the only country that steals intellectual property . 
Some of America &apos;s allies , now professing outrage at disclosures of US spying , have been known to do the same thing to the US . 
According to the US , when it inspects a non-American &apos;s e-mail , it is searching for terrorist connections , and has often shared the findings with its allies . 
In that sense , security surveillance can benefit both the US and other countries . 
After all , part of the plot that culminated in the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , was hatched by an Egyptian living in Hamburg . 
But the Americans are not without sin . 
As Snowden &apos;s information revealed , the US was monitoring the communications of European Union representatives as they were preparing for trade negotiations . 
This did not produce a joint benefit ; it was a bad decision , and one that Obama should renounce . 
It is tactically useful for Russia , China , and others to conflate espionage issues with civil liberties and accuse the US of hypocrisy . 
But those charges seem odd coming from countries with weak rule of law and heavy Internet censorship . 
Snowden revealed two major surveillance programs inside the US . 
In terms of civil liberties , examining the content of a message from a suspect non-American source is less controversial . 
The more hotly debated program is one in which the NSA maps the origin and destination of US citizens &quot; telephone traffic and stores it for possible later inspection ( presumably with a court order ) . 
This application of technological capacity to store what is called &quot; big data &quot; raises a new set of issues about intrusion into citizens &quot; privacy . 
Defenders of the program point out that it is consistent with current law and with America &apos;s constitutional philosophy of checks and balances , because both the legislative and judicial branches approved it . 
Opponents argue that the court created in 1978 under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) was designed for an era before the advent of big data , and that current practice stretches the provisions of the Patriot Act , passed after the September 11 attacks . 
The opponents call for new laws . 
Last month , the current legal framework survived a close vote ( 217 to 205 ) in the House of Representatives . 
Most interesting was the split in both parties . 
The opposition consisted of a coalition of conservative Tea Party Republicans and liberal Democrats . 
The issue is bound to arise again , with several pending bills proposing revisions of the FISA court . 
Rather than demonstrating hypocrisy and acceptance of the erosion of civil liberties , the Snowden disclosures have provoked a debate that suggests the US is living up to its democratic principles in its traditionally untidy ways . 
America faces a trade-off between security and liberty , but the relationship is more complex than it appears at first glance . 
The worst threats to liberties come when insecurity is greatest , so modest trade-offs can sometimes prevent greater losses . 
Even such a great defender of freedom as Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus under the extreme conditions of the American Civil War . 
And such decisions may not be recognized as mistaken or unjust until later - consider Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s internment of Japanese-American citizens early in World War II . 
In the decade after September 11 , 2001 , the pendulum of public sentiment swung too far to the security pole ; but it has begun to swing back in the absence of major new terrorist attacks . 
A recent ABC News-Washington Post poll showed that 39 % of Americans now say that protecting privacy is more important than investigating terrorist threats , up from only 18 % in 2002 . 
Ironically , the programs that Snowden revealed seem to have helped prevent massive new terrorism events , such as a bomb attack on the New York subways . 
If so , they may have prevented the implementation of more draconian anti-terrorist measures - thus enabling the current debate .
