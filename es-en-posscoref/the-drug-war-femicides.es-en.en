The Drug-War Femicides 
BARCELONA - The number of women murdered is increasing in most of Central America and Mexico . 
In some countries , such as Honduras , the increase is four times that of men . 
Moreover , many of these murders are committed with extreme violence - sexual savagery , torture , and mutilations - by perpetrators ( often involved in organized crime ) acting with a high degree of impunity . 
In countries like Chile , Argentina , and Costa Rica , where overall levels of violence are lower , the murders of women are usually committed with less violence , by partners or ex-partners in the context of &quot; domestic abuse . &quot; 
In Latin America , all of these crimes are known as &quot; femicides &quot; : murders of women precisely for being women . 
Cases associated with domestic violence are treated leniently by courts ; in some countries , jealousy or the absence of previous convictions can reduce the punishment . 
Those committed by strangers , often with intense cruelty - and often linked to organized-crime groups such as the Central American maras - rarely end up in court at all . 
But the reality of Latin America in recent years shows some crossover between these categories . 
Brutal murders of women also occur in countries such as Argentina , where a surprising number of women have been burned by their partners or ex-partners . 
In Mexico , women have been murdered by hit men , hired by their husbands or partners to make the killing look like the work of organized crime . 
And , in Central American countries , women are murdered by criminal groups as a kind of threat or message to their husbands or partners . 
Nonetheless , femicide in Latin America remains a matter of different realities . 
The rate for women in El Salvador is the highest in the region : 13.9 per 100,000 . 
In Guatemala , the rate is 9.8 per 100,000 women , and in Mexican states such as Chihuahua , Baja California , and Guerrero , the rate has almost tripled from 2005 to 2009 , to 11.1 per 100,000 . 
On the other hand , rates in countries such as Chile and Argentina are no more than 1.4 per 100,000 . 
That difference underscores a fundamental reality : violence associated with the &quot; war on drug trafficking &quot; and organized crime - including state corruption - in some countries has specific consequences for women . 
Just as in war , cruelly raping women is symbolic : it creates cohesion within armed groups , reaffirms &quot; masculinity , &quot; and is a form of attacking &quot; the enemy &apos;s morale . &quot; 
But &quot; domestic &quot; violence is also worsening : although women all over the world are threatened by their partners , the risk is substantially raised when men have easy access to arms and a very slight probability of being taken to court , as is the case in Mexico and Guatemala , where the rate of impunity is over 95 % . 
Since 2007 , various laws have been adopted specifically to sanction femicides : in Costa Rica and Chile , such laws are aimed solely at those murders committed by partners or ex-partners , while in Guatemala and El Salvador , murders committed by strangers are included . 
Similar laws and initiatives have proliferated in Mexico , too , in recent months . 
It is not clear whether these laws will actually punish the crimes or merely reduce the visibility of the numbers : if a crime requires certain difficult-to-prove elements in order to be considered a femicide , a large number of murders will remain on the books as simple homicides , and the authorities will be able to say they have &quot; reduced &quot; the femicide rate . 
In countries such as Chile or Costa Rica - as in much of the world - advocates for women &apos;s rights demand that the state prevent femicides by responding swiftly and effectively to death threats and abuse . 
In the most affected countries , they also demand that murderers be tried . 
But new laws are not enough , given severely debilitated police and judicial systems in much of the region . 
As long as the &quot; war on drugs &quot; remains good business not only for traffickers and money launderers , but also for developed countries &quot; arms industry , the flood of weapons in the region will continue to fuel violence - including extreme manifestations against women - and weaken the judicial system . 
Uncontrolled arms , together with impunity , make killing easy and cheap . 
To be sure , violence against women exists in times of peace . 
But it increases and worsens in times of war . 
The &quot; war on drugs &quot; must end , and that requires worldwide changes in drug-control policies that , unfortunately , no anti-femicide initiative mentions . 
Ending that war won &apos;t eradicate femicides in Central America and Mexico , but it could at least reduce the murder rate of women to the more &quot; salutary &quot; numbers of other countries that are lucky to be farther away from the main trafficking routes .
