Can the Euro Zone Survive Economic Recovery ? 
CAMBRIDGE - The economic recovery that the euro zone anticipates in 2010 could bring with it new tensions . 
Indeed , in the extreme , some countries could find themselves considering whether to leave the single currency altogether . 
Although the euro simplifies trade , it creates significant problems for monetary policy . 
Even before it was born , some economists ( such as myself ) asked whether a single currency would be desirable for such a heterogeneous group of countries . 
A single currency means a single monetary policy and a single interest rate , even if economic conditions - particularly cyclical conditions - differ substantially among the member countries of the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . 
A single currency also means a common exchange rate relative to other currencies , which , for any country within the euro zone , precludes a natural market response to a chronic trade deficit . 
If that country had its own currency , the exchange rate would decline , benefiting exports and impeding imports . 
Without its own currency , the only cure for a chronic trade deficit is real wage reductions or relative productivity increases . 
The European Central Bank is now pursuing a very easy monetary policy . 
Those countries whose economies remain relatively weak oppose tighter monetary policy . 
The contrast between conditions in Germany and Spain illustrates the problem . 
The unemployment rate is now about 8 % in Germany , but more than twice that - around 19 % - in Spain . 
And Germany recorded a trade surplus of $ 175 billion in the 12 months through August , whereas Spain has run a trade deficit of $ 84 billion in the past 12 months . 
If Spain and Germany still had the peseta and the D-mark as their respective currencies , the differences in trade balances would cause the mark to appreciate and the peseta to decline . 
The weaker peseta would stimulate demand for Spanish exports and reduce Spain &apos;s imports , which would boost domestic demand and reduce unemployment . 
Since the interest rate set by the ECB is now less than 1 % , there is little difference between its current monetary policy and what the Bank of Spain would do if it could set its own interest rate . But when the euro zone starts to recover , the ECB might choose to raise the interest rate before a higher rate would be appropriate for Spain , which could exacerbate Spanish unemployment . 
Spain and other high-unemployment euro-zone countries might oppose this policy but face monetary tightening nonetheless , because the ECB deems the overall state of the euro zone to warrant higher interest rates . 
Spain is not the only country that would have an incentive to leave the EMU . 
Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and even Italy are often cited as countries that might benefit from being able to pursue an independent monetary policy and allow their currencies to adjust to more competitive levels . 
The widening spreads between the interest rate on German eurobonds and some of the other countries &quot; euro bonds show that global bond markets take this risk seriously . 
For example , while the current yield on 10-year German government eurobonds is 3.33 % , the corresponding yield on Greek eurobonds is 4.7 % and 4.77 % for Ireland &apos;s eurobonds . 
These divergent yields reflect the market &apos;s perception of the risk of default or of effective devaluation associated with leaving the euro . 
Leaving the EMU would , of course , involve both technical and political issues . 
A government that wants to replace the euro with , say , the &quot; new franc &quot; ( which is not to suggest that France or Belgium would be likely to abandon the euro ) would have to reverse the process by which its currency was originally swapped for euros . 
How would the exchange rate be set for the new currency ? 
The obvious choice would be to start by exchanging one &quot; new franc &quot; for one euro and then leave it to the global currency markets to re-price the new currency . 
A country with a large initial trade deficit would expect to see its currency decline relative to the euro , say , to 1.2 &quot; new francs &quot; per euro , which would make its products 20 % cheaper than products in other euro countries and would make imports more expensive . 
If that causes a rise in the departing country &apos;s price level , the nominal exchange rate would have to decline further to achieve the same real adjustment . 
Because individuals from the departing country could continue to hold euros , leaving the EMU would not cause a loss of existing wealth . 
But such a country would have to worry about more substantial economic consequences . 
There would also be political problems . 
Would a country that leaves the EMU be given a diminished role in EcoFin , the European Economic and Financial Affairs Council ? 
Would its voice be diminished in European discussions about foreign and defense policy ? 
In the extreme , would it be forced out of the European Union altogether , thereby losing its trade advantages ? 
These economic and political risks may be enough to deter current EMU members from deciding to leave . 
At some point , the inability to deal with domestic economic problems within the EMU framework may lead one or more countries to conclude that those costs are simply too high to bear .
