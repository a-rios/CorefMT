Europe &apos;s Southern Future 
PARIS - Economic crisis has now reached both shores of the Mediterranean , and the risk of a lasting depression has become very real . 
Austerity policies in Europe threaten to backfire , causing enduring harm to growth prospects and thus stoking unemployment and budget deficits . 
And southern Mediterranean countries can &apos;t hope to make up in America and Asia the opportunities and investments that they are losing in Europe , certainly not in the short term . 
In these circumstances - and especially in view of the political upheaval in the countries of the southern Mediterranean - re-launching the Euro-Mediterranean process , and putting it on a new footing , would benefit both sides . 
The Barcelona Process , which Jacques Delors initiated in 1995 as head of the European Commission , had its merits , but failed to meet the expectations that it created . In 2005 , on the 10th anniversary of its launch , I joined political leaders from both sides of the Mediterranean in calling for a re-formulation of the partnership through the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean community . 
Such a community has now become an urgent necessity . 
Europe has technology and provides a secure framework for investment , but it is the southern Mediterranean that increasingly can point to strong economic growth . 
Europe is aging and will lose 20 million people by 2030 , while the southern Mediterranean has a dynamic young population that desperately needs job opportunities . 
The EU currently imports half of its energy supplies - in 20 years , the import share will be 70 % . 
Yet , to its immediate south , energy resources and raw materials are plentiful . A European energy community would accelerate Europe &apos;s low-carbon transition and stimulate development of renewable energies . It could also eventually lead to a Euro-Mediterranean energy community - one of the proposals made by the European Commission earlier this year . 
These complementarities hold great potential for both sides . 
A return to economic growth is crucial for Europe , which needs secure new investment flows . 
North-South flows are already extremely low , with the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries receiving only 3 % of global foreign direct investment . 
To boost investment in both directions , a zone of monetary stability should be created . 
A Euro-Mediterranean monetary system would avoid the discrepancy between euro- and dollar-denominated trade - indeed , eventual expansion of the eurozone should not be ruled out . A reliable legal framework for exports and investments is also needed , and a targeted development bank would help to create a financial environment favorable to investment . 
Industrial re-deployment might also be the answer to outsourcing by European companies , so we need to build an integrated Euro-Mediterranean structure that encourages industrial , agricultural , energy , and job mobility . 
Central and Eastern Europe is the example worth studying closely : in tandem with Germany , these countries developed and strengthened high-value-added industrial sectors . 
At the same time , jobs mobility should replace unwanted migration . 
Mobility for students and professors should be accompanied by improved occupational mobility for both European and African workers . 
Europe could finance more and better training to help meet its own labor shortages , while African countries would be able to provide employment for their young people . And a Euro-Mediterranean and Euro-African version of the Erasmus student-exchange program would not only attract African students to Europe , but would also boost European students &quot; interest in the development of the southern Mediterranean and Africa . 
By 2050 , Europe and Africa together will have 2.5 billion people , a quarter of the global population . With so much human potential , it will be possible to build on shared economic , social , and ecological strengths . A great North-South regional grouping of this type could negotiate in international institutions - most notably the World Trade Organization - from a stronger position , and so preserve its own development model , one based on proximity , complementarity , and solidarity . 
Fair trade and the sharing of added value should replace free-trade imbalances and the export of unprocessed raw materials . International trade must bring about a rise in social and environmental standards , which requires a multilateral Euro-Mediterranean system . This , in turn , presupposes a North African &quot; common market &quot; - and thus rapid resolution of the conflict between Algeria and Morocco , which has been holding back both countries &quot; development ( as well as that of Tunisia and Mauritania ) . 
A Euro-Mediterranean Union leading to a Euro-African Union could open the way to balanced mutual development . 
As Europe knows , constructing an economically and socially integrated zone offers the best opportunity to resolve conflicts and overcome political and cultural enmities . But all partners must first get their own houses in order : Europe must strengthen its economic and political integration , and Africa must improve its governance by fighting corruption and establishing the rule of law more firmly . 
Asia revolves around ASEAN , and the Americas around NAFTA and Mercosur . 
Europe , too , needs to help organize a large hemispheric region . 
Building a joint future for Europe and Africa , starting with the Mediterranean , will be difficult , but that is no reason to delay . 
Indeed , a Euro-Mediterranean and then Euro-African union may well be the only political project capable of preventing global rule by a G-2 of the United States and China .
