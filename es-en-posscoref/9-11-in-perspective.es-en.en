9 / 11 in Perspective 
NEW YORK - It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes , flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center , hit the Pentagon with a third , and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission . 
September 11 , 2001 , was a terrible tragedy by any measure , but it was not a historical turning point . 
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed , or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace . 
On the contrary , 9 / 11 has not been replicated . 
Despite the attention devoted to the &quot; Global War on Terrorism , &quot; the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies , globalization , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the political upheavals in the Middle East . 
As for the future , it is much more likely to be defined by the United States &quot; need to put its economic house in order ; 
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world . 
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best . 
They can destroy but not create . 
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda . 
Moreover , measures have been implemented to push back , successfully , against terrorists . 
Intelligence assets have been redirected . 
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient . 
International cooperation has increased markedly , in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area . 
Military force has played a role as well . 
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power . 
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad . 
Drones - unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered - have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists , including many of the most important leaders . 
Weak governments can be made stronger ; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable . 
But progress is not to be confused with victory . 
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease . 
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men , women , and children in pursuit of political goals . 
Indeed , terrorists are advancing in some areas . 
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world &apos;s other most dangerous terrorists . 
A mixture of instability , government weakness , and ideology in countries such as Yemen , Libya , Somalia , and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize , train , and mount operations - much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago . 
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones . 
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism . 
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US . 
The Internet , one of the great inventions of the modern Western world , has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world . 
The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today : &quot; Are we capturing , killing , or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting , training , and deploying against us ? &quot; 
All things being equal , we probably are . 
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives , money , and making open societies less so . 
What is to be done ? 
Alas , there is no single or silver bullet . 
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state , any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-Ã -vis India . 
Reducing unemployment is desirable , of course , but many terrorists do not come from poverty . 
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse , but this is easier said than done . 
Of course , we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so . 
But what may be most important , particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities , is to end any acceptance of terrorism . 
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do - before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 - is an example of just this . 
Only when more parents , teachers , and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police . 
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency .
