The Dollar &apos;s Last Days ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Zhou Xiaochuan , the governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China , recently suggested that replacing the dollar with the International Monetary Fund &apos;s Special Drawing Rights as the dominant reserve currency would bring greater stability to the global financial system . 
The idea of reforming the system by introducing a supranational reserve currency is also , it appears , supported by Russia and other emerging markets . 
And a United Nations advisory committee chaired by the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has argued for a new global reserve currency , possibly one based on the SDR . 
Transforming the dollar standard into an SDR-based system would be a major break with a policy that has lasted more than 60 years . 
The SDR was introduced 40 years ago to supplement what was then seen as an inadequate level of global reserves , and was subsequently enshrined in the IMF &apos;s amended Articles of Agreement as the future principal reserve asset . 
But the world soon became awash in dollars . 
So , instead of becoming the principal reserve asset of the global system , the proportion of SDRs in global reserves shrank to a tiny fraction , rendering the SDR the monetary equivalent of Esperanto . 
Although the euro , created in 1999 , turned out to be a more serious competitor to the dollar , its share in total international reserves has probably remained below 30 % , compared to 65 % for the dollar ( these shares are in part estimates , as China , the world &apos;s largest holder of reserves , does not report the currency composition of its holdings ) . 
There are two ways in which the dollar &apos;s role in the international monetary system can be reduced . 
One possibility is a gradual , market-determined erosion of the dollar as a reserve currency in favor of the euro . 
But , while the euro &apos;s international role - especially its use in financial markets - has increased since its inception , it is hard to envisage it overtaking the dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the foreseeable future . 
Such an outcome is probably only possible if two conditions are met : first , the United Kingdom joins the euro area , and , second , the United States makes serious , confidence-sapping mistakes . 
The latter condition may already have been partially met , but US policies to stabilize its financial system should help avoid a major dollar slide . 
Moreover , the European Central Bank has repeatedly stated that it neither encourages nor discourages the euro &apos;s international role . 
With the dollar &apos;s hegemony unlikely to be seriously undermined by market forces , at least in the short and medium-term , the only way to bring about a major reduction in its role as a reserve currency is by international agreement . 
The Chinese proposal falls into this category . 
One way to make the SDR the major reserve currency relatively soon would be to create and allocate a massive amount of new SDRs to the IMF &apos;s members . 
While the G-20 leaders have decided to support an SDR allocation of $ 250 billion , this will increase the share of SDRs in total international reserves to no more than 4 % . 
In order to make the SDR the principal reserve asset via the allocation route , close to $ 3 trillion in SDRs would need to be created , an unrealistic proposition . 
But there is a more realistic way for the SDR &apos;s importance to grow . 
Back in 1980 , the IMF came close to adopting a so-called SDR Substitution Account . 
The idea was to permit countries whose official dollar holdings were larger than they were comfortable with to convert dollars into SDRs . 
Conversion would occur outside the market , and thus would not put downward pressure on the dollar . 
Member countries would receive an asset that was more stable than the dollar , as it was based on a basket of currencies , thereby providing better protection against losses . 
The plan fell apart when some major IMF shareholders could not accept the burden-sharing arrangements that would be necessary in case of losses due to exchange-rate movements . 
The US also lost interest in the scheme as the dollar strengthened . 
What are the chances of adopting a scheme of this kind today ? 
Is the US prepared to go along with a reform of the international monetary system that reduces the dollar &apos;s role ? 
Until recently , I would have considered this unlikely . 
But the changed international climate , and the possibility of a bout of severe dollar weakness , could convince the US to go along with a conversion scheme that would alleviate excessive pressure on the dollar . 
And , apart from possible political considerations , large holders of dollars would find a substitution account attractive as a form of protection against strong fluctuations in the dollar &apos;s value . 
What about possible losses suffered by the Substitution Account ? 
This can be dealt with by setting aside part of the IMF &apos;s large gold stock . 
Even if an SDR Substitution Account is established , it is unlikely that the dollar &apos;s share in international reserves would fall to an insignificant level . 
The dollar will remain important for many countries as a vehicle for intervention in foreign-exchange markets , as well as for invoicing and for denominating internationally traded securities . 
But one can envisage a system in which international reserves are held each in roughly equal shares of dollars , euros ( assuming a further gradual increase in its share ) , and SDRs . 
While there are currently other priorities , it would be useful for the IMF to study anew an SDR substitution account and similar schemes . 
If it does not , the debate will take place elsewhere .
