Adapting to Climate Change 
COPENHAGEN - Striking the right balance between preventing global warming and adapting to its effects is one of the most important - and most vexing - policy questions of our age . 
It is also often ignored . 
According to the conventional wisdom of many environmental campaigners , we should first do everything we can to mitigate global warming , and only then focus on adaptation strategies . 
This seems wrong - even immoral - if we could do more for people and the planet through adaptation . 
Moreover , it is inconsistent with the inescapable fact that , whatever we do , we cannot prevent all of global warming &apos;s effects . 
If we are ill-prepared , global warming will cause more deaths and devastation , especially in poor countries and fragile societies . 
Adaptation would also mean saving many lives from catastrophes not related to global warming . 
If we prepare societies for more ferocious hurricanes in the future , for example , we are also helping them to cope better with today &apos;s extreme weather . 
There has been a huge amount of research into the ways that humans cause climate change , and how we can reduce it . 
Much less work has been devoted to adaptation . 
It is important to acknowledge that some adaptation strategies will lead to more greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Responding to water scarcity by re-using and treating wastewater , or through deep-well pumping and desalination , will increase fossil-fuel use . 
Using more air-conditioning to cool our houses in summer will do the same - although this is vital if we want to save lives . 
Adaptation could allow for higher carbon emissions in another way : reducing the damage and harm that we experience from global warming , giving us more time to implement alternatives to reliance on fossil fuels . 
Should any of this stop us from using adaptation strategies ? 
To arrive at an informed answer , we need to work out how the planet will look in 2100 if we invest different amounts in adaptation and carbon cuts . 
We need to take into account the increase in emissions that adaptation will cause . 
The most critical issue isn &apos;t any rise or fall in emissions . 
It is how much climate damage we can avoid . 
How much of the planet can we help by dealing with rising sea levels ? 
How many lives can we spare from heat , starvation , or malaria ? 
These are the real reasons we care about global warming . 
Reaching a proper answer to these questions requires extensive economic modeling , with different variables calculated and regional differences analyzed . 
New research by three Italian economists , Francesco Bosello , Carlo Carraro , and Enrica De Cian does this , and , ultimately , provides a powerful economic case for a much greater focus on adaptation . 
They first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-century . 
This work is based on standard scenarios , and carries the typical caveats of predictions far into the future . 
Nevertheless , they find that many of our biggest concerns will turn out to be trivial , or even beneficial . 
Sea-level rises will be a very minor concern for every country , with the financial impact adding up to less than 0.1 % of GDP . 
Health problems will be negligible for all but a few nations . 
And global warming &apos;s impact would reduce energy consumption for almost all nations . 
The important effects are on agriculture and tourism , where nations will lose , on average , about 0.5 % of GDP from each sector . 
But much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment . 
Farmers will choose plants that thrive in heat . 
New houses will be designed to deal with warmer temperatures . 
Simple economic models , often quoted in the media , show that unconstrained global warming would cost a substantial 2 % of GDP in the rich world by the end of the century . 
Taking adaptation into account , rich countries will adapt to the negative consequences of global warming and exploit the positive changes , creating a total 
Poor countries will be hit harder , however . 
Adaptation will reduce the climate change-related losses from 5 % of GDP to slightly less than 3 % - but this is still a significant impact . 
The real challenge of global warming , therefore , lies in tackling its impact on the Third World . 
Here , more needs to be done , above and beyond the adaptation that will happen naturally . 
Importantly , the new research shows that adaptation would achieve a lot more than cuts in carbon emissions . 
Reducing emissions to a level that does not extinguish economic growth could avert $ 3 trillion worth of damage , whereas adaptation could prevent around $ 8 trillion worth of damage . 
For every dollar spent on adaptation , we would achieve about $ 1.70 worth of positive changes for the planet . 
The economic case for focusing more on adaptation is clear . 
The crucial next step is to ensure that economic arguments become a stronger part of our political debate about how to address global warming .
