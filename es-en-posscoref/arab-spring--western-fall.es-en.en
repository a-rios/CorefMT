Arab Spring , Western Fall 
TEL AVIV - The old vocation of what Rudyard Kipling called the &quot; White Man &apos;s Burden &quot; - the driving idea behind the West &apos;s quest for global hegemony from the days of imperial expansion in the nineteenth century to the current , pathetically inconclusive , Libyan intervention - has clearly run out of steam . 
Politically and economically exhausted , and attentive to electorates clamoring for a shift of priorities to urgent domestic concerns , Europe and America are no longer very capable of imposing their values and interests through costly military interventions in faraway lands . 
US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was stating the obvious when he recently lambasted NATO &apos;s European members for their lukewarm response to the alliance &apos;s missions , and for their poor military capabilities . 
( Ten weeks into the fighting in Libya , the Europeans were already running out of munitions . ) 
He warned that if Europe &apos;s attitude to NATO did not change , the Alliance would degenerate into &quot; collective military irrelevance . &quot; 
Europe &apos;s reluctance to participate in military endeavors should not come as a revelation . 
The Old Continent has been immersed since World War II in a &quot; post-historical &quot; discourse that rules out the use of force as a way to resolve conflicts , let alone to bring about regime change . 
And now it is engaged in a fateful struggle to secure the very existence and viability of the European Union . 
As a result , Europe is retreating into a narrow regional outlook - and assuming that America will carry the burden of major global issues . 
But America itself is reconsidering its priorities . 
These are trying economic times for the US , largely owing to imperial overstretch financed by Chinese credit . 
Admiral Mike Mullen , the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , recently defined America &apos;s colossal fiscal deficits as the biggest threat to its national security . 
Indeed , at a time of painful budget cuts - the US is facing a $ 52 trillion shortfall on public pensions and health care in the coming decades - the US can no longer be expected to maintain its current level of global military engagement . 
But the fiscal crisis is not the whole story . 
The dire lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will shape future debate about America &apos;s international role in the twenty-first century . 
At an address in February to cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point , Gates said that &quot; any future defense secretary who advises the president to send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have his head examined . &quot; 
Gates &apos;s recent statements are by no means those of a lonely isolationist in an otherwise interventionist America . 
He expressed a widely perceived imperative for strategic reassessment . 
In 1947 , in a landmark article , &quot; The Sources of Soviet Conduct , &quot; which he signed as &quot; X , &quot; George Kennan defined America &apos;s foreign-policy strategy for the Cold War as one of containment and deterrence . 
It is difficult to imagine a more marked departure from Kennan &apos;s concepts than a report recently released by the Pentagon - A National Strategic Narrative - authored by two active-duty military officers who signed as &quot; Y. &quot; 
The report can be dismissed as just the musings of two senior members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff writing in their &quot; personal capacity . &quot; 
But its real power stems from the degree to which it reflects America &apos;s mood in an era of declining global influence and diminishing expectations regarding the relevance of military power to sustaining US global hegemony . 
Just as Kennan &apos;s &quot; X &quot; article was fully reflective of the mood in America at the time , so the Narrative expresses the current American Zeitgeist . 
Thus , the idea that &quot; Y &quot; might turn out to be a latter-day &quot; X &quot; - defining the nature of America &apos;s international role in the twenty-first century - may not be far-fetched . 
Conspicuously , there is much in the Narrative that coincides with Europe &apos;s emphasis on soft power . 
The authors call for a shift from outdated Cold War strategies of &quot; power and control &quot; to one of civic engagement and sustainable prosperity . 
Security , they maintain , means more than defense . 
It means engagement whereby America should not seek &quot; to bully , intimidate , cajole , or persuade others to accept our unique values or to share our national objectives . &quot; 
America , &quot; Y &quot; argues , must first put its own house in order if it is to recover credible global influence as a beacon of prosperity and justice . 
This would require improving America &apos;s diplomatic capabilities , as well as regaining international competitiveness through greater investment in education and infrastructure at home . 
The message emanating now from the US is not one of non-interventionism , but a strategy of restraint that assumes that there are limits to American power and seeks to minimize the risk of entanglement in foreign conflicts . 
As Gates put it in his West Point address , the US Army would no longer be &quot; a Victorian nation-building constabulary designed to chase guerrillas , build schools , or sip tea . &quot; 
The bad news is that Europe &apos;s feebleness and America &apos;s fatigue might also signal the limits of noble ideas such as the obligation to interfere in order to protect populations being brutalized by their own rulers . 
America &apos;s reluctance to be drawn into the Libyan quagmire , and the West &apos;s failure to intervene in order to stop the Syrian army from massacring civilians , now looks like a sad , and fairly accurate , guide to the future .
