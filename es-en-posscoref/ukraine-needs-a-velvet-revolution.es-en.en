Ukraine Needs A Velvet Revolution 
Ukraine is wracked by the biggest protests seen since communism &apos;s collapse over a decade ago . 
Julia Tymoshenko , a former deputy prime minister turned dissident , explains why . 
A poisoned public atmosphere threatens everyone who lives in Ukraine . 
Corruption and incompetence have forged a state in which tens of millions of lives lay broken and hopeless ; where vast swathes of the economy are in ruin ; where internal and external debts multiply into many billions of dollars ; and where an inept army of corrupt bureaucrats presides over a government that cannot meet the most elementary needs of Ukraine &apos;s people . 
President Leonid Kuchma &apos;s regime tries to lull both Ukrainians and the outside world about this dark state of affairs . 
It parrots soothing words about democratic principles , about the need for &quot; social stability , &quot; and about signs of long-term economic growth that it alone sees . 
For as Kuchma &apos;s government mouths its platitudes , its cronies loot the national patrimony , handing it over to family and friends while they desecrate , plunder and sell the nation &apos;s independence to the highest bidder . 
Why should people outside of Ukraine care ? 
Ukraine &apos;s fate matters because the country plays an important role in how the countries of the former Soviet Union are perceived . 
A strong , prosperous Ukraine would make the whole region east of the Elbe look different . 
A weak , poor Ukraine will always be in danger of whetting the appetites of Russia &apos;s unvanquished nationalists , thus undermining President Putin &apos;s efforts to make Russia a normal European country . 
It will also incite fears of chaos in our neighbors . 
Those risks are enhanced by the fact that Ukraine &apos;s economy is hugely in hock to Russia . 
Because of the mess Mr. Kuchma has made of the economy , our thirst for Russian energy is not matched by an ability to pay the bill for these imports . 
Moreover , under President Kuchma , the country is unable to respond to the West &apos;s strategic interests in Ukraine with practical signs of cooperation . 
The European Union rebuffs Ukraine &apos;s approaches with increasing coldness . 
The West &apos;s readiness to bail the country out has been stretched to the limit . 
The cause of this situation is clear . 
Today we note with bitterness that there is only one free person in Ukraine : its president . 
He is free to do what he wants- free to betray state priorities , free to crush the life of every Ukrainian ; free to hand out bits and pieces of the national economy to the favored few who do his bidding . 
He is also Ukraine &apos;s only independent person- independent of his electoral promises ; independent of responsibility for Ukraine &apos;s destiny and that of its people ; independent of charity for the homeless and poor . 
Independent , too , of global opinion , which long ago eliminated him from the list of respectable politicians . 
Little of this gets reported ( in or outside of Ukraine ) because President Kuchma &apos;s arsenal of intimidation is vast . 
Indeed , the heads of opposition or investigative journalists can literally be cut off , as happened in the case Georgi Gongadze , whose fate was prefigured in taped recordings on which President Kuchma is heard calling for Gongadze &apos;s elimination . 
Journalists are tortured , abducted , beaten , deprived of their jobs , and their families are threatened . 
But more than silence about Kuchma &apos;s actions results . 
These threats make it certain that lies are printed and broadcast - lies that are the backbone of Kuchma &apos;s regime . 
Opponents , too , find themselves under threat . 
At this moment , the President &apos;s men are seeking to strip me of my parliamentary immunity . 
Previously , I was twice arrested on charges that even Mr. Kuchma &apos;s tame courts failed to pursue . 
I have even found myself in supposed &quot; automobile accidents , &quot; an epidemic of which appears to effect President Kuchma &apos;s opponents . 
As The Economist pointed out , a shockingly large number of opposition figures somehow lose their lives on Ukraine &apos;s roads and in other strange ways . 
Ukraine &apos;s people tried to change their government in last spring &apos;s parliamentary elections . 
The majority of voters supported parties that opposed President Kuchma . 
But the president manipulated Ukraine &apos;s parliamentary procedures to continue his policies of divide and misrule . 
So Ukrainians must find another legitimate means to restore their democratic choice . 
Parliament must impeach President Kuchma . 
Ukrainians of all walks of life are engaged in peaceful nationwide protests to bring about both this change and early presidential elections . 
Some 200,000 of us braved arrest in central Kiev this week to demand Kuchma &apos;s eviction from power . 
Of course , taking democracy &quot; to the streets &quot; is never an easy choice . 
Ukraine &apos;s current autumn of discontent can end , as Shakespeare suggested , in a glorious summer , for our protests seek to change our government by legitimate democratic means , to restore normal life , and to revitalize democracy and economic development in Ukraine .
