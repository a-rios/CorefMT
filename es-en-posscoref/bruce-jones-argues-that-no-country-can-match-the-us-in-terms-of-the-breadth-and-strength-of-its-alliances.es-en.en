America &apos;s Enduring Leadership 
WASHINGTON , DC - Many observers have cited the crisis in Ukraine as yet another example of American retrenchment and declining global influence . 
Some have also interpreted it as evidence of a Russian-led effort to mobilize the major emerging economies - Brazil , India , and China - against the West . 
While there is a kernel of truth in both narratives , each is a gross exaggeration , as is the notion that America &apos;s capacity to shape a secure and prosperous international system is in decline . 
The US has had a rough few years . 
After two long , draining wars , its withdrawal from Afghanistan is inching along slowly . 
In Syria , Russian and Chinese intransigence have frustrated its efforts to find a diplomatic solution . 
Meanwhile , many of America &apos;s European allies are mired in economic malaise . 
Nonetheless , the US remains the most influential global actor - not least because of the strong alliances that it maintains . 
All of the attention given to China &apos;s economic rise - and , to a lesser extent , that of India and Brazil - has overshadowed the success of US allies like South Korea , Turkey , Indonesia , and Germany . 
In fact , the vast majority of the world &apos;s strongest economies are allied with the US . 
Moreover , far from coalescing into a united anti-Western bloc , the emerging powers remain sharply divided . 
There are far more overlapping interests between the established and the emerging powers than the &quot; West versus the rest &quot; narrative suggests ; indeed , the rising powers often share as many interests with their Western counterparts as they do with each other . 
Given this , even the economic powerhouses that are not US allies do not want to upend the existing world order , but rather to gain more space within it , such as through increased authority in international institutions . 
After all , they rose precisely by integrating themselves into the global economic system . 
Even China , which arguably seeks to curtail US leadership in some domains , has no choice but to cooperate with the US and its allies on many foreign-policy issues . 
China can challenge American leadership only if others follow it , and so far it has found few takers . 
Only Russia has sought to play a more destabilizing role - during the global financial crisis , in Syria , and now in Ukraine . 
To be sure , the emerging powers do share a strong inclination toward rivalry - or at least toward autonomy - which is rooted in what might be called the &quot; psychology of rise . &quot; 
This is particularly true for China , because its domestic stability and international influence depend largely on its ability to maintain rapid economic growth , which demands ever-larger quantities of imported energy and other natural resources . 
To ensure unimpeded access to these critical resources , China needs stability in the countries from which it can extract them , in the markets in which it can invest , and in the routes linking China to its suppliers . 
In short , striking a balance between the impulse toward rivalry and incentives encouraging restraint is the most important dynamic in contemporary international affairs . 
Of course , the US will invariably face new challenges , all of which are on vivid display in Ukraine . 
Countries will be torn between retaining their security ties to the US and building new economic linkages with China . 
The complex global systems in which America &apos;s interests are enmeshed will test US diplomacy . 
Perhaps the most dangerous challenge is the prospect of emerging powers leaning increasingly toward autonomy , instead of alliance . 
China and India may not have been happy about Russia &apos;s actions in Ukraine , but none of the emerging economies could bring itself to vote against Russia in the United Nations General Assembly , even though the vote was ultimately meaningless . 
( China took the strongest position in the Security Council by abstaining . ) 
They are not sticking with Russia ; but they are not joining a Western effort to isolate Russia , either . 
Ultimately , however , the world &apos;s relentless evolution plays to America &apos;s most important strength : its unique ability to build broad and disparate coalitions . 
The range of alliances and relationships that the US has created , including with several of the rising powers , far surpasses that of any other global actor - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future . 
This is perhaps the most enduring feature of American power . 
There is no denying that the US no longer enjoys the unrivaled hyperpower status that it did at the end of the Cold War .
