Europeanizing Europe 
BERLIN - The eurozone is at the center of the global financial crisis , because only there , in the realm of the second most important currency after the dollar , does the crisis hit a weak &quot; structure &quot; rather than a state with real power . 
It is a structure that is squandering the trust of citizens and markets in its ability to resolve conflicts - while pushing the international financial system to the brink of disaster . 
In other words , the financial crisis now reflects a political crisis of the eurozone - one that calls into question the very existence of the European project as a whole . 
If Europe &apos;s monetary union fails , not much of the common market , or of European institutions and treaties , will be left . 
We would have to write off six decades of successful European integration , with unknown consequences . 
This failure would coincide with the emergence of a new world order , as two centuries of Western predominance come to an end . 
Power and wealth are shifting towards East Asian and other emerging countries , while America will be preoccupied with its own problems and turning from the Atlantic towards the Pacific . 
If Europeans don &apos;t address their interests now , no one will do it for them . 
If Europe today does not become the agent of its own destiny , it will become the object of new world powers . 
The cause of the European crisis is not three decades of neo-liberalism . 
Nor is it the result of the collapse of a speculation-fueled asset bubble , the violation of the Maastricht criteria , ballooning debt , or greedy banks . 
As important as all of these factors are , Europe &apos;s problem is not what happened , but what did not happen : the creation of a common European government . 
At the beginning of the 1990 &quot; s , when the majority of the European Union &apos;s member states decided to form a monetary union with a common currency and a central bank , the idea of a central government lacked support . 
As a result , that phase of the monetary union &apos;s construction was postponed , leaving an impressive edifice that lacked a strong foundation to ensure stability in times of crisis . 
Monetary sovereignty was made a common cause ; but the power needed to exercise it remained in national capitals . 
It was believed at the time that formalized rules - imposing mandatory limits on deficits , debt , and inflation - would be enough . 
But this foundation of rules turned out to be an illusion : principles always need the support of power ; otherwise they cannot stand the test of reality . 
The eurozone , a confederation of sovereign states with a common currency and common principles and mechanisms , is now failing that test . 
Unable to respond decisively to a crisis , the eurozone is losing the confidence that is any currency &apos;s most important asset . 
Unless political power in Europe is Europeanized , with the current confederation evolving into a federation , the eurozone - and the EU as a whole - will disintegrate . 
The political , economic , and financial costs of renationalization would be enormous ; an EU collapse is feared around the world for good reason . 
By contrast , if the currency union &apos;s political deficit is addressed now , first by establishing a fiscal union ( a common budget and common liabilities ) , a real political federation will be possible . 
And let us be clear : anything less than a United States of Europe will not be powerful enough to prevent the looming disaster . 
Like it or not , the eurozone will have to act as the EU &apos;s avant-garde , because the EU as a whole , with its 27 member states , will be neither willing nor able to accelerate political unification . 
Unfortunately , unanimous support for the necessary EU treaty changes simply could not be secured . 
So , what should be done ? 
Europeans made decisive progress on integration outside the scope of the EU treaties ( but very much in the European spirit ) when they agreed to open their borders with the so-called Schengen Agreement ( today a part of the EU treaties ) . 
Drawing on that successful experience , the eurozone should avoid the EU &apos;s original sin of creating a supra-national structure that lacked democratic legitimization . 
The eurozone needs a government , which , as things stand at the moment , can consist only of the respective heads of state and government - a development that has already started . 
And , because there can be no fiscal union without a common budget policy , nothing can be decided without the national parliaments . 
This means that a &quot; European Chamber , &quot; comprising national parliaments &quot; leaders , is indispensable . 
Initially , such a chamber could be an advisory body , with the national parliaments maintaining their competencies ; later , on the basis of an intergovernmental treaty , it must become a real parliamentary control and decision-making body , made up of national parliaments &quot; delegated members . 
Of course , because a treaty of this kind would mean extensive transfer of sovereignty to European intergovernmental institutions , it would need direct popular legitimization through referendums in all member states , including ( and especially ) Germany . 
None of this addresses important questions , such as common policies to ensure economic stability and promote growth . 
But , if we have learned anything from the current crisis , it is that such issues cannot even be framed unless and until the eurozone has a reliable institutional framework , with a sturdy foundation consisting of a real government , effective parliamentary control , and genuine democratic legitimization .
