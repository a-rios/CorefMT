Reviving a Policy Marriage 
WASHINGTON , DC - Not long ago , the separation of financial supervision and monetary policy was in vogue in many countries . 
Some countries - like the United Kingdom and Australia - went so far as to unbundle these functions by assigning responsibility for financial stability to specialized agencies and extricating their central banks from financial supervisory issues altogether . 
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis , however , financial supervision and macroeconomic management have been forced to reunite . 
This rapprochement is a consequence of the growing recognition that asset-price cycles must be taken into account for both macroeconomic management and financial supervision . 
Prior to the crisis , asset-price cycles were seen by many as basically harmless or , at least , as a relatively insignificant monetary-policy channel . 
Even when the frequent appearance of asset-price bubbles was acknowledged , most believed that efforts to detect and prick them at an early stage would be impossible - and potentially harmful . 
Interest-rate cuts after bubbles burst would be a safer way to safeguard the economy . 
The dominant policy blueprint looked roughly as follows : the monetary authorities &quot; focus on inflation-targeting in setting interest rates should suffice to maintain price stability and economic growth near its potential rate . 
As for financial supervision , stability would be guaranteed by ensuring that individual financial institutions adopt sound prudential rules that preserve capital cushions commensurate with their risk exposure . 
While central banks should be in charge of maintaining adequate levels of liquidity in the system , so-called &quot; microprudential &quot; financial regulation should independently oversee financial institutions &quot; soundness and the protection of depositors . 
The crisis has shattered the belief that well designed microprudential rules alone are sufficient . 
It is now increasingly recognized that significant asset-price increases ( for example , in real estate or existing equities ) may well be reinforced by the pro-cyclical nature of risk assessment embodied in those rules . 
What this means is simpler than it sounds : the rising value of collateral tends to be seen as offering higher repayment probabilities . 
Moreover , if financial institutions follow their own risk assessments when estimating appropriate capital cushions , the costs associated with such provisions decline . 
Better repayment prospects and lower regulatory capital costs then fuel the asset-based financing of further acquisition of assets . 
If asset-price bubbles develop , balance sheets may look sound individually , but the entire network of interlinked asset-liability structures will become increasingly dependent on overvalued collateral , and thus vulnerable to financial contagion . 
The unraveling of such a network - through panic and runs against financial institutions , asset fire sales , credit crunches , and the like - then becomes a nightmare for financial supervisors and monetary authorities alike . 
Moreover , systemic risks potentially created during periods of booming asset prices escape the purview of macroprudential rules . 
In the advanced economies at the core of the recent financial crisis , the rules , implicit or explicit , of strict inflation-targeting regimes led monetary authorities to stay put while a massive pyramid of debt was built on a base of overvalued collateral . 
Now financial risks are deemed to be sufficiently important for macroeconomic management to warrant regulatory arrangements going beyond that of the microprudential supervisor . 
With respect to financial supervision , there has been increasing support since the crisis for countercyclical capital requirements , at least for banks . 
Capital buffers to absorb losses during the downturn of the cycle can be more easily built during the upswing . 
Furthermore , by raising regulatory capital costs in boom times , some counterweight to the pro-cyclical bias intrinsic to financial systems would be introduced . 
Such countercyclical capital requirements are likely to be added to the toolkit of macroprudential rules and policies , the use of which has risen as enthusiasm for light-touch financial supervision has faded . 
Those tools include caps , linked to borrowers &quot; characteristics , on loan-to-value ratios ; direct limits on currency and maturity mismatches in financial institutions &quot; balance sheets ; limits on their balance sheets &quot; interconnectedness ; and minimum reserve requirements for specific financial instruments . 
Beyond capital rules , however , monetary policy and financial supervision must cooperate very closely on liquidity management , particularly through credit mechanisms . 
Given modern financial systems &quot; demonstrated ability to create ( and destroy ) liquidity endogenously - via financial innovation and global mobility - financial and macroeconomic stability may become more difficult to achieve if monetary instruments and macroprudential tools are not used in a consistent manner . 
Policy harmonization , rather than separation , seems to be the key to happy cyclical endings .
