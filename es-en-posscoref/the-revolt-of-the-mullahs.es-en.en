The Revolt of the Mullahs 
Iran &apos;s election fiasco seemingly confirmed for Iranian reformists a conclusion that tens of millions of Iranian citizens reached long ago - the country &apos;s Islamic government , as it exists today , is beyond rehabilitation . 
Whether ordinary Iranians now believe that the reformers are also beyond redemption is an open question . 
Iranian reformers had tried ( to no avail ) since the landslide 1997 election of President Mohammed Khatami , to change the system from within . 
Iranians were initially hopeful , but after years of waiting in vain they grew impatient . 
Now they are despondent . 
Reformists were justly criticized for lacking unity and resolve , but in truth their greatest impediment was a lack of constitutional authority . 
Power in Iran lies in the hands of the unelected conservative establishment , namely Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the twelve-member Islamic Guardian Council . 
The Guardian Council &apos;s barring of over 2,000 mostly reformist candidates from participating in the parliamentary elections was the last straw . 
Reformist parties boycotted the vote . 
Despite a frenzied public relations campaign by regime officials , only half of all eligible voters participated . 
In Tehran , the country &apos;s political heart and soul , less than a third of the electorate turned out . 
Foreign journalists declared it the biggest legitimacy crisis in the 25-year history of the Islamic Republic , but Iranians seemed surprised by the commotion . 
Egregious abuse of power by conservative hardliners is not newsworthy to them . 
They held no illusions that their country was a democracy . 
Iran &apos;s near-term political future remains unclear . 
How reformists regroup , and how the youthful Iranian populace reacts , depends largely on the path the conservatives take . 
Similar to reformists , who encompass a broad range of political ideals , Iranian conservatives are a mixed bag . 
Many are reactionary religious fundamentalists who abhor the concept of democracy . 
&quot; It doesn &apos;t matter what people think , &quot; the powerful cleric Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi once said . 
&quot; The people are ignorant sheep . &quot; 
However , a small but increasing number of conservative thinkers - while not democrats - advocate a more pragmatic and conciliatory approach , essentially adopting the language that once worked so well for the now-beleaguered reformists . 
&quot; It &apos;s better for all of us that mainstream conservatives go to parliament , people who are not extremist but pragmatic and moderate , &quot; according to the influential newspaper editor Amir Mohebian , who is emerging as the face of Iranian &quot; compassionate conservatism . &quot; 
Whether conservative ideologues or pragmatists dominate the new parliament - which takes office in June - remains to be seen . 
Either way , the conservatives must weigh their strategy carefully . 
A more ideological and antagonistic approach - in the form of increased political and social repression - could stir Iran &apos;s discontented masses , reviving the non-violent but radicalized reformists . 
Some of these now call for passive resistance and civil disobedience . 
It will be the task of Ayatollah Khamenei to rein in conservative ideologues and make sure that pragmatic conservatism prevails . 
That Khamenei is himself more of an ideologue makes that task doubly difficult for him . 
Although he is capable of providing people with increased political and social freedoms , he is simply unwilling . 
Above all , the conservatives &apos; fate - and the fate of the regime as a whole - depends on the country &apos;s punishing economy . 
Despite Iran &apos;s vast oil wealth , close to a third of the population lives in poverty . 
Inflation and unemployment remain rampant . 
Demographics exacerbate these conditions . 
Two-thirds of Iran &apos;s 69 million people are under 30 years old , and officials admit they have no way of accommodating the burgeoning labor force . 
For the majority of Iranians , economic improvement is the priority . 
As a 57-year old retired Iranian professional moonlighting as a taxi driver told me , &quot; When your stomach is empty you don &apos;t cry for democracy , you cry for bread ! &quot; 
Conservatives , no less than reformers , must come to terms with this reality . 
No matter how hard they try , there exists no simple or immediate solution to Iran &apos;s endemic economic corruption and mismanagement . 
As a result , Iran &apos;s near-term political prospects appear ominous . 
But reasons to be hopeful about the long-term political future do exist . 
An indigenous civil society has emerged ; indeed , Iran appears to be the only nation in the Islamic Middle East that is building a sustainable liberal foundation from the bottom up . 
Monarchic and theocratic systems have both failed . 
Backers of a socialist model have gone the way of the Soviet Union . 
Liberal democracy is essentially the last man standing in Iran . 
The road from authoritarianism to democracy will not be smooth or short . 
Agitators for reform will continue to push . 
Regime loyalists will continue to push back . 
In the absence of a credible and readily available political alternative , deadlock will likely continue , with the pace of change slower than the population demands . 
So the long term could be long in coming . 
Courageous Iranians who have labored to reform their country may continue to feel as though they are plowing the seas .
