Is Uber a Threat to Democracy ? 
AIX-EN-PROVENCE - Every July , economists , business leaders , NGOs , and politicians from around the world gather in Aix-en-Provence , France , for the three-day Rencontres Économiques forum , organized by the Cercle des Économistes . 
This year &apos;s forum focused on the changing nature of work . 
The timing of the meeting , which coincided with a heated debate in France about the innovative ride-sharing service Uber , could not have been more apt . 
The forum &apos;s theme was undoubtedly selected partly in response to fears that technological advances will lead to widespread unemployment , as machines become advanced enough to replace humans in performing an increasing number of tasks . 
As MIT &apos;s Andrew McAfee pointed out , historically , technological revolutions have &quot; eventually led to more , if different , jobs &quot; ; but , with machines becoming increasingly intelligent , &quot; this time may be different . &quot; 
Given this possibility , McAfee suggests , we may need to re-build our societies so that , as intelligent machines increase productivity , the declining demand for human work has welfare-enhancing outcomes like higher ( and more equitably distributed ) incomes and more leisure time . 
He is not alone : John Maynard Keynes predicted this possibility 85 years ago . 
Uber , which enables people to connect with available drivers through a smartphone app , is precisely the kind of disruptive company that is driving the shift . 
Taxi drivers in France and around the world are particularly incensed about UberPOP ( called UberX outside Europe ) , a no-frills service . 
Uber has since withdrawn UberPOP from France , at least temporarily - though not before two of its top managers were arrested for ignoring the government &apos;s injunction to suspend UberPOP . 
But the kind of innovation that Uber exemplifies will not be stopped so easily . 
Uber &apos;s software , in a sense , does the job of thousands of Walrasian auctioneers acting locally in space and time , leading to almost perfect price discrimination . 
Airlines have long employed such price discrimination , offering multiple prices for the same distance flown , depending on date and time . 
But Uber price setting is unique in its immediacy , which it has achieved by taking full advantage of modern communications technology . 
In terms of work , Uber creates more jobs than it destroys . 
This leads to a clear increase in efficiency and provides overall income gains . 
Even if losers were fully compensated , the sum of the gains - shared by the firm , its mostly part-time workers , and its customers - would far outweigh the losses . 
Nevertheless , there are real problems that must be addressed . 
For starters , there are the losers : traditional taxi drivers , who often have had to pay large license fees and thus cannot compete with Uber &apos;s low prices . 
While this problem always arises when disruptive new technologies appear , innovation and adoption are occurring faster than ever . 
Taxi drivers are being asked to adjust in a matter of days , rather than years , leaving democratic systems little time to determine how much compensation they should receive , and how it should be distributed . 
Another problem is regulation . 
Taxis produce not only income tax , but also value-added or sales taxes . 
But the UberPOP software , at least so far , has made it impossible to collect value-added tax . 
To level the playing field , local or national authorities should require the company to integrate tax-collection software into its app . 
The fact that UberPOP drivers , unlike taxi drivers , do not cover passenger insurance also amounts to unfair competition , and must be remedied . 
Moreover , in France , taxi drivers must undergo regular health and professional tests , to which UberPOP drivers are not subject . 
Like all Uber drivers , they are &quot; monitored &quot; by users , who evaluate them through the app after each ride . 
This may be a useful innovation ; but it is not really a valid replacement for , say , an eye exam . 
The final problem with innovative companies like Uber is that the financial returns overwhelmingly accrue to the company &apos;s leadership , rather than to the service providers . 
Whether or not that is justified , such companies &quot; contribution to rising income inequality - and thus to regulatory capture , media bias , and disproportionate influence in elections - cannot be ignored . 
Uber is just one example of disruptive innovation that brings huge increases in efficiency , as well as real social and regulatory challenges , a point that French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron emphasized in his speech at Rencontres Économiques . 
And , in fact , Uber is one of the less problematic innovations , because it is a net job creator ; the rise of computers capable of replacing call-center workers , by contrast , is resulting in large net job losses . 
In a democratic system , the challenges that such disruptive technologies bring must be confronted in a way that ensures fairness , without impeding progress . 
The creative destruction of the so-called &quot; second machine age &quot; cannot and should not be stopped . 
But to think that markets alone can manage its transformative impact is pure folly - a fact that the recent global economic crisis , which was rooted in unbridled financial innovation , made clear . 
What is needed now are new social and regulatory policies , often global in nature , that embody a new social contract for the twenty-first century .
