China &apos;s Baby Step 
Whatever the ultimate economic effects of China &apos;s first modest step towards floating its currency , one has to admire its strategic brilliance . 
The genius of China &apos;s mini-move ( allowing the Yuan to rise 2 % against the dollar ) is that no one can tell when or what is going to happen next . 
Protectionists in the United States and Europe , itching to slap huge punitive tariffs on Chinese goods , have been caught flat-footed . 
They want to keep bathing in press coverage , but if they push their China-bashing too far and too fast , the protectionists will be seen as hindering delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations . 
But no one knows whether China &apos;s baby step is the start of something much bigger , as China &apos;s authorities hint one day and deny the next . 
By relenting just a little to intense global pressure to revalue its exchange rate , the Chinese leadership has masterfully stifled the growing chorus of demands to rein in its growing trade surplus . 
The key question , however , remains whether China is defying market forces at its own risk . 
On the surface , at least , the mini-revaluation hardly seems to have compromised China &apos;s ability to bend exchange markets to its will . 
Foreign experts had warned that a small Yuan appreciation might be worse than none . 
While hardly denting global trade imbalances , a small move would bring in a flood of foreign capital , overwhelming China &apos;s currency defenses and leading to chaos . 
So far , that has not happened and , China once again seems to have gone its own way and proved the experts wrong . 
But hold the applause . 
Perhaps the speculative-inflow scenario will play out , but in slow motion . 
After all , China is not a country where investors can just take their money in a heartbeat . 
It can hold the fort because it maintains one of the world &apos;s strictest regimes of exchange and capital controls . 
Unlike many Latin American and former Soviet-bloc countries , where similar controls are honored mainly in the breach , violating capital controls in China is virtually a capital offense . 
But , over the past fifty years , when many other countries , including France and Italy , implemented draconian controls , the result was always the same : eventually , the private sector adapted and eroded the controls &quot; effectiveness . 
Whether by misreporting imports and exports or exploiting corrupt government officials ( which China has in ample supply ) , private capital eventually starts finding its way around the controls if the incentives are strong enough . 
Thus , even if the Chinese authorities can somehow keep their capital controls from hemorrhaging as the country &apos;s financial system becomes more sophisticated and decentralized , they will not be able to stop the controls from dying a death of a thousand cuts . 
After that , China will be able to keep its exchange rate pegged only by slavishly following US interest-rate policy , which makes no sense for such a large and diverse region . 
Indeed , over the longer term , the biggest concern for China is that some day money will be trying to get out . 
Even China &apos;s vast reserves will not be enough to stave off a painful devaluation . 
It is a lot easier to exit from a fixed exchange rate regime when the pressures on the currency are upwards . 
While it may seem hard to imagine that the speculative tide might ever turn against China , exchange-rate pressures can turn in an instant . 
Today &apos;s darling currency can be tomorrow &apos;s dog . 
Considering China &apos;s huge and growing income inequalities , and its massive disguised rural unemployment , it is easy to imagine a period of political instability that sends investors heading for the exits . 
Mix in China &apos;s shaky financial system and the prospect of trade sanctions after an altercation over , say , Taiwan , and it is clear that the Yuan might not always be a one-way bet . 
Last but not least , the Chinese authorities desperately need to maintain the country &apos;s breakneck economic growth in order to preserve the Communist Party &apos;s legitimacy . 
Every other emerging market , even in Asia , has eventually had to cross this bridge . 
Indeed , the need to pursue financial liberalization to maintain growth is a central reason why middle-income countries are so prone to financial crises . 
That &apos;s why Chinese authorities should move to greater flexibility now , and not wait until it is too late . 
So should we expect to see much bigger currency moves in China anytime soon ? 
Should we ever expect to see wild gyrations in China &apos;s exchange rate of the sort one routinely sees in , say , the Australian dollar or the South African rand ? 
Neither scenario is very likely . 
Only fire-breathing free-market advocates , seemingly oblivious to the fact that China &apos;s shaky financial system cannot survive liberalization overnight , are calling for an extreme version of floating . 
But there may well be a lot more to come over the next 12-18 months . 
The first round of Yuan revaluation won &apos;t be over until the currency is up against the dollar by at least 10 % , and probably more . 
China &apos;s first currency move was brilliant only if it is not the last .
