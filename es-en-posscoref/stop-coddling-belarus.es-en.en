Stop Coddling Belarus 
Lenin once said that capitalists were so cynical that they would sell the Soviets the rope with which they would hang them . 
Lenin and communism have passed away , but that cynical indifference to suffering when profits are involved remains . 
Belarus provides a glaring example . 
The European Parliament has consistently denounced Belarus as Europe &apos;s last dictatorship , yet EU member governments continue business as usual with Aleksander Lukashenka , the country &apos;s wayward and near lunatic despot . 
This is especially true when there is a chance to save or make money . 
For example , for more than a decade , Germany &apos;s police forces , customs service , and even the Bundeswehr have been ordering uniforms from a state-owned factory in the city of Dzherzinsky , named after the father of the Red Terror and founder of the Soviet KGB , Feliks Dzherzinsky . 
Similar examples of such indifferent cynicism abound . 
By treating Lukashenka as a favored business partner at the same time that the EU is trying to isolate him as an international pariah , European hypocrisy stands naked . 
Instead of indirectly propping up Lukashenka &apos;s regime through such cozy deals , Europe &apos;s governments must begin to act in accordance with what Europe &apos;s parliament has long understood : underwriting Lukashenka economically only prolongs his misrule . 
So it is now more important than ever that European parliamentarians unite and make their position clear . 
The European Parliament has , indeed , taken the lead . 
Since last year it has been enlisting people with historic knowledge and understanding of totalitarian regimes to help guide its response to events in Belarus . 
This advice helped shape the parliament &apos;s strong stance against maintaining unnecessary economic engagement with Lukashenka and his henchmen . 
But there are two radically different attitudes regarding Belarus &apos;s participation in European activities . 
On one hand , the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has denied Belarusian politicians even informal access to meetings in Strasbourg . 
The Assembly condemned Lukashenka &apos;s usurpation of power when he twisted the constitution to grant himself a virtual lifetime presidency , and it has denounced the disappearance of those Belarussians who have dared to think differently from the regime . 
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) has also taken a strong stand against the Belarusian dictator . 
As the Final Report of its 2004 mission to observe the Belarusian parliamentary elections clearly stated , the vote &quot; fell significantly short of OSCE commitments . &quot; 
Similarly , the 2004 referendum to eliminate term limits on the presidency &quot; took place with unrestrained Government bias in favor of the referendum , &quot; and without &quot; the conditions , particularly freedom of expression and freedom of the media , to ensure that the will of the people serves as the basis of government authority . &quot; 
But at the same time the OSCE is condemning these anti-democratic practices , its own Parliamentary Assembly maintains full-fledged cooperation with the Belarusian parliament . 
Indeed , the OSCE treats the Lukashenka-controlled parliament in the same way it does any EU parliament . 
So real parliaments and sham parliaments are treated as equals . 
The idea would be laughable if it were not so tragic . 
This absurd situation must change . 
It is the duty of all members of EU national parliaments to reject this affront to their democratic dignity . 
Only democratic parliaments should sit as equals in Europe &apos;s democratic forums . 
The goal is not to ensure Europe &apos;s democratic purity , but to change the nature of Belarus &apos;s government . 
For that to happen , Europe &apos;s democratic voice must be heard within Belarus . 
That won &apos;t be easy . 
Of the 1,500 different media outlets in Belarus today , only a dozen or so retain any form of independence . 
Even that small number is likely to diminish , as Lukashenka keeps up political , financial , and legal pressure on them . 
Indeed , Belarus &apos;s last independent daily newspaper recently went out of business . 
The European Commission has allocated two million euros to establish an independent radio station for Belarus , which must operate outside of the country because of Lukashenka . 
Working with the Belarusian association of journalists , this independent media outlet will broadcast from Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , and perhaps Ukraine . 
This meager effort , however , is an insufficient response by Europe &apos;s democracies to the full panoply of Lukashenka &apos;s dictatorship : his docile courts , brutal jails , and corrupt police . 
Are a few hours of radio broadcasting really all Europe and the democratic west can muster ? 
If so , Lukashenka must be laughing aloud . 
Parliamentarians across Europe and the West must join their voice together in a well-defined , united and ringing declaration that forces Western leaders to apply real pressure to Europe &apos;s last dictator . 
Such pressure brought results a year ago , with the success of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine . 
Nothing less than a united position against the despot of Belarus is necessary if Lukashenka - and his Russian backers - are to be forced to change their ways .
