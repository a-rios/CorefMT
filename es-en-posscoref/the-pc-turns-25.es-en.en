The PC Turns 25 
In August 1981 , IBM introduced the 5150 personal computer . 
It was not really the first personal computer , but it turned out to be &quot; The Personal Computer , &quot; and it revolutionized not just business life , but also the way people thought about the world . 
The 1981 PC was a break with IBM &apos;s previous business model , according to which it did not sell computers , but leased them . 
With the 5150 , IBM moved into mass production of a standardized commodity using components produced by other companies . 
&quot; Big Blue &quot; ( as IBM is known ) allowed other companies ( notably the infant Microsoft ) to develop its software . 
No good deed goes unpunished : by making the PC , IBM practically destroyed itself as a company . 
Its innovation gave rise to a huge number of new and dynamic companies , forcing IBM to reinvent itself completely in order to compete with them - just one example of the socially transformative effects of the PC . 
Before 1981 , visionaries who thought about the impact of technology on society believed that the computer would allow a centralization of knowledge and power . 
This was the world of George Orwell &apos;s Big Brother , the extrapolation of the twentieth century &apos;s experience of totalitarianism . 
Powerful computers led to potent states and powerful and centrally directed business corporations . 
The PC seemed at first to promise a restoration of the balance in favor of the individual . 
Computing became decentralized , and the new flexibility produced a sense that control was moving away from big agglomerations of power - whether governments or companies . 
It is not surprising that the triumph of the PC seemed to be accompanied by a revival of the nineteenth-century vision of classical liberalism and individualism . 
The idea was that an individual could buy a computer and the software needed for a specific ( and increasingly complicated ) purpose , and immediately generate a productive result . 
Indeed , within a few years , individuals would possess in a small machine as much computing power as the mainframe IBM 360 &quot; s that had revolutionized centralized computing in the 1960 &quot; s . 
But this initial triumph of the PC ( and very substantial sales in the 1980 &quot; s ) did not immediately fulfill all the initial hopes for individual empowerment and social transformation . 
It did not seem to produce many efficiency gains , despite enormous investments in information technology . 
Immense amounts of time were wasted in enterprises by informal requests for assistance , forcing knowledgeable workers to become computer gurus in order to aid their colleagues . 
The initial disappointment about electronic productivity was thus a vivid demonstration of the limits of classical individualism . 
Only with inter-connection in the 1990 &quot; s , above all through the Internet , did the PC realize its potential . 
Suddenly , economists ( especially in the United States ) began to measure substantial productivity gains . 
New forms of activity - Internet auctions , Internet encyclopedias , Internet chat rooms -reproduced over a much wider area the interactions of individuals . 
Interlinked PC &apos;s really created a sense of a vibrant social market . 
Individuals could realize themselves , as in the old nineteenth-century model , but only to the extent that they interacted with as many other people as possible . 
It was these interactions , rather than the individual on his or her own , that created value and set in motion a dynamic process . 
The potential was alluring , but also terrifying . 
The linking of PC &apos;s produced scares about the potential dangers of the new world . 
People were afraid of malevolent computer viruses that would sweep the world and destroy information and programs in the space of a few hours . 
There was widespread fear that dependence on computers would produce a millennial catastrophe , as hospitals , airplanes , power grids , and communications would all grind to a halt when 1999 became 2000 . 
These traumas required responses very different from previous technological changes . 
Government regulation was incapable of dealing with the issues involved , although it was certainly helpful to devise ways of making destructive hackers criminally responsible . 
Nor would innovation by one company help . 
A solution required generally collaborative efforts - of a sort that corresponded to an ancient vision of civic republicanism rather than the modern ideas of centralized power or isolated and autonomous individuals . 
Some observers believe that this interconnectivity has now , after a quarter-century , made the PC obsolete . 
There are more specialized applications of computing and information technology in smart machines and mobile telephones , whose defining characteristic is that they communicate with each other . 
But the alleged obsolescence of the PC is actually a sign of how basic it has become to a new vision of society . 
We need to celebrate , advertise , and propagandize new innovations only when their success is questionable , before they have become widely accepted . 
In the eighteenth century , cheap and washable cotton undergarments produced a revolution in hygiene , but soon this had become so commonplace that the cotton revolution no longer generated any excitement . 
The PC has become the modern equivalent of cotton : so basic has it become to our lives that , despite the fact that around 200 million PC &apos;s are sold each year , it now simply generates an electronic yawn . 
But , like the cotton revolution , the true measure of the social and political transformations wrought by the PC will become clear only after a much longer time .
