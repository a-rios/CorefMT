The Right Populism for Poland 
Poland &apos;s parliamentary and presidential elections this month saw the death of a left-leaning postcommunist party that mostly dominated the country since 1995 . 
If PiS &apos;s populist slogans become policy , government spending is likely to expand , which will exacerbate Poland &apos;s already weak fiscal position and consequently trigger inflationary expectations . 
Worse , boosting social spending will contribute little to resolving the country &apos;s staggering 17.5 % rate of unemployment - most of it structural -while any hope of quick euro adoption will be dashed . 
What Poland needs most is fiscal discipline and market-oriented reforms , including relaxation of the rigid labor laws that are inhibiting job creation . 
After all , over the past two decades , the enduring goals of dismantling communism and central planning , as well as joining the European Union , have served as important driving forces of reform . 
A specific commitment to adopt the euro at the earliest possible date could serve as the same sort of springboard as the push to join the EU in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Such a strategic goal would provide justification for prudent fiscal and monetary policies , and , given Poles &quot; desire to consider themselves full Europeans , it would boost political support for such policies . 
Only such support can bring the government budget deficit , expected to reach 4.4 % of GDP in 2005 , down to the EU &apos;s benchmark of less than 3 % of GDP within the next two years . 
Moreover , a commitment to pursue euro membership will have positive spillover effects . 
It will reinforce convergence expectations among financial market participants , which will translate into lower risk premia for investors . 
Lower risk also will bring inflation expectations down and reduce interest rates , which will in turn speed up the compression of Polish government bond yields to comparable EU levels , increasing financial stability . 
While the current yield on 10-year Polish government bonds of 4.7 % appears to be at the edge of meeting the Maastricht long-term interest-rate benchmark , sustainability will depend on the fiscal policy outlook and on the overall credit risk . 
More stable financial markets and a less volatile exchange rate relative to the euro will bring many advantages . 
Most importantly , lower exchange-rate risk will boost both domestic and foreign direct investment , thereby helping to alleviate unemployment . 
So it is imperative that the new government prepares - in cooperation with the National Bank of Poland ( NBP ) - a comprehensive program to steer the course of fiscal and monetary policy toward the goal of euro membership . 
Although there is no need immediately to announce a specific exchange rate for the zloty at euro entry , such a program must include among its focal points a formula for determining the rate . 
By developing and disclose to the public a compelling rationale for what will determine the exchange rate when the time comes , the financial markets would then be able to forecast the future reference exchange rate more precisely . 
There is little doubt among economists that euro membership will bring enduring net benefits to Poland . 
It will lower transaction costs and increase labor productivity . 
These include legal impediments to labor mobility , reform of a complex tax system beset by excessive rates and porous loopholes , and substandard road infrastructure . 
Each should be regarded as an urgent matter by the new government , and each , if handled adroitly , could be &quot; sold &quot; to the public as the type of popular reform that people have been demanding . 
Poland &apos;s new government faces several serious challenges , not the least of which will be to reconcile its liberal and populist tendencies . 
Only if populism is put at the service of liberal reform will the government achieve lasting benefits .
