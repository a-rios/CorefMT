The IMF &apos;s Next Mission ? 
The world economy is increasingly threatened by volatile market reactions to global imbalances at a time when the IMF has largely lost its original raison d &quot; Ãªtre as the world &apos;s central monetary institution . 
These two developments should stimulate the Fund to claim a new purpose as the world &apos;s reserve manager . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , the IMF managed the problems of all the major economies , and in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , it developed as a crisis manager for emerging markets . 
These surpluses reflect high savings rates , both in the private and the public sector , in oil-producing and emerging Asian economies , which have resulted in their rapid accumulation of foreign reserves . 
But this is hardly a blessing for these countries . 
Like past reserve regimes that offered a choice of assets ( for example , the dollar , the pound , and gold in the interwar period ) , instability is inherent . 
The new surplus countries &quot; attempts to find alternative reserve assets have been problematic . 
Most of the attention has been fixed on China &apos;s $ 1 trillion in reserves , and its efforts to maintain the value of those assets . 
Diversification from US Treasury bills by investing some $ 3 billion in the Blackstone private equity fund this summer was swiftly followed by an embarrassing collapse in value . 
On the receiving end , industrial countries &quot; governments are anxious that new sovereign wealth funds ( SWF &apos;s ) are being used strategically , rather than simply following the logic of the market . 
Even the successful model for SWF &apos;s , Singapore &apos;s Temasek , which for a long time went largely unnoticed , is now attracting a level of attention that its owners and managers never wanted . 
The growing anxiety is understandable . 
After all , given that emerging market economies &quot; central banks and SWF &apos;s nowadays effectively dominate capital markets , outcomes no longer result from the interplay of millions of independent guesses , decisions , or strategies . 
When entities of such a size make decisions , they are bound to act in a strategic way . 
All the parties begin to suspect political manipulation . 
But the resulting controversies can be resolved , and the political venom neutralized , through surveillance by multilateral institutions that are committed to achieving an overarching good . 
Today surveillance means , in effect , merely giving advice . 
But in the 1960 &quot; s - when the IMF still supervised the rules of the Bretton Woods order &apos;s par value system before its disintegration in 1971 - surveillance was linked to the Fund &apos;s effectiveness as a major financial intermediary . 
The IMF &apos;s ability to give powerful advice to the most important countries , such as the UK , was enhanced by these countries &quot; dependence on IMF resources . 
It was the IMF &apos;s financial power that gave it its bite , and that power was enhanced by Fund borrowing , at first from the G-10 , which established the General Arrangements to Borrow . 
In the years after the collapse of Bretton Woods , the IMF reinvented itself as a principle vehicle for managing the surpluses that followed the oil price shocks of the 1970 &quot; s . 
It borrowed from the new surplus countries , which thus partly managed their new assets through the intermediation of the IMF . 
As a result , to the Fund could lend to those countries that suffered shocks from the increase in petroleum prices . 
Indeed , a large financial actor can play a stabilizing role . 
In the past , the counter-cyclical behavior of large private institutions stabilized market expectations during panics . 
The house of Rothschild made the first half of the nineteenth century stable . 
In the great panics of 1895-6 and 1907 , J.P. Morgan calmed the US economy . 
In 2007 , there are some signs that Goldman Sachs feels obliged to lean against the wind in order to stabilize markets . 
The IMF could be a powerful financial stabilizer if it managed a significant part of the new surplus countries &quot; reserve assets , for it would be well placed to take bets against speculators . 
At the same time , the management of reserve assets by an internationally controlled asset manager would remove suspicions and doubts about the use of assets for strategic political purposes . 
But , to carry out this completely new task , the IMF would need to regain the trust of its members . 
The rise in reserves in many Asian countries was a deliberate response to the 1997 financial crisis , which fueled disillusion with the IMF . 
So , before it could assume the role of global reserve manager , new surplus countries would need substantially more influence over the Fund &apos;s governance . 
Only then could they be confident that they would not be subject to politically motivated manipulation .
