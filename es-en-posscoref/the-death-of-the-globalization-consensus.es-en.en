The Death of the Globalization Consensus 
CAMBRIDGE - The world economy has seen globalization collapse once already . 
The gold standard era - with its free capital mobility and open trade - came to an abrupt end in 1914 and could not be resuscitated after World War I. Are we about to witness a similar global economic breakdown ? 
The question is not fanciful . 
Although economic globalization has enabled unprecedented levels of prosperity in advanced countries and has been a boon to hundreds of millions of poor workers in China and elsewhere in Asia , it rests on shaky pillars . 
Unlike national markets , which tend to be supported by domestic regulatory and political institutions , global markets are only &quot; weakly embedded . &quot; 
There is no global anti-trust authority , no global lender of last resort , no global regulator , no global safety nets , and , of course , no global democracy . 
In other words , global markets suffer from weak governance , and therefore from weak popular legitimacy . 
Recent events have heightened the urgency with which these issues are discussed . 
The presidential electoral campaign in the United States has highlighted the frailty of the support for open trade in the world &apos;s most powerful nation . 
The sub-prime mortgage crisis has shown how lack of international coordination and regulation can exacerbate the inherent fragility of financial markets . 
The rise in food prices has exposed the downside of economic interdependence without global transfer and compensation schemes . 
Meanwhile , rising oil prices have increased transport costs , leading analysts to wonder whether the outsourcing era is coming to an end . 
And there is always the looming disaster of climate change , which may well be the most serious threat the world has ever faced . 
So if globalization is in danger , who are its real enemies ? 
There was a time when global elites could comfort themselves with the thought that opposition to the world trading regime consisted of violent anarchists , self-serving protectionists , trade unionists , and ignorant , if idealistic youth . 
Meanwhile , they regarded themselves as the true progressives , because they understood that safeguarding and advancing globalization was the best remedy against poverty and insecurity . 
But that self-assured attitude has all but disappeared , replaced by doubts , questions , and skepticism . 
Gone also are the violent street protests and mass movements against globalization . 
What makes news nowadays is the growing list of mainstream economists who are questioning globalization &apos;s supposedly unmitigated virtues . 
So we have Paul Samuelson , the author of the postwar era &apos;s landmark economics textbook , reminding his fellow economists that China &apos;s gains in globalization may well come at the expense of the US ; 
Paul Krugman , today &apos;s foremost international trade theorist , arguing that trade with low-income countries is no longer too small to have an effect on inequality ; 
Alan Blinder , a former US Federal Reserve vice chairman , worrying that international outsourcing will cause unprecedented dislocations for the US labor force ; 
Martin Wolf , the Financial Times columnist and one of the most articulate advocates of globalization , writing of his disappointment with how financial globalization has turned out ; and Larry Summers , the US Treasury chief and the Clinton administration &apos;s &quot; Mr. Globalization , &quot; musing about the dangers of a race to the bottom in national regulations and the need for international labor standards . 
While these worries hardly amount to the full frontal attack mounted by the likes of Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel-prize winning economist , they still constitute a remarkable turnaround in the intellectual climate . 
Moreover , even those who have not lost heart often disagree vehemently about the direction in which they would like to see globalization go . 
For example , Jagdish Bhagwati , the distinguished free trader , and Fred Bergsten , the director of the pro-globalization Peterson Institute for International Economics , have both been on the frontlines arguing that critics vastly exaggerate globalization &apos;s ills and under-appreciate its benefits . 
But their debates on the merits of regional trade agreements - Bergsten for , Bhagwati against - are as heated as each one &apos;s disagreements with the authors mentioned above . 
None of these intellectuals is against globalization , of course . 
What they want is not to turn back globalization , but to create new institutions and compensation mechanisms - at home or internationally - that will render globalization more effective , fairer , and more sustainable . 
Their policy proposals are often vague ( when specified at all ) , and command little consensus . 
But confrontation over globalization has clearly moved well beyond the streets to the columns of the financial press and the rostrums of mainstream think tanks . 
That is an important point for globalization &apos;s cheerleaders to understand , as they often behave as if the &quot; other side &quot; still consists of protectionists and anarchists . 
Today , the question is no longer , &quot; Are you for or against globalization ? &quot; 
The question is , &quot; What should the rules of globalization be ? &quot; 
The first three decades after 1945 were governed by the Bretton Woods consensus - a shallow multilateralism that permitted policymakers to focus on domestic social and employment needs while enabling global trade to recover and flourish . 
This regime was superseded in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s by an agenda of deeper liberalization and economic integration . 
That model , we have learned , is unsustainable . 
If globalization is to survive , it will need a new intellectual consensus to underpin it . 
The world economy desperately awaits its new Keynes .
