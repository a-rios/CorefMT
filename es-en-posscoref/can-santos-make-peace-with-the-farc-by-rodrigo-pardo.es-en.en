Colombia &apos;s Peace Gambit 
BOGOTÁ - Two-thirds of Colombia &apos;s population believes that the dialogue now taking place between the government of President Juan Manuel Santosand the rebel group FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) might actually turn out to be successful.They believe that the conflict &apos;s end could be in sight , with the FARC , possibly the world &apos;s oldest extant guerilla organization , laying down its arms and joining the official political arena . 
After 38 years of conflict , Colombians &quot; optimism is striking . 
Since 1982 , at least three negotiation attempts have failed . 
The Unión Patriótica , a party created in the 1980 &quot; s as a vehicle for political participation by rebels , dissolved following the extermination of 1,500 of its members at the hands of unknown paramilitary forces . 
Then , in the 1990 &quot; s , the government abandoned negotiations when the FARC assassinated a former secretary of state . 
And , in 2002 , the government ended a dialogue with the rebels after officials became convinced that the FARC did not seek peace , but wanted merely to take advantage of the 42,000-square-kilometer area that would be demilitarized for the negotiations . 
After his election in 2002 , President Álvaro Uribe pursued a hardline security policy , supported by the United States . 
The strategy was so popular that the constitution was amended to allow for Uribe &apos;s reelection in 2006 . 
While he was not allowed to run for a third term , no candidate in the 2010 election suggested altering his iron-fisted approach , or proposed renewing talks with the guerillas . 
One of those candidates was Santos , Uribe &apos;s former minister of defense , who had delivered some of the military &apos;s hardest blows to the FARC . 
So , after championing the continuation of the hardline policy , his current strategy of negotiation is risky . 
Indeed , Santos and Uribe , members of the same political party and once close allies , are now embroiled in a bitter dispute , with Uribe emerging as Santos &apos;s most visible opponent . 
Yet , while an unprecedented share of the population supported Uribe &apos;s strategy , and 90 % of Colombians view the FARC negatively , public opinion has been largely supportive of Santos &apos;s dialogue with the guerillas , albeit more from frustration than from appreciation of Santos &apos;s pragmatism . 
Colombians are ready to hope that , this time , negotiations will produce results . 
And they have . 
In the last six months , government and FARC representatives have met secretly in Havana to develop a road map for a second stage of dialogue in Oslo in early October , followed by a return to Havana for further talks . 
According to Santos , this new peace process is different , because it takes into account the lessons learned from past mistakes . 
It is also taking place at a time when the government &apos;s chances of reaching a compromise are more favorable . 
In the last decade , Uribe &apos;s government made great strides in weakening the FARC . 
The number of combatants has fallen by two-thirds , four important FARC leaders have been eliminated , and the group &apos;s ties to drug trafficking and kidnapping have undermined its image in Colombia and elsewhere . 
Furthermore , with US support , Colombia &apos;s armed forces have become stronger , owing to modernization of military equipment and doctrine , an increase in the number of soldiers , and improved training . 
As a result , armed conflict is becoming increasingly costly for the rebels . 
Indeed , unlike in 2002 , when the FARC could make impossible demands on the government , today &apos;s environment favors the state , forcing the rebels to keep their demands realistic . 
The FARC is unlikely to stage a media spectacle at the meetings in Norway and Cuba . 
The agenda will focus on ending the conflict , without endless discussion of theoretical or doctrinaire questions . 
And two retired generals will participate , making the Colombian armed forces more likely to support any agreement . 
To be sure , obstacles remain . 
A ceasefire will not accompany the talks . 
The FARC have not repudiated the possibility of seizing power by force . 
Their radical ideology is obvious , and their willingness to forgive the casualties and suffering of a long and brutal conflict is unknown . 
There is no guarantee that Santos &apos;s strategy will succeed . 
But Colombians have earned a genuine opportunity to end their country &apos;s conflict .
