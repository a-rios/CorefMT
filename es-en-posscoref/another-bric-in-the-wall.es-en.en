Another BRIC in the Wall ? 
NEW YORK - Conventional wisdom rarely survives a good stress test , and few tests have been as stressful as that which the global economy has endured over the past 24 months . 
A healthy season of reappraisal has dawned , shining a new light on boom-time notions like the value of opaque markets , the untouchable status of the American consumer , or the wisdom of deregulation . 
One piece of bubble wisdom that has escaped relatively unscathed , however , is the assumption that the &quot; BRIC &quot; countries - Brazil , Russia , India , and China - will increasingly call the economic tune in years to come . 
The BRIC notion , coined in a 2003 Goldman Sachs report , is not all bad : at 75 % correct , it scores a good deal better than most economic prognostications of the day . 
Yet the economic crisis that began in 2008 exposed one of the four as an impostor . 
Set the vital statistics of the BRIC economies side-by-side and it becomes painfully obvious that , in the words of the old Sesame Street game , &quot; One of these things is not like the other . &quot; 
The weakness of the Russian economy and its highly leveraged banks and corporations , in particular , which was masked in recent years by the windfall brought by spiking oil and gas prices , burst into full view as the global economy tumbled . 
Saddled with a rust-belt infrastructure , Russia further disqualifies itself with dysfunctional and revanchist politics and a demographic trend in near-terminal decline . 
Even with the modest recovery in commodity prices over the past six months , Russia &apos;s energy sector has experienced declining production in recent years , due in part to fears among foreign investors of expropriation . 
Russia &apos;s sovereign wealth fund , integral in propping up an increasingly re-centralized economy , is being depleted fast . 
If negative trends continue , Russia &apos;s reserve fund could eventually be exhausted . 
Russia &apos;s fall back to earth , meanwhile , spawned a kind of parlor game among academics , foreign-policy wonks , and educated investors , aimed at replacing the country in the club of major emerging-market economies . 
A variety of acronyms has been suggested , from the cutesy BRICET ( adding Eastern Europe and Turkey ) to BRICKETs ( the former plus South Korea ) and - an even greater stretch - BRIMC , which shoehorns Mexico into the mix . 
In all of these revisions , Russia survives , despite the writing on its economic wall . 
While Russia retains the world &apos;s largest ( if somewhat aging ) arsenal of nuclear weapons , as well as a permanent seat ( and thus veto power ) on the UN Security Council , it is more sick than BRIC . Purely from the standpoint of economic potential and fundamentals , the case is far stronger for South Korea , a sophisticated economic power whose primary liability is the danger that the regime of its evil twin to the north will collapse and inundate it with hungry refugees . 
The same is true of Turkey , with its robust banking sector , thriving domestic market , growing importance to Middle East and energy politics , NATO membership , European Union membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across Central Asia . 
Perhaps the most compelling case of all is that of Indonesia , the world &apos;s largest Muslim state , with a rapidly expanding middle class , relatively stable democratic politics , and an economy that has been a star performer in Asia despite the global recession . 
From an American perspective , Indonesia is an attractive alternative to Russia , which recently has vied with Venezuela for leadership of the &quot; America in decline &quot; cheering section . 
Indonesia , moreover , has shown resilience not only economically , but also as a nation . 
In spite of its diverse ethnic makeup and far-flung island territory , the country has made a quick transition from military dictatorship and has recovered from myriad challenges and setbacks , including the 1997 Asian financial crisis , the tsunami in 2004 , the emergence of radical Islam , and domestic unrest . 
While Indonesia &apos;s per capita GDP remains low , it is a country &apos;s potential that matters in economic affairs , and here Indonesia shines . 
Indonesia depends less on exports than its Asian peers ( let alone Russia ) , and its asset markets ( timber , palm oil , and coal , in particular ) have attracted major foreign investment . 
The government in Jakarta , meanwhile , has taken a strong stand against corruption and moved to address structural problems . 
Even demographic trends favor Indonesia , which , with 230 million people , is already the fourth largest country in the world by population - a full Germany ( 80-plus million ) larger than Russia . 
But catchy ideas die hard , and Russia has moved to cement the current concept of the BRICs into an irreversible reality . 
The ossification of the BRICs into a 
That meeting produced a notable broadside against the United States , as each member declared its desire to unseat the dollar as the global reserve currency . 
A few months earlier , the four were moved to issue a joint communiqu√© ahead of the G-20 Summit in April noting their shared determination to change the rules of the global economic system . 
In the private sector , BRIC index funds have proliferated , though Goldman Sachs has radically hedged its own BRIC bet by introducing a second term - the &quot; Next 11 , &quot; or N-11 - to the debate . 
This grouping adds 
Russia sniffs at the idea of demotion , and American officials appear to have decided to steer clear of the semantic debate . 
Still , it should surprise no one that Russia lobbied hard for the Yekaterinburg BRIC summit , and footed the bill for much of it as well . 
Why risk exposure too soon ?
