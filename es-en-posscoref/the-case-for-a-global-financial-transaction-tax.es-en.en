The Case for a Global Financial-Transaction Tax 
BERLIN - What went wrong with global financial markets ? 
In a nutshell : the implosion of the brave new world of modern finance , and the economic crisis that followed , was rooted in the idea that free and unregulated capital markets always work for the public good , and are all that is needed for economic prosperity . 
The prologue to the crisis was a combination of cheap money , deregulation , and a race for returns by executives undeterred by the associated risks . 
When the housing bubble burst and financial markets collapsed in its wake , growth slumped worldwide as never before since the Great Depression . 
GDP in the advanced economies is expected to shrink about 4 % this year . 
Total financial-sector losses in the world &apos;s advanced economies stand at around $ 1.6 trillion . 
The IMF estimates that losses of more than double this total are yet to come . 
Jobs will continue to be shed . 
Future generations are being saddled with an explosion of public debt . 
It will take years before we recover fully . 
Despite all this pain , the remaining financial-market participants gained significant benefits from government bailouts . 
The G-20 &quot; s average headline support for the financial sector is more than 30 % of GDP ( including capital injections , guarantees , treasury lending and asset purchases , liquidity provision , and other central bank support ) . 
In our political response to this crisis , new forms of financing and fiscal burden-sharing will have to play a role . 
It is in this context that German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and I have advanced our proposal for a global financial-transaction tax ( FTT ) . 
Remaining financial-market participants are not pulling their weight in this crisis . 
But &quot; Main Street &quot; sees what happens on Wall Street - and in London and Frankfurt . 
Citizens are aware of the hundreds of billions of euros and dollars that have been used to prop up banks . 
Bonus payments in the financial sector now go hand in glove with massive job losses in the real economy . 
I came to realize that the political answer to this crisis must encompass more than improved regulatory regimes , risk-management strategies , and capital requirements . 
How governments handle the burden-sharing between Wall Street and Main Street will determine social cohesion , financial-market stability , ­ and political leaders ­ &quot; reputations for years to come . 
Of course , compensation payments and fees for government guarantees are being levied on banks participating in taxpayer-funded stabilization schemes . 
But that &apos;s not enough . 
Financial-market participants need to demonstrate that they understand their role in causing the crisis , and that they are willing to significantly contribute to preventing its recurrence . 
A global financial-transaction tax ( FTT ) , applied uniformly across the G-20 countries and covering all financial transactions at a very low rate , is the obvious instrument of choice to ensure that all financial-market participants contribute equally . 
Foreign Minister Steinmeier and I are suggesting that the G-20 take concrete steps toward implementing an FTT of 0.05 % on all trades of financial products within their jurisdictions , regardless of whether these trades occur on an exchange . 
National governments could establish a personal allowance to exempt retail investors . 
Based on calculations by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research , which studied the possible effects of general FTTs on behalf of the Austrian government , a global FTT of 0.05 % could yield up to $ 690 billion per year , or about 1.4 % of world GDP . 
Such a tax would not unduly burden financial-market participants , yet it would raise a significant amount of money to finance the costs of this crisis . 
Financial-market participants are fighting tooth and nail not to pay their fair share , putting forward a number of arguments against an FTT to camouflage their resistance . 
Some of them argue that such a tax would lead to evasive reactions by market participants and have distorting effects . 
But such evasive actions by market participants would be almost impossible if the G-20 stood united . 
Trading volume on G-20 and European Union exchanges accounts for roughly 97 % of total global trading in exchange-traded equities , and about 94 % of total volume in exchange-traded bonds . 
As the tax would be very low and would include transactions in exchange-based spot and derivatives markets and OTC markets , as well as all asset classes ( equities , bonds , derivatives , and foreign exchange ) , there would not be much of a distorting effect , either . 
I don &apos;t think such a tax would significantly impact market liquidity , but even if it did , a nudge towards buying and holding might not be such a bad thing . 
The debate among finance ministers in London in the run-up to the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh revealed a basic agreement that the burdens imposed by the financial crisis ought to be shared in a fair manner . 
At the G-20 summit , we should discuss what fair and equitable burden-sharing between taxpayers and financial-market participants should look like . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has registered initial support for such an idea from British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France . 
We are receiving a wave of interest and readiness for further dialogue on this topic within the EU and beyond . 
There is a clear-cut case for a global FTT : it would be just , would do no harm , and would do a lot of good . 
If there is a better idea for fair burden-sharing between the world &apos;s Main Streets and its Wall Streets , let &apos;s hear it . 
If there isn &apos;t , let &apos;s have an FTT now .
