Tony Blair &apos;s Long Goodbye 
In early 1999 , Paddy Ashdown , then the leader of Britain &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party ( and since then , as Lord Ashdown , Europe &apos;s envoy in Bosnia ) , was found with a woman not his wife and forced to resign his post . 
In his diaries , he describes calling on Prime Minister Tony Blair to inform him in advance of his intention to quit : 
&quot; Blair said : &quot; Going is the most difficult thing to do in politics . 
Too many people stay for too long . 
I would rather stop when people said , &quot; Why is he going ? &quot; than when they said , &quot; Why isn &apos;t he going ? &quot; 
I hope I will be able to do it the same way . &quot; &quot; 
This leaves us with an enduring mystery . 
Britain &apos;s most adept and skillful politician has evidently known for years exactly what not to do about arranging his departure , and yet he has chosen to ignore his own advice . 
The mystery deepens when we recall that this consideration has been a part of Blair &apos;s calculations ever since he became leader of the Labour Party in 1994 . 
At a dinner in a London restaurant named Granita , in what has since become the best-known coffee-stage chat in British history , Blair made a proposal to Gordon Brown , his rival for the leadership . 
That proposal fell in two parts . 
He , Blair , was demonstrably more &quot; electable , &quot; and should lead Labour in deposing the ramshackle Tory regime of John Major . 
Then , with Labour in power , Brown could expect in due time to receive the mantle . 
On this condition , Brown agreed to give Blair a clear run . 
That was three elections ago . 
What has kept Blair going ? 
When I called on him in January this year , his press officer advised me not to bring up the obvious question . 
( I readily agreed , since an unanswerable question is a waste of time . ) 
But no sooner had I asked the Prime Minister how he was than he replied with a grin : &quot; It &apos;s nice to know one doesn &apos;t have to fight another election . &quot; 
So there was the topic , inescapably , right in the middle of the room . 
For the rest of the conversation , and on the trip to the outskirts of London that I also took with him , Blair talked and acted as if he had a full Prime Ministerial agenda on everything from global warming to the reconstruction of Afghanistan . 
He also behaved , when talking to voters and citizens , as if he was tirelessly running for office for a fourth time . 
Some of the motivations for this are purely human : he likes being Prime Minister and is good at it . 
Moreover , next year he will have been Prime Minister for a decade , longer than any previous Labour leader . 
A little longer , and he would outlast Margaret Thatcher &apos;s record-breaking tenure , which must have been a temptation . 
But Blair inexplicably chose to compound the mistake he had made with Brown , by announcing publicly , after having defeated the Tories for the third straight time , that he would not stand again . 
From then on , there was really only one question on peoples &quot; minds , and it was the third - the worst - of the three questions he had mentioned to Ashdown : &quot; When is he going ? &quot; 
Blair ought to have known that politics is a pitiless business . 
For years , his backbench members of parliament kept quiet because they knew that they owed their seats , and their majority , to him . 
Now , with the country insisting on an answer to the question he posed , they see him as a liability . 
And the trade unions , whose power he has done so much to reduce , have been open in saying that they want a new party leader . 
Thus , his announcement that he will leave Downing Street next year is no more than a reluctant acceptance of what has been reality for some time . 
No politician is free from a sense of destiny , and I think that Blair &apos;s got the better of him . 
In the decision to send British forces to defend Sierra Leone from a barbaric invasion from Liberia , he faced down all those who warned of disaster and won great moral credit . 
In deploying soldiers to Afghanistan and Iraq , he was convinced that he was both morally correct and politically right to stand by Britain &apos;s main historic ally , the United States . 
( It is reasonably certain that he would not have trusted Brown to do any of these things in the face of any serious opposition , and also reasonably certain that he was correct to think so . ) 
When I first interviewed Blair , as newly elected Labour leader in 1994 , he answered my question about the role of his Christianity in his politics by saying , &quot; I can &apos;t stand politicians who go on about religion . &quot; 
If I had to date the moment when my own misgivings about him began , it would be the time - starting after September 11 , 2001 - when he began to emphasize his own &quot; faith &quot; as a motivating factor in his moral stand . 
A saving element in British politics is that such appeals are usually considered embarrassing . 
They may also suggest a slight tendency , on the part of those uttering them , to believe in some kind of supernatural endorsement . 
So Blair &apos;s concession that he must leave office , a decision so long postponed and so disastrously protracted , represents among other things a triumph of the mundane over the permanent temptation to believe that politics is about anything else .
