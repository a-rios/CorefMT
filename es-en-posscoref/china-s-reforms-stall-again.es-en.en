China \ u0027s Reforms Stall Again 
As the 82 nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party approached last July , the Party &apos;s new General Secretary , Hu Jintao , seemed on the verge of announcing a whole new range of reforms . 
In a ceremony celebrating the promulgation of the current 1982 constitution , Hu reportedly expressed interest in strengthening constitutional protections against official intrusions in people &apos;s lives and in promoting extensive legal reform . 
Indeed , he was even rumored to be considering more inner-Party democratization , greater press freedom , strengthening non-Communist political parties , and permitting exiled dissidents to return home . 
Such optimistic views were re-enforced when Chinese intellectuals - even some official scholars - began writing and speaking out in favor of re-evaluating controversial Party verdicts on historical incidents ( such as the Tiananmen Square massacre ) . 
Similarly , there was an increase in public advocacy on behalf of rural workers ( who have been migrating by the tens of millions into China &apos;s cities ) , as well as calls for significant constitutional changes . 
For example , legal scholar Cao Siyuan began writing on , lobbying for , and organizing conferences about constitutional reform . 
The fact that Cao was detained after the 1989 Beijing Massacre , expelled from the Party , spent time abroad lecturing , and now runs a research consulting firm , seemed no impediment . 
Mr Cao was careful to stay within the bounds of moderate reformism , yet he openly called for reform within five areas of governance : the constitution , separation of powers , elections , political parties , and the culture of politics . 
For their part , Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao were even reported to have authorized a top-level body , &quot; The Leading Group On Revising the Constitution , &quot; to draft &quot; sweeping changes &quot; that would be considered in March 2004 when the next plenary session of the National People &apos;s Congress met . 
The proposed changes were reported to include an amendment that would guarantee the same rights to property for private entrepreneurs as for state-owned enterprises , the constitutional right of Party members to choose their leaders , and even some steps toward a multi-party political system . 
The Party &apos;s evident tolerance toward these ideas was assumed to emanate from Hu Jintao himself . 
When Hu also cancelled the traditional closed-door summer caucus of old Party elders that takes place each year at the beach resort of Beidaihe , hopes were raised that political reform might actually burst forth . 
However , when none of these issues were raised in Hu &apos;s July 1 st speech to the nation , reform-minded Chinese were palpably discouraged . 
To the disappointment of many , Hu ended up giving a lackluster oration that , instead of extolling political reform , re-emphasized the dreary notion of the Three Represents - the banal theory advanced by former Party chief Jiang Zemin , which allowed businessmen to be included in the Party . 
Then reform-minded intellectuals like Cao Siyuan began to be trailed by Public Security Bureau goons , and members attending a conferences on legal reform organized by Cao were admonished by the Propaganda Department ( China &apos;s censors ) to stop discussing the &quot; three unmentionables , &quot; ( political reform , constitutional revision , and reversing the verdicts on historical incidents ) . 
It was clear that the reform bandwagon had hit a wall . 
Indeed , the Party soon issued a document to think tanks , media outlets and universities banning all public debate on these issues . 
What happened ? 
As so often in the past , this latest reform effort hit the limits of permissible Party tolerance almost before it got going . 
It is an old story in China : calls for reform by liberalizers end up antagonizing conservative Party members - in this case , the political faction of Jiang Zemin , who , although not on the Politburo standing committee , still heads the powerful central Military Commission and wields substantial influence . 
The reformers were silenced in the name of maintaining stability . 
Since the early 1980 &apos;s China has experienced many iterations of this dynamic . 
While it is true that some modest residue of progress often remains after these episodes end , China &apos;s current political environment is far more censorious and intolerant now than it was in the mid-1980 &apos;s . 
Indeed , this most recent example of reformus interruptus once again raises the all-important question of whether China can actually undergo a &quot; peaceful evolution , &quot; at least so long as the Chinese Communist Party remains in control . 
What this pattern suggests is that the Party can rarely choke down more than the smallest dose of political reform , much less outright criticism before reacting in an almost autonomic fashion against it . 
While a process of &quot; peaceful evolution &quot; offers the best prospect for change in this mutating &quot; people &apos;s republic , &quot; the Party &apos;s demonstrated inability to countenance even the most modest quotients of political challenge - even with a new generation of leaders in power - does not inspire confidence in the prospect for piecemeal reform . 
The failure of this latest mini-reform movement suggests that when it comes to politics , fazhi , or the rule of law , has still made relatively little progress in eclipsing renzhi , the rule of men . 
China may be something of a miracle of economic reform , but until changes come in its Leninist governmental system , borrowed from the USSR during the Stalinist era , a truly new New China will never arise . 
While one hopes that China will find some way to continue transforming itself peacefully , the Communist Party &apos;s continuing intolerance of free expression , and its refusal to allow its people even to discuss in public how their government might be reformed , does not bode well for the future .
