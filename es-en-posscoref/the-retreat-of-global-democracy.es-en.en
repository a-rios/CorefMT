The Retreat of Global Democracy 
A nasty , unintended side-effect of globalization is its corrosive effect on democracy . 
Even if individual countries are becoming more democratic , it seems , the sum of global democracy is shrinking thanks in no small part to globalization . 
Democracy means many things , but at its core it requires that people choose their rulers and that votes be weighted equally . 
But globalization means that nations and peoples can exert an asymmetric influence . 
America can cut off trade with Cuba not only by curtailing its own trade but by threatening punitive action against others who trade or invest in Cuba . 
Cuba , however , can do little to hurt America &apos;s economy . 
Likewise , China can injure Taiwan in ways that Taiwan cannot reciprocate . 
Of course , the powerful have always encroached on the sovereignty of others . 
Take the story , perhaps apocryphal , of an Indian diplomat showing a map of South Asia to Stalin . 
&quot; That is not an Indian island , sir , &quot; the diplomat replied , &quot; it is a sovereign nation . &quot; 
&quot; Why ? 
Thanks to globalization , however , dominant nations have a variety of new tools with which to influence other countries short of war . 
Foremost is money . 
Instantaneous electronic links and an improving system of global guarantees allow capital to flow across national boundaries as never before . 
Rapid withdrawal of such capital can have devastating effects , as we saw in 1997 when Asia &apos;s super-performing economies succumbed to financial crisis . 
In 1998 , during the Asian crisis , the rescue package offered by several industrialized nations - prominently Japan and the US - required Korea to lift bans on imports of certain Japanese products and to open up its banking sector to foreign banks ( which is what America wanted ) . 
People in vulnerable nations have very little say in the imposition of these policies . 
Trade sanctions for political / security ends also serve the same function . 
Another consequence of the freer flow of capital is a greater intertwining of different markets . 
A fall in the Thai housing market can cause the Thai baht to collapse in ways that could not have happened before ; a fall in the Indian rupee can cause a meltdown of the Indian stock market in ways inconceivable ten years ago . 
The large presence of overseas investors is the cause here . 
Suppose a New Yorker buys shares in the Mumbai stock market . 
For that , dollars are converted into rupees , which are used to buy shares . 
The aim is not to hold rupees but to make money and eventually re-convert to dollars . 
Suppose , then , that the rupee &apos;s exchange rate begins to fall . 
The foreign investor will naturally want to sell off Indian stocks . 
While a fall in the exchange rate with no decline in stock prices gives Indian investors no reason to flee the stock market , if sufficient numbers of foreign investors begin to sell , stock prices will decline so that Indian investors , too , sell their stocks . 
What can be done about the erosion of global democracy and accountability ? 
Utopian schemes such as a global government or a global bank answerable to all nations are a distant dream . 
What is needed is a system in which the poor have a voice alongside the rich in the organizations ( the IMF , WTO , World Bank , and UN ) that mediate in world economics and international relations . 
Today , equity is violated in most international organizations through at least two routes . 
First , there is the open channel , which gives a larger share of votes to the nations contributing more to organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank . 
The second route is the lack of transparency in decision-making . 
In domestic democratic politics , if the decision-making process is visible to all , it becomes difficult for any group to hijack the agenda . 
Big business and the military are able to push through their interests much more in Pakistan than in India because India &apos;s government is more open to scrutiny . 
The same goes for international organizations . 
Powerful nations , by virtue of contributing senior personnel and money , gain greater access . 
Decisions taken behind opaque walls are more likely to be diverted to their interests . 
Take the WTO . 
While it does subscribe to the principle of one-country one-vote , it is widely perceived as a preserve of rich nations . 
This is because of what can be called the &quot; green room &quot; effect , that is , what goes on behind the scenes . 
If the WTO is to be a democratic institution , it must not allow its green room to be hijacked by a few . 
This problem is most obvious when drafting international labor standards . 
Although supposedly designed in the interests of the workers in developing countries , the biggest opposition to them comes from poor countries , and rightly so . 
The form that these standards take - and the increasing talk of using trade sanctions to impose them - is close to what protectionist lobbies in industrial nations seek . 
This is not surprising given the greater access of rich countries . 
The fact that questioning the practices of rich nations ( who contribute more funds ) exercising more voting power in these organizations sounds outrageous , shows how far away we remain from global democracy . 
After all , it does not seem outrageous that Bill Gates does not have multiple votes in the US elections on the ground that he contributes more to government coffers . 
Indeed , the suggestion that Gates should have more votes sounds outrageous . 
This is because democracy within a nation is a settled idea . 
Now it is time to provide more equal voting power to nations irrespective of their wealth , because one of the basic tenets of democracy is that the advantages of wealth should not be compounded by giving the rich extra voting power . 
When the idea of &quot; one-person one-vote &quot; arose , feudal landlords predicted chaos in the decision-making process . 
How wrong they were . 
For the sake of global stability , economic efficiency and also the fight against terrorism we must instill greater democracy within our international organizations . 
This may not be in the immediate individual interest of every state , especially big and powerful ones , but is , in the long run , in the enlightened interest of all of humanity collectively .
