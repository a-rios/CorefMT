Asia &apos;s Threesome Turns Four 
SEOUL - Like many regions of the world , Northeast Asia faces severe political challenges in creating a viable structure of peace . 
Relations among the region &apos;s three major powers , China , South Korea , and Japan , are burdened both by territorial disputes and by the bitter historical legacies of Japanese colonialism . 
Of course , economic interdependence has deepened over the past three decades , but nationalism remains a convenient tool for political mobilization - and of manipulation for domestic and diplomatic purposes . 
Moreover , although the Cold War is two decades in the past , South Korea and China remain divided nations . 
Furthermore , North Korea &apos;s development of nuclear weapons , its economic fragility , and uncertainty about its very future as a state , are causes of deep anxiety among its neighbors . 
Yet , despite all of these obstacles , there are signs that momentum is building for greater regional cooperation in overcoming them . 
The recent trilateral summit of China , South Korea , and Japan is the fourth such meeting to be held , in addition to meetings that take place at international gatherings such as the ASEAN summits . 
Unfortunately , however , the leaders of China , South Korea , and Japan have not yet made any major breakthrough on the most sensitive security issues that divide them . 
Indeed , any breakthrough to the sort of trust needed to resolve these festering security disputes will require that the three countries establish their annual gatherings as a meaningful multilateral body in its own right - one that can address major issues in dispute and plan for a better regional future . 
For example , at the first trilateral summit , held in May 2008 , as the global economic crisis was gathering pace , currency-swap arrangements were agreed upon among the three powers . 
At the second summit , in May 2009 , the three heads of state agreed to start a feasibility study on a trilateral free-trade agreement ( FTA ) . 
If such a trilateral FTA can be realized , its political and economic significance has the potential to equal that of the creation of European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 , the first step in Europe &apos;s integration process . 
At last year &apos;s third trilateral summit , the leaders went further still , agreeing to establish a Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat in Seoul for institutionalizing cooperation among the three governments . 
They also adopted a blue print for cooperation over the next 10 years . 
Among the issues discussed at this year &apos;s summit in Tokyo , a few stand out . 
First , Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan , President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea , and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao agreed to strengthen mutual cooperation on nuclear safety and disaster-relief activities , reflecting the three states &quot; concerns about how effectively they can cooperate in preventing and confronting a nuclear crisis like the Fukushima disaster . 
They also promised to cooperate on development of renewable energy , improvement of energy efficiency , and denuclearization of North Korea . 
In addition , they agreed to speed up the feasibility study for an FTA . 
South Korea and China have already finished a feasibility study for a bilateral FTA , and probably will enter into formal negotiations soon . 
In the summit &apos;s joint declaration and the three leaders &quot; remarks at the concluding press conference , one can see China &apos;s clear intention to improve bilateral relations with Japan by promising cooperation on the issue of Japanese imports that might be contaminated by radiation from Fukushima . 
Such political goodwill is essential for regional stability , particularly given the deterioration in Sino-Japanese relations following last year &apos;s confrontation over the arrest of a Chinese fisherman by Japan &apos;s coast guard . 
China &apos;s cooperative approach on Japanese imports was a response to Kan &apos;s ongoing effort to calm international concern about the safety of Japan &apos;s agricultural products . 
Kan undoubtedly hopes that success in convincing trade partners to lift their bans on such products will boost his exceptionally weak domestic political support . 
Lee , meanwhile , sought to bring to the fore the issue of North Korea &apos;s drive for nuclear weapons . 
Thus , he solicited commitments from China and Japan on denuclearization and realization of the 2005 agreement on North Korea reached by the six-party talks ( involving the United States , China , Russia , Japan , North Korea , and South Korea ) . 
Though the history of the trilateral dialogue between China , Japan , and South Korea is short , it marks a new and constructive effort toward regional cooperation . 
This kind of pragmatic and functional approach , if strengthened , promises to generate momentum for cooperation on more sensitive security issues . 
At least so far , security relations between South Korea and Japan , both US allies , and China have been more or less confrontational . 
Strengthening these two countries &quot; relations with China would increase the possibility of building a new , peaceful order for Northeast Asia . Indeed , measures aimed at creating a climate of genuine trilateral cooperation are the only effective way to improve regional security .
