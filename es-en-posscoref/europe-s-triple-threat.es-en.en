Europe &apos;s Triple Threat 
PALO ALTO - Europe is suffering from simultaneous sovereign-debt , banking , and currency crises . 
Severe economic distress and political pressure are buffeting relationships among citizens , sovereign states , and supranational institutions such as the European Central Bank . 
Calls are rampant for surrendering fiscal sovereignty ; for dramatic recapitalization of the financially vulnerable banking system ; and / or for Greece and possibly other distressed eurozone members to quit the euro ( or for establishing an interim two-tier monetary union ) . 
In this combustible environment , policymakers are desperately using various vehicles - including the ECB , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Financial Stability Facility - in an attempt to stem the financial panic , contagion , and risk of recession . 
But are officials going about it in the right way ? 
The sovereign debt , banking , and euro crises are closely connected . 
Given their large , battered holdings of peripheral eurozone countries &quot; sovereign debt , many of Europe &apos;s thinly capitalized banks would be insolvent if their assets were marked to market . 
Their deleveraging inhibits economic recovery . 
And the large fiscal adjustment necessary for Greece , Ireland , and Portugal , if not Italy and Spain , will be economically and socially disruptive . 
Default likely would be accompanied by severe economic contraction - Argentina &apos;s GDP fell 15 % after it defaulted in 2002 . 
Despite stress tests , bailout funds , and continual meetings , a permanent workable fix has so far eluded European policymakers . 
Failure will erect a huge obstacle to European economic growth for years to come , and could threaten the survival of the euro itself . 
Disagreement among and between heads of state and the ECB over the Bank &apos;s purchases of distressed sovereign debt have only added to the uncertainty . 
A decent pan-European economic recovery , and successful gradual fiscal consolidation , would allow the distressed sovereign bonds to rise in value over time . 
Until then , the jockeying will continue over who will bear the losses , when , and how . 
Will it be Greek citizens ? 
German , French , and Dutch taxpayers ? 
Bondholders ? 
Financial institutions &quot; shareholders ? 
And the fundamental problem is that how the battle is resolved will affect the amount of the losses . 
Prices of bank shares and the Euribor-OIS spread ( a measure of financial stress ) signal a profound lack of confidence in the sovereign debt of distressed countries , with yields on ten-year Greek bonds recently hitting 25 % . 
The crisis affects non-Europeans too ; for example , concern over the exposure of American banks and money-market funds to troubled European banks is harming US financial markets . 
There are three basic approaches to resolving the banking crisis ( which means resolving the fiscal adjustment , sovereign debt , and euro issues simultaneously ) . 
The first approach relies on time , profitability , and eventual workout . 
One estimate suggests that a 50 % reduction in the value of peripheral countries &quot; sovereign debt ( reasonable for Greece , but high for the others ) would cause about $ 3 trillion in losses , overwhelming the capital of European banks . 
But the banks are profitable ongoing enterprises in the current low-interest-rate environment , because they typically engage in short-term borrowing and longer-term lending at higher rates , with leverage . 
Playing for time thus might enable them gradually to recapitalize themselves by retaining profits or attracting outside capital . 
A strong , durable economic recovery would make such an approach workable . 
Most European officials hope that , when combined with substantial public money to support troubled sovereign debt , it will . 
The Obama administration adopted this option , following the unpopular Troubled Asset Relief Program , which injected hundreds of billions of public dollars into the banking system ( most of which has been repaid ) . 
But some US banks , including Bank of America and Citi , are still vulnerable , with considerable toxic assets ( mainly related to home mortgages ) on their balance sheets . 
The second approach is rapid resolution . 
But letting questionable banks gradually recapitalize themselves and resolving the bad debt later - perhaps with European Brady Bonds ( zero-coupon bonds which in the 1990 &quot; s enabled US banks and Latin American countries to agree to partial write-downs ) - won &apos;t work if the losses are too large or the recovery is too fragile . 
More rapid resolution may be necessary to prevent zombie banks from infecting the financial system . 
The US Resolution Trust Corporation rapidly shut down 1,000 insolvent banks and Savings and Loans from 1989 to 1995 so that they would not damage healthy institutions . 
Scaled to today &apos;s economy , assets worth $ 1.25 trillion were sold off , with 80 % of the value recovered . 
The financial system rapidly returned to health . 
This approach requires judgment and resolve in separating insolvent institutions from solvent ones . 
Finally , there is the path of public capital . 
If market-driven recapitalization is too slow , and closing failing institutions is impossible , a more extreme alternative is to inject public capital directly into the banks ( rather than indirectly , as now , by propping up the value of the sovereign debt that they hold ) . 
This approach prevents bank runs , because banks with more capital are safer . 
But how much public capital should be used , and on what terms ? 
Private capital , of course , is preferable , but , given the risk that it will be wiped out by future public intervention , investors will be wary . 
In the meantime , regulators are increasing banks &quot; capital ratios . 
Europeans , both debtors and creditors , must address the banking problem forthrightly , and simultaneously with the euro , sovereign-debt , and fiscal-adjustment issues . 
Pretending that banks that passed modest stress tests can be kept open indefinitely with little collateral damage is wishful - and dangerous - thinking .
