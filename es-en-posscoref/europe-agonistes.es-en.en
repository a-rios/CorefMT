Europe Agonistes 
In transatlantic relations , nothing is potentially more divisive than the issue of Israel &apos;s security . 
From that standpoint , in spite of a rapprochement between France and the United States , culminating in a joint UN resolution , the latest Middle East war is in reality widening and deepening the emotional gap that has existed between Europe and the US since the war in Iraq began . 
What is unfolding in front of us can be seen as a real-life version of Luigi Pirandello &apos;s play To Each His Own Truth . 
And , in all fairness , each side has its grains of truth . 
For a majority of Americans , now more than ever , Israel is the first line of defense for the West against Iranian-led radical Islam , even if they disagree with the tactical choices made by Ehud Olmert &apos;s government . 
This war , unlike the previous 1982 war in Lebanon , is for Americans not a war of choice but of necessity . 
For a majority of Europeans , though they have absolutely no sympathy for radical Muslims , be they Sunni or Shia , Israel &apos;s offensive against Hezbollah and its result , the destruction of Lebanon , are seen as self-defeating for Israel and as potentially detonating a clash of civilizations between Islam and the West . 
For , ultimately , a resolution of the conflict between Israel and its neighbors can be only political . 
The &quot; falling out of love &quot; between Europe and Israel , so visible in most European reporting about the war , is part of a process rather than the result of a single event . 
Until the Six-Day War in 1967 , Israel &apos;s image benefited from living memories of the Shoah and the silent guilt of an entire generation of Europeans . 
The transformation of Israel &apos;s image in Europe since then is above all a product of time and size , magnified by the power of images in our global age . 
With the passing of time and the transformation of Israel from a small pioneer state to a regional superpower , Israel &apos;s image became blurred and progressively negative , while sympathy for the Palestinian cause spread , despite Palestinian terrorism . 
Israel &apos;s settlement policies , opposition to the ever closer alliance between Israel and the US , and integration of the sensitivities of a growing Muslim population all contribute to explaining the evolution of Europe &apos;s disenchantment with Israel . 
Paradoxically , given the initial Christian origins of anti-Semitism in Europe , the process of &quot; dechristianization &quot; on the Continent has played against Israel . 
At a time of reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism , a less Christian Europe has been more reluctant to consider the spiritual specificity of Israel . 
This stands in total contrast with the growing strength of America &apos;s Christian revival , with the evangelical right combining support for the Greater Israel of the Bible with a rather classical form of Anti-Semitism . 
After all , Jews are destined to be converted to Christianity before the end time . 
Europeans , with some nuances , are now emotionally united in their &quot; coolness &quot; toward Israel . 
Germany is no longer an exception when it comes to public opinion , and European governments are united in their reluctance to send troops on the ground to separate Israel and Hezbollah . 
Nonetheless , political divisions within Europe are reminiscent of those that prevailed at the time of the Iraq war . 
Of course , Germany under Angela Merkel has adopted a somewhat different stance , owing to the Christian Democratic Party &apos;s special relationship with Israel . 
By contrast , Spain and Italy are more critical and have moved closer to France . 
Indeed , in the context of the latest Middle East war , there is &quot; more &quot; France and &quot; less &quot; Europe , at least on the visible diplomatic front . 
Paradoxically , it is France , which initiated - or at least reinforced - the European Union &apos;s deep identity crisis by its resounding &quot; No &quot; to the EU constitution in 2005 , that could emerge with more clout from today &apos;s Middle East morass . 
This is easy to explain . 
As a former mandate power , France had always had a keen interest and presence in Lebanon , and its influence has been deepened by the close personal rapport between President Jacques Chirac and Lebanon former Prime Minister , the late Rafiq Hariri . 
But will France ultimately deliver i.e. send a significant amount of troops for the UN force set to police the peace in southern Lebanon ? 
By not doing so France would damage her credibility as a &quot; serious country , &quot; and her reputation for being a rare breed in Europe , a country that is not shy to intervene militarily with her troops . 
Where is the France whose motto once was &quot; I intervene therefore I exist &quot; 
Europe &apos;s other natural interventionist , Great Britain , has its hands more than full in Iraq and Afghanistan , and Germany remains reluctant to intervene in general , and in a conflict that so directly involves Israel in particular , leaving only France to act . 
The lesson for the EU is clear : if it wants to matter diplomatically , the Union must be able at least to give the impression that it matters militarily . 
The EU &apos;s current formula , &quot; United we fall , divided I stand , &quot; does not augur well for the future of Europe &apos;s foreign and security policy . 
The Middle East was a natural ground for the emergence of a new European presence in the world . 
Given that Europe &apos;s legacies of anti-Semitism and colonialism stand at the origins of the Middle East &apos;s core problems , the EU could have been at least part of the solution . 
Unfortunately , the Middle East , beyond suffering its own tragic fate , has also revealed the extent of Europe &apos;s weakness .
