Dollar Diplomacy and Japan &apos;s Lost Decades 
TOKYO - A specter is haunting China &apos;s exchange-rate regime : the long-running dispute between the United States and Japan throughout the 1980 &quot; s and early 1990 &quot; s over the value of the yen . 
That dispute ended only when Japan &apos;s economy entered its &quot; lost decades , &quot; which has made the Chinese determined not to repeat the experience . 
Of course , history - particularly financial history - never repeats itself exactly . 
But the arguments being heard about the renminbi today certainly give rise , at least for Japanese , to a strong sense of déjà vu . 
Now , as then , the United States Congress is the focal point of American anger . 
Today , it is preparing retaliatory legislation against China in response to pressure from many in the US who argue that an artificially weak renminbi is contributing to global imbalances , in particular to America &apos;s massive bilateral trade deficit . 
They are also frustrated that the US Treasury has not &quot; named and shamed &quot; China by designating it a currency manipulator . 
But , based on Japan &apos;s experience , the Chinese do seem to have good reasons to be wary of US pressure to revalue the renminbi . 
Indeed , the economists Ronald McKinnon and Kenichi Ohno have singled out US pressure for yen appreciation as a key source of the Japanese economy &apos;s long-term deflation and stagnation - the so-called &quot; lost decade &quot; of economic malaise that is now well into its second . 
The US and China have engaged simultaneously in dispute and dialogue for several years - again reminiscent of what Japan went through with the US in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
Just as China has its &quot; Strategic Dialogue &quot; with the US , so Japan had the &quot; Structural Impediments Initiative &quot; ( 1989-1990 ) and &quot; Framework Talks &quot; ( 1993-1995 ) . 
And for China now , as for Japan then , the undercurrent for these discussions is US frustration with bilateral current-account deficits . 
Both structural factors and the exchange rate are discussed . 
But the weight give to the exchange rate is higher today in the US-China dispute , because , whereas Japan had a &quot; managed float &quot; exchange-rate regime in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , the Chinese exercise much tighter control over the renminbi . 
Chinese officials agonize over the US pressure . 
If they yield to it , the Chinese economy , they argue , may fall into the same deflationary trap that ensnared Japan after the yen &apos;s appreciation in the 1980 &quot; s - under US pressure - inflated a catastrophic asset-price bubble . 
But if they continue to resist , China may face hot trade disputes with the US , which could be even messier . 
Like Japan in the 1980 &quot; s , China must defend itself from US claims that the renminbi &apos;s weakness is the source of the imbalances between the two countries . 
Currency appreciation , Japan argued then and China argues now , is unlikely to result in a significant current-account adjustment , which requires addressing not only China &apos;s high savings rate , but also low savings in the US . 
How the situation will develop in the near future can be gleaned from the recent past . 
China instituted a flexible exchange rate from July 2005 to the summer of 2008 , and the renminbi gradually appreciated against the dollar - cumulatively by more than 20 % . 
Whereas the peg to the dollar was resumed during the global financial crisis , in June China announced a return to flexibility . 
The renminbi fluctuated without a clear trend until mid-September , when it appreciated sharply , apparently in response to increased US pressure stemming from the impending congressional vote . 
In one respect , then , the dispute appears set to follow a path similar to the US-Japan case . 
It will be prolonged and occasionally very tense , but eventually result in appreciation of the renminbi . 
But there is a crucial distinction to be made between the two cases : Japan needs the US to ensure its security , while China does not . 
Moreover , the size of China &apos;s economy will surpass that of the US in about 15 years . 
So time is on China &apos;s side . 
But there is a more fundamental issue : the Chinese authorities , in arguing that it was a mistake to allow the yen to appreciate , may be misinterpreting what happened in Japan - and thus overestimating the risk posed by currency appreciation . 
For Chinese officials who believe that yen appreciation was the source of Japan &apos;s chronic economic malaise , the Plaza Accord of September 1985 - a concerted effort by the US , the United Kingdom , France , West Germany , and Japan to depreciate the dollar - is Exhibit A. The yen soared from ¥ 240 : $ 1 in September 1985 to ¥ 200 : $ 1 the following December . 
The real dilemma for Japan arrived in March 1986 , when the yen neared its then record high , ¥ 178 : $ 1 . 
Japan responded by intervening in the opposite direction - dropping interest rates , selling yen , and buying dollars . 
That proved decisive . 
Keeping interest rates low discouraged capital inflows and encouraged asset-price inflation . 
The ensuing bubble in Japanese housing and equity prices inflated and burst not because Japan succumbed to US pressure to allow the yen to appreciate , but because Japan , in the end , resisted that pressure . 
So , if China is to draw the correct lesson from the Japanese experience , it must know what really happened in Japan back then . 
What China should be carefully watching is whether there are signs of overheating in the domestic economy , and whether asset prices are rising sharply . 
Allowing the renminbi to appreciate would be a good way to prevent both .
