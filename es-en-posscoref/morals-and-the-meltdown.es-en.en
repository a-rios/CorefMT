Morals and the Meltdown 
LONDON - After World War I , H.G. Wells wrote that a race was on between morality and destruction . 
Humanity had to abandon its warlike ways , Wells said , or technology would decimate it . 
Economic writing , however , conveyed a completely different world . 
Here technology was deservedly king . 
Prometheus was a benevolent monarch who scattered the fruits of progress among his people . 
In the economists &quot; world , morality should not seek to control technology , but should adapt to its demands . 
Only by doing so could economic growth be assured and poverty eliminated . 
Traditional morality faded away as technology multiplied productive power . 
We have clung to this faith in technological salvation as the old faiths waned and technology became ever more inventive . 
Our faith in the market - for the market is the midwife of technological invention - was a result of this . 
In the name of this faith , we have embraced globalization , the widest possible extension of the market economy . 
For the sake of globalization , communities are de-natured , jobs off-shored , and skills continually re-configured . 
We are told by its apostles that the wholesale impairment of most of what gave meaning to life is necessary to achieve an &quot; efficient allocation of capital &quot; and a &quot; reduction in transaction costs . &quot; 
Moralities that resist this logic are branded &quot; obstacles to progress . &quot; 
Protection - the duty the strong owe to the weak - becomes Protectionism , an evil thing that breeds war and corruption . 
That today &apos;s global financial meltdown is the direct consequence of the West &apos;s worship of false gods is a proposition that cannot be discussed , much less acknowledged . 
One of its leading deities is the &quot; efficient market hypothesis &quot; - the belief that the market accurately prices all trades at each moment in time , ruling out booms and slumps , manias and panics . 
Theological language that might have decried the credit crunch as the &quot; wages of sin , &quot; a come-uppance for prodigious profligacy , has become unusable . 
But consider the way in which the term &quot; debt &quot; ( the original sin against God , with Satan as the great loan shark ) has become &quot; leverage , &quot; a metaphor from engineering that has turned the classical injunction against &quot; getting into debt &quot; into a virtual duty to be &quot; highly leveraged . &quot; 
To be in debt feeds the double temptation of getting what we want as quickly as possible as well as getting &quot; something for nothing . &quot; 
Financial innovation has enlarged both temptations . 
Mathematical whiz kids developed new financial instruments , which , by promising to rob debt of its sting , broke down the barriers of prudence and self-restraint . 
The great economist Hyman Minsky &apos;s &quot; merchants of debt &quot; sold their toxic products not only to the credulous and ignorant , but also to greedy corporations and supposedly savvy individuals . 
The result was a global explosion of &quot; Ponzi &quot; finance - named after the notorious Italian-American swindler Charles Ponzi - which purported to make such paper as safe and valuable as houses . 
By contrast , the virtuous Chinese , who save a large proportion of their incomes , were castigated by Western economists for their failure to understand that their duty to humanity was to spend . 
The key theoretical point in the transition to a debt-fueled economy was the redefinition of uncertainty as risk . 
This was the main achievement of mathematical economics . 
Whereas guarding against uncertainty had traditionally been a moral issue , hedging against risk is a purely technical question . 
The main uncertainty in life - the destination of one &apos;s immortal soul - nudges one toward morality . 
Even the existence of mundane uncertainty gives rise to conventions and rules of thumb that embody the best of human experience in dealing with the unknown . 
The abolition of uncertainty abolishes the need for moral rules . 
Future events could now be decomposed into calculable risks , and strategies and instruments could be developed to satisfy the full range of &quot; risk preferences . &quot; 
Moreover , because competition between financial intermediaries steadily drives down the &quot; price of risk , &quot; the future became ( in theory ) virtually risk-free . 
This monstrous conceit of contemporary economics has brought the world to the edge of disaster . 
Obviously , the traditional moral taboos surrounding money had to be loosened for capitalism to get going centuries ago . 
For example , the classical prohibition on usury was softened from a ban on charging interest on all loans to a ban on charging interest on loans for which the lender had no alternative use , i.e. , for charging interest on &quot; hoards &quot; or cash balances . 
Without the development of debt finance , the world would be a lot poorer than it is . 
Yet going from one extreme ( keeping one &apos;s spare cash under the bed ) to the other ( lending out money one does not have ) is to cut out the sensible middle . 
The prudential supervision regime initiated by the Bank of Spain in response to the Spanish banking crises of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s shows what a sensible middle way might look like . 
Spanish banks are required to increase their deposits in proportion to their lending and set aside capital against assets in their off-balance sheets . 
With little incentive to manufacture &quot; structured investment vehicles , &quot; few Spanish banks created them , thereby avoiding excessive leverage . 
As a result , Spanish banks typically make provision to cover 150 % of bad debts whereas British banks cover only 80-100 % , and Spanish homebuyers must pay between 20 % and 30 % deposit on a house , whereas 100 % mortgages have routinely been given in the United States and the United Kingdom in recent years . 
H.G. Wells was only partly right : the race between morality and destruction encompasses not just war , but economic life as well . 
As long as we rely on technical fixes to plug moral gaps and governments rush in with rescue packages that enable the merry-go-round to start up again , we are bound to keep lurching from frenzy to frenzy , punctuated by intervals of collapse . 
But , at some point , we will confront some limit to growth .
