The Confidence Game . 
CAMBRIDGE - Next month marks the one year anniversary of the collapse of the venerable American investment bank , Lehman Brothers . 
The fall of Lehman marked the onset of a global recession and financial crisis the likes of which the world has not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
After one year , trillions of dollars in public monies , and much soul searching in the world &apos;s policy community , have we learned the right lessons ? 
I fear not . 
The overwhelming consensus in the policy community is that if only the government had bailed out Lehman , the whole thing would have been a hiccup and not a heart attack . 
Famous investors and leading policymakers alike have opined that in our ultra-interconnected global economy , a big financial institution like Lehman can never be allowed to fail . 
No matter how badly it mismanages its business - Lehman essentially transformed itself into a real estate holding company totally dependent on a continuing US housing bubble - the creditors of a big financial institution should always get repaid . 
Otherwise , confidence in the system will be undermined , and chaos will break loose . 
Having reached the epiphany that financial restructuring must be avoided at all costs , the governments of the world have in turn cast a huge safety net over banks ( and whole countries in Eastern Europe ) , woven from taxpayer dollars . 
Unfortunately , the conventional post-mortem on Lehman is wishful thinking . 
It basically says that no matter how huge the housing bubble , how deep a credit hole the United States ( and many other countries ) had dug , and how convoluted the global financial system , we could have just grown our way out of trouble . 
Patch up Lehman , move on , keep drafting off of China &apos;s energy , and nothing bad ever need have happened . 
The fact is global imbalances in debt and asset prices had been building up to a crescendo for years , and had reached the point where there was no easy way out . 
The United States was showing all the warning signs of a deep financial crisis long in advance of Lehman , as Carmen Reinhart and I document in our forthcoming book This Time is Different : 
Eight Centuries of Financial Folly . 
Housing prices had doubled in a short period , spurring American consumers to drop any thought of saving money . 
Policymakers , including the US Federal Reserve , had simply let the 2000s growth party go on for too long . 
Drunk with profits , the banking and insurance industry had leveraged itself to the sky . 
Investment banks had transformed their business in ways their managers and boards clearly did not understand . 
It was not just Lehman Brothers . 
The entire financial system was totally unprepared to deal with the inevitable collapse of the housing and credit bubbles . 
The system had reached a point where it had to be bailed out and restructured . 
And there is no realistic political or legal scenario where such a bailout could have been executed without some blood on the streets . 
Hence , the fall of a large bank or investment bank was inevitable as a catalyst to action . 
The problem with letting Lehman go under was not the concept but the execution . 
The government should have moved in aggressively to cushion the workout of Lehman &apos;s complex derivative book , even if this meant creative legal interpretations or pushing through new laws governing the financial system . 
Admittedly , it is hard to do these things overnight , but there was plenty of warning . 
The six months prior to Lehman saw a slow freezing up of global credit and incipient recessions in the US and Europe . 
Yet little was done to prepare . 
So what is the game plan now ? 
There is talk of regulating the financial sector , but governments are afraid to shake confidence . 
There is recognition that the housing bubble collapse has to be absorbed , but no stomach for acknowledging the years of slow growth in consumption that this will imply . 
There is acknowledgement that the US China trade relationship needs to be rebalanced , but little imagination on how to proceed . 
Deep down , our leaders and policymakers have convinced themselves that for all its flaws , the old system was better than anything we are going to think of , and that simply restoring confidence will fix everything , at least for as long as they remain in office . 
The right lesson from Lehman should be that the global financial system needs major changes in regulation and governance . 
The current safety net approach may work in the short term but will ultimately lead to ballooning and unsustainable government debts , particularly in the US and Europe . 
Asia may be willing to sponsor the west for now , but not in perpetuity . 
Eventually Asia will find alternatives in part by deepening its own debt markets . 
Within a few years , western governments will have to sharply raise taxes , inflate , partially default , or some combination of all three . 
As painful as it may seem , it would be far better to start bringing fundamentals in line now . 
Restoring confidence has been helpful and important . 
But ultimately we need a system of global financial regulation and governance that merits our faith .
