Foreign Policy and America &apos;s Presidential Campaign NEW YORK - It is impossible to know whom American voters will choose as their next president . 
But it is certain that the choice will have profound consequences , for better and for worse , for the entire world . 
More than anything else , this reflects the continuing reality of American power . 
It also reflects the near-certainty that the next president will inherit a world in considerable turmoil . 
What he or she chooses to do , and how he or she chooses to do it , will matter a great deal to people everywhere . 
That said , it is difficult to know what role foreign policy will play in determining who will next occupy the Oval Office . 
The 2016 election is still 17 months away . 
A lot can , and will , happen between now and then . 
Two related but distinct political processes - the Democratic and Republican parties &quot; nominating contests - will play out over the next year . 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the Democratic frontrunner , though her nomination is not a foregone conclusion . 
In any case , foreign policy probably will play little role in the decision , as the issues that most concern voters likely to participate in the Democratic primary elections are domestic and economic in nature . 
The Republican side is far more crowded and uncertain , and it seems far likelier that foreign policy will play a large role in choosing the party &apos;s nominee . 
The economy is improving under President Barack Obama , making it a less attractive political target . 
Global turbulence , by contrast , has given the Republicans more room to attack Obama and the Democrats . 
Nonetheless , a few foreign-policy issues will dominate the conversation in both parties . 
One is trade , which is both a domestic and international matter . 
Obama is seeking Trade Promotion Authority , a necessary prelude to gaining congressional support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which would reduce barriers between the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries . 
Many - but not all - of the Republican candidates back the TPP ; the politics on the Democratic side is more hostile to the deal , making it potentially risky for any Democratic candidate to support it . 
A second issue certain to dominate both parties &quot; nominating debates is Iran and the international negotiations to contain its nuclear program . 
One can expect many of the Republican candidates to be critical of any proposed deal . 
Questions will be raised about which sanctions are to be eased and when ; about the terms of compliance inspections ; and about what will happen once some of the limits on Iran &apos;s nuclear activities expire . 
Democratic candidates are more likely to be sympathetic to whatever is negotiated ; but there are certain to be differences among candidates on both sides . 
A third issue is climate change . 
Pope Francis will boost the issue &apos;s salience when he releases a major statement on it next week . 
Likewise , planning for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December will keep the issue in the news . 
Democrats will be more supportive of more far-reaching US commitments , although , again , differences of view will emerge on both sides . 
A fourth cluster of issues involves the Middle East . 
There is little appetite on either side for large-scale military intervention in Iraq and Syria to counter the Islamic State . 
Then there are all the other issues , from Chinese assertiveness in Asia to Russian revanchism in Ukraine . 
The rhetoric , especially on the Republican side , will be muscular . 
One hopes that what emerges from the parties &quot; nominating processes is insight into how the successful candidates answer three big questions . 
The first concerns how much importance , in absolute and relative terms , the nominee assigns to foreign policy . 
If one thinks of national security as two sides of a coin , with foreign policy on one side and domestic policy on the other , how likely is each to land face up for the next president ? 
This is the classic &quot; guns versus butter &quot; debate over how resources , from dollars to presidential attention , should be allocated . 
Second , what are the purposes and priorities of foreign policy ? 
The realist tradition in international relations focuses on influencing other countries &quot; foreign policies and places less emphasis on their internal affairs . 
The main alternative tradition takes the opposite tack , arguing that other countries &quot; domestic affairs are what matter most , whether for reasons of morality and principle , or because it is believed that how a government behaves at home affects how it acts abroad . 
According to this idealist view , countries that are democratic and treat their citizens with respect are more likely to treat other countries &quot; citizens with respect . 
The problem , of course , is that affecting the trajectories of other societies is typically a difficult , long-term proposition ; in the meantime , there are pressing global challenges that need to be addressed , sometimes with the assistance of unsavory regimes . 
The last question concerns the nominees &quot; approach to the execution of foreign policy . 
What will be their preferred mix of unilateralism and multilateralism , and which tools - from diplomacy and sanctions to intelligence operations and military force - will they reach for most often ? 
The answers to these questions should become clearer during the campaign .
