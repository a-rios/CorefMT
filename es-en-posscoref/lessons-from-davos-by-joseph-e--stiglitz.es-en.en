Complacency in a Leaderless World 
DAVOS - The World Economic Forum &apos;s annual meeting in Davos has lost some of its pre-crisis panache . 
After all , before the meltdown in 2008 , the captains of finance and industry could trumpet the virtues of globalization , technology , and financial liberalization , which supposedly heralded a new era of relentless growth . 
The benefits would be shared by all , if only they would do &quot; the right thing . &quot; 
Those days are gone . 
It goes without saying that developing and emerging-market countries no longer look at the advanced countries as they once did . 
In response to one development expert &apos;s heartfelt despair that unfair trade treaties and unfulfilled promises of aid have cost the developed countries their moral authority , he retorted : &quot; The West never had any moral authority . &quot; 
Colonialism , slavery , the splintering of Africa into small countries , and a long history of resource exploitation may be matters of the distant past to the perpetrators , but not so to those who suffered as a result . 
If there is a single topic that concerned the assembled leaders the most , it is economic inequality . 
The shift in the debate from just a year ago seems dramatic : no one even mentions the notion of trickle-down economics anymore , and few are willing to argue that there is a close congruence between social contributions and private rewards . 
While the realization that America is not the land of opportunity that it has long claimed to be is as disconcerting to others as it is to Americans , inequality of opportunity at the global scale is even greater . 
One cannot really claim that the world is &quot; flat &quot; when a typical African receives investment in his or her human capital of a few hundred dollars , while rich Americans get a gift from their parents and society in excess of a half-million dollars . 
A high point of the meeting was the speech by Christine Lagarde , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s managing director , who stressed the marked change in her institution , at least at the top : deep concern about women &apos;s rights ; renewed emphasis on the link between inequality and instability ; and recognition that collective bargaining and minimum wages could play an important role in reducing inequality . 
If only the IMF programs in Greece and elsewhere fully reflected these sentiments ! 
The Associated Press organized a sobering session on technology and unemployment : Can countries ( particularly in the developed world ) create new jobs - especially good jobs - in the face of modern technology that has replaced workers with robots and other machines in any task that can be routinized ? 
Overall , the private sector in Europe and America has been unable to create many good jobs since the beginning of the current century . 
Even in China and other parts of the world with growing manufacturing sectors , productivity improvements - often related to job-killing automated processes - account for most of the growth in output . 
Those suffering the most are the young , whose life prospects will be badly hurt by the extended periods of unemployment that they face today . 
But most of those in Davos put aside these problems to celebrate the euro &apos;s survival . 
The dominant note was one of complacency - or even optimism . 
The &quot; Draghi put &quot; - the notion that the European Central Bank , with its deep pockets , would and could do whatever necessary to save the euro and each of the crisis countries - seemed to have worked , at least for a while . 
The temporary calm provided some support for those who claimed that what was required , above all , was a restoration of confidence . 
The hope was that Draghi &apos;s promises would be a costless way of providing that confidence , because they would never have to be fulfilled . 
Critics repeatedly pointed out that the fundamental contradictions had not been resolved , and that if the euro was to survive in the long run , there would have to be a fiscal and banking union , which would require morepolitical unification than most Europeans are willing to accept . 
One very senior government official of a northern European country did not even put down his fork when interrupted by an earnest dinner companion who pointed out that many Spaniards now eat out of garbage cans . 
They should have reformed earlier , he replied , as he continued to eat his steak . 
IMF growth forecasts released during the Davos meeting highlight the extent to which the world has become decoupled : GDP growth in the advanced industrial countries is expected to be 1.4 % this year , while developing countries continue to grow at a robust 5.5 % annual rate . 
While Western leaders talked about a new emphasis on growth and employment , they offered no concrete policies backing these aspirations . 
In Europe , there was continued emphasis on austerity , with self-congratulations on the progress made so far , and a reaffirmation of resolve to continue along a course that has now plunged Europe as a whole into recession - and the United Kingdom into a triple-dip downturn . 
Perhaps the most optimistic note came from the emerging markets : while the risk of globalization was that it implied a new interdependence , so that flawed economic policies in the US and Europe could torpedo developing countries &quot; economies , the more successful emerging markets have managed globalization well enough to sustain growth in the face of failures in the West . 
With the US politically paralyzed by the Republicans &quot; infantile political tantrums , and Europe focused on ensuring the survival of the ill-conceived euro project , the lack of global leadership was a major complaint at Davos . 
In the last 25 years , we have moved from a world dominated by two superpowers to one dominated by one , and now to a leaderless , multi-polar world . 
While we may talk about the G-7 , or G-8 , or G-20 , the more apt description is G-0 . 
We will have to learn how to live , and thrive , in this new world .
