Transatlantic Trade for All 
WASHINGTON , DC - The negotiations to create a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States are being widely welcomed . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron has called the TTIP a &quot; once-in-a-generation prize , &quot; citing potential gains of £ 80 billion ( $ 125.5 billion ) each for the EU and the US and £ 85 billion for the rest of the world . 
For a world weary of waiting for the World Trade Organization &apos;s interminable Doha trade round to conclude , even a bilateral trade initiative may seem like a boon , especially when , as a recent Financial Times editorial pointed out , &quot; bilateral &quot; covers half of the world &apos;s economy . 
But there is a serious downside : The deal could hurt developing-country exporters , unless the EU and the US make a concerted effort to protect these actors &quot; interests . 
The feature of the proposed pact that elicits the most excitement - its focus on regulatory barriers like mandatory product standards - should actually incite the greatest concern . 
Given low tariffs in the EU and the US - less than 5 % , on average - further preferential reductions will not seriously handicap outsiders . 
But , when it comes to standards - such as those governing safety , health , and the environment - the market-access requirements are brutal and binary : either you meet the established standard or you do not sell . 
As a result , third-country firms &quot; options will depend on how TTIP standards are established : through harmonization ( adoption of a common standard ) or mutual recognition ( acceptance of goods that meet one another &apos;s established standards ) . 
The first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale . 
But , in some cases , the harmonized standard could be more stringent than some countries &quot; original standards . 
Even though new standards would apply to suppliers from all exporting countries , compliance costs usually vary , meaning that those less equipped to meet higher standards could suffer . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s , when the EU decided to harmonize standards for aflatoxins ( a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds ) , eight member states - including Italy , the Netherlands , and Spain - raised their national standards substantially , which is likely to have caused African exports of cereals , dried fruits , and nuts to Europe to decline by as much as $ 670 million . 
With mutual recognition , the EU and the US would accept each other &apos;s standards or conformity-assessment procedures , allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area . 
If the policy were extended to third-country firms , it would have a powerful liberalizing impact . 
For example , Malaysian television producers could choose to comply with , say , America &apos;s easier-to-meet safety standards , then sell the same product in both markets , reaping the benefits of economies of scale while lowering compliance costs . 
If , however , the TTIP excluded third-country firms from the mutual recognition policy , their competitiveness vis-à-vis European and American companies would diminish substantially . 
Indeed , our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin , intra-regional trade increases - at the expense of trade with other countries - and that developing countries tend to suffer most . 
In fact , excessively constraining rules of origin have proved problematic for some of the EU &apos;s previous recognition agreements , such as those governing professional-services standards . 
While a Brazilian orange admitted for sale in Portugal can be sold throughout the EU , a Brazilian engineer or accountant licensed in Portugal must fulfill separate licensing requirements to work elsewhere in the EU , hampering much-needed labor mobility by forcing non-European workers to endure costly and inefficient bureaucratic procedures . 
Furthermore , when it comes to tariffs and standards , WTO rules are not created equal . 
While they protect countries excluded from bilateral or regional tariff agreements , thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive additional advantages , few safeguards exist to shield third countries from the fallout of agreements on mandatory standards . 
Even in the absence of international rules , the EU and the US could take two actions to ensure that the TTIP does not have adverse consequences for developing economies . 
First , they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a bilateral mutual-recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin . 
Second , where they do consider harmonization , they could favor the less stringent of the original standards , unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective . 
This is akin to a WTO test for departures from established international standards . 
If the EU and the US made these two commitments , the rest of the world could follow the TTIP negotiations with hope , rather than trepidation .
