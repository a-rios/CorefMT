Hard Wisdom for Scarce Water 
CAMBRIDGE - In California , residential consumers are being fined for wasting water . 
The trouble is that residential water use accounts for less than 15 % of total consumption . 
Even if the desired cuts are achieved , they will account for less than 3 % of total demand - a drop in an otherwise empty bucket . 
Meanwhile , in China , some 30,000 workers are trying to change the weather , attempting to seed clouds from airplanes or using anti-aircraft guns to shoot shells into the air , hoping to coax some rain from the sky . 
There is no statistical proof that this type of weather manipulation works , but cloud seeders are also busy in the United States , mainly in the west . 
These pointless policies are what I have come to call &quot; political placebos &quot; : attempts by governments to demonstrate to their citizens that they are doing something - anything ! - to alleviate water shortages . 
Placebos may have their place in medicine , but when they distract from efforts to address the underlying malady , they can do more harm than good . 
Measures like those in California are like instructing police officers to blare their sirens wherever they drive to create the impression that crime is being fought . 
As climate change leads to deeper and more frequent droughts , the resulting water shortages will require new , sometimes difficult , solutions that go beyond futile attempts to placate the public . 
The challenges are daunting . 
In many places , underground water is considered the property of the owner of the land where the water is extracted , even when a well &apos;s user is tapping an aquifer that spreads across thousands of square miles . 
As a result , there is little incentive to conserve . 
Meanwhile , widespread pumping lowers the level of the entire aquifer , potentially allowing salt water to encroach . 
And , because this arrangement is tied to property rights , only the bravest of politicians dare to address it . 
In some parts of California and Texas , a portion of the water supply is provided to consumers for almost nothing - delivered by a network of dams , reservoirs , and aqueducts that were built decades ago . 
The Hoover Dam , for example , which created Lake Mead , the largest reservoir in the US , was built in 1936 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal . 
Even if the federal government had intended to get a return on its investment by selling the water from Lake Mead , the dam &apos;s construction costs have long since been amortized . 
Unlike other commodities , the price of water is very often a political decision , subject to the influence of interest groups that lobby for subsidies . 
For example , most of the water used in agriculture in Texas and California is sold at a price below its cost . 
The cost for an acre-foot of water in Dallas or Austin is at least $ 150 . 
Texas rice farmers , however , pay just $ 10 , and every year they consume the equivalent of a five-foot flood . 
Such a large quantity of water is not even necessary for rice farming ; most of it is used to drown weeds . 
The US federal government needs to intervene in the water industry . 
Rationalizing the water sector would allow new investors to enter the market . 
Farmers in Texas and California need to stop growing rice , which should be imported from water-rich countries like Vietnam . 
Instead , US farmers should be encouraged to shift to other crops , such as sesame , with the government sharing the cost of replacement machinery needed to cultivate and harvest them . 
The adoption of technologies like drip irrigation would make current water use seem primitive and outdated . 
The deep price cuts and improved service ushered in by these regulatory changes prompted other countries to adopt the American model . 
It is time to turn off the tap on subsidized water and find a real cure for persistent water shortages .
