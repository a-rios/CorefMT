The Global Economics of Desire 
How concerned should advanced countries be about the outsourcing of manufacturing to China or software development to India ? 
Fear of jobs lost to low-wage countries strikes a populist chord , but misses a vital point : the prosperity of developed countries depends primarily on entrepreneurship . 
After all , no economy can raise living standards forever through innovations that make production of existing goods more efficient . 
In the short run , increased efficiency reduces the cost of a good or service , so people consume more of it . 
But eventually , consumers refuse to buy more even if prices continue to fall . 
After that , further efficiencies require shedding workers . 
Creating and satisfying new consumer desires keeps the system going by absorbing the labor and purchasing power released by the increasingly efficient satisfaction of old ones . 
At the other end of this process , producers who satisfy old desires continue economizing , because they compete for employees and consumers with producers who satisfy new desires . 
Similarly , outsourcing to low-wage countries improves living standards only if the human capital released can be used to make new goods and services . 
Otherwise , outsourcing merely reduces demand for domestic labor , just like other efficiency gains . 
For many advanced countries , expansion of markets for new goods and services facilitates - and has been facilitated by - imports from low-wage countries . 
More than half of all manufactured goods consumed in the US are made abroad , particularly low technology , mass-produced labor-intensive products . 
Virtually all the toys and shoes sold in the US are made in the Far East . 
China alone accounts for 86 % of the US bicycle market . 
Resources released by these imports fostered the growth of industries that satisfy new needs . 
Cheap Asian televisions gave Western households the wherewithal to purchase PC &apos;s powered by Intel microprocessors and Microsoft software , which are designed by engineering graduates who would otherwise have worked for TV manufacturers . 
To be sure , the speed and magnitude of the integration of nearly a billion Chinese and Indian workers into global labor markets is unprecedented and will hurt some workers and communities in developed countries . 
But as long as these economies churn out new desires , outsourcing represents an opportunity for prosperity on both sides . 
The problem , of course , is that producers of new goods and services do not create jobs at exactly the same rate as efficiency gains or imports reduce the demand for labor . 
Following the Internet boom of the late 1990 &apos;s , job creation slowed , while efficiency improvements continued to reduce the labor required by the &quot; old &quot; goods and services . 
Nor does the usual argument for free trade apply . 
Low-cost call centers in India or Chinese made bicycles do not reflect any &quot; natural &quot; comparative advantage . 
Rather , costs are low because for almost two centuries colonial powers and then domestic governments hobbled markets and restricted international trade , leaving a legacy of wages so low that they offset weaker productivity . 
Moreover , exports to low-wage countries cannot compensate for job losses . 
A Chinese worker simply cannot buy the same goods and services as a worker in the EU , and workers in low-wage countries spend only a small portion of their incomes on EU products . 
As incomes in China grow , imports from other low or middle-income countries rise faster than imports from high-wage countries . 
China &apos;s trade surplus with the US exceeds $ 100 billion , but it runs a deficit with India . 
Uncertainty about jobs breeds anxiety , and anxiety stokes protectionist sentiments . 
But , apart from a few industries , such as toys and bicycles , far fewer jobs are lost to imports than to efficiency improvements . 
Manufacturing employment in the US fell in 2003 to its lowest level since 1964 , but thanks to a tripling in output per worker , total manufacturing output was roughly three times larger . 
Pressure to reduce costs in the recent downturn may have accelerated the movement of jobs to low-wage locations , but this accounts for only 15-35 % of the decline in employment since the downturn began . 
The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter attributed the boom-and-bust cycles of the 19th century to periodic bursts of &quot; creative destruction &quot; followed by lulls in innovative activity . 
More effective use of counter-cyclical policies may have subsequently smoothed out the economic cycle , but this cannot explain why productivity and incomes also grew more rapidly than in the 19th century . 
Standard supply-side arguments fare no better . 
After all , tax rates were higher in the 20th century and regulation more extensive . 
A critical factor is large scale , non-destructive creation . 
Inventions from 1850 to 1900 may well overshadow those of the entire 20th century , but they were the result of a few inventors , such as Thomas Edison , who satisfied a small wealthy clientele . 
In the 20th century , many entrepreneurs , large companies , financiers , and inventors developed products and services for the masses . 
Moreover , their innovations created and satisfied many new consumer desires . 
Airplanes , for instance , didn &apos;t reduce demand for automobiles : people fly when they would not otherwise have driven . 
These new mass markets sustained a steady increase in average incomes and total employment . 
Simply put , the long-term prosperity of developed economies depends on their capacity to create and satisfy new consumer desires . 
Provided this capacity remains in good repair , job &quot; losses &quot; - through improvements in the efficiency of domestic production or through outsourcing to low-wage countries - will enhance standards of living . 
But if this capacity is impaired , neither the low road of protection nor the high road of free trade can do much good .
