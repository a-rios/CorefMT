What Does Germany Want ? 
PRINCETON - By now , everyone knows that Germany is calling the shots not just in the eurozone , but across all of Europe . 
Inside Germany , there used be endless debates about German identity - what one historian called &quot; the continual dispute about what being German might mean . &quot; 
But , in foreign-policy terms , post-war West Germany - and , later , reunified Germany - was utterly predictable : never against the West ; always for more Europe . 
Now , the &quot; Berlin Republic &quot; is very secure about its identity - and seemingly at sea in its dealings with the world . 
There are structural reasons for this change . 
Germany is too small to be a global player , but too big to be merely first among equals in Europe . 
While Germans generally see no legitimacy in a global role , even in alliance with the country &apos;s old partners , Germany &apos;s neighbors do not find a German-led Europe legitimate . 
Contrary to the fears of many of these neighbors in 1990 ( and contrary to what many analysts claim now ) , the Berlin Republic is not more nationalistic than the old West Germany . 
True , the left-liberal pacifist milieu that in the old Federal Republic disproportionately influenced published opinion with its political pieties disappeared during the 1990 &quot; s ; but today &apos;s more &quot; normal &quot; Germany did not begin forgetting the Nazi past and reasserting itself as a Great Power . 
To the extent that there is a new German patriotism , it is ironic ; if there is pride , it is pride in how thoroughly the country has dealt with the double legacy of Nazism and East German state socialism ( in addition to pride in the economy and the constitution ) . 
Germans - for once not so ironically - often present themselves as world champions at &quot; coming to terms with the past &quot; ; and their new capital &apos;s architecture - derided by some as &quot; antiquarian masochism &quot; - literally gives this ethos concrete expression . 
Moral disputes over history , once the most acrimonious in post-war Europe , are over , and even the Left Party - still somewhat nostalgic for East Germany - is coming around to an anti-totalitarian consensus , with real consequences for policy and political self-perception . 
Nobody wants to repeal citizenship legislation that makes birthplace , not bloodlines , the basis of belonging , and everybody is proud that right-wing populism has never taken off in the way that it has among some of Germany &apos;s neighbors . 
Indeed , while received opinion has moved to the right on economics and foreign policy since 1990 , the party spectrum as a whole has moved to the left . 
The Social Democrats , the Greens , the Left Party , and now possibly the left-libertarian Pirates ( who polled close to 9 % in the recent Berlin elections , but have yet to entrench themselves nationally ) potentially represent a structural majority for the left . 
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Christian Democratic Union is in many ways de facto a social democratic , and certainly not a nationalist , party . 
Germany &apos;s behavior today is not driven by nationalism ( not even economic nationalism ) , but by German elites &quot; loss of a political compass , as well as the Berlin Republic &apos;s new domestic and international circumstances . 
Berlin is not sleepy Bonn , and the world of the 24-news cycle is not the same as the clubby atmosphere of the old Federal Republic , where only the opinion of one or two newspapers mattered . 
In foreign policy , Germany has no real global game plan : witness its blunders over Libya , and its clumsy attempts to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council . 
In Europe , Germany is obviously the indispensable nation , yet it lacks not only a clear mandate to lead , but also a clear sense of what the European Union should look like after the great projects of peace , the common market , and enlargement are more or less completed . 
Previously , the question of Europe &apos;s final shape could be postponed or finessed . 
Now , Merkel has had the misfortune of inheriting an incoherent project ( a currency union without fiscal and political union ) - a situation that demands some type of vision from a politician famously good at everything but articulating one . 
Thus , Germany &apos;s political class , confused about what it wants and generally unable to explain to citizens what it does , has responded with short-term solutions : yes , more Europe , but no European state ; yes , more money to pour down fiscal black holes , but no departure from the old Bundesbank orthodoxies . 
Merkel &apos;s style has exacerbated this confusion : she prefers to lead from behind and seems incapable of the stateswoman-like speech that would bring people to accept bolder measures . 
Others have filled this vacuum . 
Even the most banal statements of Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl , pronouncing from retirement on the dangers of betraying their European dream , are adored as shimmering pearls of wisdom . 
The president of Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court openly speculates that , if more Europe is needed for technocratic reasons , it might be time for the people to vote on a new constitution . 
Leading intellectuals recommend that Europe &apos;s periphery be permanently disempowered for the sake of Franco-German leadership . 
Others wish that Germany could be like Switzerland and retreat from a complex world that poses too many moral challenges . 
Deep down , however , everybody knows that there is no way back to Bonn . 
Unlike in the post-war decades , Germans no longer want to escape to &quot; Europe &quot; from their difficult fatherland . 
Today &apos;s generations are far too comfortable with being German to see Europe as the answer to all of their problems . 
Still , they probably would be willing to do much more with and for Europe if someone explained why it fits their ideals and interests . 
Talk of a new , Europe-friendly constitution indicates that they might even be willing to give up what , along with the Deutschmark , was the old Federal Republic &apos;s most prized possession : the Basic Law , arguably the world &apos;s most successful constitution during the last half-century . 
But Germans will not give it up for nothing .
