Automation , Productivity , and Growth 
BERLIN - It seems obvious that if a business invests in automation , its workforce - though possibly reduced - will be more productive . 
So why do the statistics tell a different story ? 
In advanced economies , where plenty of sectors have both the money and the will to invest in automation , growth in productivity ( measured by value added per employee or hours worked ) has been low for at least 15 years . 
And , in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis , these countries &quot; overall economic growth has been meager , too - just 4 % or less on average . 
One explanation is that the advanced economies had taken on too much debt and needed to deleverage , contributing to a pattern of public-sector underinvestment and depressing consumption and private investment as well . 
In the long term , overall economic growth depends on growth in the labor force and its productivity . 
Hence the question on the minds of politicians and economists alike : Is the productivity slowdown a permanent condition and constraint on growth , or is it a transitional phenomenon ? 
There is no easy answer - not least because of the wide range of factors contributing to the trend . 
Beyond public-sector underinvestment , there is monetary policy , which , whatever its benefits and costs , has shifted corporate use of cash toward stock buy-backs , while real investment has remained subdued . 
Meanwhile , information technology and digital networks have automated a range of white- and blue-collar jobs . 
One might have expected this transition , which reached its pivotal year in the United States in 2000 , to cause unemployment ( at least until the economy adjusted ) , accompanied by a rise in productivity . 
One explanation is that employment in the years before the crisis was being propped up by credit-fueled demand . 
Only when the credit bubble burst - triggering an abrupt adjustment , rather than the gradual adaptation of skills and human capital that would have occurred in more normal times - did millions of workers suddenly find themselves unemployed . 
The implication is that the economic logic equating automation with increased productivity has not been invalidated ; its proof has merely been delayed . 
But there is more to the productivity conundrum than the 2008 crisis . 
In the two decades that preceded the crisis , the sector of the US economy that produces internationally tradable goods and services - one-third of overall output - failed to generate any increase in jobs , even though it was growing faster than the non-tradable sector in terms of value added . 
Most of the job losses in the tradable sector were in manufacturing industries , especially after the year 2000 . 
Although some of the losses may have resulted from productivity gains from information technology and digitization , many occurred when companies shifted segments of their supply chains to other parts of the global economy , particularly China . 
By contrast , the US non-tradable sector - two-thirds of the economy - recorded large increases in employment in the years before 2008 . 
However , these jobs - often in domestic services - usually generated lower value added than the manufacturing jobs that had disappeared . 
This is partly because the tradable sector was shifting toward employees with high levels of skill and education . 
In that sense , productivity rose in the tradable sector , although structural shifts in the global economy were surely as important as employees becoming more efficient at doing the same things . 
Unfortunately for advanced economies , the gains in per capita value added in the tradable sector were not large enough to overcome the effect of moving labor from manufacturing jobs to non-tradable service jobs ( many of which existed only because of credit-fueled domestic demand in the halcyon days before 2008 ) . 
Hence the muted overall productivity gains . 
Meanwhile , as developing economies become richer , they , too , will invest in technology in order to cope with rising labor costs ( a trend already evident in China ) . 
As a result , the high-water mark for global productivity and GDP growth may have been reached . 
The organizing principle of global supply chains for most of the post-war period has been to move production toward low-cost pools of labor , because labor was and is the least mobile of economic factors ( labor , capital , and knowledge ) . 
But for capital-intensive digital technologies , the organizing principle will change : production will move toward final markets , which will increasingly be found not just in advanced countries , but also in emerging economies as their middle classes expand . 
Martin Baily and James Manyika recently pointed out that we have seen this movie before . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , Robert Solow and Stephen Roach separately argued that IT investment was showing no impact on productivity . 
Then the Internet became generally available , businesses reorganized themselves and their global supply chains , and productivity accelerated . 
The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s was a misestimate of the timing , not the magnitude , of the digital revolution . 
Likewise , Manyika and Baily argue that the much-discussed &quot; Internet of Things &quot; is probably some years away from showing up in aggregate productivity data . 
Organizations , businesses , and people all have to adapt to the technologically driven shifts in our economies &quot; structure . 
These transitions will be lengthy , rewarding some and forcing difficult adjustments on others , and their productivity effects will not appear in aggregate data for some time .
