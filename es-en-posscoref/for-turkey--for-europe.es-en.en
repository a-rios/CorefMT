For Turkey , For Europe 
Turkey is now , finally , negotiating with the European Commission the terms of its possible membership in the European Union . 
But whether &quot; possible &quot; becomes &quot; eventual &quot; remains very much an open question . 
Indeed , completing the negotiations is likely to prove as difficult as the decision to start them . 
Recall that Turkey made its first application to join in 1959 , and that since 1963 , the European Economic Community , the forerunner to today &apos;s EU , responded with a delaying tactic : a request for a customs agreement . 
At the same time , having never had to take &quot; no &quot; for an answer - and after receiving a series of nods and winks that hinted that membership might one day come - Turkey &apos;s expectation of eventual EU integration became increasingly palpable . 
But ordinary Europeans have begun looking at maps , and the geography that they see cannot be denied : 95 % of Turkey &apos;s territory and 80 % of its population is in Asia . 
As a result , the fierce and lively debate - in Turkey and much more emphatically in the EU - about whether Turkey really belongs to Europe has continued , despite the start of negotiations . 
Of course , the question of Turkey &apos;s European identity cannot be answered with geography lessons . 
At least half of the body of Greek theater and philosophy was produced in Asia Minor . 
The first Christian evangelization trips of Saint Peter and Saint Paul were to Turkey . 
Later , Ottoman Turkey was for centuries considered a part of the &quot; concert of Europe , &quot; proving indispensable in defining and securing the strategic balance among the European continent &apos;s Great Powers . 
Yet this historical evidence is not enough to unite European sentiment in favor of Turkey &apos;s EU membership . 
On the contrary , &quot; the Turkish Question &quot; will be resolved on the basis of the current political preoccupations and concerns for the future . 
Fortunately , that choice was not settled prematurely and peremptorily : the process that will lead to a final decision was merely allowed to start with the opening of negotiations . 
Membership talks can &apos;t help but be long and arduous , if only because adopting the acquis communautaire ( the body of EU law ) requires that Turkey integrate around 10,000 pages of texts into its legislation . 
However , all this now seems to have a serious chance of succeeding . 
And yet Turkey scares countless Europeans . 
With 67 million people today , and a population that will reach 80 million in 20 years and 100 million in 2050 , Turkey is bound to become the most populous of all European nations . 
It is also a very poor Muslim country . 
To be sure , a few countries in Europe , mainly Germany and Austria , have welcomed strong inflows of Turkish immigration . 
But the immigrants have been mostly poor peasants from Anatolia , whose integration has proven to be difficult . 
By contrast , Turkey &apos;s large , secular intellectual community , whose cultural background is European , and from which the Turkish state recruits most of its executives , has remained in Istanbul and Ankara . 
Europe , then , is frightened by the prospect of more immigration by Turks who find it almost impossible to assimilate . 
For the moment , such immigration has almost stopped , owing to rapid economic growth - indeed , the fastest in Europe - in recent years , which is absorbing the country &apos;s available labor and has thus stemmed the flow of emigrants . 
Yet the fear remains that membership in the Union will unleash a new human tide . 
Economic fears are not the only concern for EU citizens . 
Turkey was the theater of exceptional violence in the twentieth century : its participation in WWI fueled hatred and gigantic massacres , with the genocide of the Armenians the last vicious spasm of the Ottoman Empire &apos;s brutal demise . 
Moreover , while Kemal Ataturk restored Turkish national pride by creating the secular Turkish republic , his legacy is mixed , for it includes both Turkey &apos;s strong attraction to the West and a militarization of public life . 
The latter explains much of the repressive attitude towards free speech and independent opinion that has characterized much of Turkish public life - a straitjacket that has left little room for real negotiations with Turkey &apos;s restless Kurds or for resolving the division of Cyprus . 
But Turkey &apos;s EU aspirations mean that it is now being forced to demilitarize its democracy and to find negotiated and peaceful agreements with all its neighbors and future partners - Armenians , Kurds , and Cypriots . 
Thus , if Europe manages to overcome its fears and hesitations and open itself to a powerful Muslim state , it will consolidate peace in one of the world &apos;s most dangerous regions . 
Indeed , by integrating Turkey , Europe would show that it is not a Christian club , that the supposed &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; need not be fatal , and that the European project , born out of a desire for reconciliation and the need to promote development , can spread its benefits far beyond the Western half of Europe . 
In opening itself to Turkey , the EU would finally begin to play its proper role in confronting today &apos;s most daunting political challenges .
