Mexico &apos;s New President 
CAMBRIDGE : With Vincente Fox assuming Mexico &apos;s Presidency on December 1 , Mexico celebrates much more than a simple leadership transition . 
For the first time in its history , Mexico is on the verge of four simultaneous accomplishments : real democracy , economic prosperity , social cohesion , and good relations with the United States . 
Mexico &apos;s mood is palpable : high expectations that the country will escape its past demons - instability , corruption , and massive social divisions - to become a dynamic society built upon strong , distinctive cultures , social inclusion , and a growing role in the world . 
Few Mexicans could be sure that the previously ruling party , the PRI , would relinquish power after 71 years of continuous rule . 
Yet when Fox defeated the PRI candidate this summer , Mexicans were treated to a peaceful transition of power based on an honest count at the ballot box . 
Much credit for this goes to outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo , last in line of a dozen PRI presidents . 
Zedillo championed democratic reforms during his term , enabling the elections and political transition to proceed smoothly . 
Zedillo bequeaths an economy in remarkably strong shape , thanks mostly to the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , the free-trade arrangements that link the economies of Canada , Mexico , and the US . 
NAFTA came into force on January 1 , 1994 . 
Ironically , Mexico fell into a temporary financial crisis later that same year , the result not of the trade agreement , but of a sudden reversal in capital flows to Mexico - the kind of crisis that hit East Asia three years later . 
NAFTA became the main mechanism for Mexico to overcome the crisis , as its economy dramatically multiplied exports to the US , achieving an export-led economic recovery . 
The US / Mexican economic relationship may be the world &apos;s most important example of how rich and poor economies can be harmonized for mutual benefit . 
Under NAFTA , US firms are flocking across the 2,000-mile Mexican border in order to set up operations in Mexico to benefit from lower wage levels , and hence lower production costs . 
In recent years , Mexico has been able to attract more than $ 10 billion per year of foreign direct investment into Mexico , mainly from US multinational firms . 
US firms bring their technologies and capital goods into Mexico , and then make final products in Mexico which are re-exported to the US economy . 
Under these arrangements , Mexico &apos;s overall exports have grown from around $ 40 billion in 1990 to an estimated $ 140 billion in 1999 . 
In the process Mexico has also shifted from being dependent on oil earnings to becoming a diversified exporter of manufactured goods . 
With a democratic transition and an economy primed for growth on the basis of inward investments into Mexico and an export boom to the US , President Fox assumes power at a time of great promise . 
He carries with him into office the goodwill of most of the country , impressed by Fox &apos;s sincerity , intelligence , and eagerness to lead Mexico in an open and professional manner . 
Fox lived up to this promise with his choice of cabinet ministers . 
To an amazing extent , he reached out to experts in many areas , choosing professionals of impeccable reputations for probity and accomplishment , rather than politicians eager for patronage . 
Of course expertise is only part of the story of good governance . 
These new cabinet ministers will have to show that they can be effective in politics in the best sense as well as - building coalitions , gaining public support , and helping to galvanize the public &apos;s current optimism into practical programs . 
The Fox Administration will benefit from a basically sound framework for Mexican economic growth , in which Mexico &apos;s economic prosperity will emerge in part from increasing economic integration with Canada and the US . 
President Fox will be the first to acknowledge that NAFTA is just part of the story . 
After seventy-one years of one party rule in Mexico , and decades of under-investment in key areas of Mexican economic life , there remains much to accomplish . 
The first goal is to create the rule of law in Mexico . 
Decades of lawlessness have given Mexico a corrupt judicial system , lack of legal protection for minority groups , massive tax evasion , organized crime , and police viewed more as a threat than source of protection . 
Part of the problem can indeed be addressed by honest leadership and a more democratic system . 
Part of the problem , alas , may lie beyond Mexico &apos;s control . 
America &apos;s insatiable demand for cocaine has made Mexico a transit route from South American producers . 
The US treats its drug problem in criminal terms , trying to use police and military tactics to block drug supplies . 
This has been a losing battle , but has dramatically increased violence and corruption in Mexico by ensuring that drug trafficking is a lucrative business . 
The US would help Mexico by focusing on drug treatment and reducing demand and much less on military and police solutions . 
Fox &apos;s second goal should be to prepare Mexicans for life in the global knowledge economy . 
One key to competitiveness will be high levels of education for a broad population . 
Mexico still has low levels of enrolment for secondary school and only around 16 % of the university-aged population is enrolled in high education . 
Universal access to secondary school for rich and poor alike , and a rapidly rising proportion of students going to University must be the goal . 
Mexico also ranks very low in comparison with high-income countries in the quality of its science and mathematics education , and its efforts in scientific research . 
For example , Mexico spends only around one-third of one percent of GNP on research and development , while Korea ( as a comparison ) spends more than 2 % of GNP on research and development . 
Other major goals include upgrading health care , reforming financial markets , and aiming to reduce the high levels of income inequality . 
Also , Mexico needs to diversify its economy , so that it is not completely dependent on US prosperity . 
But despite the huge challenges ahead , the basic message is clear . 
With the arrival of the Fox Administration , Mexico &apos;s chances for democracy and prosperity are the best they &apos;ve been at any time in Mexico &apos;s modern history .
