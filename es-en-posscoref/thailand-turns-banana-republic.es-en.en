Thailand Turns Banana Republic 
BANGKOK - &quot; Thailand &apos;s future is up for grabs , &quot; proclaimed the eminent Thai scholar Thitinan Pongsudhirak just before the country &apos;s Constitutional Court ruled , in effect , that the ruling People Power Party ( PPP ) and its two smaller coalition partners are &quot; illegal , &quot; and hence must disband due to &quot; election frauds &quot; committed by party executives a year ago . 
Party leaders , including Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat , are barred from politics for five years . 
With that one stroke , Thailand &apos;s popularly elected government fell . 
Parliament must now reconstitute itself without the three parties loyal to Somchai . 
In Thailand &apos;s current crisis , history is repeating itself , for the PPP under Somchai was the same Thai Rak Thai ( Thais Love Thais ) Party formed by the ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , a figure much-hated by the country &apos;s Bangkok-based elite . 
The PPP was created because TRT had been outlawed at the time of Thaksin &apos;s removal . 
What is perverse about this is that every recent poll in Thailand shows that Thaksin remains wildly popular with the vast majority of Thais , most of whom live outside Bangkok . 
So , despite the ousting of two Thaksin proxies in a row by the court and the elite , Thais are likely to return yet another Thaksin loyalist if they are allowed to vote in an unrigged election . 
The current crisis has been brewing for some time , but the breaking point came when anti-government protestors occupied Bangkok &apos;s main airport . 
The protestors march under the banner of the &quot; People &apos;s Alliance for Democracy , &quot; but the truth is that they have resorted to undemocratic means to topple a democratically elected government . 
This parade of toppled and ousted governments has led Pavin Chchavalpongpun , another eminent Thai scholar , to call his country a &quot; failed state . &quot; 
That description may not yet be true , but the shadow of state failure is certainly growing . 
Thaksin &apos;s unforgivable sin was his violation of Thailand &apos;s unwritten rules about how the country &apos;s ruling elites are to behave . 
The key rule here is that the winner in any power play must not shut out his opponents . 
In a land of &quot; smiles &quot; and plenty , the winner must not take all . 
But Thaksin , a self-made billionaire , allowed his greed and huge electoral successes to get the better of him . 
After his two landslide victories , he thought he could have it all . 
The traditional Bangkok elites had always thought of him as an uncouth upstart . 
Once in power , he essentially shut them out of the &quot; grabbing &quot; game , preserving it for himself and his cronies . 
Thaksin &apos;s supposedly legal &quot; tax planning , &quot; which allowed him to pay zero capital gains tax on the billion dollar sale of his flagship telecom company , Shin Corporation , in 2006 , offended the rising urban professional classes . 
But Thaksin had by then won over Thailand &apos;s rural population through popular policies including handouts . 
Some of these projects were the proverbial bridges to nowhere . 
Thaksin &apos;s rural base rewarded him by returning him to power , ignoring his personal corruption . 
Thaksin &apos;s detractors call his rural strategy ( which his proxy successors have followed ) cynical vote buying . 
But Thaksin &apos;s rural base wonders why the anti-Thaksin groups and his predecessors in power never tried to do much for them . 
Such vote buying to win hearts and minds is , after all , a fair game for any party to indulge in . 
The going &quot; wage &quot; for the &quot; Rent-A-Crowds &quot; at the heart of the crisis was 300 Baht a day per person , plus food , transportation , and a clean yellow T-shirt - yellow being the Royal color . 
These protests have run , on and off , for nearly 200 days , with crowd sizes ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands . It is widely known that the anti-Thaksin business elites provided the money to keep people in the street . 
Thailand &quot; s universally loved and respected King has not taken a public stand on the occupation of the airports nor on any other recent public demonstrations . 
Some analysts say anti-government leaders have hijacked the Royal Color to pretend that they have his support . 
Nevertheless it is widely believed that Thaksin committed &quot; lèse majesté &quot; by attempting to undermine the moral authority of the crown , a cornerstone of the kingdom , perhaps replacing it with a republic that he would control . Lèse majesté is a grave crime in Thailand . 
It is true that Thailand &apos;s queen herself recently presided over the funeral of a protestor killed in a clash with the police . 
From that point on , policing of the protests became utterly passive . 
The queen is rumored to have said she would pay the medical expenses of any injured demonstrators . 
The anti-Thaksin factions have failed to produce a knockout in any recent general election . 
Street protests to paralyze the government remain their sole weapon . But until and unless the anti-Thaksin civilian elite can convince the rest of the country that they are serious about winning the hearts and minds of the poor , Thailand will remain on a knife edge between banana republic and failed state .
