Global Development &apos;s Winning Goals 
NEW YORK - The world &apos;s governments meet at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 25 to discuss how to accelerate progress on the Millennium Development Goals , and also to agree on a timetable for a new set of Sustainable Development Goals . 
The MDGs , adopted in 2000 , will conclude in 2015 , to be followed by the SDGs , most likely for the 2015-2030 period . 
The MDGs focus on ending extreme poverty , hunger , and preventable disease . 
The SDGs will continue the fight against extreme poverty , but also add the challenges of ensuring more equitable economic growth and environmental sustainability , especially the key goal of curbing the dangers of human-induced climate change . 
Setting international development goals has made a huge difference in people &apos;s lives , particularly in the poorest places on the planet . 
Sub-Saharan Africa has benefited enormously from the MDGs , and we can learn from that success in designing the SDGs . 
To see the MDGs &quot; importance for Sub-Saharan Africa , one need only compare the decade before their adoption with the decade after . 
In the ten years before the MDGs , economic growth in the region was slow , the poverty rate was high ( and rising ) , and there was an increasingly heavy disease burden , including HIV / AIDS and malaria . 
The adoption of the MDGs focused increased attention by African governments , non-governmental organizations , UN agencies , international donors , foundations , and activists on the urgency of combating poverty , hunger , and disease . 
The MDGs also cast a global spotlight on the crippling debt burdens faced by many of Africa &apos;s poorest countries , leading to a process of debt cancelation led by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
From 2000 to 2010 , Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s poverty rate ( as measured by the share of those living on less than $ 1.25 / day ) fell to 48.5 % , after having risen from 56.5 % to 58 % in the 1990-1999 period , while overall annual economic growth , which averaged 2.3 % from 1990 to 2000 , more than doubled , to 5.7 % during the 2000-2010 period . 
There were significant improvements in disease control as well . 
From 1990 to the peak year , around 2004 , annual malaria deaths rose from roughly 800,000 to 1.6 million . 
After that point , upon the MDGs-inspired mass distribution of anti-malaria bed nets , malaria deaths began to decline , to around 1.1 million per year in 2010 , and perhaps lower now . 
Likewise , as of 2000 , there were still no official donor-supported programs to enable poor Africans to receive antiretroviral treatment for AIDS . 
Thanks in large part to the agenda-setting power of the MDGs , donor programs to fight AIDS began to be implemented , and more than six million Africans now receive antiretroviral treatment supported by official donor programs . 
As Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on the MDGs since 2001 ( to Kofi Annan until 2006 , and to Ban Ki-moon since 2007 ) , I have seen how seriously many African governments take the targets , using them to set priorities , catalyze stakeholders , increase public awareness and motivation , and hold ministries accountable . 
Over time , the UN and the high-income countries &quot; donor agencies increasingly used the MDGs to help organize their own work in Africa as well . 
While the MDGs are not the only factor underpinning the improvements since 2000 , they have played a huge role . 
Of course , much remains to be done to maximize progress on achieving the targets set by the MDGs . 
Most important , significant gains in health could be attained with adequate financial resources . 
Donor countries should provide ample replenishment funding later this year to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria , which would ensure this vital agency &apos;s continued success . 
When UN member states turn to the next set of global development goals , they should learn from the MDGs . 
First , keeping the list of SDGs relatively short - no more than ten - will make them easy to remember , which will help in mobilizing the public . 
Second , all governments , rich and poor , should be accountable for meeting the SDGs as implementers . 
The MDGs applied mainly to poor countries as implementers and to rich countries as donors . 
The SDGs should apply to all countries as implementers ( and also to rich countries as donors ) . 
Indeed , when it comes to problems like climate change , which will be at the core of the new SDGs , rich countries have more work ahead of them than poor countries do . 
Third , the SDGs should build on the MDGs . 
The MDGs helped to cut global extreme poverty by more than half . 
The World Bank , to its credit , has already adopted the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 . 
UN member states should do the same . 
When the MDGs first appeared , the relevant specialists began to organize themselves to give advice on achieving them . 
The UN Millennium Project synthesized the counsel of roughly 250 global experts on crucial development issues . 
The same process of expert advice and problem solving is urgently needed on issues such as low-carbon energy , sustainable agriculture , resilient cities , and universal health coverage , all of which are likely to feature in the SDGs . 
Fifty years ago , US President John F. Kennedy declared that , &quot; By defining our goal more clearly , by making it seem more manageable and less remote , we can help all people to see it , to draw hope from it , and to move irresistibly towards it . &quot; 
The MDGs have helped to play that role in the fight against poverty .
