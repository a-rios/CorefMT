The Enduring Egypt-Iran Divide 
WASHINGTON , DC - Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi may look besieged at home , but by brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in November , he enhanced his diplomatic stature mightily across the entire Middle East . 
Indeed , as 2012 comes to a close , Egypt &apos;s centrality to regional diplomacy has been restored . 
The big question for 2013 is whether Morsi will follow his achievement in Gaza by tackling another major diplomatic challenge : rebuilding relations with Iran after more than three decades of animosity . 
Initially , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s ascent to power in the aftermath of the massive popular protests that toppled Morsi &apos;s predecessor , Hosni Mubarak , inspired hope of renewed diplomatic ties with Iran . 
Relations between the two countries collapsed in 1980 , after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to power in Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution and severed ties in response to Egypt &apos;s formal recognition of Israel the previous year . 
Egypt &apos;s then-president , Anwar El Sadat , granted the exiled Shah of Iran permission to live in Egypt , and supported Iraq in its eight-year war with the Islamic Republic . 
The Shah was ultimately buried in a mosque in Cairo . 
After Mubarak &apos;s ouster last year , Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei welcomed the prospect of Islamist rule , with delegations from both countries exchanging visits . 
For Khamenei , the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; was in fact an &quot; Islamic Awakening . &quot; 
Islamists in Iran and Egypt have a strong ideological connection . 
They share anti-Israel sentiment , and support Hamas against the secular-nationalist Fatah in the Palestinians &quot; internecine struggle . 
Committed to governance under Sharia ( Islamic law ) , they both view Western culture as a threat . 
Iran has made some efforts to establish stronger economic relations with Egypt &apos;s Islamist government and , in turn , cement a powerful anti-Israel front in the region . 
Iran &apos;s attempt to strike a deal to sell Egypt crude oil would also help the Iranian government to cope with economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union . 
Beyond economics , Khamenei has an emotional attachment to Egypt . 
A student of the Egyptian style of Koran recitation , he gathers Koran reciters from Egypt , as well as from other Islamic countries , in his home every Ramadan . 
More important , his outlook has been heavily influenced by the writings of Sayyid Qutb , the Egyptian theoretician of the Muslim Brotherhood . 
Prior to the revolution , Khamenei translated three of Qutb &apos;s books into Farsi . 
Despite these ideological affinities , political disagreements make a rapprochement unlikely . 
The Muslim Brotherhood considers itself the bastion of modern political Islam , and believes that it should assume a leadership role for all Islamist groups and states . 
For his part , Khamenei describes himself as the &quot; leader of the Islamic world , &quot; and calls Iran its &quot; mother city &quot; ( Umm al Qora ) . 
Moreover , the Sunni-Shia divide could pose a major challenge for Egypt-Iran relations . 
The Muslim Brotherhood is working to strengthen ties with Sunni allies , such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and even Turkey , rather than with Iran &apos;s Shia regime , which threatens Sunni regimes by exporting revolution and pitting Shia minorities against their governments . 
In fact , since Mubarak &apos;s ouster , anti-Shia propaganda has gained traction in the Egyptian public sphere , with books alleging Shia corruption of Islam &apos;s true meaning filling the shelves of Cairo &apos;s bookstores . 
But these governments attribute the protests to Iranian agitation , not to legitimate domestic grievances . 
Indeed , many of Cairo &apos;s cultural landmarks , for example , were built under the Shia Fatimid Caliphate . 
And , before last year &apos;s revolution , Egypt was considered one of the most Shia-friendly Sunni countries in the Arab world . 
But the Muslim Brotherhood remains financially dependent on the Gulf monarchies , which are using Egypt as a platform for their anti-Shia , anti-Iran agenda . 
During its years in opposition , the Muslim Brotherhood considered Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution an example of how a transnational Islamist government might assume power . 
But , in the face of a popular uprising in Syria , Iran has supported the brutal , repressive policies of President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
As a result , Islamists in Egypt are beginning to view Iran as a status quo power , not an agent of revolutionary change . 
Furthermore , the flow of military supplies from Iran , together with battlefield support for Assad &apos;s regime from Iran &apos;s Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah , reinforce the perception of a Sunni-Shia conflict in Syria . 
In this context , the collapse of Assad &apos;s regime would likely exacerbate tensions between Iran and Egypt - especially given that Syria &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood , the leading opposition group , would likely play a strong , even dominant , role in a new Syrian order . 
For now , Egypt &apos;s government is putting national interests ahead of pan-Islamist aspirations . 
Rather than inciting an escalation in fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza , Egypt worked with the US and other regional allies to broker a cease-fire . 
By contrast , Iran &apos;s military leaders boasted about their support for Hamas , offering no indication that they wanted the fighting to end . 
Less than two years after Egypt &apos;s revolution , Morsi &apos;s government is struggling to address domestic challenges , including the proliferation of armed radical groups in Sinai .
