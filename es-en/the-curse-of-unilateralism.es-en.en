The Curse of Unilateralism 
The realization in the United States that the war in Iraq has been lost is perhaps the most momentous fact of international politics in 2006 . 
The time of American unilateralism is objectively over . 
Whether US foreign policy will come to reflect this fact , only the future will tell . 
Unfortunately , this also means that a unique opportunity has been lost . 
For only the US - with all its power and sense of mission - had the ability to establish a new world order at the beginning of the twenty-first century . 
To achieve this , the US would have had to subordinate its power to the goal of shaping the new order , much as it did at the close of World War II in 1945 . 
Instead , America succumbed to the temptation of unilateralism . 
National greatness for a world power always arises from its ability to shape the world . 
If a great power forgets this , or loses the ability to act accordingly , it begins to decline . 
It is almost tempting to think that America &apos;s great Cold War opponent , the Soviet Union , with its sudden disappearance 15 years ago this month , left its own Trojan horse for America - the poisoned gift of unilateralism . 
Without a fundamental turnaround in American political consciousness , the unilateralist amnesia of US foreign policy will have far-reaching consequences and leave a huge vacuum in the global system . 
No other nation - not China , Europe , India , or Russia - has the power and the sense of mission to take on America &apos;s role . 
Only America was ( and potentially still is ) able to fuse realism and idealism , self-interest and ethics , in its foreign policy . 
Only the US pursued a foreign policy that conceived freedom and democracy as its mission . 
This was not always and everywhere the case - certainly not in Latin America . 
But where it did apply , America &apos;s strength and willingness to seek international cooperation created an order whose institutions still hold the world together . 
The UN , NATO , the IMF and the World Bank , the law of nations and international criminal law , even today &apos;s free and united Europe - all are crowning achievements of US foreign policy . 
They mark the moments in history when America &apos;s power was used to further a global order , while also pursuing America &apos;s own interests in the most effective and sustainable manner . 
America &apos;s departure from this great tradition did not begin with the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
Indeed , as early as the final years of the Cold War , the US began to view the whole system of international treaties and institutions as an obstacle to enforcing its own interests . 
America &apos;s foreign policy elite increasingly came to perceive the US as a Gulliver tied down and oppressed by political midgets , with their laws of nations , treaties , and multilateral institutions . 
The existing world order - created by the US itself - was first devalued in American eyes , then weakened , and finally consciously attacked . 
Thus , the current debate in the US about the consequences of defeat in Iraq still falls short - because , despite all the critiques of American policy , that debate is still premised on the unilateral use of American power . 
This applies to the views of the Democratic opposition as well as to the Baker-Hamilton report . 
What is needed is a conscious , deliberate return of US foreign policy to multilateralism . 
This mental turnaround is , indeed , essential if things are to improve , because the situation in Iraq represents , above all , a defeat of America &apos;s unilateralist orientation . 
The Middle East , North Korea , Darfur , Central and East Africa , the Caucasus - in none of these places can the US still act successfully on its own . 
And yet , without America and its power , the prospects in all these places are still bleaker : more dangers and more chaos . 
The situation is the same with respect to global growth , energy , resource management , climate change , environment , nuclear proliferation , arms control , and terrorism . 
None of these problems can be resolved or even contained unilaterally . 
Yet no attempted solution will get very far without the US and its decisive leadership . 
This also applies to the future of the law of nations , the newly created international criminal law , and the United Nations . 
Unless these rules and institutions are further developed , globalization , too , will take an ever more chaotic shape . 
Madeleine Albright once called the US the &quot; indispensable nation . &quot; 
She was right then , and she is still right today . 
Only one power can rob the US of its unique position : America itself . 
The question today is whether the current crisis of American consciousness marks the beginning of America &apos;s decline or , let us hope , the beginning of a return to multilateralism . 
Will America hark back to the spirit of 1945 or , despite being sobered and disappointed , decide to stick to its lone and lonely path ? 
No other power will be able to assume America &apos;s role in the world for the foreseeable future . 
The alternative to American leadership is a vacuum and increasing chaos . 
But within one or two decades maybe China will define the rules , if the US continues to reject its multilateral responsibilities . 
For all these reasons not only America &apos;s friends have a vital interest in a US return to multilateralism . 
Given the dangers of unilateralism for the current world order , so do America &apos;s enemies .
