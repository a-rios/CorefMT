Europe &apos;s Narrative Struggle 
MADRID - The start of any year invariably prompts stocktaking , and 2012 certainly offers much to consider : the dramatic events in the Middle East , leadership change in China , and the brinkmanship of America &apos;s budget debate . 
All were high in importance , if not always in popular interest . 
That seems especially true of the painful and excruciatingly prolonged - indeed , still ongoing - process of saving the euro . 
The euro &apos;s survival in 2012 - if only by the skin of its teeth - confounded skeptics who forecast Greece &apos;s exit from the eurozone and the single currency &apos;s collapse by the end of the summer . 
Indeed , the European Union &apos;s future still seems acutely uncertain , owing mainly to a mismatch between rhetoric and reality . 
In the realm of reality , the latest of many &quot; grand &quot; summits in Brussels has left a yawning gap between Europe and a fiscal union , as heads of state stripped much of the substance from the blueprint proposed by Herman Van Rompuy , the president of the European Council , and developed by the European Commission . 
Nonetheless , concrete and positive steps toward institutional consolidation - though far from achieving the ambitions of some - have been taken . 
The creation of the European Stability Mechanism , the European Central Bank &apos;s new supervisory role , and the ECB &apos;s purchases of sovereign bonds over the course of the last year have provided much-needed relief to Europe &apos;s beleaguered peripheral economies . 
Moreover , Europe is one step closer to a full-fledged banking union . 
The main impediment to further progress is that two competing narratives have emerged to explain Europe &apos;s economic travails and lay out a path forward . 
One centers on the eurozone &apos;s structural flaws and aims at strengthening the institutional framework , whereas the other highlights faulty domestic policies and focuses on austerity . 
Alarmingly , the resulting political debate has degenerated into a shrill cacophony of moral righteousness , finger-pointing , scapegoating , and stereotyping . 
In fact , though often portrayed as irreconcilable opposites , the two approaches to resolving the euro &apos;s problems are complementary - indeed , essential - components of any realistic approach to ensuring the eurozone &apos;s future . 
Likewise , neither narrative alone can provide a vision for the EU ; the gap between them can be filled only by trust . 
Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal , and even France need to control their deficits and streamline debt . 
But no degree of austerity on its own will enable Europe &apos;s southern economies to get back on their feet . 
Consider Greece . 
Anticipating desertion by Europe and convinced that painful budget cuts and repayment will benefit only its creditors , the country has ring-fenced itself , and has been sapped of all motivation to undertake the reforms dictated by Brussels . 
Meanwhile , Germans regard economic transfers to the South as a moral-hazard problem that no European political agreement could resolve . 
Seeing only one side of the equation , public opinion has become polarized between northern and southern Europe , perpetuating a vicious cycle of mistrust . 
It would be equally wrong to imagine that institutional changes alone will fix Europe &apos;s problems . 
While an integrated financial framework for Europe is taking shape , daunting decisions regarding the design of a European resolution mechanism need to be worked out . 
A banking union will undoubtedly entail significant encroachments on sovereignty ( for example , decisions to close banks , distribute losses , or cut workforces at the national level ) , which , unless accompanied by progress toward a political union , will generate a crisis of legitimacy . 
Thus , addressing Europe &apos;s serious economic issues requires wading into the deep waters of the political imagination . 
So far , however , policies aimed at shoring up the euro have been narrowly technical , in an effort to isolate Europe &apos;s financial travails from popular discontent over its direction . 
That debate has been left to fester , serving as a dangerously dysfunctional pressure valve for turbulent and frustrated citizens across Europe . 
Confronted with the reality of disgruntled electorates , pundits are quick to bemoan the &quot; democratic deficit &quot; of the Union &apos;s institutions . 
None of these initiatives would work , however , owing to a simple , inconvenient truth : to this day , Europeans view each other in &quot; us versus them &quot; terms . 
Europe &apos;s common institutions - both old and newly created - can survive in the long run only if a common European identity materializes to underpin them . 
The emergence of such an identity depends on politicians &quot; ability to communicate to their fellow citizens the Union &apos;s real advantages and the bleak prospects of nation-states that try to go it alone . 
In a &quot; post-European world , &quot; Europe is globally relevant only when united . 
The single market is the paramount example at one extreme , with defense - plagued by duplication and lacunae between EU countries - at the other . 
Although politicians and voters are equally unwilling to admit it , the EU has reached a fork in the road . 
One route leads to further integration , while the other implies a return to national sovereignty ; navigating the former will require great effort , whereas the latter is a relatively straight downward path . 
Ultimately , the EU &apos;s future - if it has any future at all - depends on constructing a coherent narrative that articulates that choice explicitly .
