The Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Republicans 
WASHINGTON , DC - Shortly after America &apos;s Republican Party trounced the Democrats and gained control of the Senate in last November &apos;s midterm congressional elections , Mitch McConnell , the new Senate majority leader , appealed to his colleagues not to be &quot; scary , &quot; but to be &quot; positive &quot; and effective . 
This has proved very difficult . 
McConnell &apos;s strategy is typically farsighted . 
He knows that , if the Republicans are to win back the presidency in 2016 , they must prove their ability to govern responsibly . 
He also recognizes that the Republicans would otherwise find it much more difficult to hold onto the Senate in the next election , when more swing-state seats are in play . 
And he is aware that public approval of Congress has fallen to the mid-teens - nearly an all-time low . 
With this in mind , McConnell decided that continuing to block President Barack Obama &apos;s initiatives , as the Republicans had done during the previous six years , could no longer work . 
So he promised that his party would try to compromise on a few issues , and offered an explicit pledge that there would be no government shutdowns like the highly unpopular one in 2013 . 
But the strategy has been tough to execute - partly because Congress &apos; staunchest conservatives , such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and his Tea Party-affiliated allies , refuse to be tamed . 
In fact , the Tea Party candidates who swept into Congress in 2010 campaigned on a pledge never to compromise - even , apparently , if it means opposing their own party members , such as House Speaker John Boehner , whom they view as too amenable to bipartisanship . 
This refusal to compromise has put the Republican Party in a pickle . 
Meanwhile , many Democrats view their new minority status as a source of relief , as it has removed the pressure to deliver results or obey their party &apos;s leaders . 
Even Obama seems to feel liberated , proposing popular programs - for example , free tuition at two-year community colleges and a minimum-wage increase - that he knows the Republicans will reject , thereby upholding their reputation as the &quot; party of no . &quot; 
The ideological divide between Republicans and Democrats is deeper than ever . 
The Republicans eschew anything that enhances the role of the federal government , unless they consider it to be essential to national security ( the party of personal liberty supports warrantless wiretapping , for example ) . 
The Democrats , by contrast , support a more active federal role in setting national standards and ensuring that the benefits of public programs are distributed fairly . 
The Tea Party &apos;s rise exacerbated this split . 
Though the movement &apos;s ranks have thinned somewhat , its adherents continue to exert considerable influence in Congress . 
It has powerful and well-funded backers , including the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch . 
Some Republican strategists say that even Ronald Reagan could not be nominated by today &apos;s Republicans . 
To be sure , now that the Democrats are the minority in both congressional chambers , they have turned to tactics - like Senate filibusters and amendments that would be politically costly to oppose - previously favored by Republicans . 
Despite the desire of party leaders to boost trust in a Republican-led government , many Republicans care little about the effect of their behavior on their party &apos;s prospects of winning back the White House . 
Indeed , the party &apos;s agenda remains laden with proposals to reverse or overturn Obama &apos;s achievements . 
In the new Congress &apos; first couple of weeks , the House passed a bill scaling back the Dodd-Frank financial reform act . 
Numerous proposals are pending to undo significant parts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , Obama &apos;s signature health-insurance program ( if the Supreme Court does not do the job later this year ) . 
Moreover , the Senate spent weeks on a bill to force Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline , a 1,179-mile conduit to carry oil from Canada &apos;s tar sands to the US for refinement and export . 
Obama has , as promised , vetoed the bill , owing to the pipeline &apos;s adverse environmental implications . 
Though it will be difficult to marshal the two-thirds House and Senate majorities needed to override a presidential veto , the Republicans will seek to capitalize politically by portraying Democrats who oppose the pipeline as effete elitists who do not care about jobs or national security . 
But it is the House Republicans &apos; move to overturn Obama &apos;s executive actions on immigration reform - which would shield as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation - that has turned into the biggest headache for party leaders . 
They know that in 2016 , the party will need more Hispanic votes than it received in 2012 . 
In this sense , the recent ruling by a federal judge in Texas halting the order &apos;s implementation - a decision that the Obama administration is appealing - does not help the Republicans , however joyous anti-immigration forces may be . 
Likewise , House Republicans set a trap for their party last December , by demanding that funding of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) be separated from legislation funding all other government agencies , so that the anti-immigration legislation could be attached to it . 
But , as should have been expected , the Senate - which adopted a bipartisan immigration bill in 2013 - would not accept the anti-immigration baggage . 
The Republicans &apos; inability to control their House faction has exposed them to responsibility for a DHS shutdown at a time of increased terror threats . 
To break the impasse , McConnell has proposed addressing the issues in separate bills . 
In their first couple of months dominating Congress , the Republicans have passed no major legislation ; taken largely negative positions ; and may be about to impede the operation of a crucial government department . 
This is exactly where McConnell and other national leaders did not want their party to be .
