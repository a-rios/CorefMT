The Other , Brighter Africa 
LONDON - The usual images of Africa are of a continent mired in conflict and squalor . 
But this picture , based on Africa &apos;s most corrupt regimes , is unfair and misleading - like claiming that all Europeans are guilty of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; because of what happened in the former Yugoslavia . 
Yes , African has some failed states , but most of its 53 countries are mostly peaceful , agreeable places . 
Last year , the annual Ibrahim Index of African governance , produced by my foundation , showed that governance had improved in two-thirds of African countries . 
And if we look at politicians such as Joaquim Chissano , the former president of Mozambique , or Festus Mogae , the former president of Botswana , as well as men like Kofi Annan and Nelson Mandela , the high caliber of African leadership is obvious . 
This matters because good governance is the cornerstone of development . 
Governments must establish an enabling environment for the private sector to create jobs , and officials cannot consider the public purse to be a private bank account . 
Government is responsible for delivering services , but it is up to civil society to be vigilant and ensure that officials work toward these aims . 
A strong civil society that monitors and demands more of its leaders is vital to improving Africa &apos;s governance . 
As with economics , demand stimulates supply . 
The annual Ibrahim Index of African Governance tracks government performance across sub-Saharan Africa , providing a tool that allows citizens and civil-society groups to monitor their governments &quot; progress . 
We look at almost a hundred indicators and define governance in a new way - as the public goods and services that should be provided to citizens . 
We do not measure inputs - including aid or natural-resource revenues - or government promises and commitments ; instead , we have chosen to measure the impact of government activities on the lives of citizens . 
Alongside this focus on improving African governance , we must also put pressure on our leaders to encourage regional integration . 
Many small , landlocked African countries will never become serious players in the global economy without increased cooperation within their own regions . 
Today &apos;s haphazard , overlapping regional integration is proving largely ineffective , and this severely hampers African countries &quot; ability to compete in international markets . 
One of the consequences of this lack of cooperation for Africa &apos;s 967 million people is the bureaucratic replication and currency-exchange issues that being divided into 53 countries entails . 
China , with 1.3 billion people , is just one country ; and the European Union , with some 500 million people , functions as a single economic market , with most of its members sharing a single currency . 
If Africa &apos;s small and diverse nations do not come together , they will never integrate properly into the world economy , and so will not reap the benefits of our globalised world . 
Economic integration must be backed up by increased intra-regional trade ; less than 4 % of Africa &apos;s trade is between African countries , compared to over 70 % in Europe and over 50 % in Asia . 
The International Monetary Fund credits Asian intra-regional trade as the main factor behind its recent export boom and strong economic growth . 
Africa , with its huge and often untapped markets , must follow the same path . 
Africans themselves must tackle these issues , but our international partners have an important role to play . 
The debate over the failure of international aid to produce development , together with the current financial crisis , have added weight to arguments against development assistance . 
But the argument should not be about whether to provide aid - no one can question the many successes that aid has brought , or its importance in providing a safety net for those who would otherwise be left to suffer . 
The argument should instead be focused on how to get the most effective results out of aid , both for the recipients and for a donor country &apos;s tax-payers . 
Aid , I believe , is best focused on infrastructure - the bridges , roads , Internet cables , and power stations that will help our economies to grow and allow us to trade more easily with each other . 
Accompanying this should be a focus on the &quot; software &quot; of development - health and education . 
If aid satisfies basic governance conditionality and is directed at these vital areas , Africa will have a far greater chance of progressing . 
For too long there has been international dismay at the state of governance in Africa ; corruption and at times a complete lack of accountability are blamed for all of Africa &apos;s ills . 
Although this is largely the case , no one can claim that Africans have a monopoly on governance failures . 
The current financial crisis offers a perfect example , as it was poor governance in the banking sector that brought so many of the world &apos;s great economies to their knees . 
Moreover , while the international community is quick to pounce on African leaders for governance failures , it seems less enthusiastic about examining its role in the flight of African assets . 
Europe and America were slow to enact legislation barring their companies from bribing foreign government officials in return for mining concessions or other advantages , and there has been limited enforcement of the rules . 
Similarly , European and American banks keep the resources that are looted from Africa . 
Then there is the unresolved problem of trade barriers . 
If African products are forced to compete in markets skewed toward European and American producers , Africans do not have a fair chance to develop . 
The issue of trade barriers speaks directly to the question of whether there is a genuine international commitment to Africa &apos;s development . 
Finally , there is the problem of limited resources for international peacekeeping operations in Africa - always with disastrous results . 
In my own country , Sudan , and its western state of Darfur , African Union ( AU ) troops try to protect civilians . 
While the AU is providing soldiers to police the conflict , the United Nations and the international community have been tasked with providing resources and equipment , which are widely viewed as inadequate . 
No one denies that Africa has many problems . 
But those problems should not be allowed to obscure the continent &apos;s many success stories - much less to be defined as Africa &apos;s alone .
