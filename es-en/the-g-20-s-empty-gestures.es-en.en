The G-20 &quot; s Empty Gestures 
CAMBRIDGE - The world &apos;s 20 most important finance ministers and 20 most important central bankers traveled to Washington this month from every part of the globe to accomplish , predictably , exactly nothing . 
The subject of the G-20 &quot; s recent meeting was &quot; global imbalances . &quot; 
According to the communiqu√© issued by the group , the meeting focused on developing a procedure for identifying which G-20 countries have &quot; persistently large imbalances &quot; and why they have them . 
This delicate analytical task was assigned to the International Monetary Fund , which is to complete its work before the ministers &quot; next meeting in October . 
It hardly takes a team of IMF economists to answer these questions . 
Anyone who has taken a first-year undergraduate course in economics would have no difficulty in identifying the countries with the largest trade surpluses and deficits . 
The United States wins first prize with a trade deficit of more than $ 650 billion in the most recent 12 months . 
No other country comes close enough to be awarded second prize . 
The broader current-account indicator ( which includes trade in services and net investment income ) confirms America &apos;s leading role : its external deficit is nearly $ 500 billion . 
No other country has more than a $ 100 billion current-account deficit . 
Even if we look at current-account deficits relative to countries &quot; GDP , America &apos;s 3.3 % ratio exceeds that of almost every other economy . 
The three countries with larger deficit-to-GDP ratios have a combined deficit of less than $ 70 billion - not enough to warrant the G-20 &quot; s attention . 
The country with the largest current-account surplus is , no surprise , China , with a positive balance of more than $ 300 billion . 
Japan and Germany are the only other countries whose current-account surpluses exceed $ 100 billion . 
China &apos;s current-account surplus is 4 % of its GDP . 
Several oil producers have larger relative current-account surpluses that , combined , exceed China &apos;s in absolute terms . 
But the G-20 &quot; s decision to focus only on member countries that account for more than 5 % of its combined GDP will exclude these smaller countries from the spotlight . 
Only China and the US , and perhaps Germany and Japan , will be at center stage . 
So much for the not-so-difficult task of identifying the countries with big imbalances . 
Every student of economics knows that a country &apos;s current-account deficit is the difference between its national investment ( in business equipment , structures , and inventories ) and its national saving ( by households , businesses , and government ) . 
That is not a theory or an empirical regularity . 
It is an implication of the national income-accounting definitions . 
The US has an enormous current-account deficit because the federal government &apos;s dissaving ( i.e. , the fiscal deficit ) drags down America &apos;s overall national saving . 
And the reverse is true for the Chinese , German , and Japanese current-account surpluses . 
So the policy actions needed to reduce the trade and current-account imbalances are clear enough . 
The US must raise its national saving rate by shrinking its budget deficit , which currently stands at nearly 10 % of GDP . 
Fortunately , the desirability of doing so is now clear to every policymaker in Washington and to most of the American public . 
It will begin to happen as the massive &quot; fiscal stimulus &quot; enacted in 2009 comes to an end , the political process begins to deliver spending cuts , and economic growth yields more tax revenue . 
When President Barack Obama attends the G-20 &quot; s summit of heads of state in Cannes in November , he will no doubt agree to further reductions in the US budget deficit . 
But that will be an empty promise : the US president has far less control over legislation than government heads in parliamentary democracies like Britain or in countries like China . 
The history of previous summits suggests that the president will promise in Cannes only what he has already proposed at home . 
The G-20 ministers and central bankers are , of course , in no position to change the behavior of either the US or China , whose recently adopted five-year plan makes clear that it will reduce national saving by increasing consumer spending and raising government outlays for services like health care . 
In other words , China will , for its own domestic reasons , reduce its current-account surplus . 
The same kind of national self-interest that is driving the Chinese to stimulate domestic spending was at work when the G-20 leaders met in London in April 2009 and agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies . 
That agreement was easy to achieve , since it was in each country &apos;s interest to expand demand . 
The G-20 only ratified what was going to happen anyway . 
The same is likely to happen over the next few years as the US reduces its fiscal deficit and thereby shrinks its current-account deficit while China reduces its national saving and thereby shrinks its current-account surplus . 
The leaders of the G-20 will no doubt claim credit for this achievement . 
Perhaps that is why they like to meet .
