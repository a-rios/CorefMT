The Syria Lessons 
PRINCETON - As the United States and Russia try to broker a conference that can bring the various sides in the Syrian conflict to the negotiating table , potential Western participants , at least , should be thinking about the larger implications of the Syrian conflict for dictators and democracies around the world . 
Here are the lessons thus far : 
Bad guys help their friends . 
The Russians and Iranians are willing to do whatever it takes to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power . 
Hezbollah , supplied by Iran , has now moved openly onto the battlefield in support of the Assad regime . 
Russia and Iran have kept the Syrian government supplied with heavy weapons and other military assistance , including a Russian shipment of sophisticated anti-ship missiles with advanced radar systems . 
These will help Assad hunker down and fend off all comers in an Alawite mini-state that will include the Russian-leased port facility at Tartus . 
Diplomacy without a credible threat of force is empty talk . 
&quot; Speak softly and carry a big stick , &quot; Theodore Roosevelt counseled . 
President Barack Obama rightly wants to lead in global affairs through civilian more than military power ; he understands that military solutions to foreign-policy problems are hugely expensive and often counter-productive in terms of advancing US security and prosperity over the long term . 
But Obama &apos;s strategy in Syria seems to be &quot; speak loudly and throw away your stick . &quot; 
Obama has made it clear over and over ( as has NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen ) that he has no interest in intervening militarily in Syria . 
And the US response to the latest Russian missile shipment ? 
Secretary of State John Kerry said : &quot; I think we &apos;ve made it crystal clear we would prefer that Russia was not supplying assistance . &quot; 
The US has cast aside one of its most important foreign policy tools , creating an incentive for the Syrian government and its supporters to keep fighting until they are in the most advantageous position possible to negotiate a settlement - that is , if they have any incentive to negotiate at all . 
If you are a dictator facing sustained political protests , be as brutal as possible and incite sectarian killing . 
Part of Syria &apos;s agony is the self-fulfilling nature of the conflict . 
From March to December 2011 , hundreds of thousands of Syrians marched every Friday , seeking the same political liberalization that Tunisians , Egyptians , Yemenis , Bahrainis , Jordanians , and others across the Middle East and North Africa sought in what was optimistically called &quot; the Arab Spring . &quot; 
Unarmed , they were shot in the streets by riot police and government snipers , until they finally started forming small local militias for self-protection - militias that gradually grew into the loose federation of forces now known as the Free Syrian Army . 
All the while , Assad was describing the violence as the product of terrorists and Sunni extremists seeking dominion over minority Alawites , Druze , Kurds , Christians , and other groups . 
He worked assiduously to fan the flames of sectarian civil war , succeeding to the extent that now the chief reason for not intervening to stop the killing is the impossibility of doing so effectively in an environment of sectarian violence . 
Regional organizations are still unable to solve regional problems without great-power leadership . 
Turkey has been threatening and calling for military action for 18 months , but US officials say that the Turks are not in fact ready to do anything beyond providing support for refugees and opposition fighters . 
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also sending arms to Syrian opposition groups , but the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council are paralyzed . 
Without a great power that is willing both to share the lead and to push from behind , regional organizations cannot take charge in their own neighborhood . 
Human suffering , even on a massive and destabilizing scale , will not move the world to action . 
In a recent conversation about Syria with a couple of well-known foreign policy experts , one participant suggested that the Middle East &apos;s current borders , drawn in colonial times , cannot last and must be redrawn . 
I pointed out the possibility of a Middle East conflagration equivalent to the Thirty Years War in Europe , which is estimated to have killed between half and three-quarters of the population of some of the participating states . 
One of my interlocutors agreed , but said that we could do nothing to stop it , because &quot; that &apos;s the period of history we &apos;re in . &quot; 
For all the world &apos;s pious proclamations about &quot; never again , &quot; a mantra arising from the Holocaust , mass murder almost never motivates foreign intervention . 
It is astounding to think that the world mobilized immediately to push Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 , but has dithered for more than two years as tens of thousands of Syrians have been killed , and their country , a cradle of civilization , laid waste . 
&quot; Humanitarian &quot; intervention - action that is motivated by our concern for the fate of fellow human beings - is often described as reflecting &quot; moral concern . &quot; 
But how many wars does it take for us to understand that killing always begets more killing ? 
People who watch the butchering of their children and parents , the rape of their wives , daughters , and sisters , and the wanton destruction of their homes and livelihoods do not forget . 
They carry vengeance in their hearts from generation to generation , until a measure of justice is done , nursing their enmity in frozen conflicts that block economic growth , prevent the formation of social capital , and paralyze political institutions . 
When no side in a war has a reason to stop fighting , a peace conference cannot succeed . 
In Syria , the moral , strategic , and political arguments all converge in favor of decisive action to stop the killing , if not forever , at least for now , to create a space for peace . 
But if the lessons of the past two years are any guide , the wheels of violence will keep on turning .
