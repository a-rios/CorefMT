China &apos;s Policy Disharmony 
NEW HAVEN - China was hardly lacking in policy pronouncements in the final months of 2013 . 
From the 60-point reform program issued by the Central Committee &apos;s Third Plenum in early November to the six core tasks endorsed by the Central Economic Work Conference a month later , China &apos;s leaders proposed a raft of new measures to address the daunting challenges that their country faces in the years ahead . 
But , seen in their entirety , the risk of incoherence has become evident . 
The Third Plenum initiatives , for example , have a strategic focus : promoting the economy &apos;s long-awaited pro-consumption structural rebalancing . 
While the Work Conference &apos;s core tasks embody the spirit of these reforms , they also reflect a tactical focus : &quot; keeping growth steady . &quot; 
Given the likely tradeoffs between strategy and tactics - that is , between long-term reforms and short-term growth imperatives - can Chinese policymakers really accomplish all of their objectives ? 
Of course , such tradeoffs have long been evident in most economies - developed and developing alike . 
What has separated China from the pack has been its strong inclination to place greater emphasis on strategic objectives in charting its economic-development path . 
Even so , new tensions between the Third Plenum &apos;s policies and those of the latest Work Conference have raised the question of tradeoffs once again . 
The consumer- and services-led rebalancing initially proposed in the 12th Five-Year Plan and endorsed by the recently concluded Third Plenum implies slower GDP growth than the 10 % average annual rate recorded from 1980 to 2010 . 
Yet slower growth need not be a bad thing . 
Employment in Chinese services is about 30 % higher per unit of output than in the manufacturing and construction sectors , which means that an increasingly services-led China can accomplish its critical labor-absorption objectives - namely , rapid job creation and poverty reduction - with 7-8 % annual growth . 
For China , rebalancing and slower growth go hand in hand - and yield the additional benefits of less intensive resource demand , a more subdued rise in energy consumption , and related progress in addressing environmental pollution and income inequality . 
But the recent Work Conference failed to consider China &apos;s growth slowdown in this strategic context , placing considerable weight instead on the macro-stabilization imperatives of &quot; proactive fiscal and prudent monetary policies . &quot; 
Since the Work Conference was concluded , investors have been debating the 2014 growth target . 
Will the 7.5 % objective set for 2013 be maintained next year , as a recent leak from senior Chinese officials seems to indicate , or do the recent pronouncements indicate further deceleration toward 7 % ? 
The answer will be revealed at the National People &apos;s Congress in March . 
But focusing on a near-term growth target , and fine-tuning fiscal and monetary policies in order to achieve it - to say nothing of yet another credit crunch roiling Chinese short-term funding markets - detract from the emphasis on strategic shifts that economic rebalancing now requires . 
Indeed , most of the six major economic tasks for 2014 set by the recent Work Conference - including efforts aimed at ensuring food security , containing local-government debt , and improving coordination of regional development - have little or nothing to do with China &apos;s strategic rebalancing imperatives . 
Though laudable , they seem disconnected from pro-consumption restructuring . 
In fact , only two of the six major economic tasks identified by the Work Conference fit neatly with the Third Plenum &apos;s strategic agenda . 
The call for enhanced social security is consistent with the Third Plenum &apos;s proposal to allocate 30 % of state-owned enterprises &quot; profits to fund safety-net programs such as pensions and health care . 
Likewise , the emphasis on markets &quot; &quot; decisive role &quot; in upgrading China &apos;s industrial structure and eliminating excess capacity is compatible with the Third Plenum &apos;s goal of achieving a market-based shift to a consumer society . 
But what emerges from all of this is yet another example of the timeworn &quot; kitchen sink &quot; approach to Chinese economic policymaking - countless proposals , initiatives , and goals that are loosely connected at best , and that are often plagued by internal inconsistencies . 
A new approach is needed , and it will require three key changes to China &apos;s economic-policy framework . 
First , in keeping with global best practice , Chinese authorities need to be far more explicit ( that is , transparent ) in prioritizing , or ranking , their policy objectives . 
Setting different agendas on multiple platforms - Five-Year Plans , Third Plenums , and Work Conferences - is a recipe for confusion and potential conflict . 
Second , economy-wide growth targets should be downplayed . 
Such targets smack of the legacy of a state-directed economy - a legacy that runs counter to policymakers &quot; new emphasis on the &quot; decisive role &quot; of markets . 
Finally , there is a need to separate stabilization objectives from strategic imperatives . 
The former should be handled by an independent central bank with primary responsibility for monetary and currency policies , whereas the latter should be the responsibility of the new Central Leading Group on Reforms , which has just been established by the Third Plenum . 
Chinese policymakers &quot; traditional emphasis on long-term strategy has enabled them to steer past the inevitable bumps on the road to economic development . 
Now , however , as the authorities set out on a new course aimed at sustaining China &apos;s extraordinary progress , they should act quickly to achieve greater coherence in their policy agenda .
