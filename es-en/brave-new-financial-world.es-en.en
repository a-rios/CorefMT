Brave New Financial World 
CAMBRIDGE - A huge struggle is brewing within the G-20 over the future of the global financial system . 
The outcome could impact the world - and not only the esoteric world of international finance - for decades to come . 
Finance shapes power , ideas , and influence . 
Cynics may say that nothing will happen to the fundamentals of the global financial system , but they are wrong . 
In all likelihood , we will see huge changes in the next few years , quite possibly in the form of an international financial regulator or treaty . 
Indeed , it is virtually impossible to resolve the current mess without some kind of compass pointing to where the future system lies . 
The United States and Britain naturally want a system conducive to extending their hegemony . 
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has recently advanced the broad outlines of a more conservative financial regulatory regime . 
Even critics of past US profligacy must admit that the Geithner proposal contains some good ideas . 
Above all , regulators would force financiers to hold more cash on hand to cover their own bets , and not rely so much on taxpayers as a backstop . 
Geithner also aims to make financial deals simpler and easier to evaluate , so that boards , regulators , and investors can better assess the risks they face . 
While the rest of the world is sympathetic to Geithner &apos;s ideas , other countries would like to see more fundamental reform . 
Russia and China are questioning the dollar as the pillar of the international system . 
In a thoughtful speech , the head of China &apos;s Central Bank , Zhou Xiaochuan , argued the merits of a global super-currency , perhaps issued by the International Monetary Fund . 
These are the calmer critics . 
The current president of the European Union &apos;s Council of Ministers , Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek , openly voiced the angry mood of many European leaders when he described America &apos;s profligate approach to fiscal policy as &quot; the road to hell . &quot; 
He could just as well have said the same thing about European views on US financial leadership . 
The stakes in the debate over international financial reform are huge . 
The dollar &apos;s role at the center of the global financial system gives the US the ability to raise vast sums of capital without unduly perturbing its economy . 
Indeed , former US President George W. Bush cut taxes at the same time that he invaded Iraq . 
However dubious Bush &apos;s actions may have been on both counts , interest rates on US public debt actually fell . 
More fundamentally , the US role at the center of the global financial system gives tremendous power to US courts , regulators , and politicians over global investment throughout the world . 
That is why ongoing dysfunction in the US financial system has helped to fuel such a deep global recession . 
On the other hand , what is the alternative to Geithner &apos;s vision ? 
Is there another paradigm for the global financial system ? 
China &apos;s approach represents a huge disguised tax on savers , who are paid only a pittance in interest on their deposits . 
This allows state-controlled banks to lend at subsidized interest rates to favored firms and sectors . 
In India , financial repression is used as a means to marshal captive savings to help finance massive government debts at far lower interest rates than would prevail in a liberalized market . 
A big part of Russia &apos;s current problems stems from its ill-functioning banking system . 
Many borrowers , unable to get funding on reasonable terms domestically , were forced to take hard-currency loans from abroad , creating disastrous burdens when the ruble collapsed . 
Europe wants to preserve its universal banking model , with banks that serve a broad range of functions , ranging from taking deposits to making small commercial loans to high-level investment-banking activities . 
The US proposals , on the other hand , would make universal banking far harder , in part because they aim to ring-fence depository institutions that pose a &quot; systemic risk &quot; to the financial system . 
Such changes put pressure on universal banks to abandon riskier investment-bank activities in order to operate more freely . 
Of course , US behemoths such as Citigroup , Bank of America , and JP Morgan will also be affected . 
But the universal banking model is far less central to the US financial system than it is in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America . 
Aside from its implications for different national systems , the future shape of banking is critical to the broader financial system , including venture capital , private equity , and hedge funds . 
The Geithner proposal aims to rein in all of them to some degree . 
Fear of crises is understandable , yet without these new , creative approaches to financing , Silicon Valley might never have been born . 
Where does the balance between risk and creativity lie ? 
Although much of the G-20 debate has concerned issues such as global fiscal stimulus , the real high-stakes poker involves choosing a new philosophy for the international financial system and its regulation . 
If our leaders cannot find a new approach , there is every chance that financial globalization will shift quickly into reverse , making it all the more difficult to escape the current morass .
