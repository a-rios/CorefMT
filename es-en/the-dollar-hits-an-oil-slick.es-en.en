The Dollar Hits an Oil Slick 
CAMBRIDGE - The rapid rise in the price of oil and the sharp depreciation of the dollar are two of the most noteworthy developments of the past year . 
The price of oil has increased by 85 % over the past 12 months , from $ 65 a barrel to $ 120 . 
During the same period , the dollar fell by 15 % relative to the euro and 12 % against the yen . 
To many observers , the combination of a falling dollar and a rise in oil prices appears to be more than a coincidence . 
But what is the link between the two ? 
Would the price of oil have increased less if oil were priced in euros instead of dollars ? 
Did the dollar &apos;s fall cause the price of oil to rise ? 
And how did the rise in the price of oil affect the dollar &apos;s movement ? 
Because the oil market is global , with its price in different places virtually identical , the price reflects both total world demand for oil and total supply by all of the oil-producing countries . 
The primary demand for oil is as a transport fuel , with lesser amounts used for heating , energy , and as inputs for petrochemical industries like plastics . 
The increasing demand for oil from all countries , but particularly from rapidly growing emerging-market countries like China and India , has therefore been , and will continue to be , an important force pushing up the global price . 
The thinking behind the question of whether oil would cost less today if it were priced in euros seems to be that , since the dollar has fallen relative to the euro , this would have contained the rise in the price of oil . 
In reality , the currency in which oil is priced would have no significant or sustained effect on the price of oil when translated into dollars , euros , yen , or any other currency . 
Here is why . 
The market is now in equilibrium with the price of oil at $ 120 . 
That translates into 75 euros at the current exchange rate of around $ 1.60 per euro . 
If it were agreed that oil would instead be priced in euros , the quoted market-equilibrating price would still be 75 euros and therefore $ 120 . 
Any lower price in euros would cause excess global demand for oil , while a price above 75 euros would not create enough demand to absorb all of the oil that producers wanted to sell at that price . 
Of course , the rate of increase of the price of oil in euros during the past year was lower than the rate of increase in dollars . 
The euro price of oil in May 2007 was 48 euros , or 56 % below its current price . 
But that would be true even if oil had been priced in euros . 
The coincidence of the dollar decline and the rise in the oil price suggests to many observers that the dollar &apos;s decline caused the rise in the price of oil . 
That is only true to the extent that we think about the price of oil in dollars , since the dollar has fallen relative to other major currencies . 
But if the dollar-euro exchange rate had remained at the same level that it was last May , the dollar price of oil would have increased less . 
The key point here is that the euro price of oil would be the same as it is today . 
And the dollar price of oil would have gone up 56 % . 
The only effect of the dollar &apos;s decline is to change the price in dollars relative to the price in euros and other currencies . 
The high and rising price of oil does , however , contribute to the decline of the dollar , because the increasing cost of oil imports widens the United States &quot; trade deficit . 
In 2007 , the US spent $ 331 billion on oil imports , which was 47 % of the US trade deficit of $ 708 billion dollars . 
If the price of oil had remained at $ 65 a barrel , the cost of the same volume of imports would have been only $ 179 billion , and the trade deficit would have been one-fifth lower . 
The dollar is declining because only a more competitive dollar can shrink the US trade deficit to a sustainable level . 
Thus , as rising global demand pushes oil prices higher in the years ahead , it will become more difficult to shrink America &apos;s trade deficit , inducing more rapid dollar depreciation .
