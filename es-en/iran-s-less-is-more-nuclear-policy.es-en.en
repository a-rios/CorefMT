Iran &apos;s Less-is-More Nuclear Policy 
NEW YORK - The recent United States National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , which reports that Iran once had a &quot; nuclear weapons program &quot; but suspended it in 2003 , means that there will probably be no American attack on Iran during the Bush administration . 
How could America &apos;s president explain to the world why he was bombing nuclear weapon facilities that his own intelligence services have said do not exist ? 
So , in all likelihood , the world has been spared a policy that would be as futile as it would be destructive . 
Indeed , the one act most likely to guarantee that Iran obtains nuclear weapons would be to attack it . 
( Nine years after Israel &apos;s bombing raid on Iraq &apos;s nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981 , Saddam Hussein was nevertheless within a year of having an atomic bomb . ) 
Yet the NIE arrived at its result by a strange route . 
Every technically competent person knows that the paths to civilian nuclear power and to nuclear weapons are the same , except for a few last , comparatively simple steps . 
The hard part is obtaining the fissionable materials - plutonium or highly enriched uranium . 
Once that &apos;s done , any nation - or even a sophisticated terrorist group - can do the rest . 
Nuclear power requires low-enriched uranium as fuel . 
Enrich it further , in the same facilities , and you have bomb-grade highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) . 
The remaining step - slamming two pieces of HEU together to create a critical mass and an explosion - is easy : the blueprints can be downloaded from the Internet . 
Indeed , the &quot; secret &quot; of the hydrogen bomb was published in 1979 in an article by Howard Morland in The Progressive magazine , sparking a failed legal suit by the US government to suppress it . 
The hard work of building facilities for enriching uranium is precisely what the Iranians are now already doing , if not yet in sufficient quantity to make a bomb , which might take them five or ten more years to acquire . 
But , once they acquire sufficient capacity , only the easy steps will remain . 
Yet it is work on the easy steps , allegedly attempted and then canceled , that the NIE called Iran &apos;s &quot; nuclear weapon program . &quot; 
In light of the technical realities , it would have been more accurate to designate the difficult and openly acknowledged enrichment activity as the nuclear weapons program , for this is what can supply the guts of an atomic bomb . 
Ironically , Iran &apos;s suspension of the easy steps creates the impression that its weapon program has been stopped , while the most important activity continues in plain sight . 
Of course , this does not mean that once Iran has adequate enrichment facilities , it will make a bomb . 
But it is capacity , not intention , that counts . 
Iran could easily do what Japan does - hold enrichment facilities in readiness to make a bomb without actually doing so . 
Or , like India in 1974 , it might wait a long time , then dash to the finish line and conduct an atomic test . 
How has this confusion arisen ? 
One answer lies in the provisions of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which forbids nuclear weapons to most of its signatories but guarantees them the right to build technology for nuclear power , including uranium enrichment . 
Thus , the treaty unfortunately permits any signatory to acquire the most important facilities needed for making atomic bombs . 
So , when the Bush administration wanted to oppose Iran &apos;s program , merely pointing to the bare fact of enrichment wasn &apos;t enough . 
It had to point to other acts , including concealment efforts , which violate the NPT , and argue that these infractions were so serious that Iran &apos;s enrichment right must be taken away . 
The US was thus led to a series of over-statements . 
In December 2005 , Vice President Dick Cheney said , &quot; There is every reason to believe that they are seriously pursuing nuclear weapons . &quot; 
President Bush now argues that all along it has been the above-board enrichment of uranium , not some other , secret program , that carries Iran ever closer to having nuclear weapons . 
But he makes that legitimate point in vain : having rested its case on misjudgments , the administration now finds itself discredited by its own intelligence estimate . 
We are left in a situation that layers paradox upon paradox . 
A disastrous possible policy - military attack on Iran - has been headed off by a misguided , misinterpreted intelligence report . 
One question is why Bush and Cheney set themselves up for this embarrassment . 
Bush has said that he learned of the NIE &apos;s conclusion only a week before it came out - a statement that either is false or reveals a level of incompetence beyond anything suspected so far . 
None of that matters now . 
The Bush administration &apos;s habits of falsehood have undone its aggressive proclivities , leaving a gaping vacuum . 
The doctrine according to which great powers , many of them nuclear-armed , try to stop lesser powers from acquiring nuclear weapons by force and threats of force - a fiasco in Iraq , nuclear-armed North Korea , and now Iran - has reached a dead end . 
But , report or no report , the danger that Iran will acquire nuclear weapons is real , and may even have increased . 
What &apos;s missing is a policy to address it .
