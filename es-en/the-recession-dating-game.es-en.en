The Recession Dating Game 
STANFORD - The optimism that emerged in the early stages of the recovery from the financial crisis and recession has given way to more sobering assessments of the short- , medium- , and long-run challenges facing the global economy and its constituent national parts . 
In many countries , fears have even arisen of a prolonged period of slow and occasionally negative growth , persistent obstacles to reducing unemployment , and continued economic anxiety ; or worse , of a Japanese-style &quot; lost decade &quot; with multiple recessions ; or , even worse , of a depression , ( which politicians and intellectuals have stoked in an attempt to justify continued massive government intervention in the economy for years to come ) . 
But are multiple downturns so unusual in periods of severe economic distress ? 
It would be useful to know the answer to this question before trying repeatedly to pump up the economy in the short run with costly policies that might worsen longer-run prospects . 
The global recession was severe , unmatched since World War II , with the possible exception of the early 1980 &quot; s ( when , for example , the unemployment rate in America soared to 10.8 % as a by-product of the disinflation from the double-digit price growth of the late 1970 &quot; s ) . 
From the beginning of the crisis in December 2007 to the apparent end of the recession in the summer of 2009 , the decline in real GDP in the US was 3.8 % . 
All the other G-7 economies ( Japan , Germany , Italy , France , Canada , and the United Kingdom ) experienced severe recessions as well during this period . 
Major middle-income trading economies , such as Brazil , South Korea , Singapore , and Taiwan , experienced brief but even sharper declines . 
The downturn was so severe , and lasted so long , that some even used the term &quot; depression , &quot; before settling on &quot; Great Recession . &quot; 
How exactly is a recession defined ? 
Different national statistical agencies define , and therefore date , such episodes somewhat differently . 
In the US , recessions are officially dated by a non-partisan , non-profit private research institution , thus wisely depoliticizing the measurement . 
The point at which the economy stops growing is called the &quot; peak , &quot; and the point at which it stops contracting , the &quot; trough . &quot; The period from the point at which the economy starts to grow again until the point at which it reaches the previous peak is called the &quot; recovery . &quot; 
Thereafter , growth is labeled an &quot; expansion . &quot; 
For economists , a recession is over when the economy starts to grow . 
The economy falls to the bottom of a well , and then , as soon as it begins to climb itself out , the recession is declared &quot; over , &quot; even though it may be a long climb back to the top . 
Little wonder , then , that ordinary citizens consider a recession over only when the economy has returned to &quot; normal , &quot; which means that incomes are rising and jobs are no longer desperately scarce . 
A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession . 
But sometimes recessions don &apos;t satisfy this rule . 
Neither the 2001 nor the 1974 / 1975 US recessions met that criterion . In addition to real GDP , employment , income , and sales are considered , as are the depth , duration , and diffusion of the downturn throughout the overall economy . 
Sometimes dating a recession is a judgment call . 
America had a brief , sharp recession in 1980 , followed by a long and severe one in 1981 / 1982 . 
Many economists believe that it was one major episode , and that is probably the appropriate way to think about it in a broader historical context . 
But the economy did indeed grow in the interim - just barely enough to consider them distinct recessions . 
Likewise , the recent recession was officially dated as starting in December , 2007 , but it could equally well have been dated as starting in the summer of 2008 because , in the interim , the economy grew . 
Double-dip downturns are more the rule than the exception . 
If we focus on real GDP and define a double dip as a historical sequence in which a period long enough to be declared a recession is followed by a period of recovery , and then quickly followed by a second outright recession , the 1980-1982 period in the US is a classic example . 
In fact , defined more loosely as a sequence that includes periods of growth followed by periods of decline , followed by further periods of growth and decline , the 1973-1975 period in the US , with eight quarters of alternating gains and losses in real GDP , was one quadruple-dip recession . 
These are not rare occurrences . 
Around the same time , Germany had this type of double dip and the UK a quadruple dip . 
In the early 1980 &quot; s , the UK , Japan , Italy , and Germany all had double dips . 
America &apos;s 2001 recession was one brief , mild double dip . 
Within the current recession , we have already had a double dip ; a dip at the beginning of 2008 , then some growth , then another long , deep dip , then renewed growth . 
If the economy declines again - a highly plausible prospect - we would have a triple dip , although perhaps not an outright second recession . 
So history suggests that economies seldom grow out of recessions continuously , without an occasional subsequent decline . 
Double dips , triple dips , and quadruple dips have been America &apos;s recessionary experience since WWII . 
Japan , for example , had three recessions in its &quot; lost decade , &quot; starting in the 1990 &quot; s , despite a long string of large Keynesian stimulus programs that left it with the worst public-debt burden among advanced economies . 
While the baseline forecast seems to be slow global growth - in the US around 3 % , about half the usual pace following deep recessions - history suggests that another decline would hardly be surprising before sustained stronger growth emerges .
