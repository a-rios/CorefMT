The Tunisian Catalyst 
DAVOS - The whole world celebrates Tunisia &apos;s democratic revolution , which has set off a cascade of events elsewhere in the region - particularly in Egypt - with untold consequences . 
The eyes of the world are now set on this small country of ten million , to learn the lessons of its recent experience and to see if the young people who overthrew a corrupt autocrat can create a stable , functioning democracy . 
First , the lessons . 
For starters , it is not enough for governments to deliver reasonable growth . 
After all , GDP grew at around 5 % annually in Tunisia over the last 20 years , and the country was often cited as boasting one of the better-performing economies , particularly within the region . 
Nor is it enough to follow the dictates of international financial markets - that may get good bond ratings and please international investors , but it does not mean that jobs are being created or that standards of living are being increased for most citizens . 
Indeed , the fallibility of the bond markets and rating agencies was evident in the run up to the 2008 crisis . 
That they now looked with disfavor at Tunisia &apos;s move from authoritarianism to democracy does not redound to their credit - and should never be forgotten . 
Even providing good education may not suffice . 
All over the world , countries are struggling to create enough jobs for new entrants into the labor force . 
High unemployment and pervasive corruption , however , create a combustible combination . 
What matters is a sense of equity and fair play . 
If , in a world of scarce jobs , those with political connections get them , and if , in a world of limited wealth , government officials accumulate masses of money , there will be justifiable outrage at such inequities - and at the perpetrators of these &quot; crimes . &quot; 
Outrage at bankers in the West is a milder version of the same basic demand for economic justice that we saw first in Tunisia , and now across the region . 
Virtuous though democracy is - and as Tunisia has shown , it is far better than the alternative - we should remember the failures of those who claim its mantle , and that there is more to true democracy than periodic elections , even when they are conducted fairly . 
Democracy in the United States , for example , has been accompanied by increasing inequality , so much so that the upper 1 % now receives around one-quarter of national income - with wealth being even more inequitably distributed . 
Indeed , most Americans today are worse off than they were a decade ago , with almost all the gains from economic growth going to the very top of the income and wealth distribution . 
Moreover , in many countries , democracy has been accompanied by civil strife , factionalism , and dysfunctional governments . 
In this regard , Tunisia starts on a positive note : a sense of national cohesion created by the successful overthrow of a widely hated dictator . 
Tunisia must strive to maintain that sense of cohesion , which requires a commitment to transparency , tolerance , and inclusiveness - both politically and economically . 
A sense of fair play requires voice , which can be achieved only through public dialogue . 
Everyone stresses the rule of law , but it matters a great deal what kind of rule of law is established . 
Tunisia may not be able to prevent special interests from capturing its government , but , if public financing of electoral campaigns and restrictions on lobbying and revolving doors between the public and private sectors remain absent , such capture will be not only possible , but certain . 
Commitments to transparent privatization auctions and competitive bidding for procurement reduce the scope for rent-seeking behavior . 
There are many balancing acts to be mastered : a government that is too powerful might violate citizens &quot; rights , but a government that is too weak would be unable to undertake the collective action needed to create a prosperous and inclusive society - or to prevent powerful private actors from preying on the weak and defenseless . 
Latin America has shown that there are problems with term limits for political officeholders , but not having term limits is even worse . 
So constitutions need to be flexible . 
Enshrining economic-policy fads , as the European Union has done with its central bank &apos;s single-minded focus on inflation , is a mistake . 
A good place for Tunisia &apos;s debate to begin is deciding how far beyond the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the country should go in writing its new constitution . 
Tunisia is off to an amazingly good start . 
Its people have acted with purpose and thoughtfulness in setting up an interim government , as Tunisians of talent and achievement have , on a moment &apos;s notice , volunteered to serve their country at this critical juncture . 
It will be the Tunisians themselves who will create the new system , one that may serve as a beacon for what a twenty-first-century democracy might be like . 
For its part , the international community , which so often has propped up authoritarian regimes in the name of stability ( or on the principle that &quot; the enemy of my enemy is my friend &quot; ) has a clear responsibility to provide whatever assistance Tunisia needs in the coming months and years .
