Managing Europe &apos;s Perfect Storm 
NEW YORK - The Chinese often point out that in their language the character for crisis and opportunity are one and the same . 
But , while it is indeed true that crisis and opportunity often go hand in hand , it is difficult to see much opportunity in Europe &apos;s current circumstances . 
One reason the current situation facing Europe is so difficult is that it was so unexpected . 
Here we are , 70 years after the end of World War II , a quarter-century after the end of the Cold War , and some two decades after the Balkan wars , and suddenly Europe &apos;s political , economic , and strategic future seems much more uncertain than anyone predicted as recently as a year ago . 
Another reason to be worried is that Europe faces not one crisis , but several . 
The first is economic : not just the current reality of slow growth , but the prospect that slow growth will continue without respite , owing above all to policies that often discourage businesses from investing and hiring . 
The rise of populist political parties of both the left and the right across the continent attests to popular frustrations and fears . 
Making matters worse for Europe &apos;s economy was the decision taken decades back to introduce a common currency without a common fiscal policy . 
Discipline disappeared at the national level in many countries ; 
Greece was the most recent casualty , but it is unlikely to be the last . 
The second crisis results from Russian actions in Ukraine . 
There is no prospect of Russia giving up Crimea , and questions about its intentions in eastern Ukraine and the Baltics are mounting . 
The result is the return of geopolitics to Europe at a time when defense spending is modest and public support for armed intervention is largely absent . 
The third , and most pressing , crisis is the result of massive flows of migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere into Europe . 
The flood of people is exposing new rifts among EU members , raising questions about the principle of open borders and free movement that has long been at the core of the EU . 
Germany and a few other countries have stepped up to the challenge in ways that are admirable but unsustainable . 
Some 8,000 refugees a day - a modern day Volkerwanderung - are entering Germany , partly because of harsh conditions back home , and partly because of Germany &apos;s willingness to take them in . 
The challenge of caring for , employing , and integrating such numbers will soon run up against the limits of physical capacity , financial resources , and public tolerance . 
It is obvious that public policy cannot succeed if it is focused on the consequences , rather than the causes , of the refugee crisis . 
The change that would have the greatest positive impact would be the emergence of a new government in Damascus that was acceptable to the bulk of the Syrian people and a satisfactory partner for the United States and Europe . 
Unfortunately , this seems likely to come about only with the blessing of Russia and Iran , both of which appear more inclined to increase their support for President Bashar al-Assad than to work for his removal . 
Other steps , however , would improve the situation . 
Increased international financial support for countries in Europe or the Middle East hosting large numbers of refugees is one . 
Ideally , such funding would help persuade more countries to follow Germany &apos;s example . 
Another useful development would be the creation of enclaves inside Syria where people could gather with some expectation of security . 
Such enclaves would require local support from Kurdish forces or select Arab tribes , with military backing by the US and others . 
A new comprehensive arrangement with Turkey is also needed to reduce the flow of jihadist recruits to Syria and the number of refugees heading north . 
Turkey would receive financial and military assistance in exchange for asserting greater control over its borders , while the question of Turkey &apos;s long-term relationship with Europe would be set aside until the crisis passed . 
The US has a special obligation to help . 
Both by what it has done and what it has failed to do in Iraq , Syria , and elsewhere in the Middle East , American foreign policy bears more than a little responsibility for outcomes that have led to the refugee exodus . 
The US also has a strategic interest in helping Germany and Europe contend with this crisis . 
Europe still constitutes a quarter of the world &apos;s economy and remains one of America &apos;s principal geopolitical partners . 
A Europe overwhelmed by a demographic challenge , in addition to its economic and security challenges , would be neither able nor willing to be an effective ally . 
In all of this , time is of the essence . 
Europe - and Germany in particular - cannot sustain the status quo . 
Waiting for a solution to the Syrian situation is no answer ; while lesser steps will not resolve Europe &apos;s predicament , they could make it manageable .
