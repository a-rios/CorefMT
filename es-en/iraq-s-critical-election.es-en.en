Iraq &apos;s Critical Election 
BLOOMINGTON - Iraqis go to the polls on March 7 to elect a new Parliament for the second time under the country &apos;s permanent constitution of 2006 . 
Many scholars believe that it is the second general election , not the first , which is the most important test of any new democracy . 
If so , these elections appear to foreshadow ominous times ahead . 
The security situation in Iraq has deteriorated dramatically over the past six months . 
Though much of the violence in Iraq over the past six years has been random , aimed at soft targets such as markets and restaurants , its nature changed last summer . 
On August 19 , 2009 , the sixth anniversary of the bombing that killed the United Nations representative in Baghdad , a series of spectacular attacks were carried out . 
These bombings , and others since , have targeted the Iraqi state and its infrastructure , including the ministries of finance and foreign affairs and municipal and judicial offices . 
Moreover , as United States troops have lowered their profile , daily violence of the more random variety has increased . 
Equally ominous , the banning of hundreds of candidates for alleged ties to the Baath Party signals a return to sectarian politics , which could reignite a sectarian civil war . 
The individuals banned include the current defense minister and several members of parliament . 
The message from Iran &apos;s allies in Iraq , who control the de-Baathification process , is clear . 
While some Shia who were prominent allies of the Baathist regime hold positions of great influence in the &quot; new &quot; Iraq , Sunnis will never know when they will be shut out of the process , especially if they become too powerful . 
Some of Iraq &apos;s Sunni leaders might thus conclude that permanent armed opposition is their only viable strategy . 
True , they might not be able to topple the new regime , but they will be able to de-stabilize Iraq over the long term , in the hope of forcing a negotiated settlement of their grievances . 
The new Shia elites who control Iraq have emulated their allies in Iran , creating a system that effectively chooses which of their rivals may constitute a &quot; legitimate &quot; opposition and which may not participate in the political process . 
The struggle of Iraq &apos;s Kurds should be instructive . 
As the Iraqi political scientist Ghassan Atiyyah , has noted , the Kurds , even without regional allies , have been able to de-stabilize Iraq for 80 years . 
How much more will the Sunnis be able to de-stabilize the country , he asked , enjoying as they do the support of most of the regional powers , including Saudi Arabia , Syria , and potentially Turkey ? 
Politics aside , the long-term damage to Iraq &apos;s legal institutions caused by these maneuverings should not be underestimated . 
After the de-Baathification order was issued ( by a commission that does not actually have any sitting members ) a panel of the Iraqi Court of Appeal essentially invalidated it . 
The prime minister then met with Iraq &apos;s chief justice , following which the court &apos;s decision was reversed . 
There will be several ways to gauge the election &apos;s relative success . 
The first of these will be the length of time that it takes the victors to form a new government . 
If , as occurred after the last elections , months go by without the formation of a government , this will be confirmation that Iraq &apos;s political elites will continue to subordinate the desperate needs of the country - for security , electricity , water , and basic services - to their political futures as they haggle over positions . 
Whether competent technocrats , or as has happened in the past , party hacks are appointed to the ministries will be a telling sign . 
Another sign will be the extent to which the newly elected leadership , which is likely to be largely the same as the current leadership , reaches out to real Sunni leaders . 
Doing so might well mean a retreat from the pre-election banning of candidates , and would demonstrate a maturity among the Shia political elites that they have not yet shown . 
Finally , the reaction of the election &apos;s losers will be key . 
For example , it is likely that the current prime minister will not be able to form a new government . 
Even the principal Kurdish parties are facing a challenge from an independent party , Goran , and are likely to incur some losses to it . 
If these losers engage in post-election jockeying to cheat opponents of their fair allotment of seats , that will tell much about the future . 
Whether Iraq achieves stability or is once again ripped apart by sectarian violence now depends , as it always has , on the new political elites . 
If the past is an indication of their future performance , there is reason for deep concern .
