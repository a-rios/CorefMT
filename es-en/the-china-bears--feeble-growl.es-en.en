The China Bears &quot; Feeble Growl 
BEIJING - In recent months , bearish sentiment about the Chinese economy has surged , owing largely to three conjectures . 
First , China &apos;s housing market is on the brink of collapse . 
Second , China &apos;s fiscal position will worsen rapidly because of massive local government debt . 
And , third , the collapse of underground credit networks in bustling cities such as Wenzhou will lead to a broad financial crisis across the country . 
In fact , despite its problems , China &apos;s economy remains in good condition - at least so far . 
Indeed , it is not yet near to hitting the rocks . 
Since the twenty-first century began , skyrocketing housing prices in China , except for a short respite during the global financial crisis , have caused serious social discontent . 
After years of half-hearted effort , China &apos;s government has finally clamped down on housing speculation . 
As a result , prices fell in October for the first time this year , while real-estate investment growth fell as well . 
But the fall in housing prices is unlikely to turn into a rout , because real demand for houses will remain strong after speculative demand is driven from the market . 
As soon as housing prices fall to an affordable level , buyers will enter the market and set a floor under the decline . 
Moreover , because there are no subprime mortgages in China and down payments are as high as 50-60 % , even a significant fall in housing prices will not seriously damage China &apos;s mega-banks . 
Over the past decade , real-estate investment in China has been the single most important contributor to fixed-asset investment growth and therefore , to the economy . 
Indeed , since the late 1990 &quot; s , the real estate investment-to-GDP ratio has been far higher than it was in countries like Japan and Korea during their high-growth periods . 
It is simply wrong for a developing country with per capita income of $ 5,000 to concentrate its resources on producing concrete and cement . 
Although a significant decline in real-estate investment will have a very serious negative impact on China &apos;s growth - which can and should be prevented - as long as the fall is not too drastic , it is a welcome development . 
Meanwhile , local government debts are a relatively new phenomenon . 
In 2009 , local governments were encouraged to create Special Purpose Vehicles , specifically &quot; local finance platforms &quot; ( LFPs ) , to supplement China &apos;s RMB4 trillion ( $ 628.7 billion ) stimulus package . 
The LFPs would borrow from banks using future government revenue as collateral to finance packaged-investment projects in Chinese localities . 
By 2010 , some 6,576 LFPs had been created . 
There is no denying that local-government debt is a ticking time bomb for the Chinese economy . 
According to China &apos;s National Audit Office ( NAO ) , these LFPs &quot; total borrowing amounts to RMB10.7 trillion , of which 79.1 % is bank loans . 
But it is equally true that China &apos;s local-government debt has so far been manageable , and there is no reason to believe that all of it is bad . 
In fact , for the majority of the LFPs , the cash flow generated by investment so far has been enough to meet repayment of principal and interest . According to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( ICBC ) - the largest of China &apos;s &quot; big four &quot; banks - 93 % of its loans to LFPs are being repaid regularly . 
Indeed , the ICBC &apos;s non-performing loan ( NPL ) ratio for LFP loans is as low as 0.3 % , while the corresponding coverage ratio - the bank &apos;s ability to absorb losses from NPLs - is 1,066 % . 
According to the NAO , the NPL ratio for the RMB10.7 trillion in local-government debt is roughly 2.3 % . 
A significant proportion of total local-government debt either has no direct relation to local governments , or cannot be guaranteed by them . 
Therefore , in legal terms , it is not government debt at all . 
In addition , given that local-government debt comprises 27 % of China &apos;s 2010 GDP , while central government debt and policy loans stand at 20 % and 6 % of GDP , respectively , the total public debt-to-GDP ratio is approximately 53 % - lower than Germany &apos;s . 
So , while China should not be complacent about local-government debt , panic is unwarranted . 
Finally , there is a long history of underground lending and borrowing in some of China &apos;s east coast region , especially in Wenzhou . 
Whenever monetary tightening causes bank credit to shrink , small and medium-size private enterprises are prepared to borrow at suicidally high interest rates from relatives or loan sharks . 
In recent years , real-estate speculation has become another important source of demand for underground loans . 
When real asset prices fall and cause local credit networks to collapse , not only are hundreds of families left financially shattered and enterprises bankrupted , but banks suffer collateral damage , as occurred recently in the Wenzhou region . 
But the severity of Wenzhou &apos;s underground credit crisis has been exaggerated . 
In fact , Wenzhou &apos;s underground credit accounts for less than 20 % of total credit in the region , while the region accounts for less than 1 % of China &apos;s GDP . 
The total volume of affected bank credit in the crisis was just above RMB3 billion - roughly 0.5 % of bank loans in the Wenzhou region . 
So , the damage that the breakdown of Wenzhou &apos;s underground credit networks has inflicted on the regional banking system is limited , with scant national impact . 
Thus , despite the high likelihood that China &apos;s economic growth will slow significantly in 2012 , a hard landing is unlikely . 
Nevertheless , while there is no need to be overly bearish about China &apos;s short-term economic prospects , because of the slow progress in fundamental adjustment and further reform , even Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has noted that China &apos;s growth is ultimately unsustainable . 
The real test has yet to come .
