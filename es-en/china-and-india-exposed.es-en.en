China and India Exposed 
BERKELEY - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao &apos;s forthcoming trip to India , following hard on the heels of President Barack Obama &apos;s recent visit , will provide another opportunity for the media to gush about the growing global economic clout of China and India . 
We can be sure that the soft underbellies of both economies will be kept hidden from view . 
After a couple of centuries of relative stagnation , these two countries , containing nearly two-fifths of the world &apos;s population , have experienced remarkably rapid income growth in the last three decades . 
In manufacturing and services ( particularly software , business processing , etc . ) , respectively , China and India have made huge strides internationally , and their acquisition of global companies has attracted considerable attention . 
But some dubious assertions have , through constant repetition in recent , often breathless , accounts about the two economies , become part of conventional wisdom . 
Much of what really goes on inside these two large countries is often left out . 
For example , in terms of value added ( the value of output after deducting the cost of materials and components ) , China , contrary to popular impression , is not yet the manufacturing center of the world . 
The Chinese produce about 15 % of value added in world manufacturing , while the United States contributes about 24 % and the European Union about 20 % . 
Similarly , while India &apos;s information technology-enabled services have gained an international reputation , the total number of people employed in this sector is less than 0.5 % of India &apos;s workforce . 
As such , it cannot , by itself , transform the Indian economy . 
Chinese growth is widely regarded as furiously export-driven , but domestic investment has in fact been the major component . 
Even at the height of global trade expansion in 2002-2007 , exports ( in value-added terms ) accounted for only a little more than one-quarter of GDP growth , whereas domestic investment contributed a substantially larger share . 
Moreover , contrary to popular belief , much of the dramatic poverty reduction in China over the last three decades was due not to integration into the global economy , but to domestic factors like growth in the agricultural sector ( where mass poverty was concentrated ) . 
This is attributable largely to public investment in rural infrastructure , and , in the initial period , to institutional changes in agrarian production organization and an egalitarian distribution of land-cultivation rights . 
Expansion of exports of labor-intensive manufactures has nonetheless lifted many Chinese out of poverty . 
Economic reform clearly has made the Indian corporate sector more vibrant and competitive , but most of the Indian economy is not in the corporate sector ( public or private ) . 
Indeed , 92 % of the labor force is employed in the informal sector . 
Indian poverty reduction has been significant , but not substantial . 
However , in terms of non-income indicators of poverty - for example , child mortality , malnutrition , and school dropouts - India &apos;s performance has been dismal ( in some respects worse even than in sub-Saharan Africa ) . 
In the financial media , China and India have become poster children for market reform and globalization , even though in matters of privatization , property rights , deregulation , and lingering bureaucratic rigidities , both countries have in many ways departed from economic orthodoxy . 
According to the US-based Heritage Foundation &apos;s widely cited Index of Economic Freedom , China and India are relegated to the group described as &quot; mostly unfree . &quot; 
Out of a total of 157 countries in 2008 , China ranked 126th and India 115th . 
Although socialist economic policies in both countries inhibited initiative and enterprise , a positive legacy of that period cannot be denied . 
It is arguable , for example , that Chinese socialism provided a strong launching pad for growth , particularly in terms of a solid base of education and health , rural electrification , a safety net enabled by equitable distribution of land rights , regional economic decentralization , and high female participation in the labor force . 
Moreover , a major part of the socialist legacy in both countries is the cumulative effect of the state &apos;s active role in technological development . 
Unlike in India , where the private corporate sector is the most dynamic sector , in China state-controlled companies are some of the globally more successful . 
Even in famous private Chinese companies like Lenovo and Huawei Technologies , the ownership structure is highly convoluted , and the boundaries of state and private control rights blurred . 
The recent purchase of Volvo by the private Chinese automaker Geely generated much publicity , but most of the money was put up by municipal governments . 
Powerful political families run many Chinese state-owned enterprises . 
Indeed , there is some evidence that the overwhelming majority of multi-millionaires in China are relatives of high-ranking Communist Party officials . 
And , thanks to the large pool of savings generated by Chinese households and state-owned companies , the Chinese economy can for the time being bear the waste and misallocation implied by such crony capitalism . 
Without political reform , the long-run viability of such a system is in doubt . 
Premier Wen himself indicated as much in a speech in August that was widely noted abroad , but largely blacked out in Chinese media . 
The global media should now go further , and begin to examine the many features of the rise of China and India that depart from the simplistic narrative of the triumph of market reform .
