Merkel &apos;s American Minders 
BERLIN - Germans used to joke that Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s penchant for communicating via fleeting text messages effectively marked the end of traditional historiography . 
Well , at least American spy agencies seem to have kept full track of the behind-the-scenes communications - in Berlin and beyond . 
Regrettably , US President Barack Obama and his administration have yet to comprehend the scale and severity of the damage caused to America &apos;s credibility among its European allies . 
The problem is not that countries spy on each other ( they all do ) . 
Previous transatlantic clashes over diverse issues such as climate change , the detainees at Guantánamo Bay , and the Iraq War exposed a breakdown of mutual understanding , sometimes stemming from sharp differences over how best to achieve certain common objectives . 
But the wiretapping crisis and other troubling revelations from the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden point to a deeper problem : a crisis of mutual distrust that risks becoming a serious transatlantic rift at a time when closer political , economic , and security cooperation between Europe and the United States is needed more than ever . 
There is probably nothing more destructive to friendly relations among democratic states than behavior by an ally that causes the other side to lose face at home . 
After all , it was Merkel who tried to calm the waters after the NSA scandal first hit Europe this summer . 
That is why the alleged US wiretapping of her cellphone is so damaging for her , both personally and politically . 
As someone who served in Merkel &apos;s government from 2009 to 2011 , I must admit that I was rather careless in the use of mobile communication devices while in office . 
In principle , of course , one should always assume that foreign intelligence services attempt to listen in on other governments &quot; conversations . 
But it makes a big difference whether such activities are conducted by Russia or China , or by an ally that repeatedly emphasizes the importance of close transatlantic friendship and cooperation . 
Obama &apos;s personality makes matters more complicated . 
It is hard to recall any other US president who has been so personally disconnected from other heads of state . 
Instead of immediately reaching out to a friendly country , he decided to lie low and send White House Press Secretary Jay Carney to issue a rather awkward statement that the US government &quot; is not &quot; and &quot; will not &quot; monitor Merkel &apos;s communications . 
Of course , it does not take much interpretive skill to recognize a clumsy attempt to avoid confessing that US intelligence services targeted Merkel in the past . 
The Obama administration appears to have failed to ask itself some basic questions . 
How could it justify spying on a leader who is among America &apos;s closest allies in NATO and in the Afghanistan mission - a leader whom he invited to the Rose Garden to bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest honor that America can give to a foreigner ? 
Moreover , Merkel was not the only target . 
In the case of France , how could the Obama administration justify targeting an ally that has tried hard to build trust with the US by providing much-needed military and political cover in Libya and Syria ? 
French President François Hollande , too , must feel like a fool - not just as a result of US surveillance , but also because he probably received no advance warning from his intelligence services about Obama &apos;s sudden decision to ask Congress to pass a resolution prior to using military force in Syria . 
Finally , how can Obama explain to the EU ( whose delegation in Washington , DC , was also bugged ) that it is crucially important to enter into honest , serious , and comprehensive negotiations to conclude a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ? 
Prominent voices in Europe - including the president of the European Parliament and the leader of Germany &apos;s Social Democrats ( who is about to form a coalition government with Merkel ) - are already demanding a suspension of the TTIP talks . 
The potential economic cost of a delay or a failure to achieve closer transatlantic economic integration could total hundreds of billions of dollars - in addition to the incalculable damage done to America &apos;s credibility in Europe . 
There is much talk today about the risks of a new era of American isolationism and a lack of US leadership in the world . 
It is important to remember that isolationism can be triggered not only by a potential retreat from global affairs , but also by the rather imprudent use of America &apos;s hard and soft power on the world stage . 
To escape the NSA mess , various options will be discussed . 
The new Franco-German push for an intelligence-sharing agreement with the US is probably difficult to put into practice , especially considering that spy services operating around the world are not always fully controllable . 
As a first step , Obama must rediscover the great communications skills that propelled him to the White House in the first place . 
From a public-diplomacy perspective , his handling of the surveillance scandal has been a complete failure . 
To contain the damage and begin to rebuild much-needed trust , Obama must issue a credible apology to Merkel , other Western allies , and their citizens . 
In the American political context , issuing an apology , especially to foreign governments , is often viewed as a sign of weakness . 
In the case of the NSA scandal , an unequivocal apology by Obama is the only viable solution to leave the past behind and move forward . 
Unfortunately , the window of opportunity for such a gesture to be viewed in Europe as a much-awaited olive branch - and a sign of real American strength and conviction - is closing fast .
