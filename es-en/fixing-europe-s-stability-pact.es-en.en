Fixing Europe \ u0027s Stability Pact 
Europe &apos;s Stability Pact - which underpins the euro by setting fixed constraints on the size of budget deficits for euro members - is in trouble . 
The European Union &apos;s leading country , Germany , failed to meet its commitments to its EU partners concerning its deficit . 
Furthermore , it used its political muscle to block the early warning about its deficit that the EU Commission had mandated by the terms of the Stability Pact . 
Now France is making waves . 
The EU &apos;s reluctant number two country has served unofficial notice that it , too , does not plan to abide by its deficit-reduction promises . 
This comes one year after tiny Ireland received an official warning about its fiscal policies , even though Ireland &apos;s budget was in surplus , and mightily so . 
So , four years after it was signed , the Stability Pact seems to be in shambles . 
Indeed , Europe is now rife with talk about junking it , as well as with discussions about how to fix it . 
Rightly so : the Pact is ill-conceived and its implementation ill-designed . 
Not only is the Pact &apos;s fixed 3 % limit for the ratio of budget deficit to GDP arbitrary , but it also ignores the fact that when an economy slows , deficits increase automatically . 
Recognizing this fact , the Pact &apos;s architects made things worse by adopting two misguided &apos; solutions &apos; . 
They introduced a safety clause allowing a country to suspend the deficit ceiling in case of serious recession , but they went on to define a serious recession in such a way as to make such a suspension implausible in practice . 
Mindful that normal slowdowns could lead to a breach of the ceiling , they decreed that a normal deficit is a zero deficit . 
Accordingly , each year , every county is required to submit a budget that projects two years ahead which demonstrates how its budget will be balanced in that time . 
Germany &apos;s commitment for 2002 was made in early 2001 when its economy was growing at a reasonable pace . 
The unanticipated slowdown made it impossible for Germany to meet the target . 
Finance Minister Hans Eichel decided , reasonably , not to worsen conditions by adopting a contractionary fiscal policy . 
The Commission , seeking to project itself as the protector of the Pact , sought to issue a warning . 
But that decision had to be taken by real-life politicians , the Council of Finance Ministers . 
No one on the Council wanted to upset Germany , for all of them recognized that the same problem could one day confront them . 
No warning was issued . 
France &apos;s case is different . 
During elections , politicians invariably make promises , including those of tax cuts . 
In a country with crushing rates of taxation , this is not only smart politics , but it is also good economics , provided spending is cut . 
But France is also a country where everyone enjoys some publicly-funded privilege , so cuts are a political &quot; no-no . &quot; 
Thus France cannot meet the Pact &apos;s deficit target . 
The Commission expresses outrage , but France is skilled at challenging the EU &apos;s rules of common behavior . 
Political scheming is guaranteed . 
Economists and cynics are not surprised . 
The Pact &apos;s objective - to enforce fiscal discipline in countries that share the same currency - is worthy . 
But having lost control of their national monetary policies , euro member countries retain only one macroeconomic instrument , fiscal policy . 
The challenge , therefore , is to combine long-run discipline with short-run flexibility . 
Like promising to go on a diet just before a big party , this challenge is not easily met . 
The Stability Pact is too crude and technocratic : a 3 % deficit target enforced by Brussels bureaucrats cannot bind real-life politicians . 
A solution must be found elsewhere . 
Fortunately , we need not look far . 
Monetary policy faces a similar challenge . 
It needs to deliver price stability in the long run while being flexible enough in the short run to deal with business cycles . 
Over the last decade , monetary policy has been a true success story . 
Everywhere the recipe is roughly the same : delegate policy to a group of competent people - the central bank - by making them formally independent from political pressure and providing them with a clear , explicit mandate . 
Knowing that any slippage today will need to be dealt with tomorrow , they exercise their best judgment . 
This has been a spectacular improvement over the monetary rules of the past . 
The same approach should work for fiscal policy . 
Some , of course , may fear a loss of democratic accountability . 
It is essential to realize that fiscal policy fulfills two very different tasks . 
The first task is structural and redistributive : it concerns the size of the budget and its detailed structure on both the spending and revenue sides . 
Decisions on such issues cannot be delegated ; they must remain in the hands of elected governments and be subject to parliamentary approval and oversight . 
The second task is macroeconomic : it is about setting the budget balance to deal with cyclical fluctuations . 
That task does not differ from monetary policy and can be delegated to an independent body . 
So what Europe must to do is clear . 
Each country should regain full control of its fiscal policy but delegate its macroeconomic component , decisions about deficits or surpluses , to an independent Fiscal Policy Committee given the long-run mandate of stabilizing , or in some countries reducing , the size of the public debt . 
In order to guarantee the outcome , the statutes of such committees and their mandates ought to be agreed upon by all euro members . 
No more Brussels interference , no more arbitrary rules , no more political judgments -  just plain common sense .
