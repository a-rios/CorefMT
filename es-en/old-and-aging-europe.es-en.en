Old and Aging Europe 
When US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld spoke recently of &quot; Old Europe , &quot; he was right , but not in the way he intended . 
Europe is indeed old , and growing older . 
Across the continent children are increasingly scarce . 
Fertility rates ( the number of children per woman in the population ) have fallen to 1.2 % in Germany and Italy . 
The rate is even lower in Spain  - in fact , the lowest in Europe . 
Spain is still a young society , but a society without children is doomed . 
The fertility rate for the US , by contrast , is 2.4 , and it is 2.1 for the UK . 
These differences are extraordinary , particularly in view of the far less generous maternity leave policies that apply in the US and the UK relative to continental Europe . 
France stands out on the Continent with a fertility rate of 1.8 , which is most likely the result of years of generous tax policies towards large families . 
Migration is also an important explanation for these differences . 
Higher fertility rates in the US , the UK , and France reflect the large number of immigrant families in each country . 
Fertility rates among immigrants are typically higher than in native European or North American families . 
But increasing the number of immigrant workers will not necessarily raise fertility rates . 
Germany , for example , has a large population of guest workers , but few settle there with their families ; most leave their children in their homeland . 
An aging population contributes to Europe &apos;s poor economic performance . 
The old do not work , and a smaller and smaller share of the population ( the disappearing young ) is taxed to support them . 
In turn , the high tax rates needed to support the old discourage the young from working , creating a vicious cycle : ever increasing tax rates on a disappearing labor force , lower growth rates , and fewer resources available to support those that retire at 60 and live into their 90 &apos;s . 
The effects of this are partly offset by the fact that , with fewer children , more women enter the labor force . 
But then these women also retire ( often at an even younger age than men ) adding to the &quot; unsupported &quot; army of retirees . 
Compare this with the US , where participation by women in the labor force also is increasing , despite America &apos;s higher fertility rate . 
Indeed , female participation in the workforce is higher in the US than in the European Union ( 70 % versus 60 % ) . 
The saving rates among Europe &apos;s old people indicate that they are worried about the dwindling number of workers who can be taxed to support them . 
Consider Germany . 
Any economic textbook will tell you ( the famous &quot; life-cycle &quot; model ) that the young save for their retirement , while the old spend what they accumulate . 
But in Germany , the data seem to suggest a puzzling fact : the old save until their final days . 
It is the young who spend . 
Even more remarkable is not the level of savings among the old , but how it changes over time . 
Recent German surveys have detected a small increase in their savings rate . 
Why should old people save ? 
The most plausible reason is that many now realize that they will live far longer than they anticipated - often spending one-third of their lives in retirement - but that the State may no longer deliver on its promises . 
Default is unlikely , although not impossible , on pension benefits . 
But it is more likely on the provision of health services , by far the most important service for old people . 
When you understand that you are likely to live into your late 80 &apos;s or beyond , and you also understand that the quality of public health services is deteriorating , you save more to take care of yourself . 
So why do Europeans have fewer and fewer children ? 
Indeed , non-working time even for those who hold jobs is increasing , offering ample opportunity to rear children . 
Working hours in Europe as a whole fell from 1713 hours per year in 1980 to about 1576 today , with Germans putting in the least number of hours at work . 
One explanation often mentioned points to a lack of support , such as public childcare , for mothers raising children . 
But , then , why is America &apos;s birth rate higher than in many countries in Europe that have much larger public support for childbearing mothers ? 
High housing costs and imperfection in lending markets are the more likely explanation behind Europe &apos;s falling fertility rates . 
It is easier for a young couple to borrow and buy a house in the US than in Europe . 
Rental markets are also more flexible in the US . 
So another dangerously vicious circle seems to be operating : high taxes discourage work , and because fewer jobs are created , fertility is discouraged . 
But with fewer children , higher tax rates are needed to support the growing army of the old . 
Gunther Grass famously titled one of his novels &quot; Headbirths , or the Germans are Dying Out . &quot; 
Little could he know how true his fantasy would just three decades later .
