Prizes , Not Patents 
Part of modern medicine &apos;s success is built on new drugs , in which pharmaceutical companies invest billions of dollars on research . 
The companies can recover their expenses thanks to patents , which give them a temporary monopoly and thus allow them to charge prices well above the cost of producing the drugs . 
We cannot expect innovation without paying for it . 
But are the incentives provided by the patent system appropriate , so that all this money is well spent and contributes to treatments for diseases of the greatest concern ? 
Sadly , the answer is a resounding &quot; no . &quot; 
The fundamental problem with the patent system is simple : it is based on restricting the use of knowledge . 
Because there is no extra cost associated with an additional individual enjoying the benefits of any piece of knowledge , restricting knowledge is inefficient . 
But the patent system not only restricts the use of knowledge ; by granting ( temporary ) monopoly power , it often makes medications unaffordable for people who don &apos;t have insurance . 
In the Third World , this can be a matter of life and death for people who cannot afford new brand-name drugs but might be able to afford generics . 
For example , generic drugs for first-line AIDS defenses have brought down the cost of treatment by almost 99 % since 2000 alone , from $ 10,000 to $ 130 . 
But , despite the high price they pay , developing countries get little in return . 
Drug companies spend far more money on advertising and marketing than they do on research , far more on research for lifestyle drugs ( for conditions like impotence and hair loss ) than for lifesaving drugs , and almost no money on diseases that afflict hundreds of millions of poor people , such as malaria . 
It is a matter of simple economics : companies direct their research where the money is , regardless of the relative value to society . 
The poor can &apos;t pay for drugs , so there is little research on their diseases , no matter what the overall costs . 
A &quot; me-too &quot; drug , for example , which nets its manufacturer some portion of the income that otherwise accrues only to the company that dominates a niche , may be highly profitable , even if its value to society is quite limited . 
Similarly , companies raced to beat the human genome project in order to patent genes such as that associated with breast cancer . 
The value of these efforts was minimal : the knowledge was produced just a little sooner than it would have been otherwise . 
But the cost to society was enormous : the high price that Myriad , the patent holder , places on genetic tests ( between $ 3,000 and $ 4,000 ) may well mean that thousands of women who would otherwise have been tested , discovered that they were at risk , and taken appropriate remediation , will die instead . 
There is an alternative way of financing and incentivizing research that , at least in some instances , could do a far better job than patents , both in directing innovation and ensuring that the benefits of that knowledge are enjoyed as widely as possible : a medical prize fund that would reward those who discover cures and vaccines . 
Since governments already pay the cost of much drug research directly or indirectly , through prescription benefits , they could finance the prize fund , which would award the biggest prizes for developers of treatments or preventions for costly diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people . 
Especially when it comes to diseases in developing countries , it would make sense for some of the prize money to come from foreign assistance budgets , as few contributions could do more to improve the quality of life , and even productivity , than attacking the debilitating diseases that are so prevalent in many developing countries . 
A scientific panel could establish a set of priorities by assessing the number of people affected and the impact on mortality , morbidity , and productivity . 
Once the discovery is made , it would be licensed . 
Of course , the patent system is itself a prize system , albeit a peculiar one : the prize is temporary monopoly power , implying high prices and restricted access to the benefits that can be derived from the new knowledge . 
By contrast , the type of prize system I have in mind would rely on competitive markets to lower prices and make the fruits of the knowledge available as widely as possible . 
With better-directed incentives ( more research dollars spent on more important diseases , less money spent on wasteful and distorted marketing ) , we could have better health at lower cost . 
That said , the prize fund would not replace patents . 
It would be part of the portfolio of methods for encouraging and supporting research . 
A prize fund would work well in areas in which needs are well known - the case for many diseases afflicting the poor - allowing clear goals to be set in advance . 
For innovations that solve problems or meet needs that have not previously been widely recognized , the patent system would still play a role . 
The market economy and the profit motive have led to extremely high living standards in many places . 
But the health care market is not an ordinary market . 
Most people do not pay for what they consume ; they rely on others to judge what they should consume , and prices do not influence these judgments as they do with conventional commodities . 
The market is thus rife with distortions . 
It is accordingly not surprising that in the area of health , the patent system , with all of its distortions , has failed in so many ways . 
A medical prize fund would not provide a panacea , but it would be a step in the right direction , redirecting our scarce research resources toward more efficient uses and ensuring that the benefits of that research reach the many people who are currently denied them .
