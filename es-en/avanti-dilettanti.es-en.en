Avanti Dilettanti ! 
BERLIN - Returning to Europe lately after a six-day trip to the United States , I wondered for the first time while reading the press on the recent Irish crisis whether the euro - and thus the European Union - might possibly fail . 
This could happen because , in the long run , the EU won &apos;t be able to withstand its conflicts of interest and the resulting process of &quot; renationalization &quot; in all member states without suffering grave damage . 
At the height of the Irish crisis - mainly a crisis of confidence in banks &quot; stability and the strength and competence of Europe &apos;s political leadership - European leaders were publicly at each other &apos;s throats . 
While their stated aim was to save the euro , the government leaders involved did exactly the opposite , producing increased nervousness and volatility in financial markets , which in turn exacerbated Ireland &apos;s problems . 
Germany made its own contribution to aggravating the crisis by launching a public debate about involving the banks in shouldering losses from 2013 on . 
Why this discussion had to take place now , in the middle of the Irish crisis , remains Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s secret . 
It was most likely prompted solely by domestic political considerations . 
Indeed , the demand for bank participation is popular in Germany - and justifiably so - unlike the Irish rescue package . 
But it would be more productive to implement such a policy than to announce it two years in advance . 
Wherever you look , the price tag put on Europe these days is calculated in euros and cents and no longer in political and historical currency . 
Germany , in particular - Europe &apos;s largest country , and its strongest in economic terms - seems to have fallen victim to historical amnesia . 
The idea that Germany &apos;s own national interest dictates avoiding anything that isolates the country within Europe , and that the task is therefore to create a &quot; European Germany &quot; rather than a &quot; German Europe , &quot; seems to have been abandoned . 
To be sure , Germany &apos;s leaders still consider themselves to be pro-European and reject such criticism with indignation . 
But the fundamental change of strategy within Germany &apos;s European policy can no longer be overlooked . 
Objectively , the trend is indeed towards a &quot; German Europe , &quot; which will never work . 
The failure of the euro - and thus of the EU and its Common Market - would be the biggest pan-European disaster since 1945 . 
That this outcome is possible - despite protestations to the contrary by all involved - reflects the willful ignorance and lack of imagination of Europe &apos;s heads of state and government . 
Otherwise , they would recognize that the financial crisis has long become a political crisis threatening the EU &apos;s very existence , and thus that a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism for debt-distressed members , while clearly needed , requires a permanent political crisis-resolution mechanism in order to succeed . 
With the status quo it will be hard for the euro to survive . 
This permanent political crisis mechanism is , however , nothing less than a well-functioning economic union . 
The alternatives are therefore either forging ahead with realeconomic union and further EU integration , or regressing to a mere free-trade area and the renationalization of Europe . 
The belief that stability can be achieved with technocratic rules , regulations , and sanctioning mechanisms alone in a eurozone whose economies are diverging will prove to be misguided . 
Genuine eurozone stability presupposes macroeconomic alignment , which in turn requires the political integration of a well-functioning economic union . 
Staggered alignment of economic and social policies ( such as the legal retirement age ) , new balancing schemes ( euro bonds as a transfer instrument ) , and an effective stability mechanism are all needed to preserve the common currency . 
How can these far-reaching aims be achieved within the eurozone ( together with non-eurozone EU members that want to join in ) ? 
We should probably forget about any treaty changes at the moment . 
But the Schengen agreement offers an alternative , namely arrangements between individual states . 
The abolition of border controls was anything but a minor detail , and yet it was achieved on the basis of intergovernmental agreements . 
Why not economic union , too ? 
What the eurozone needs now isn &apos;t a repetition of Maastricht , but a kind of Schmidt / Giscard 2.0.This kind of initiative requires the support of Germany and France , because the crisis cannot be resolved without them . 
Given their economic and political clout , Germany and France are the respective leaders of the eurozone &apos;s northern and southern parts . 
Both could therefore sponsor the indispensable compromise between the eurozone &apos;s stronger and weaker countries . 
France &apos;s role would be to ensure that the weaker countries don &apos;t fall victim to enduring deflation . 
And Germany would have to be the guarantor of stability . 
Both countries together , however , must inaugurate the step towards economic union , which requires that both governments actually want that . 
Merkel will have to explain the inconvenient truth to Germans that the price of having the euro is inevitably a transfer and economic union , and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will have to make clear to the French the price of a real economic and stability union . 
The political risk for both of them will be anything but small , but the alternative - the failure of the euro - is unacceptable for both countries . 
Any eurozone political leader whose primary consideration now is re-election will face certain failure by meeting this historical challenge . 
But European priorities have to be the primary concern in this crisis - even at the price of losing office . 
On the other hand , taking this historic initiative would , relative to fainthearted tactical maneuvering , substantially increase politicians &quot; chances of re-election later . 
But Europe has no shortage of politicians . 
What is urgently required now are genuine statesmen and stateswomen .
