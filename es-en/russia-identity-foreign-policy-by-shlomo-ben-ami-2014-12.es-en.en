Let Russia Be Russia 
TEL AVIV - In his famous &quot; X &quot; article , published in 1947 , George F. Kennan argued that the Soviet Union &apos;s hostility toward the United States was virtually inexorable , given that it was rooted not in a classic conflict of interest between great powers , but in a deep-seated nationalism and insecurity . 
The same could be said of the current conflict between Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia and the West : It is , at root , a collision between the West &apos;s supposedly universal values and Russia &apos;s quest for a distinct identity . 
A country &apos;s struggle for identity can shape its strategic behavior . 
The missionary ethos of American civilization helps to explain its conduct as a global power . 
The resurgence of Islamism is essentially a quest for a fulfilling identity by an ancient civilization overwhelmed by the challenges of modernity . 
And Israel &apos;s emphasis on its Jewish identity has become a formidable obstacle to peace with the Palestinians . 
Putin &apos;s defiant foreign policy is a response - mediated by an authoritarian political tradition , the reactionary tenets of Orthodox Christianity , and pride in Russia &apos;s vast geography and natural wealth - to the humiliating loss of an empire . 
Seeing in Russia &apos;s Cold War defeat the need to extol the non-Western roots of Russian history and tradition , Putin has fallen back on the same conservative values that emerged in response to the Napoleonic invasion of 1812 , frustrating Peter the Great &apos;s modernization efforts . 
When the deputy head of the presidential administration , Vyacheslav Volodin , said during a recent Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi that &quot; Putin is Russia and Russia is Putin , &quot; he was expressing a profound Russian reality . 
In no other country has the ruler &apos;s persona - from Catherine the Great and Ivan the Terrible to Lenin and Stalin - made such a deep mark on national history . 
But Putinism cannot be reduced to sheer lust for power . 
Putin knows that Russia &apos;s reemergence on the global stage must be underpinned by a counterpoint to American exceptionalism , a national identity based on a distinct conception of history and distinct ideals . 
As Putin declared last year , the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse dealt a &quot; devastating blow &quot; to Russia &apos;s &quot; cultural and spiritual codes , &quot; and subsequent &quot; attempts to civilize Russia from abroad &quot; amounted to &quot; primitive borrowing . &quot; 
Instead of expecting a new national ideology to emerge on its own , Russia must pursue and develop its unique identity - with Putin leading the way . 
Securing a place for Russia in a new world order is integral to establishing such an identity . 
To this end , Putin has maximized the foreign-policy value of Russia &apos;s vast oil and gas reserves , enabling the Kremlin to build partnerships with rising Asian powers , especially China . 
If , as some Russian officials have proposed , Russia begins an identity-defining large-scale project to develop its immense territory east of the Ural Mountains , including Siberia and the Far East , it would have a unique opportunity to deepen these connections further . 
More broadly , Putin &apos;s defiance of US hegemony could attract support from countries and peoples worldwide that resent American-imposed values and norms . 
Indeed , for many international actors , Western notions of tolerance and political correctness - for example , acceptance of &quot; non-traditional lifestyles , &quot; such as homosexuality - are , in Putin &apos;s words , an affront to the world &apos;s &quot; God-given diversity . &quot; 
But Putin is not merely preaching values . 
The annexation of Crimea and continuing destabilization of Ukraine advance his broader ambition of resurrecting Russia &apos;s cultural and political dominance in Eurasia and much of the former Soviet space . 
In Putin &apos;s view , the 1945 Yalta Agreement , which divided Europe into Soviet and Western spheres of influence , did not die ; its borders simply moved eastward . 
Tellingly , following a discussion of numerous global challenges at the recent Valdai meeting , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov identified a demonstration by ethnic Russians in Chișinău ( Kishinev ) , Moldova &apos;s capital , as the &quot; most important question &quot; to be addressed . 
Putin &apos;s Russia is anything but shy when it comes to ethnic unity . 
Of course , the West - particularly the US - bears its share of responsibility for the failure to find a diplomatic solution to the current showdown with Russia . 
Before a lasting peace can be achieved , the US will need to reflect on the mistakes that characterized its post-Cold War period of hegemony , when its unilateral military adventures and neo-imperial ambitions left it overstretched , highly indebted , and locked in perpetual war . 
Without such introspection , the US and its European allies will probably continue to depend on economic sanctions to deter Russian aggression . 
But , though this approach could weaken Putin &apos;s legitimacy by limiting his ability to deliver economic prosperity , it could also result in an anti-Western nationalist backlash . 
Moreover , as Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov has shown , sanctions can be presented as a blessing , forcing the Kremlin to diversify Russia &apos;s commodities-based economy . 
National identities cannot be negotiated away ; but diplomacy can dilute their aggressive manifestations . 
It is time for Russian and Western leaders to devise a grand bargain for peace in eastern Ukraine , one that goes beyond the Minsk Protocol to address the questions of global security and arms control that have impeded cooperation on issues like Syria &apos;s civil war and Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Russia does not need to upend the existing global order ; it simply needs to find its place . 
And the US must let it .
