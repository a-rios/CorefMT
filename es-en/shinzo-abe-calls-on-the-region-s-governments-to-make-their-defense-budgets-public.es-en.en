Military Transparency and Asian Security 
TOKYO - We have all heard the saying , &quot; Sunshine is the best disinfectant . &quot; 
That is particularly true where Asian security is concerned . 
Indeed , I believe that a framework under which Asian governments publicly disclose their military budgets needs to be established if we are to build trust and avoid a regional arms race . 
More broadly , keeping military expansion in check , enlarging the number of countries that conclude the Arms Trade Treaty , and improving mutual understanding among national defense authorities are now the paramount issues facing Asia . 
They should be the focus of the East Asia Summit , which in turn should become the premier forum for taking up regional security issues and ensuring that stability is maintained . 
Military expansion is inherently incompatible with Asia &apos;s move toward the center of the global economy . 
The fruits of prosperity should be reinvested in improving people &apos;s lives , not in weapons that can take them . 
And yet safeguarding the rule of law counts most . 
For example , Japan will offer its utmost support for efforts by ASEAN member countries to ensure the security and free navigation of the seas and skies . 
But let me be transparent about what Japan will actually support , and how . 
We have already provided three new patrol vessels to Indonesia through grant aid cooperation and have decided to provide ten more to the Philippine Coast Guard . 
Moreover , we are moving forward with the necessary survey to enable us to provide such vessels to Vietnam . 
No less important , when Japan sends hardware , experts and training follow , and we convey our sense of pride in committing ourselves to our duties . 
By cultivating a high degree of morale and proficiency , we strengthen the bonds between the peoples of Japan and recipient countries . 
In the Philippines , Indonesia , and Malaysia alone , Japan has trained more than 250 coast guard personnel . 
In 2012 , when we invited senior officials responsible for enforcing maritime law in each of the five major ASEAN countries to a month-long training program , three members of the Japan Coast Guard were assigned to each trainee , with all of them living , eating , and sleeping together under the same roof . 
Recently , Japan formulated a new framework for transfers of defense equipment and technology to other countries . 
On the basis of appropriate controls and strict inspections , we can now offer rescue , transport , surveillance , and minesweeping equipment . 
To support ASEAN countries in safeguarding the seas , Japan will combine various options , including official development assistance , capacity building by the Japan Self-Defense Forces ( JSDF ) , and provision of defense equipment and technology . 
No country can secure its own peace alone anymore . 
That is why it is incumbent upon us in Japan to reconstruct the legal basis for collective self-defense and international cooperation , including participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations - a reform that my administration has begun . 
The importance of this reform can hardly be overstated . 
The JSDF is now working to foster peace in South Sudan , under the flag of the UN mission there , alongside units from Cambodia , Mongolia , Bangladesh , India , Nepal , the Republic of Korea , and China , as well as many civilian UN staffers and NGO personnel from various countries . 
All are partners with us in assisting South Sudan &apos;s nation-building process . 
But imagine now that civilian workers there , powerless to defend themselves , came under sudden attack by armed elements . 
Under the approach that Japanese governments have taken up to now , the JSDF would be unable to rescue the civilians . 
Is this really an appropriate response ? 
My government is thinking hard about this dilemma , and close consultation is underway within the ruling coalition . 
It is precisely because Japan depends so heavily on the international community for the stability of its external environment that we wish to work even more proactively for world peace . 
Many generations of Japanese have walked a single path - that of freedom , human rights , and the rule of law - and we will continue to walk this path for generations to come . 
But , as we revitalize Japan &apos;s economy , we need &quot; new &quot; Japanese who shoulder global responsibilities commensurate with their country &apos;s size and economic resources . 
These new Japanese will lose none of their good qualities . 
They will still loathe poverty , embrace universal values , and find joy in hard work . 
If anything has changed , it is that women are much more visible among these new Japanese . 
For example , all three of the Japanese judges and public prosecutors who helped draft Cambodia &apos;s civil code were young women . 
The new Japanese will actively serve the cause of Asian peace . 
In August 2011 , President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines and Chairman Murad Ebrahim of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front met in Narita , Japan . 
Three months ago , in March , the two sides finally reached a comprehensive peace agreement . 
When the new Bangsamoro local government assumes power two years from now , Japanese assistance teams will be there from the start . 
Japan is already focusing on giving women in the region the skills they need to earn a living . 
In Mindanao , where Japan built a vocational training center for women , the sounds of gunshots and angry cries have been replaced by the whir of sewing machines . 
All of this is nothing other than an expression of Japan &apos;s determination to spare no effort for the sake of peace , security , and wider prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region . 
By working with our regional allies and partners , including the United States and ASEAN , we will translate that determination into a rock-solid zone of stability .
