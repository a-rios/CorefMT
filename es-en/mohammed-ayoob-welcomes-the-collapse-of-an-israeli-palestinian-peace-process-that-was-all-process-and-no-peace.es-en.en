The End of the Two-State Solution 
BANGALORE - US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s valiant effort to save the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is about to end in failure . 
Though achieving a substantive settlement was always a pipe dream , this latest disappointment will render the United States unable to preserve even the fa√ßade of a &quot; peace process &quot; that was all process and no peace . 
And that might not be such a bad thing . 
The negotiations are failing for several reasons , beginning with Israel &apos;s continued colonization of lands occupied in 1967 , despite opposition from the international community , including the US . 
If anything , Israel has accelerated settlement construction since the latest round of talks began , while escalating its demands , especially regarding the stationing of Israeli troops in the Jordan Valley . 
Releasing a few dozen Palestinian prisoners is no substitute for genuine concessions on these contentious issues . 
Making matters worse , the US has continually refrained from using its substantial leverage to compel Israel to change course , owing to the domestic political strength of the pro-Israel lobby , especially the American Israel Public Affairs Committee . 
Tellingly , Kerry appointed Martin Indyk - a British-born Australian citizen , who began his political career in the US working for AIPAC in the early 1980s - as the principal US facilitator . 
Another obstacle to a peace agreement has been the division between Hamas-controlled Gaza and the Fatah-controlled West Bank . 
This , too , is rooted in American and Israeli intransigence - specifically , their refusal to accept Hamas &apos;s victory in the 2006 election and recognize the group as the legitimate Palestinian representative . 
This policy encouraged Fatah not to cede any power to Hamas in the West Bank , engendering the split in occupied Palestine . 
In the latest round of negotiations , however , this division has not been a major obstacle , because Hamas remained on the sidelines - neither participating nor seeking to play a spoiler role . 
This decision may have stemmed from an assumption that the talks would collapse , thereby discrediting the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority . 
Regardless , the division among Palestinians cannot be blamed for the talks &quot; failure this time . 
This brings us back to Israel &apos;s continued colonization of Palestinian land , which all but excludes the possibility of a two-state solution . 
Add to that the Israeli right &apos;s insistence that no concessions are possible on territorial issues , Jerusalem , or the Palestinians &quot; right of return , and it is clear that Kerry never really had a chance . 
Perhaps the clearest indication of Israel &apos;s obstinacy came from its economy minister , Naftali Bennett , last July . 
&quot; The idea that a Palestinian state should be established within the Land of Israel has reached a dead end , &quot; he declared . 
&quot; The most important thing for the Land of Israel is to build and build and build &#91; Jewish settlements &#93; . &quot; 
Paradoxically , the discerning Palestinian observer may find comfort in America &apos;s failure to stop Israel from expanding its settlements ( and thus effectively annexing a growing share of Palestinian land ) , for it ends the charade on which the peace process has been based . 
The most likely outcome now is the establishment of a single unified country within the borders of the 1922 British Mandate for Palestine , including all of present-day Israel and the occupied territories . 
In other words , Israel and Palestine are moving inexorably toward the establishment of a binational state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea . 
Such a state will be based on one of two mutually exclusive principles : equal rights for all of its inhabitants or some form of apartheid , characterized by Jewish control and Palestinian subordination . 
The problem for Palestinians is that Jewish Israelis would have more clout in directing this unified state &apos;s development , and they are unlikely to choose equality on their own . 
After all , granting equal political and civil rights to all citizens would diminish the country &apos;s exclusivist Jewish character , reversing Zionist goals and achievements - an outcome that most of Israel &apos;s Jewish population would reject . 
Calling the country &quot; Israel &quot; would be inadequate to moderate this resistance . 
The international community would probably respond to the emergence of an apartheid state with opprobrium and ostracize Israel , regardless of American protests . 
Moreover , conflict within such a country would be bound to spill over its borders , possibly sparking a major regional conflagration . 
This would have serious consequences for the US and other staunch Western supporters of Israel that have major strategic and economic interests in the region . 
It is time , therefore , for the US to rethink its policy toward the Israel-Palestine conflict . 
Instead of pursuing the mirage of a two-state solution , the US should use its leverage in the region to clear the way for the emergence of a binational , democratic state that guarantees full political and civil equality for all of its inhabitants . 
This may not be an ideal solution for any of the parties to the Israel-Palestine conflict , but it is far better than the alternative : an apartheid state that is likely to further destabilize the Middle East and lead to a never-ending cycle of conflict in the region .
