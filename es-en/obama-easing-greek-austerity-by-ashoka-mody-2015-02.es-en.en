Obama Joins the Greek Chorus 
PRINCETON - US President Barack Obama &apos;s recent call to ease the austerity imposed on Greece is remarkable - and not only for his endorsement of the newly elected Greek government &apos;s negotiating position in the face of its official creditors . 
Obama &apos;s comments represent a break with the long-standing tradition of official American silence on European monetary affairs . 
While scholars in the United States have frequently denounced the policies of Europe &apos;s monetary union , their government has looked the other way . 
Those who criticize the euro or how it is managed have long run the risk of being dismissed as Anglo-Saxons or , worse , anti-Europeans . 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher accurately foresaw the folly of a European monetary union . 
Gordon Brown , as British Chancellor of the Exchequer , followed in Thatcher &apos;s footsteps . 
When his staff presented carefully researched reasons for not joining the euro , many Europeans sneered . 
And that is why Obama &apos;s statement was such a breath of fresh air . 
It came a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Greece should not expect more debt relief and must maintain austerity . 
Meanwhile , after days of not-so-veiled threats , the European Central Bank is on the verge of cutting funding to Greek banks . 
The guardians of financial stability are amplifying a destabilizing bank run . 
Obama &apos;s breach of Europe &apos;s intellectual insularity is all the more remarkable because even the International Monetary Fund has acquiesced in German-imposed orthodoxy . 
As IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the Irish Times : &quot; A debt is a debt , and it is a contract . 
Defaulting , restructuring , changing the terms has consequences . &quot; 
The Fund stood by in the 1990s , when the eurozone misadventure was concocted . 
In 2002 , the director of the IMF &apos;s European Department described the fiscal rules that institutionalized the culture of persistent austerity as a &quot; sound framework . &quot; 
And , in May 2010 , the IMF endorsed the European authorities &quot; decision not to impose losses on Greece &apos;s private creditors - a move that was reversed only after unprecedented fiscal belt-tightening sent the Greek economy into a tailspin . 
The delays and errors in managing the Greek crisis started early . 
In July 2010 , Lagarde , who was France &apos;s finance minister at the time , recognized the damage incurred by those initial delays , &quot; If we had been able to address &#91; Greece &apos;s debt &#93; right from the start , say in February , I think we would have been able to prevent it from snowballing the way that it did . &quot; 
Even the IMF acknowledged that it had been a mistake not to impose losses on private creditors preemptively ; it finally did so only in June 2013 , when the damage had already been done . 
There is plenty of blame to go around . 
Former US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner championed a hardline stance against debt restructuring during a crisis . 
As a result , despite warnings by several IMF Directors in May 2010 that restructuring was inevitable , the US supported the European position that private creditors needed to be paid in full . 
Lee Buchheit , a leading sovereign-debt attorney and the man who managed the eventual Greek debt restructuring in 2012 , was harshly critical of the authorities &quot; failure to face up to reality . 
As he put it , &quot; I find it hard to imagine they will now man up to the proposition that they delayed - at appalling cost to Greece , its creditors , and its official-sector sponsors - an essential debt restructuring . &quot; 
Obama may have arrived late to the right conclusion , but he expressed what should be an obvious truth : &quot; You cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression . &quot; 
If Obama &apos;s words are to count , he must continue to push for the kind of deal Greece needs - one that errs on the side of too much debt forgiveness , rather than too little . 
Recent analysis shows that forgiveness of Greece &apos;s official debt is unambiguously desirable , as another bogus deal will keep the Greek economy depressed , ensuring that the problem soon recurs . 
If European sensitivities must be assuaged , Greece &apos;s debt repayment could be drawn out over 100 years . 
At the end of the day , debt forgiveness benefits creditors as much as it helps debtors . 
Creditors have known this since at least the sixteenth century , when Spain &apos;s King Philip II became the world &apos;s first known serial sovereign defaulter . 
As Jesus put it , &quot; It is more blessed to give than to receive . &quot; 
European authorities must come to understand that the next act of the Greek tragedy will not be confined to Greece . 
If relief fails to materialize , political discontent will spread , extremist forces will gain strength , and the survival of the European Union itself could be endangered .
