Cold War or Cool Calculation ? 
NEW YORK - With escalating violence in southern and eastern Ukraine and no solution in sight , the Ukraine crisis has become the world &apos;s most turbulent geopolitical conflict since that triggered by the terrorist attacks against the United States in 2001 . 
The US-led sanctions strategy will neither deescalate the tensions between the West and Russia nor bolster the imperiled pro-Western Ukrainian government . 
But , even with tightening sanctions against Russia and growing violence in Ukraine , there is little chance that Cold War II is about to start . 
The US approach has been to ratchet up sanctions in response to Russian aggression , while ensuring that America &apos;s allies remain united . 
At a recent joint press conference , President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a new , lower threshold for additional sanctions . 
Previously , that threshold was a direct Russian military invasion ; now , as Merkel explained , if Russia disrupts Ukraine &apos;s May 25 elections , &quot; further sanctions will be unavoidable . &quot; 
But Merkel and Obama also lowered the bar for what those &quot; further sanctions &quot; would be . 
Instead of launching sweeping sectoral measures that would target vast swaths of the Russian economy - a big step toward &quot; Iran-like &quot; sanctions against Russia - it now seems that the next round will be only incremental . 
The elections threshold makes another round of sanctions virtually certain , but allows the tightening to be more modest and gradual . 
Why slow down the sanctions response ? 
The Americans understand that if they go too far too fast , Europe will publicly break with the US approach , because the Europeans have a lot more at stake economically . 
Whereas the US and Russia have a very limited trade relationship - worth around $ 40 billion last year , or roughly 1 % of America &apos;s total trade - Europe &apos;s financial exposure to Russia , as well as its reliance on Russian natural gas , make it far more hesitant to torpedo the economic relationship . 
More important , dependence on Russia varies immensely across the European Union , impeding substantial coordination - and limiting the EU &apos;s alignment with the US . 
That is why , when the latest sanctions were announced , the Europeans issued a modest expansion of their existing list - primarily focusing on military and political officials - while the US went further , adding several Russian institutions . 
When the sanctions were announced , Russian markets rallied , a clear indication that the West &apos;s response fell far short of expectations . 
Indeed , though the sanctions are having a real economic impact on Russia ( particularly in spurring capital flight ) , tightening the screws further will not materially change Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s decision-making . 
Putin &apos;s Russia has too much at stake in Ukraine , and his actions have been overwhelmingly popular at home . 
But , even as tensions escalate , with no hope of Russia backing down , the world is not headed toward anything resembling a new Cold War . 
For starters , America &apos;s interests in Ukraine do not justify putting troops on the ground , while Europe has been dragging its feet in supporting America &apos;s diplomatic position . 
Moreover , Russia is in long-term decline . 
The economy and the government budget have become increasingly reliant on oil and gas ; the wealthiest 110 Russians control more than one-third of the country &apos;s wealth ; and Russia is far less capable militarily than it was in the Soviet era , with a defense budget roughly one-eighth that of the US . 
The demographic picture is bleak , with an aging population and a low fertility rate . 
In order to form a coherent bloc that could oppose the US-led global order , Russia would need powerful friends , which it sorely lacks . 
When the United Nations General Assembly voted on the legitimacy of the Crimea annexation , only ten countries - neighbors in Russia &apos;s orbit ( Armenia and Belarus ) , traditionally sympathetic Latin American countries ( Bolivia , Nicaragua , and Venezuela ) , and rogue states ( Cuba , North Korea , Zimbabwe , Sudan , and Syria ) - sided with the Russians . 
The one country that could tilt the balance and establish a Cold War dynamic is China . 
But the Chinese have proved completely unwilling to pick one camp or the other , as they stand to benefit from more purchases of Russian energy exports and new opportunities as Western firms become more squeamish about doing business in Russia . 
China can reap those rewards without angering its largest trade partners , the EU and the US . 
And China is hesitant to support a Russian effort to create turmoil within Ukraine &apos;s borders , given that its own restive provinces , such as Xinjiang and Tibet , could learn the wrong lesson from the Ukraine precedent . 
So the good news is that we are not heading toward any kind of global war , cold or hot . 
But the consequences of a misguided Western policy are becoming more apparent . 
The US cannot successfully isolate Russia for not adhering to international law and seizing another state &apos;s territory . 
While other major emerging countries may not be rallying behind Russia , they are not subscribing to the US approach . 
Pushing for tougher sanctions will lead to a rift with Europe , while pushing Russia further toward China economically . 
Meanwhile , the Ukrainian government is at risk . 
It lacks the military capacity to halt the separatist forces in the south and east but will face mounting domestic pressure and illegitimacy if it does not act . 
The best path forward for the US is to offer more carrots for Ukraine , rather than more sticks for Russia . 
Thus far , the US has put up $ 1 billion in loan guarantees , which is far too little . 
The fledgling pro-Western government is losing ground to Russia on a daily basis ; the West should focus on supporting it . 
Obama and Merkel &apos;s press conference was symbolically useful in establishing a united front toward Russia , despite the two leaders &quot; evident disagreement about how - and how much - to punish the Kremlin . 
But rallying around the Ukrainian government and putting their money where their mouths are - even when Ukraine fades from the headlines and new crises erupt - is more important for US and European interests , and represents a more viable path forward for both sides .
