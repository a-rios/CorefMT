The Cartoonist &apos;s Responsibility 
The recent events surrounding the publication of cartoons in Denmark have left everybody astounded - especially editorial cartoonists like myself . 
For once I have decided to trade my brushes for a laptop on this issue , principally because the space normally allocated to my cartoons cannot say what I want to say . 
Had I been given enough space , I would have drawn this article ! 
The debate over the cartoons has been intense to the point that it is now tedious , ranging from freedom of expression to a clash of cultural values and even to a clash of civilizations . 
What is also apparent is the fact that the debate has been exploited and hijacked by radical and extreme elements on both sides of the divide - those defending the right of free speech and those who defend the Muslim faith 
What has also clearly come out is that faith has a deeper significance than merely belonging to the faithful . 
It is held dearly , and it is closely connected to the lives of those who maintain it . 
Although the Danish cartoons might not appear offensive to many , they certainly insult principles that Muslims hold sacred . 
With my limited knowledge of Islam and the respect that I have for that faith , I would not have drawn them . 
One has the right to sneeze , but that does not include the right to sneeze in somebody &apos;s face . 
The cartoonists involved have admitted they know very little about Islam . 
In one of the cartoons , the Prophet Mohamed depicted as a terrorist , thereby explicitly equating Islam with terrorism . 
As an editorial cartoonist , I always try to find more about my subjects before rendering my final sketches . 
All of us ( including cartoonists ) agree that cartoons are a powerful tool of communication . 
But how responsibly do cartoonists exercise that power ? 
I recently attended a presentation on the constraints of creativity faced by editorial cartoonists . 
What limitation to artistic freedom do editorial cartoonists encounter in their work ? 
Top cartoonists from the United States , Switzerland , Turkey , South Africa , Singapore , Japan , Kenya , and Israel showcased their unpublished work . 
The general feeling was that there was no absolute freedom . 
Cartoonists and editors loosely agreed that there would always be cultural and religious issues to take into account when determining what can and should be published . 
But should such considerations override free speech at any cost ? 
I don &apos;t think so . 
Freedom of expression is never categorically right or wrong ; instead , it accommodates rights and wrongs . 
The Danish cartoons were offensive , but did their publication warrant the killing of innocent individuals , attacking Danish and Western embassies and their citizens , and the burning of the Danish flag around the world ? 
Did those who drew those cartoons represent Danes and the West ? 
Did those who burned the Danish flag and issued the threats represent Islam ? 
My answer is no . 
The issue is therefore not about the beliefs themselves as much as it is about how the faithful deal with offense , and why . 
For example , there have been publications of equally insensitive anti-Semitic cartoons in many Arab countries , against which no Muslim ever raised a finger . 
And , as a cartoonist from Africa , I &apos;ve seen racist and offensive cartoons in some Western publications . 
Do they represent Western values ? 
No , yet they reflect part of the cultural problem of the West . 
I think Muslims have the right to show and demonstrate their anger against the cartoons . 
But they need to do so in a peaceful manner , with regard to the rights of others . 
That right , unfortunately , includes drawing and publishing cartoons that may not please them .
