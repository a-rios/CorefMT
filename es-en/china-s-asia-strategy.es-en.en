China \ u0027s Asia Strategy 
For over a decade , American strategic thinking has focused on China &apos;s emergence as a great power in East Asia . 
Such thinking is pass√© . 
China already is East Asia &apos;s great power . 
While America has struggled in Iraq this year , China has spent it on a diplomatic goodwill offensive in Asia . 
The result ? 
In October , one day after President George W. Bush was booed in Australia &apos;s parliament , Chinese President Hu Jintao received a standing ovation from the same parliamentarians . 
China &apos;s emergence as Asia &apos;s dominant power , and the overall regional balance of power , are now matters that governments across the Pacific must reckon with carefully . 
To be sure , the US remains Asia &apos;s power broker , as it has been since the end of WWII . 
But diplomacy regarding the Korean peninsula , in which all roads lead to Beijing , has opened the door to China as the new &quot; go-to &quot; guy . 
Indeed , the six-party meetings in Beijing earlier this year to discuss North Korea &apos;s nuclear challenge confirmed China &apos;s emerging great power status , which is also reflected in its increasingly active - and effective - Asian diplomacy . 
This includes even Japan , China &apos;s traditional rival . 
This past May , Chinese President Hu Jintao met with Japan &apos;s Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in St. Petersburg , Russia . 
Hu &apos;s move lifted bilateral relations out of the deep freeze , where China &apos;s previous leadership had consigned them following Koizumi &apos;s repeated visits to the Yasukuni Shrine , where the spirits of Japan &apos;s war dead , including Class A war criminals , are enshrined . 
Unlike former Chinese president Jiang Zemin , whose history lectures irritated Japan &apos;s postwar generations , Hu focused on the future , avoiding the dreaded &quot; Y &quot; word in the meeting with Koizumi . 
The Japanese media took note . 
In August , Japan &apos;s Chief Cabinet Secretary , Yasuo Fukuda , attended ceremonies in Beijing marking the 25th anniversary of the China-Japan Friendship Treaty . 
At the same time , China &apos;s Foreign Minister , Li Zhaoxing , traveled to Tokyo . 
If all goes well , a Koizumi visit to China may be in the offing . 
Koizumi has long sought an official visit , only to be stymied by Chinese opposition to his Yasukuni visits . 
His interest is understandable . 
Last year , Japan &apos;s imports from China surpassed those from the US for the first time , while annual exports to China soared by 39.3 % . 
Even as the SARS epidemic raged in China , Japanese companies kept their long-term investment bets on the promise of low-cost Chinese labor . 
China has been equally active to its south and west . 
In June , during the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh , China announced that it will sign the 1976 Treaty of Amity and Cooperation , ASEAN &apos;s founding document . 
China &apos;s accession to ASEAN represents a major confidence-building step toward Southeast Asia . 
It follows China &apos;s 2001 proposal for a China-ASEAN free trade area and its active financial support for Thailand and Indonesia during the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis . 
Talk of a &quot; strategic partnership &quot; is in the air . 
Meanwhile in South Asia , after hosting Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee in Beijing , China and India signed a Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation . 
India acknowledges in the document that Tibet is part of China and proscribes anti-Chinese activities by Tibetans from Indian soil . 
In November , the first ever India-China joint naval exercises were held off the Chinese coast . 
If the US is looking to develop a post-Cold War strategic relationship with India to counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia , the recent China-India agreements suggests that an alternative strategic calculus may exist in both China and India . 
The US must recognize that , while the countries of the region look to the US to balance - or at least leaven - China &apos;s growing influence , they are unlikely to be interested in getting caught up in any containment strategy . 
For now , US and Chinese interests coincide on the war on terrorism , on a peaceful resolution of the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula , and on stability in East Asia . 
Over the long-term , however , accommodation will be difficult on issues like Taiwan , Korean reunification , and the future of the US alliance structure in Asia . 
Moreover , on the fundamental issue of freedom -  &quot; the non-negotiable demand of human dignity , &quot; in the words of the Bush administration &apos;s National Security Strategy - American and Chinese visions conflict . 
Clearly , the war on terrorism presented China with opportunities to strengthen both its relations with the US and its ties with nations across the Pacific . 
The big question is whether today &apos;s cooperation between China and the US will prove to be no more than a diversion from Asia &apos;s enduring strategic reality - China &apos;s emergence as the region &apos;s dominant power . 
The safest bet is that Asia &apos;s realities outlast the war on terrorism , and that after Afghanistan and Iraq , when the US refocuses on Asia , it will find a very different China in a much-changed region .
