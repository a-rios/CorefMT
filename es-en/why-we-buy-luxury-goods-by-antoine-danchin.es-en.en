The Biology of Luxury 
PARIS - Despite the global economic crisis , sales of luxury goods are surging worldwide . 
Why ? 
While marketing has contributed to the rise , the luxury market &apos;s robust growth is actually rooted in biology . 
Discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the Enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements : space , time , matter , and energy . 
But recently , a fifth element , information , has entered the debate . 
And information , it turns out , is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of luxury-goods consumption , and thus to predicting the luxury market &apos;s future . 
Living organisms communicate , and the information that they exchange shapes their reality . 
While animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength , humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health . 
But , more than a symbol , buying luxury goods could indicate future success , owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides . 
In nature , competitors perform , and the most compelling , beautiful spectacle wins . 
For most animals , males are the performers . 
Male birds , for example , often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages , such as the Australian lyrebird &apos;s long tail . 
As a result , competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate . 
A bird that survives , despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators , must be fit , and will likely sire a healthy progeny . 
Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring , an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous - and thus more common - in nature . 
But humans are social creatures with no natural predators , so female competition is more widespread - and demonstrative performance and display are more likely . 
Indeed , while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders , women &apos;s appearance is frequently more vivid ( and more closely scrutinized ) . 
But effective display is costly . 
Developing complex , vibrant plumage demands significant energy and genetic resources . 
Genes are difficult to maintain , requiring subtle and energy-intensive correcting processes . 
Just as writing too fast can cause typographical errors that garble a text , rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species &quot; integrity . 
Likewise , purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources . 
This cost dictates the display &apos;s competitive impact . 
In today &apos;s information-based world , selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price - and that price is known . 
For example , those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier , more vibrant , and more attractive than those who do not . 
This is not the result of efficiency ( the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs ) . 
Rather , it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth . 
Cosmetics , like all luxury products , gain influence not from their production , or even their purchase , but from their visibility . 
Indeed , an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand . 
For luxury goods to have any function , society needs information about their cost . 
This has been true to varying degrees throughout history - sometimes resulting in price bubbles . 
False information , such as counterfeit goods , jeopardizes the competition-based selection process . 
Animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge - or fear - of another &apos;s strength . 
By imitating an animal with a well-known protective profile , a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs . 
But mimicry &apos;s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz . 
If there are too few of the original , the profile loses its significance , and its protective value vanishes . 
Similarly , nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common . 
Therefore , assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact , and thus their appeal , requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting . 
Given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage , higher luxury-goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country . 
In a time of crisis , countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the safest bets for productive investment .
