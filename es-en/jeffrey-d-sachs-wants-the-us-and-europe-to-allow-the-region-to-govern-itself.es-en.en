Let the Middle East Govern Itself 
NEW YORK - It is time for the United States and other powers to let the Middle East govern itself in line with national sovereignty and the United Nations Charter . 
As the US contemplates yet another round of military action in Iraq and intervention in Syria , it should recognize two basic truths . 
First , US interventions , which have cost the country trillions of dollars and thousands of lives over the past decade , have consistently destabilized the Middle East , while causing massive suffering in the affected countries . 
Second , the region &apos;s governments - in Syria , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , Iran , Iraq , Egypt , and elsewhere - have both the incentive and the means to reach mutual accommodations . 
What is stopping them is the belief that the US or some other outside power ( such as Russia ) will deliver a decisive victory on their behalf . 
When the Ottoman Empire collapsed at the end of World War I , the great powers of the day , Britain and France , carved out successor states in order to ensure their control over the Middle East &apos;s oil , geopolitics , and transit routes to Asia . 
Their cynicism - reflected , for example , in the Sykes-Picot Agreement - established a lasting pattern of destructive outside meddling . 
With America &apos;s subsequent emergence as a global power , it treated the Middle East in the same way , relentlessly installing , toppling , bribing , or manipulating the region &apos;s governments , all the while mouthing democratic rhetoric . 
For example , less than two years after Iran &apos;s democratically elected parliament and prime minister , Mohammad Mossadegh , nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951 , the US and Britain used their secret services to topple Mossadegh and install the incompetent , violent , and authoritarian Shah Reza Pahlavi . 
Not surprisingly , the Islamic Revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979 brought a wave of virulent anti-Americanism in its wake . 
Rather than seeking rapprochement , however , the US supported Saddam Hussein during Iraq &apos;s eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s . 
Iraq fared no better with the British and Americans . 
Britain ruthlessly created a subservient Iraqi state after WWI , backing Sunni elites to control the majority Shia population . 
After oil was discovered in the 1920s , Britain assumed control over the new oil fields , using military force as needed . 
The US supported the 1968 coup that brought the Ba &apos;ath Party - and Saddam - to power . 
With Saddam &apos;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , however , the US turned on him , and has been entwined in Iraq &apos;s politics ever since , including two wars , sanction regimes , the toppling of Saddam in 2003 , and repeated attempts , as recently as this month , to install a government that it considered acceptable . 
The result has been an unmitigated catastrophe : the destruction of Iraq as a functioning society in an ongoing civil war , fueled by outside powers , that has caused economic ruin and collapsing living standards . 
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died in the violence since 1990 . 
Syria endured decades of French dominance after WWI , and then alternatingly hot and cold relations with the US and Europe since the 1960s . 
During the past decade , the US and its allies have tried to weaken , and then , starting in 2011 , to topple President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , mainly in a proxy war to undermine Iranian influence in Syria . 
The results have been devastating for the Syrian people . 
Assad remains in power , but more than 190,000 Syrians are dead and millions have been displaced as a result of an insurrection supported by the US and its allies ( with Assad backed by Russia and Iran ) . 
Some US officials are now reportedly considering an alliance with Assad to fight the militant Islamic State , whose rise was enabled by the US-backed insurrection . 
After decades of cynical and often secret interventions by the US , Britain , France , Russia , and other outside powers , the region &apos;s political institutions are based largely on corruption , sectarian politics , and brute force . 
Yet whenever a new Middle East crisis erupts , the latest being triggered by the Islamic State &apos;s recent gains , the US intervenes again , perhaps to change a government ( as it has just orchestrated in Iraq ) or to launch a new bombing assault . 
Backroom dealings and violence continue to rule the day . 
Pundits claim that Arabs cannot manage democracy . 
In fact , the US and its allies simply don &apos;t like the results of Arab democracy , which all too often produces governments that are nationalist , anti-Israel , Islamist , and dangerous to America &apos;s oil interests . 
When the ballots go in that direction , the US simply ignores the election results ( as it did , for example , in 2006 , when Hamas won a large majority of the popular vote in Gaza ) . 
The US cannot stop the spiral of violence in the Middle East . 
The damage in Libya , Gaza , Syria , and Iraq demands that a political solution be found within the region , not imposed from the outside . 
The UN Security Council should provide an international framework in which the major powers pull back , lift crippling economic sanctions , and abide by political agreements reached by the region &apos;s own governments and factions . 
Iran , Turkey , Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , the UAE , and other neighbors know one another well enough - thanks to 2,000-plus years of trade and war - to sort out the pieces themselves , without interference from the US , Russia , and the former colonial powers of Europe . 
The countries of the Middle East have a common interest in starving hyper-violent groups like the Islamic State of arms , money , and media attention . 
They also share an interest in keeping oil flowing to world markets - and in capturing the bulk of the revenues . 
I am not claiming that all will be well if the US and other powers pull back . 
There is enough hatred , corruption , and arms in the region to keep it in crisis for years to come . 
And nobody should expect stable democracies any time soon . 
But lasting solutions will not be found as long as the US and other foreign powers continue to meddle in the region . 
One hundred years after the start of WWI , colonial practices must finally come to an end . 
The Middle East needs the opportunity to govern itself , protected and supported by the UN Charter , not by any individual great power .
