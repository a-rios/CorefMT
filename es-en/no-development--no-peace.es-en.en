No Development , No Peace 
Anyone interested in peacemaking , poverty reduction , and Africa &apos;s future should read the new United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) report Sudan : Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment . 
This may sound like a technical report on Sudan &apos;s environment , but it is much more . 
It is a vivid study of how the natural environment , poverty , and population growth can interact to provoke terrible human-made disasters like the violence in Darfur . 
When a war erupts , as in Darfur , most policymakers look for a political explanation and a political solution . 
This is understandable , but it misses a basic point . 
By understanding the role of geography , climate , and population growth in the conflict , we can find more realistic solutions than if we stick with politics alone . 
Extreme poverty is a major cause , and predictor , of violence . 
The world &apos;s poorest places , like Darfur , are much more likely to go to war than richer places . 
This is not only common sense , but has been verified by studies and statistical analyses . 
In the UNEP &apos;s words , &quot; There is a very strong link between land degradation , desertification , and conflict in Darfur . &quot; 
Extreme poverty has several effects on conflict . 
First , it leads to desperation among parts of the population . 
Competing groups struggle to stay alive in the face of a shortage of food , water , pasture land , and other basic needs . 
Second , the government loses legitimacy and the support of its citizens . 
Third , the government may be captured by one faction or another , and then use violent means to suppress rivals . 
Darfur , the poorest part of a very poor country , fits that dire pattern . 
Livelihoods are supported by semi-nomadic livestock-rearing in the north and subsistence farming in the south . 
It is far from ports and international trade , lacks basic infrastructure such as roads and electricity , and is extremely arid . 
It has become even drier in recent decades because of a decline in rainfall , which is probably the result , at least in part , of man-made climate change , caused mostly by energy use in rich countries . 
Declining rainfall contributed directly or indirectly to crop failures , the encroachment of the desert into pasturelands , the decline of water and grassland for livestock , and massive deforestation . 
Rapid population growth - from around one million in 1920 to around seven million today - made all of this far more deadly by slashing living standards . 
The result has been increasing conflict between pastoralists and farmers , and the migration of populations from the north to the south . 
After years of simmering conflicts , clashes broke out in 2003 between rival ethnic and political groups , and between Darfur rebels and the national government , which in turn has supported brutal militias in &quot; scorched earth &quot; policies , leading to massive death and displacement . 
While international diplomacy focused on peacekeeping and on humanitarian efforts to save the lives of displaced and desperate people , peace in Darfur can be neither achieved nor sustained until the underlying crises of poverty , environmental degradation , declining access to water , and chronic hunger are addressed . 
Stationing soldiers will not pacify hungry , impoverished , and desperate people . 
Only with improved access to food , water , health care , schools , and income-generating livelihoods can peace be achieved . 
The people of Darfur , Sudan &apos;s government , and international development institutions should urgently search for common ground to find a path out of desperate violence through Darfur &apos;s economic development , helped and supported by the outside world . 
The UNEP report , and experiences elsewhere in Africa , suggests how to promote economic development in Darfur . 
Both people and livestock need assured water supplies . 
In some areas , this can be obtained through boreholes that tap underground aquifers . 
In other areas , rivers or seasonal surface runoff can be used for irrigation . 
In all cases , the world community will have to help pay the tab , since Sudan is too poor to bear the burden on its own . 
With outside help , Darfur could increase the productivity of its livestock through improved breeds , veterinary care , collection of fodder , and other strategies . 
A meat industry could be developed in which Darfur &apos;s pastoralists would multiply their incomes by selling whole animals , meat products , processed goods ( such as leather ) , dairy products , and more . 
The Middle East is a potentially lucrative nearby market . 
To build this export market , Darfur will need help with transport and storage , cell phone coverage , power , veterinary care , and technical advice . 
Social services , including health care and disease control , education , and adult literacy programs should also be promoted . 
Living standards could be improved significantly and rapidly through low-cost targeted investments in malaria control , school feeding programs , rainwater harvesting for drinking water , mobile health clinics , and boreholes for livestock and irrigation in appropriate locations . 
Cell phone coverage could revolutionize communications for sparse populations in Darfur &apos;s vast territory , with major benefits for livelihoods , physical survival , and the maintenance of family ties . 
The only way to sustainable peace is through sustainable development . 
If we are to reduce the risk of war , we must help impoverished people everywhere , not only in Darfur , to meet their basic needs , protect their natural environments , and get onto the ladder of economic development .
