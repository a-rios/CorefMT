From Rome to Moscow 
One of the late Pope John Paul II &apos;s unfulfilled dreams was to visit Moscow and forge a rapprochement with the Orthodox Church . 
But , although he was invited to Moscow by Russia &apos;s three most recent presidents - Vladimir Putin , Boris Yeltsin , and Mikhail Gorbachev - opposition to the visit by Orthodox Patriarch Alexi prevented the Pope from making the journey before he died . 
Will Pope Benedict XVI achieve the breakthrough that his friend and predecessor failed to realize ? 
Despite the recent return to Russia of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan that once hung in John Paul &apos;s bedroom , relations between the Vatican and the Patriarchate remain strained . 
So Putin , who usually seems omnipotent , remains wary of issuing an invitation to Pope Benedict . 
That wariness is reinforced by a new political factor : a defense of Orthodoxy has become a pillar of the national idea on which Putin seeks to base the legitimacy of his regime . 
This is one reason why Putin was one of the few leading heads of state to miss attending Pope John Paul &apos;s funeral . 
Although the Orthodox Church did send a delegation , immediately after the funeral Patriarch Alexi warned that the disagreements between the two branches of Christianity go much deeper than the former Pope &apos;s Polish nationality , which was always a particular sore spot for Russian Orthodox Slavs . 
Russians saw John Paul &apos;s Polish nationality as linking him to a long history of perceived oppression of Russian Orthodoxy . 
No less a figure than Alexander Pushkin wrote in 1836 that &quot; Orthodoxy has always been persecuted by Catholic fanaticism .... Their missionaries cursed the Orthodox Church , with hypocrisy and threats tried to recruit into Catholicism not only ordinary people but Orthodox priests as well . &quot; 
Those Russians who continue to view the Catholic Church as a threat regularly quote these lines . 
Pope Benedict , being from Germany , a predominantly Protestant country , does not carry the weight of this bitter history . 
Perhaps this is one reason why Alexi responded positively to Benedict &apos;s first speech urging reconciliation , saying that he hopes that this will improve &quot; Orthodox-Catholic relations on the post-Soviet territory . &quot; 
This positive spirit can be nurtured by Russia &apos;s government , which usually has cordial relations with the Vatican . 
Indeed , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has many projects for which he thinks the Vatican can be of help , particularly in advancing the cause of reconciliation and creating a &quot; partnership between civilizations . &quot; 
Recently , another key Vatican figure , Cardinal Walter Casper , the head of the Council for Christian Unity , called for a Catholic-Orthodox high level meeting that would address unifying both branches of Christianity . 
Cardinal Casper is well regarded in Russia for being the man who returned Our Lady of Kazan to its homeland . 
In his public speeches , Casper more than once suggested that the Vatican considers Christian unification its main goal , and - most important from the Orthodox perspective  -  that &quot; unity does not have to mean sameness . &quot; 
The fact that Pope Benedict and Cardinal Casper are both Germans is important , because Russian-German relations are perhaps warmer now than they have ever been . 
Putin , in particular , is at home in the German language , having spent many years in East Germany during his days as a KGB agent . 
Moreover , unlike Pope John Paul II , who , as a Pole , always saw communist Russia as an oppressor , Benedict carries the German sense of guilt stemming from the country &apos;s Nazi past and its brutal invasion of Russia . 
In both Rome and Moscow , there is growing hope that a road to Christian unity can be built , but it is increasingly clear that the road can be completed only by passing through Berlin .
