The US with Iran in Syria 
PRINCETON - The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama &apos;s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpile . 
The eleventh-hour U-turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in Syria . 
In a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart , Walid al-Moallem , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tabled a proposal , originally agreed with Iran , calling for Syria to &quot; place chemical weapons storage sites under international control . &quot; 
The stockpiles would then be destroyed and Syria would fully join the international Chemical Weapons Convention . 
The second component of the Russian-Iranian proposal calls for international efforts , under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council , to rein in Syrian rebel forces &quot; chemical-weapons capabilities . 
Moallem immediately embraced the proposal . 
Hours later , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did as well , while Obama said that &quot; I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way . &quot; 
This initiative would allow Obama to escape from a messy political and foreign-policy predicament . 
So here are 12 reasons why America should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the Russian-Iranian plan . 
First , there is evidence that the Syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons . 
In December 2012 , Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons , including sarin gas , being transferred to Syria . 
The US declined to cooperate with Iran to press ahead on the case . 
Second , US military strikes on Syria have the potential to engulf the entire region - and perhaps the US - in a broader war . 
After its experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade , the US can hardly afford a Syrian quagmire . 
Third , with the regional Sunni-Shia conflict intensifying , the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region . 
US military strikes against Syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against Syrians of all faiths . 
Reports point to the execution and mutilation of Syrian-government prisoners . 
There is no doubt that the fate of Syria &apos;s Christian and Jewish communities is now extremely precarious . 
Fourth , America &apos;s decision to back extremists in Syria contradicts its &quot; war on terrorism &quot; and will erode international support for it . 
The prospect of Iranian cooperation to root out Al Qaeda extremists , which it provided in Afghanistan and Iraq , would be unlikely following any intervention . 
Fifth , it is wrong to assume that without Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , Iran would lose its influence in the Muslim world as well as its link to Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
America &apos;s regional position weakened , and Iran &apos;s strengthened , following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq ; 
US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern . 
Sixth , a US attack on Syria would leave the US isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution . 
There is no domestic or international appetite for another US military adventure - NATO , the G-20 , the Europeans , Russia , China , and 60 % of Americans oppose a unilateral US military strike . 
Seventh , the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high . 
If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian - to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians - US military intervention would do more harm than good . 
Eighth , US involvement in Syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the US and Iran . 
Al Qaeda affiliates will target US regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on Iran and its militant proxies - providing a pretext for US military confrontation . 
Ninth , a US military strike against a third Muslim-majority country would demolish the credibility of Obama &apos;s efforts to repair America &apos;s image in the Islamic world . 
Indeed , it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the &quot; resistance axis &quot; - Iran and Hezbollah . 
Tenth , any US unilateral military strike against Syria would ratchet up tensions between the US and Russia . 
Eleventh , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani &apos;s new administration to enter into direct talks with the US . 
In these circumstances , a US attack on Syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a US-Iran rapprochement for years to come . 
Finally , with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President , a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face-saving solution ( for both sides ) on Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime . 
Indeed , Iran was a major victim of chemical-weapons attacks during its 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq . 
Iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of WMDs in Syria , the Middle East , and beyond . 
Iran maintains that the Security Council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response . 
One promising avenue for US-Iran cooperation on Syria could be joint support for a fact-finding mission by the Security Council to identify the perpetrators . 
Obama has his &quot; red line &quot; on the use of chemical weapons .
