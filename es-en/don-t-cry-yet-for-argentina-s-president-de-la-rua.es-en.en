Don \ u0027t Cry Yet for Argentina \ u0027s President De la Rua 
BUENOS AIRES : After ten years of democratic rule under President Carlos Menem , Argentina &apos;s transition to its new president , Fernando De la Rua , has been swift and smooth . 
The ease of change from Peronist rule to the center / left Alianza signals Argentina &apos;s democratic maturity . 
Stability prevails in financial markets ; country risk fell 300 basis points between July and the day De la Rua assumed power ; industrial production grew 14.9 % in the second half of last year . 
Policy continuity eased this change of regime . 
Sensibly , the new government maintained &quot; Convertibility , &quot; the local name for a Currency Board system that sets a 1 : 1 exchange rate between the peso and the US dollar . 
That catastrophic assessment led the new government to enact a tax package which hiked taxes on middle income wage earners and exempted earnings from dividends or interest . 
Tax evaders were offered deals to repay overdue taxes . 
Nothing , however , angers paying taxpayers more than having their taxes raised while shirkers get special breaks . 
Economists , although they praised the idea of balancing the budget , sharply criticized the means . 
Moreover , persistent effort to blame everything bad in Argentina on Menem &apos;s administration boomeranged : people viewed it as a smokescreen for a lack of leadership . 
Such finger-pointing has a price . 
During the new government &apos;s first three months , trends in industrial production , services , construction , consumption and , worst of all , tax collection reversed . 
Although nominal GDP was expected to be 2 % higher ( in annual terms ) in the first quarter of 2000 , nominal tax collection fell by 1.5 % , exposing the inadequacies of De la Rua &apos;s tax package . 
Government economists now accept that recovery will be slow , but expect improvements due to lower interest rates and higher exports , even though both may only be the result of ongoing slowdown . 
The banking sector , indeed , is showing excess liquidity as a result of a fall in demand for credit . 
To offset this , a reduction in bank reserve requirements is expected , although this cuts against the rules of Convertibility and may cause a fall in international reserves . 
The financial system , still strong thanks to Convertibility and a buoyant global economy , favors recovery - but a later recovery . 
Nothing , however , indicates that Argentina will grow again at the 5 % to 8 % rates of the 1990 &apos;s . 
For growth and investment to improve , Argentina needs a long term strategy for integration in the world trading system which pushes productivity up . 
Mercosur , the regional trading pact of which Argentina is a member , served as a growth engine in the 1990 &apos;s , seems insufficient to the task now . 
President De la Rua cannot take Argentina out of Mercosur , yet the country cannot live permanently within it . 
This paradox demands a solution : muddling through will not attract investment or induce appropriate scale in new export projects . 
Investors need to know whether they must compete with Brazil alone or the whole world . 
Under prevailing conditions , Argentina cannot compete globally . 
To do so requires labor market deregulation and tax reform . 
High employment costs and nominal tax rates promote small scale enterprises that only thrive on black market employment and tax evasion . 
With much industry operating at small scale , it is no surprise that many firms cannot compete internationally . 
De la Rua has not been completely idle here . 
A proposed Labor Reform Law is now being considered by the Peronist controlled Senate . 
While the proposed law does not kill all the distortions favored by unions , it is clearly a step in the right direction and may be accepted by the Peronists . 
Legislative approval will help De la Rua recover lost momentum and perhaps encourage new investments . 
Unfortunately , De la Rua botched other competitiveness initiatives . 
Despite 14 % joblessness , unemployment taxes were increased last December after three years of cuts by Menem . 
A law promoting small enterprises ( so long as they remain small ! ) only increases the bias against large scale operations embedded in Argentina &apos;s high tax rates and strict labor market regulations . 
Reforms of the opposite sort are needed in an economy plagued by unemployment and low productivity . 
Other Menem era reforms are also under threat . 
Privatization of much of the Social Security System was one key change wrought by President Menem . 
Some members of the ruling administration now want to allow people to voluntarily switch back to the state system , bringing with them contributions made during their years in the private capitalization system . 
Because the state system is based on redistribution , those extra funds are likely to be spent immediately , risking bankruptcy of the system for a second time . 
President De la Rua &apos;s worse problem is not this or that policy , but his tendency to send contradictory messages that confuse markets . 
In his state of the nation address he promised to increase competition in the economy , yet in the same week suspended an &apos; open sky &apos; airline agreement reached with the US by the Menem administration . 
Perversely , he did so to defend the monopoly of a now privatized national airline which is 85 % owned by foreigners . 
President De la Rua &apos;s first four months weakened Argentina &apos;s economy . 
His misfortunes do not seem to be ideologically motivated , but are based on an inability to see the conflicts intrinsic within his policy initiatives . 
Hope , however , is not lost . 
It took President Menem two years to find his footing and act boldly ; he then delivered a death blow to inflation by implementing Convertibility in 1991 . 
No test of that magnitude faces President De la Rua - at least not yet . 
What he needs to do is abandon the politics of blame and get on with implementing a coordinated policy package designed to lift Argentina &apos;s international competitiveness .
