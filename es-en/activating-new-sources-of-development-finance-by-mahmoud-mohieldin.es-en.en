Financing the Next Development Agenda 
WASHINGTON , DC - As the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals approaches , the United Nations is intensifying its efforts to foster debate about what comes next for promotion of development worldwide . 
The outcome of these discussions will shape policies and investment aimed at spurring GDP growth , strengthening human capital , and promoting more inclusive prosperity . 
With the global population expected to reach nine billion people by 2050 - a significant proportion of whom will reside in developing or underdeveloped countries - the international community must improve access to education , health care , and employment opportunities worldwide . 
Meanwhile , the prospect of a rise in global temperature of more than 2 ° C ( 3.6 ° F ) over pre-industrial levels by the end of this century ( which would trigger global warming &apos;s most damaging effects ) calls for higher investment in sustainable urbanization , climate-smart agriculture , and social safety nets . 
Both factors challenge us to define , in the longer term , more sustainable patterns of production and consumption . 
Governments , civil society , and the private sector must rise to the challenge , cooperating to find and implement creative solutions . 
But , first , they must anticipate the associated financing requirements , which will soon surpass the current capacities of governments and international donors , and take action now to activate new , reliable sources of financing . 
To start , governments should design targeted , evidence-based policies and support the development of sound institutions . 
This would make government services more effective , while helping to catalyze additional development aid from traditional donors and mobilize private-sector resources . 
In many countries , there is considerable scope for domestic resource mobilization . 
Broadening the tax base , improving tax administration , and closing gaps in the value-added tax could make a significant difference in lower-income countries , where tax revenues account for only about 10-14 % of GDP , compared to 20-30 % of GDP in high-income countries . 
More equitable taxation would have a positive impact on governance , another important tool for mobilizing domestic resources . 
With improved corporate and public governance and clear transfer-pricing policies , resource-rich countries could shore up their capacity to negotiate fair contracts with extractive industries , balance revenues and expenditures over time , and manage their natural endowments more transparently . 
Progress in these areas would help governments to channel their spending more effectively toward those who would benefit the most . 
For example , only 8 % of the $ 409 billion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20 % of the population . 
A targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending , freeing up resources for education , health , and poverty eradication . 
Furthermore , promoting financial deepening and inclusiveness could accelerate private-sector growth , creating more opportunities . 
Indeed , broader access to financial services would help the estimated 400 million micro , small , and medium-size enterprises in developing countries to prosper , while enabling the 2.5 billion people worldwide who currently lack access to such services to build their assets . 
A deeper and more efficient financial sector would also reduce transaction costs and facilitate risk management . 
Local-currency bond markets could help to develop domestic investor bases and mobilize domestic savings to support long-term investments . 
At the same time , the international community should work to improve the availability and effectiveness of official development assistance . 
The ODA target of 0.7 % of GDP - agreed in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey , Mexico - should motivate countries to increase their contributions . 
They can also take steps to make ODA more predictable from year to year . 
Donors should structure aid to ensure that it supports sound national development policies and programs , rather than their own narrow interests . 
This is particularly relevant as emerging development partners , especially the BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) , offer new kinds of aid packages that incorporate investment and non-financial assistance . 
Private charities , which have been instrumental in promoting innovation in fields such as health care , the environment , and education , could provide valuable insight into channeling aid more effectively . 
More generally , improving coordination among donors would help to maximize the impact of aid on the ground . 
While ODA remains an important source of financing for fragile and very-low-income countries , it represents only 7 % of net financial flows to developing countries , where foreign direct investment , remittances , long-term debt , and portfolio investment have a larger impact . 
Donors should leverage aid to &quot; grow the pie &quot; and to diversify financing sources for the world &apos;s poorest countries by providing risk guarantees , innovative investment vehicles , debt syndication , and co-financing arrangements . 
Attracting even a fraction of the assets held by institutional investors , sovereign-wealth funds , and public pension funds could boost development finance substantially . 
Diaspora populations are another major potential source of development financing . 
Reducing transfer costs , which average an estimated 9 % of the value of transactions , would put more money into the hands of those who need it most . 
Tailoring financial products for diaspora communities could attract resources for investment , while reinforcing migrants &quot; ties - economic and otherwise - to their home countries . 
Finally , the international community bears a special responsibility for delivering global public goods . 
The responsibility to preserve the environment , stem the spread of communicable diseases , strengthen the international financial architecture , enhance developing-country participation in the global trading system , and facilitate the exchange of knowledge lies at the intersection of national development priorities and global interests . 
Duty-free , quota-free access to OECD markets , complemented by simpler , more transparent rules of origin , would raise GDP by 1 % in the least-developed countries , lifting millions out of poverty . 
Investment in statistical capacity would help governments and businesses worldwide to make better policy decisions , based on a more accurate accounting of the associated costs and benefits . 
The challenge of the post-2015 development agenda lies in finding creative solutions to support prosperity , equality , and sustainability . 
Together , governments , civil society , international organizations , and the private sector can improve the availability and quality of finance for development , and shape a better future for all .
