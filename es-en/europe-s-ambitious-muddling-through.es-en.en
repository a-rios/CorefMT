Europe &apos;s Ambitious Muddling Through 
BRUSSELS - Following the escalation of the euro crisis and decisions taken at the European Union &apos;s last summit , especially EU leaders &quot; commitment to embark on the road &quot; Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union , &quot; it is high time to ask what comes next . 
Whatever the final outcome , the current crisis will fundamentally shape the future of European integration . 
In a worst-case scenario , Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis could cause the eurozone to implode , with immediate negative effects for the EU itself . 
Fortunately , this scenario still seems rather unlikely - as EU countries inside and outside the eurozone seem keen to avoid the enormous economic , financial , political , and social fallout that such a scenario implies . 
But the danger of a fundamental disintegration has increased over time , and today such an outcome cannot be excluded . 
At the same time , it seems unlikely that member states will be ready and able to make one giant leap towards a &quot; United States of Europe &quot; - that is , a genuine federal entity in which EU countries agree to surrender national sovereignty on an unprecedented scale . 
The record since 2010 suggests that &quot; muddling through &quot; will remain the EU &apos;s dominant approach for the foreseeable future . 
But , contrary to the past , the increasing existential pressures on the common currency and the constant scrutiny by markets and citizens will require bold policy responses that go well beyond the lowest common denominator . 
At the end of the day , &quot; ambitious muddling through &quot; will most likely lead to a higher degree of sui generis economic and fiscal integration ( especially among euro-zone countries ) , including binding synchronization of national budgets , greater economic coordination , and eventually also some limited form of debt mutualization . 
In other words , resolving the crisis will require &quot; more Europe , &quot; though the final outcome is impossible to predict , as it will result from a complex process aimed at reconciling divergent and opposing positions both within the EU and among eurozone countries . 
The EU &apos;s leaders have asked Herman Van Rompuy , the president of the European Council , to develop , in close collaboration with the presidents of the European Commission , the Eurogroup , and the European Central Bank , a road map to achieve a &quot; Genuine Economic and Monetary Union . &quot; 
The final report , due to be delivered in December 2012 , should identify which additional steps can be taken on the basis of the existing EU treaties , and which measures require treaty amendments . 
Given the urgency of the crisis , some of the more immediate steps towards a higher level of economic and fiscal integration , which are not enforceable under the current EU treaties , might require additional intergovernmental arrangements outside of the EU &apos;s treaty framework . 
Such an approach should not be a goal in itself , but it might be a necessary evil to avert the danger of a euro implosion . 
But , in order to regain institutional coherence , legal certainty , and democratic accountability , core elements of the &quot; fiscal compact &quot; and any other future agreements between EU governments should be incorporated into the Union &apos;s primary body of law as soon as possible . 
Moving towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union will also require more fundamental institutional reforms . 
This process cannot be limited to governments , but will also have to involve the European Parliament and national parliaments in the framework of yet another European Convention . 
A higher level of economic , fiscal , and political integration will also compel the amendment of national constitutions . 
Ratification of a new EU treaty and the adaptation of national constitutions would inevitably require referenda in a number of countries . 
Given Dutch and French voters &quot; rejection of the EU &apos;s constitutional treaty in 2005 , and European citizens &quot; increasing frustration with the Union and its crisis management , the outcome would be highly uncertain . 
Indeed , the danger of a euro implosion or a potential exit from the common currency may prove to be sufficiently strong arguments to &quot; persuade &quot; a majority of Europeans to vote yes . 
The &quot; ambitious muddling through &quot; scenario will be long , bumpy , and sometimes risky , and will probably end at a destination that looks very different from today &apos;s expectations . 
But , before the EU embarks on that inevitable and uncertain journey , its institutions and member states ( actively supported by the ECB ! ) must fashion a safety net that can protect the euro and the Union itself from hitting the ground face first when the going gets rough in the coming years . 
After all , the debt crisis is likely to continue to generate immediate economic , fiscal , and market pressures . 
But the EU and its members will also increasingly have to cope with the collateral damage caused by the crisis - its unintended and unexpected consequences at the European and national levels . 
That damage includes increasing nationalism and anti-euro / EU populism , mounting social challenges in many member countries , a growing &quot; democratic deficit &quot; there and in the EU , a poisoned atmosphere among EU countries , and the lack of proactive , stable leadership coalitions pushing in the same direction . 
All of this could lead to a standstill , which , in the current environment , would be tantamount to going backward , threatening not only European integration &apos;s future prospects , but also its past accomplishments . 
Under these circumstances , &quot; ambitious muddling through &quot; is both the most likely and the most promising scenario . 
It will not be easy , and it will not allow time for complacency , given that the EU is most likely to remain in crisis mode for some time to come . 
But it is probably the only way to keep Europe moving forward .
