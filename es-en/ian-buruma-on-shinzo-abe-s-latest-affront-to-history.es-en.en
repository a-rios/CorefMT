Sorry for Nothing 
NEW YORK - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is once again stirring Asia &apos;s cauldron of national rivalries and historical resentments . 
This time , he has instructed a committee of historians to reexamine the official apology delivered in 1993 to World War II-era sex slaves held in Japanese military brothels . 
It is clear from various recent statements that some of Abe &apos;s closest advisers believe that the apology was not in order , so the committee might well conclude that Japan was never officially involved in prostitution , and that its &quot; sincere remorse &quot; should therefore be withdrawn . 
What perverse reason could Abe have for pursuing such an outcome ? 
Glossing over , or denying , dark chapters of national history is not unique to Japan , of course . 
There is no room for Stalin &apos;s mass murders in the kind of &quot; patriotic &quot; education favored by Russian President Vladimir Putin . 
And the Tiananmen Square Massacre , to name but one bloody event in China &apos;s recent past , has been officially forgotten . 
Still , Japan is a democracy , with freedom of expression . 
The official apology made in 1993 was prompted by a Japanese historian &apos;s discovery of documents showing that the Imperial Japanese Army had been directly involved in setting up , though not necessarily in running , what were known as &quot; comfort stations . &quot; 
One of the official reasons was that widespread rape of Chinese women by Japanese soldiers was provoking too much resistance among the local population . 
But , because there was no escape , the women , once ensnared in the system , were effectively slaves . 
This has been officially admitted , so why reopen the ghastly business now , at a time when rescinding the apology would make Japan &apos;s already-strained relations with China and South Korea many times worse ? 
If Abe and his allies were cosmopolitan in their outlook , with a deep understanding of , or concern for , other countries , the decision to revisit the 1993 apology would indeed be extraordinary . 
But , as is true of many political leaders , especially on the nationalistic right , they are chauvinistic provincials whose concerns are almost entirely domestic . 
In their efforts to revise the historical record , they are not really thinking of Koreans or Chinese , but of political adversaries at home . 
The views of the Japanese on their country &apos;s wartime history are deeply divided , reflecting political battle lines drawn in the immediate aftermath of the war , when Japan was under Allied occupation . 
The United States , which ran the occupation , was keen to reform Japanese society in such a way that another war would be unthinkable . 
Worship of the emperor was abolished , though Hirohito remained on his throne . 
A new pacifist constitution , written by the Americans , banned the use of armed force . 
And Japan &apos;s wartime leaders were tried in Tokyo by Allied judges for &quot; crimes against peace &quot; and &quot; crimes against humanity . &quot; 
Most Japanese , heartily sick of war and military bullying , were happy to go along with all of this . 
But there was always a right-wing minority that felt humiliated and resentful of the loss of national pride and , more important , national sovereignty , for Japan &apos;s security would henceforth have to depend entirely on the protection offered by the US . 
One of the main leaders of this group of disgruntled nationalists was Nobusuke Kishi , Abe &apos;s grandfather . 
Kishi &apos;s aim was to regain Japanese pride and sovereignty by revising the constitution and reviving old-fashioned patriotism , thus undoing some of the American educational reforms . 
He failed , because most Japanese were still allergic to anything that smacked of militarism . 
Until not long ago , there was a strong left-wing current in education and some of the media that used Japan &apos;s horrendous wartime record as an argument against any kind of revisionism . But , as long as the Japanese left used history to make this political argument , the nationalists pushed back by claiming that stories of wartime atrocities had been greatly exaggerated . 
Books about the infamous Nanking Massacre of 1937 , or the enslavement of &quot; comfort women &quot; in military brothels , were denounced as &quot; historical masochism &quot; or dismissed as &quot; the Tokyo Trial View of History . &quot; 
This , then , is the modern Japanese version of populism : the &quot; liberal elites , &quot; by falsifying the history of Japan &apos;s glorious war to &quot; liberate Asia , &quot; undermined the Japanese people &apos;s moral fiber . 
Because the ideological collapse of left-wing politics in Japan has been as precipitous as in much of the Western world , the so-called liberal elites have lost much of their former influence . 
That is why Abe can get away with appointing cronies to the board of NHK , the national broadcasting company , who openly claim that the military brothels were an entirely private enterprise and that the Nanking Massacre was a foreign fabrication . 
Historical truth is not the point ; political mastery is . 
Japan &apos;s prime minister is playing a risky game . 
He is upsetting allies in Asia , embarrassing the US , and making bad relations with China even worse . 
Like Putin , he is driving himself and his country into further isolation for entirely domestic reasons . 
And that is where Abe &apos;s behavior becomes truly perverse . 
After all , a Japan that is isolated in Asia will be even more dependent on the US , the wartime victor , which Abe and his nationalist allies hold responsible for the postwar order that they seek to revise .
