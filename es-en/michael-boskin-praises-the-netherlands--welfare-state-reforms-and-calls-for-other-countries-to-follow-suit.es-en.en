A Dutch Cure for the Dutch Disease 
STANFORD - Far too few governments rein in their countries &quot; bloated welfare states before disaster strikes . 
As a result , some citizens eventually suffer the economic equivalent of a heart attack : wrenching declines in living standards as they are victimized by unsustainable programs &quot; endgame . 
Greece and the city of Detroit are only the most recent grim examples . 
Many more suffer from the meager growth and barely rising incomes that result from the toxic combination of government overspending , burdensome regulations , and corrosive taxation . 
Much of Europe fits this category of economic stagnation . 
Occasionally , however , governments stage successful retreats from welfare-state dysfunction . 
Canada reduced spending by over 8 % of GDP in the 1990 &quot; s , and the United States reduced non-military spending by 5 % of GDP beginning in the mid-1980 &quot; s - a trend sustained by center-right and center-left governments alike . 
So , when a European country reverses course to reduce welfare dependency and restore work incentives , it is worth noting - especially when that country is the Netherlands , which built one of the world &apos;s most expansive welfare states in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s . 
Recently , the Netherlands &quot; King Willem-Alexander , delivering his first annual address to Parliament , said , &quot; Our labor market and system of public services no longer fully meet the demands of the twenty-first century .... The classical welfare state is slowly but surely evolving into a participation society . &quot; 
That represents a genuinely remarkable shift . 
From the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s on , those writing about the Netherlands often lamented the &quot; Dutch disease . &quot; 
There were so many generous subsidies , grants , and transfer payments - aimed at everyone from the truly needy to artists unable to sell their work - that after-tax wages were often barely higher than benefits . 
So people rarely returned to work after they lost or left a job , or did so in the underground economy , with its unreported cash payments . 
Whether one considered the Dutch welfare state humane and generous , or bloated and foolhardy , its largesse took a heavy toll on the economy . 
But unlike , say , the French , the Dutch have responded to their past excesses with a series of policies designed to promote a return to work in the formal labor market . 
Indeed , they deserve an orange-hued salute for innovative reforms that governments worldwide might usefully emulate in the interest of maintaining a targeted , effective , and affordable safety net . 
For example , disability insurance has become a huge , rapidly growing problem in many countries , despite the dramatic decline in the share of workers in physically demanding and dangerous jobs like construction and manufacturing . 
To stem the dramatic rise in disability payments , the Dutch now require firms with high claim rates to pay more for disability insurance , thereby creating a strong incentive to ensure greater workplace safety . 
But reducing disability claims ( and thus payments ) is only half of the equation . 
The other half is returning those who can do so to gainful employment . 
( In America , fewer than 1 % of the disabled return to work . ) 
Early intervention and informational campaigns about return-to-work options are promising possibilities . 
Much economic research shows that job skills deteriorate the longer one is away from work ; so retraining , information , and re-entry programs are very important . 
Similarly , the Dutch have embraced welfare reform , much as the United States did in 1996 , when a Democratic president , Bill Clinton , and a Republican Congress agreed on time limits , as well as work and training requirements . 
As a result , the Dutch welfare system now requires beneficiaries to show proof of an active job search prior to eligibility ; to perform work or volunteer community service while receiving benefits ; and to take a job even if it requires a long commute . 
America &apos;s 1996 welfare reform grew out of initiatives in the US state of Wisconsin . 
And , just as Wisconsin &apos;s reform proved to be a model that was successfully adopted nationally , so reforms in one European Union country could spur policy innovations elsewhere in the EU and around the world . 
And contagious successful policy reforms are precisely what Europe and most of the world need . 
To see why , consider the tax rate necessary to pay for social benefits , which equals the replacement rate ( the average level of benefits relative to taxpayer incomes ) multiplied by the dependency ratio ( the share of the population receiving the benefits ) . 
The higher the replacement rate and / or dependency ratio , the higher the tax rate needed to pay for the benefits . 
What is absolutely certain is that the dependency ratio will rise virtually everywhere , owing to inexorable demographic trends . 
The combination of rising life expectancy , lower fertility rates , and , in some countries ( including the US ) , the retirement of the post-World War II baby-boom generation , implies a rapid increase in the old-age dependency ratio . 
The US , for example , will go from one retiree for every three workers today to a 1 : 2 ratio in the next three decades . 
Italy and Germany will have a 1 : 1 ratio . 
And the share of China &apos;s population that will be over 65 a generation from now will be larger than in the US . 
Common-sense policy reforms that ought to be adopted for their own sake , like the Dutch disability and welfare reforms , will provide a second dividend by lowering the dependency ratio . 
That will not be enough to maintain sound public finances indefinitely . 
But , by demonstrating cures to the &quot; Dutch disease , &quot; the Netherlands is giving all of us an invaluable lesson .
