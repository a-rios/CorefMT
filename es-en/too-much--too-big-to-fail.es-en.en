Too Much &quot; Too Big to Fail &quot; ? 
LONDON - Obviously , the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 was partly one of specific , systemically important banks and other financial institutions such as AIG . 
In response , there is an intense debate about the problems caused when such institutions are said to be &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
Politically , that debate focuses on the costs of bailouts and on tax schemes designed to &quot; get our money back . &quot; 
For economists , the debate focuses on the moral hazard created by ex ante expectations of a bailout , which reduce market discipline on excessive risk-taking - as well as on the unfair advantage that such implicit guarantees give to large players over their small-enough-to-fail competitors . 
Numerous policy options to deal with this problem are now being debated . 
These include higher capital ratios for systemically important banks , stricter supervision , limits on trading activity , pre-designated resolution and recovery plans , and taxes aimed not at &quot; getting our money back , &quot; but at internalizing externalities - that is , making those at fault pay the social costs of their behavior - and creating better incentives . 
I am convinced that finding answers to the too-big-to-fail problem is necessary - indeed , it is the central issue being considered by the Standing Committee of the Financial Stability Board , which I chair . 
But we must not confuse &quot; necessary &quot; with &quot; sufficient &quot; ; there is a danger that an exclusive focus on institutions that are too big to fail could divert us from more fundamental issues . 
In the public &apos;s eyes , the focus on such institutions appears justified by the huge costs of financial rescue . 
But when we look back on this crisis in , say , ten years , what may be striking is how small the direct costs of rescue will appear . 
Many government funding guarantees will turn out to have been costless : liquidity support provided by central banks at market or punitive rates will often show a profit , and capital injections will be partly and sometimes wholly recovered when stakes are sold . 
Emerging estimates of the total fiscal costs of rescue vary by country , but are usually just a few percentage points of GDP . 
As a result of this crisis , however , government debt-to-GDP ratios in the United Kingdom and the United States will likely rise by 40 to 50 percentage points , and more important measures of economic harm - foregone GDP growth , additional unemployment , and individuals &quot; wealth and income losses - will rise as well . 
All of this implies that the crucial problem is not the fiscal cost of rescue , but the macroeconomic volatility induced by precarious credit supply - first provided too easily and at too low a price , and then severely restricted . 
And it is possible - indeed , I suspect likely - that such credit-supply problems would exist even if the too-big-to-fail problem were effectively addressed . 
In the US , this crisis has seen over-exuberant commercial real-estate lending by regional banks . 
If such banks fail , they are resolved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) in the normal fashion , and this has always been the market &apos;s ex ante expectation . 
In the UK , similarly , we have had problems with mid-sized mortgage banks , and with poor commercial real-estate lending by mutual building societies , as well as problems with two large banks . 
Ireland faces huge economic problems as a result of a commercial real-estate boom driven by banks that are relatively small by global standards . 
There is therefore a danger that excessive focus on &quot; too big to fail &quot; could become a new form of the belief that if only we could identify and correct some crucial market failure , we would , at last , achieve a stable and self-equilibrating system . 
Many of the problems that led to the crisis - and that could give rise to future crises if left unaddressed - originated elsewhere .
