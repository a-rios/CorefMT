Weimar Russia Revisited 
The phrase &quot; Weimar Russia &quot; first appeared about 13 years ago , at the height of the confrontation between then President Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet that ended when Yeltsin &apos;s tanks shelled the parliament . 
The meaning was clear to all : Weimar Russia , like Weimar Germany , signified a weak republic attacked from within by nationalists yearning to restore authoritarian ways . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s and the early years of this decade , the problems that incited fears of a dysfunctional state seemed to fade . 
But over the past 18 months , the specter of Weimar has once again begun to haunt Russia . 
If taken to extremes , Russian society &apos;s response to its wrenching modernization could degenerate into a nationalist revolution led by xenophobes . 
A different and healthy conservative response is possible if the tattered remnants of old threads , torn apart in the course of postcommunist modernization , can reconnect and grow together in a new way . 
The problem is that everyone writes history in their own manner , and that there are no scales that can fix the precise point at which the remedy of unifying patriotism turns into the lethal poison of rabid nationalism . 
Weimar Germany blindly poisoned itself . 
In the period from 1991 to 1993 , nationalism was on the rise because Yeltsin &apos;s infant democracy seemed weak , with the country in the throes of a deep economic crisis , as well as an acute confrontation between different branches of government . 
But what explains today &apos;s resurgence of nationalism , when the regime and economy are strong , and all branches of government appear to operate in total unity ? 
Indeed , there are no practical reasons for Russia &apos;s current system of governance to fall into crisis ( although such reasons may emerge in the event of an economic downturn ) . 
But there is another reason , no less important , that concerns morals and ideology . 
Challenges to established political authority have been chilled , fairly effectively , by means of state-sponsored patriotism . 
But the virus of nationalism has survived and multiplied . 
Opinion polls , for example , indicate that 50 % of Russians support the slogan &quot; Russia for Russians . &quot; 
Moreover , nationalism has spread from the streets into the elite . 
Nationalist statements that would have been confined to the extremist newspaper Den in the early 1990 &quot; s are now considered normal , &quot; centrist , &quot; even commonplace . 
Today &apos;s hardcore Russian nationalists consider Putin &apos;s regime too soft , too pragmatic , too reasonable - in their language , &quot; weak and indecisive . &quot; 
They loathe it for its &quot; surrender &quot; in Ukraine to the &quot; Orange Revolution , &quot; and they condemn the decision to give land along Siberia &apos;s Amur River to China . 
The &quot; Putin Center &quot; can be displaced . 
Recall that Russia &apos;s pro-Western liberals , ascendant a decade ago , have been relegated to the ideological fringe , with the very word &quot; democrat &quot; ( let alone &quot; pro-West &quot; ) now a term of abuse . 
Fortunately , there is no sign yet ( not even on the horizon ) of a charismatic leader capable of forging the scattered energies of national-socialist grievances into a critical mass of hatred and &quot; national revival . &quot; 
Stalin &apos;s ghost is no substitute for a real live leader ; he will never leap out of his portraits , no matter how often they are waved . 
Moreover , times have changed . 
For example , no one even mentions the idea of introducing a dictatorship , abolishing elections , and so on . 
No matter how harshly Russia &apos;s &quot; democrats &quot; are abused , the word &quot; democracy &quot; remains a sacred cow . 
Instead , a populist-nationalist revolution might resemble the attempt to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991 , or a Russian version of Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution . 
It might be some sort of &quot; democratic nationalist revolution &quot; - spontaneous , and not made by any one political party but by a popular mass movement . 
It would be anti-bureaucrat , anti-oligarch , anti-West , and staunchly pro-nationalist . 
These are the key ingredients in the nationalist stew that seems to appeal to Russians nowadays . 
Judging by Putin &apos;s most recent address to parliament , his regime is fully aware of the danger posed by populist nationalists . 
It is likely that the regime will attempt to counter this eruption of nationalism while maintaining its strong statist rhetoric . 
But , in order to defeat the far right , Putin &apos;s regime will be forced to take its stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds . 
This won &apos;t be easy for a regime based on the twin pillars of bureaucracy and the security apparatus . 
What liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious : support Putin &apos;s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order . 
The populist nationalists , because they reject these fundamentals , are the unremitting political antagonists of all liberals . 
Yet an alliance with the nationalists against Putin currently tempts many Russian liberals . 
Indeed , the most popular tactic among liberals nowadays is to unite with all opponents of the regime . 
That scheme is both absurd and dangerous . 
After all , the word &quot; Weimar &quot; draws its infamy from the pact with the devil that German conservatives and royalists made by backing Hitler .
