The Eurozone &apos;s Narrowing Window 
PRINCETON - Portuguese authorities recently made a preemptive offer to their country &apos;s creditors : Instead of redeeming bonds maturing in September 2013 , the government would stretch its repayment commitment out to October 2015 . 
The deal was concluded on October 3 , and has been interpreted as a successful market test for Portugal . 
Ireland &apos;s authorities have conducted similar recent operations , exchanging short-maturity paper for longer-term debt . 
These transactions highlight the broader strategy of buying time . 
Both countries are seeking to create a longer , more manageable repayment profile for their privately-held debt as they begin weaning themselves from dependence on official &quot; bailout &quot; funds provided by the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) . 
Private investors are acknowledging the reality that repayments will likely be drawn out , because insisting on existing terms could cause an untenable bunching of debt-service payments , with possibly unpleasant consequences . 
This strategy &apos;s success presupposes that , in the interim , economic growth will strengthen the capacity to repay debt down the line . 
The debt ratios for both Ireland and Portugal are expected to peak at about 120 % of GDP in 2013 , after which they are projected to fall . 
The peak ratio and the subsequent downward trajectory depend crucially on the assumed pace of economic growth . 
But growth prospects remain grim . 
The Portuguese economy is now expected to contract by 1 % in 2013 . 
In late June , the IMF projected modest growth , and , at the time of the &quot; bailout &quot; agreement in May 2011 , GDP in 2013 was expected to grow by 1.25 % . 
Such successive downward forecast revisions have become commonplace . 
The latest estimates for Italy and Spain project a deeper contraction , prolonged into next year . 
Ireland is doing better , although its growth forecast has also been revised downward , to just under 0.5 % in 2012 and 1.4 % next year . 
Moreover , Irish GNP ( the income accruing to its nationals , as distinct from foreign firms operating in Ireland ) continues to shrink . 
Each downward revision implies postponement of the date on which the debt / GDP ratio will peak . 
Beyond 2013 , growth must depend on either the elixir of structural reforms , or a strong revival of the global economy . 
But a revival of economic growth in the short term is unlikely . 
Crucially for Europe , world trade has been virtually stagnant in recent months . 
Global trade and economic performance in the eurozone appear to be dragging each other down . 
The potential consequences are serious . 
While the IMF &apos;s primary scenario is that Irish and Portuguese debt levels will soon stop rising , it comes with a chilling litany of downside risks . 
The likelihood that budget deficit and debt targets will be missed is rising . 
Thus , the eurozone faces three choices : even more austerity for the heavily-indebted countries , socialization of the debt across Europe , or a creative re-profiling of debt , with investors forced to accept losses sooner or later . 
Austerity alone cannot do it . 
Some countries face the growing risk of near-perpetual belt-tightening , which would further dampen growth and thus keep debt ratios high . 
After all , if a country &apos;s debt / GDP ratio is to decline without austerity , the interest rate that it pays on its debt must be lower than its GDP growth rate . 
If the interest rate is higher than the growth rate , austerity is required ; the wider the gap , the more austerity is needed . 
Acknowledging the limits of austerity , several initiatives attempt a European resolution . 
Special European facilities , along with the IMF , lend money at below-market interest rates , which reduces the extent of austerity required . 
But the facilities &quot; resources are dwindling , and they certainly would not be sufficient if Spain and Italy were to seek support . 
The ECB &apos;s announcement of a new program to purchase sovereign bonds has lowered market interest rates . 
But , even with that decline , many countries &quot; long-term interest rates will most likely remain higher than their growth rates for the next several years . 
More ambitious pan-European efforts are embodied in various Eurobond proposals . 
These schemes imply socialization of debt - taxpayers elsewhere in Europe would share a country &apos;s debt burden . 
These proposals , once in great vogue , have receded . 
Not surprisingly , the political opposition to such debt mutualization was intense . 
Given that perpetual austerity is untenable and others in Europe can only do so much , without robust growth the options will narrow quickly . 
As a result , much now hangs on the ECB &apos;s actions - and how long they will be sufficient to maintain a truce with financial markets . 
Perhaps the Portuguese time-buying strategy points the way ahead . 
But time eventually does run out . 
If buying time is not enough , will there finally be a greater call on bondholders to share the pain ?
