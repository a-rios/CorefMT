Europe &apos;s Easy-Money Endgame 
MUNICH - The euro has brought a balance-of-payments crisis to Europe , just as the gold standard did in the 1920s . 
In fact , there is only one difference between the two episodes : During today &apos;s crisis , huge international rescue packages have been available . 
These rescue packages have relieved the eurozone &apos;s financial distress , but at a high cost . 
Not only have they enabled investors to avoid paying for their poor decisions ; they have also given overpriced southern European countries the opportunity to defer real depreciation in the form of a reduction of relative prices of goods . 
This is necessary to restore the competitiveness that was destroyed in the euro &apos;s initial years , when it caused excessive inflation . 
Indeed , for countries like Greece , Portugal , or Spain , regaining competitiveness would require them to lower the prices of their own products relative to the rest of the eurozone by about 30 % , compared to the beginning of the crisis . 
Italy probably needs to reduce its relative prices by 10-15 % . 
But Portugal and Italy have so far failed to deliver any such &quot; real depreciation , &quot; while relative prices in Greece and Spain have fallen by only 8 % and 6 % , respectively . 
Revealingly , of all the crisis countries , only Ireland managed to turn the corner . 
The reason is obvious : its bubble already burst at the end of 2006 , before any rescue funds were available . 
Ireland was on its own , so it had no option but to implement massive austerity measures , reducing its product prices relative to other eurozone countries by 13 % from peak to trough . 
Today , Ireland &apos;s unemployment rate is falling dramatically , and its manufacturing sector is booming . 
In relative terms , Greece received most of Europe &apos;s bailout money and showed the largest increase in unemployment . 
The official loans granted to the country by the European Central Bank and the international community have increased more than sixfold during the past five years , from € 53 billion ( $ 58 billion ) in February 2010 to € 324 billion , or 181 % of GDP , now . 
Nevertheless , the unemployment rate has more than doubled , from 11 % to 26 % . 
There are four possible economic and policy responses to this state of affairs . 
First , Europe could become a transfer union , with the north giving more and more credit to the south and later waiving it . 
Second , the south can deflate . 
Third , the north can inflate . 
And , fourth , countries that are no longer competitive can exit Europe &apos;s monetary union and depreciate their new currency . 
Each path is associated with serious complications . 
The first creates a permanent dependence on transfers , which , by sustaining relative prices , prevents the economy from regaining competitiveness . 
The second path drives many debtors in crisis countries into bankruptcy . 
The third expropriates the creditor countries of the north . 
And the fourth may cause contagion effects via capital markets , possibly forcing policymakers to introduce capital controls , as in Cyprus in 2013 . 
European politics has focused so far on providing public credit to the crisis countries at near-zero interest rates , which eventually may morph into transfers . 
But now the ECB is attempting to break the impasse through quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
The ECB &apos;s stated goal is to reflate the eurozone , thereby reducing the euro &apos;s external value , by purchasing more than € 1.1 trillion worth of assets . 
According to ECB President Mario Draghi , the inflation rate , which currently stands at just below 0 % , is to be raised to an average of just below 2 % . 
This would offer southern European countries a way out of their competitiveness trap , because if prices remained unchanged in the south , while the northern countries inflated , the southern countries could gradually reduce their goods &quot; relative prices without feeling too much pain . 
Of course , in that case the north needs to inflate faster than by just 2 % . 
If , say , southern Europe kept its inflation rate at 0 % and France inflated at a rate of 1 % , Germany would have to inflate by a good 4 % , and the rest of the eurozone at 2 % annually , to reach a eurozone average of slightly less than 2 % . 
This pattern would have to continue for about ten years to bring the eurozone back into balance . 
At that point , Germany &apos;s price level would be about 50 % higher than it is today . 
I do expect QE to bring about some inflation . 
Given that an exchange rate is the relative price of a currency , as more euros come into circulation , their value has to fall substantially to establish a new equilibrium in the currency market . 
Experience with similar programs in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Japan has shown that QE unleashes powerful forces of depreciation . 
QE in the eurozone will thus bring about the inflation that Draghi wants via higher import and export prices . 
Whether this effect will be sufficient to revitalize southern Europe remains to be seen . 
There is a risk that Japan , China , and the US will not sit on their hands while the euro loses value , with the world possibly even sliding into a currency war . 
Moreover , the southern EU countries , instead of leaving prices unchanged , could abandon austerity and issue an ever greater volume of new bonds to stimulate the economy . 
Competitiveness gains and rebalancing would fail to materialize , and , after an initial flash in the pan , the eurozone would return to permanent crisis . 
The euro , finally and fully discredited , would then meet a very messy end . 
One can only hope that this scenario does not come to pass , and that the southern countries stay the course of austerity . 
This is their last chance .
