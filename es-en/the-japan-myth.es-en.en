The Japan Myth 
BRUSSELS - The first decade of this century started with the so-called dot-com bubble . When it burst , central banks moved aggressively to ease monetary policy in order to prevent a prolonged period of Japanese-style slow growth . 
But the prolonged period of low interest rates that followed the 2001 recession instead contributed to the emergence of another bubble , this time in real estate and credit . 
With the collapse of the second bubble in a decade , central banks again acted quickly , lowering rates to zero ( or close to it ) almost everywhere . 
Recently , the United States Federal Reserve has even engaged in an unprecedented round of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; in an effort to accelerate the recovery . 
Again , the key argument was the need to avoid a repeat of Japan &apos;s &quot; lost decade . &quot; 
Policymaking is often dominated by simple &quot; lessons learned &quot; from economic history . 
But the lesson learned from the case of Japan is largely a myth . 
The basis for the scare story about Japan is that its GDP has grown over the last decade at an average annual rate of only 0.6 % compared to 1.7 % for the US . 
The difference is actually much smaller than often assumed , but at first sight a growth rate of 0.6 % qualifies as a lost decade . 
According to that standard , one could argue that a good part of Europe also &quot; lost &quot; the last decade , since Germany achieved about the same growth rates as Japan ( 0.6 % ) and Italy did even worse ( 0.2 % ) ; only France and Spain performed somewhat better . 
But this picture of stagnation in many countries is misleading , because it leaves out an important factor , namely demography . 
How should one compare growth records among a group of similar , developed countries ? 
The best measure is not overall GDP growth , but the growth of income per head of the working-age population ( not per capita ) . 
This last element is important because only the working-age population represents an economy &apos;s productive potential . 
If two countries achieve the same growth in average WAP income , one should conclude that both have been equally efficient in using their potential , even if their overall GDP growth rates differ . 
When one looks at GDP / WAP ( defined as population aged 20-60 ) , one gets a surprising result : Japan has actually done better than the US or most European countries over the last decade . 
The reason is simple : Japan &apos;s overall growth rates have been quite low , but growth was achieved despite a rapidly shrinking working-age population . 
The difference between Japan and the US is instructive here : in terms of overall GDP growth , it was about one percentage point , but larger in terms of the annual WAP growth rates - more than 1.5 percentage points , given that the US working-age population grew by 0.8 % , whereas Japan &apos;s has been shrinking at about the same rate . 
Another indication that Japan has fully used its potential is that the unemployment rate has been constant over the last decade . 
By contrast , the US unemployment rate has almost doubled , now approaching 10 % . 
One might thus conclude that the US should take Japan as an example not of stagnation , but of how to squeeze maximum growth from limited potential . 
Demographic differences are relevant not just in comparing Japan and the US , but also in explaining most of the differences in longer-term growth rates across developed economies . 
A good rule of thumb for the average growth rates of the G-7 countries would be to attribute about one percentage point in productivity gains to the growth rate of the working-age population . 
The US has done slightly worse than suggested by this rough measure ; 
Looking to the decade ahead , this analysis suggests that one can predict the rich countries &quot; relative growth rates based on the growth pattern of their working-age populations , which one already knows today , given that anybody starting to work over the next two decades has already been born . 
On this basis , Japan &apos;s relative decline as a major economic power will continue , as its working-age population will continue to shrink by about 1 % per year . 
Germany and Italy increasingly show Japanese patterns of decline in their working-age populations , and are thus likely to grow very little as well . 
In the case of Germany , one observes an interesting kink in its demography : from 2005-2015 , the working-age population is temporarily stabilized . 
But this will be followed by accelerating decline , as the working age population declines even faster than in Japan . 
The current strength of the German economy is also partly due to this temporary demographic stabilization . 
But a Japanese-style scenario seems inevitable after 2015 . 
By contrast , the US , the United Kingdom , and France are likely to grow faster for the simple reason that their working-age populations are continuing to grow , even if at a relatively slow pace . 
Two lessons emerge from this consideration of the influence of demographic factors on economic growth . 
First , the idea of a Japanese-style &quot; lost decade &quot; is misleading - even when applied to Japan . 
Slow growth in Japan over the last decade was due not to insufficiently aggressive macroeconomic policies , but to an unfavorable demographic trend . 
Second , a further slowdown in rich countries &quot; growth rates appears inevitable , given that even in the more dynamic countries the growth rates of the working-age population is declining . 
In the less dynamic ones , like Japan , Germany , and Italy , near-stagnation seems inevitable .
