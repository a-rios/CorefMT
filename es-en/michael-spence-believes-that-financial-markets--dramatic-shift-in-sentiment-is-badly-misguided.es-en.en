Overshooting in Emerging Markets 
MILAN - Until relatively recently , countries &quot; so-called middle-income transitions were largely ignored - in part because what was supposed to be a transition often became a trap . 
A few economies in Asia - particularly Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan - sailed through to high-income status with relatively high growth rates . 
But the vast majority of economies slowed down or stopped growing altogether in per capita terms after entering the middle-income range . 
Today , investors , policymakers , and businesses have several reasons to devote much more attention to these transitions . 
For starters , with a GDP that is as large as the combined total of the other BRICS countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , and South Africa ) plus Indonesia and Mexico , China has raised the stakes considerably . 
Sustained Chinese growth , or its absence , will have a significant effect on all other developing countries - and on the advanced economies as well . 
Second , the developed economies are out of balance and growing well below potential , with varying but limited prospects for faster growth on a five-year time horizon . 
By contrast , emerging economies , with their higher growth potential , increasingly represent large potential markets to tap . 
Third , a majority of the large emerging economies ( Indonesia , Brazil , Russia , Turkey , and Argentina , but not China ) unwisely relied on large inflows of abnormally cheap foreign capital , rather than domestic savings , to finance growth-sustaining investments . 
As a result , their current-account balances deteriorated in the post-crisis period . 
Now , with the onset of monetary tightening in the advanced economies , the imported capital is leaving , in a slightly panicky mode , creating downward pressure on exchange rates and upward pressure on domestic prices . 
The adjustment now underway requires launching real reforms and replacing low-cost external capital with domestically financed investment . 
Market uneasiness reflects uncertainty about the duration of the growth slowdown that is likely to result , the implications for credit quality and valuations , herd effects , and the negative returns from bucking the trend . 
Moreover , there is concern that an overshoot in capital outflows could produce the kind of self-reinforcing damage to stability and growth from which it is more difficult to recover . 
These large emerging economies received an apparently free pass to growth : an ability to invest without pursuing arduous reform or sacrificing current consumption . 
But it is easier to take the detour than it is to return to the main road . 
But this narrative is largely irrelevant to China , where excess savings and capital controls still limit direct exposure to monetary-policy externalities spilling over from advanced countries . 
China is not risk-free ; its risks are just different . 
Even so , amid growing concerns about emerging economies &quot; prospects , China is attracting attention because of its scale and central position in the structure of global trade ( and , increasingly , global finance ) . 
As a result , risk assessment in China focuses on the magnitude of the structural transformation , resistance from powerful domestic interests , and domestic financial distortions . 
In particular , there is considerable uncertainty about the Chinese version of shadow banking , which has grown in large part to circumvent the restrictions embedded in the state-dominated official system . 
Shadow banking has given savers / investors access to a larger menu of financial options , while small and medium-size enterprises - which play an increasingly important role in generating growth and employment - have gained broader access to capital . 
The Chinese authorities need to address two issues . 
The first , establishing regulatory oversight , will be easier to resolve than the second : the potential for excessive risk-taking as a result of the implicit government guarantees that back state-owned banks &quot; balance sheets . 
The authorities need to remove the perceived guarantee without triggering a liquidity crisis should they let some bank or off-balance-sheet trust fail . 
The list of other challenges facing China is long . 
Thoughtful analysts like Yu Yongding worry that the difficulties of managing imbalances , leverage , and related risks - or , worse , a policy mistake - will distract policymakers from these fundamental reforms , all of which are needed to shift to a new , sustainable growth pattern . 
Little wonder that financial markets are feeling slightly overwhelmed . 
But the swing is excessive . 
Not all advanced-economy investors who were chasing yield have deep knowledge of developing-country growth dynamics . 
As a result , the trend reversal will almost surely overshoot , creating investment opportunities that were missing in the previous environment , in which asset prices and exchange rates were strongly influenced by external conditions , not domestic fundamentals . 
The major emerging economies are adjusting structurally to this new environment . 
They do not need external financing to grow . 
In fact , since World War II , no developing economy has sustained rapid growth while running persistent current-account deficits . 
The high levels of investment required to sustain rapid growth have been largely domestically financed . 
China &apos;s challenges are idiosyncratic and different from those of other emerging economies . 
The structural transformation required is large , and the imbalances are real . 
The most likely scenario is that most major emerging markets , including China , will experience a transitional growth slowdown but will not be derailed by shifts in monetary policy in the West , with high growth rates returning in the course of the coming year . 
There are internal and external downside risks in each country that cannot and should not be dismissed , and volatility in international capital flows is complicating the adjustment . 
The problem today is that the downside risks are becoming the consensus forecast . 
That seems to me to be misguided - and a poor basis for investment and policy decisions .
