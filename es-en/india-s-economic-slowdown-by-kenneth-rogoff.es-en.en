What &apos;s Troubling India ? 
CAMBRIDGE - India &apos;s recent fall from macroeconomic grace is a lamentable turn of events . 
After many years of outperformance , GDP growth has slowed sharply . 
Annual output will most likely rise by less than 5 % this year , down from 6.8 % in 2011 and 10.1 % in 2010 . 
Reform has stalled amid profound political paralysis . 
All of the major emerging economies face weakening external demand , but India &apos;s slowdown has been exacerbated by a drop in investment that reflects a deeper loss of official direction and business confidence . 
Even the International Monetary Fund &apos;s forecast of a modest improvement in 2013 is predicated on the government &apos;s ability to breathe life into a spate of stalled economic reforms . 
India &apos;s recent torpor has underpinned a remarkable shift in global opinion . 
Just a couple of years ago , India was developing a reputation as the cool place to invest . 
Heads of state tripped over one another to meet business leaders in Mumbai , hoping to pave the way for a significant expansion of trade and investment . 
Now their interest has faded , along with the macroeconomic numbers . 
And yet changes currently afoot might just turn things around . 
India &apos;s octogenarian prime minister , Manmohan Singh , has recently awakened to the desperate need for renewed momentum . 
Economists around the world have taken note of the arrival of Raghuram Rajan as chief economist in the finance ministry . 
Rajan is a superstar academic researcher , a brilliant writer on political economy , and a former chief economist for the IMF . 
But it is far from obvious that Sonia Gandhi , President of the Indian National Congress and the country &apos;s most powerful politician , shares Singh &apos;s reform agenda . 
True , the cabinet is being reshuffled to elevate younger ministers . 
But the process points to a continuation of the tradition whereby most ministers are appointed on the basis of their loyalty to the Gandhi family rather than their merit and accomplishments . 
Unfortunately , for a country as poor as India , only sustained rapid growth can lead to enduring development gains . 
India &apos;s poverty rate ( an indicator that is admittedly both conceptually and practically difficult to measure ) fell by half between 1981 and 2010 , to just under 30 % - a remarkable achievement . 
But faster-growing East Asia has experienced significantly greater progress , with the poverty rate falling from 77 % to 14 % over the same period . 
Why has India &apos;s growth acceleration fizzled ? 
For many years , India benefited from the long-lasting impact of economic liberalization in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
Back then , Singh , as finance minister , played a central role . 
He could count on the IMF - which had real policy leverage , owing to India &apos;s need for a bailout program in 1991 - to provide external support to counter the huge internal obstacles to reform . 
Today , however , there is no external counterweight to the domestic political pressure that is stalling further liberalization . 
True , India &apos;s government must now consider growing threats to the country &apos;s investment-grade credit rating . 
The major ratings agencies are increasingly complaining about the country &apos;s lack of a growth strategy and its outsize budget deficits . 
But the impact has been limited , owing to the authorities &quot; ability to stuff debt down the throats of captive local banks , insurance companies , and pension funds . 
Indeed , this &quot; financial repression &quot; tax on domestic savers remains a huge opaque source of funding for India &apos;s debt-ridden government . 
It also prevents funds from being channeled to private-sector investment projects with far higher rates of return than the government can offer . 
The good news is that , from an economic perspective , there is still plenty of low-hanging fruit for restoring growth . 
Although India is right to avoid taking financial liberalization to the extreme that the United States did in the decades before the recent meltdown , it can do quite a lot without assuming inappropriate risks , as a commission headed by Rajan detailed a few years back . 
The retail sector is a huge source of inefficiency that effectively places a massive tax on India &apos;s poor by driving up prices . 
Instead of suing foreign retailers like Wal-Mart , India should be finding ways to emulate and benefit from their hyper-efficient methods . 
Infrastructure is slowly improving , but roads , ports , water access , and the electricity grid are still horrific across large parts of the country . 
Of course , India &apos;s democratic government cannot simply bulldoze through people and the environment to create infrastructure . 
But the obstacles also include layers of corrupt bureaucrats and politicians - a vast network of resistance to reform . 
Some argue that central-government paralysis is inevitable in a democracy of 1.2 billion people , and that the only way to re-energize India is to establish a looser confederation of its constituent states . 
Devolution would unshackle the economically more successful states . 
And , by combating the culture of aid dependency in economically weaker states , India &apos;s poorer regions might benefit in the long run as well . 
As dysfunctional as a decentralized Europe seems to be these days , India might benefit from moving a few steps in that direction , even as Europe itself struggles to become more centralized . 
Devolution might sound unrealistic , but once upon a time so did the European Union . 
If Singh &apos;s new reform agenda is again blocked , perhaps it will be time for a more radical assessment .
