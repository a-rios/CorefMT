Free-Trade Blinders 
CAMBRIDGE - I was recently invited by two Harvard colleagues to make a guest appearance in their course on globalization . 
&quot; I have to tell you , &quot; one of them warned me beforehand , &quot; this is a pretty pro-globalization crowd . &quot; 
In the very first meeting , he had asked the students how many of them preferred free trade to import restrictions ; the response was more than 90 % . 
And this was before the students had been instructed in the wonders of comparative advantage ! 
We know that when the same question is asked in real surveys with representative samples - not just Harvard students - the outcome is quite different . 
In the United States , respondents favor trade restrictions by a two-to-one margin . 
But the Harvard students &quot; response was not entirely surprising . 
Highly skilled and better-educated respondents tend to be considerably more pro-free trade than blue-collar workers are . 
Perhaps the Harvard students were simply voting with their own ( future ) wallets in mind . 
Or maybe they did not understand how trade really works . 
After all , when I met with them , I posed the same question in a different guise , emphasizing the likely distributional effects of trade . 
This time , the free-trade consensus evaporated - even more rapidly than I had anticipated . 
I began the class by asking students whether they would approve of my carrying out a particular magic experiment . 
I picked two volunteers , Nicholas and John , and told them that I was capable of making $ 200 disappear from Nicholas &apos;s bank account - poof ! - while adding $ 300 to John &apos;s.amp # 160 ; 
This feat of social engineering would leave the class as a whole better off by $ 100 . 
Would they allow me to carry out this magic trick ? 
Those who voted affirmatively were only a tiny minority . 
Many were uncertain . 
Clearly the students were uncomfortable about condoning a significant redistribution of income , even if the economic pie grew as a result . 
How is it possible , I asked , that almost all of them had instinctively favored free trade , which entails a similar - in fact , most likely greater - redistribution from losers to winners ? 
They appeared taken aback . 
Let &apos;s assume , I said next , that Nicholas and John own two small firms that compete with each other . 
Suppose that John got richer by $ 300 because he worked harder , saved and invested more , and created better products , driving Nicholas out of business and causing him a loss of $ 200 . 
How many of the students now approved of the change ? 
This time a vast majority did - in fact , everyone except Nicholas approved ! 
I posed other hypotheticals , now directly related to international trade . 
Suppose John had driven Nicholas out of business by importing higher-quality inputs from Germany ? 
By outsourcing to China , where labor rights are not well protected ? 
By hiring child workers in Indonesia ? 
Support for the proposed change dropped with each one of these alternatives . 
But what about technological innovation , which , like trade , often leaves some people worse off . 
Here , few students would condone blocking technological progress . 
Banning the light bulb because candle makers would lose their jobs strikes almost everyone as a silly idea . 
So the students were not necessarily against redistribution . 
They were against certain kinds of redistribution . 
Like most of us , they care about procedural fairness . 
To pass judgment on redistributive outcomes , we need to know about the circumstances that cause them . 
We do not begrudge Bill Gates or Warren Buffett their billions , even if some of their rivals have suffered along the way , presumably because they and their competitors operate according to the same ground rules and face pretty much the same opportunities and obstacles . 
We would think differently if Gates and Buffett had enriched themselves not through perspiration and inspiration , but by cheating , breaking labor laws , ravaging the environment , or taking advantage of government subsidies abroad . 
If we do not condone redistribution that violates widely shared moral codes at home , why should we accept it just because it involves transactions across political borders ? 
Similarly , when we expect redistributive effects to even out in the long run , so that everyone eventually comes out ahead , we are more likely to overlook reshufflings of income . 
That is a key reason why we believe that technological progress should run its course , despite its short-run destructive effects on some . 
When , on the other hand , the forces of trade repeatedly hit the same people - less educated , blue-collar workers - we may feel less sanguine about globalization . 
Too many economists are tone-deaf to such distinctions . 
They are prone to attribute concerns about globalization to crass protectionist motives or ignorance , even when there are genuine ethical issues at stake . 
By ignoring the fact that international trade sometimes - certainly not always - involves redistributive outcomes that we would consider problematic at home , they fail to engage the public debate properly . 
They also miss the opportunity to mount a more robust defense of trade when ethical concerns are less warranted . 
While globalization occasionally raises difficult questions about the legitimacy of its redistributive effects , we should not respond automatically by restricting trade . 
There are many difficult trade-offs to consider , including the consequences for others around the world who may be made significantly poorer than those hurt at home . 
But democracies owe themselves a proper debate , so that they make such choices consciously and deliberately . 
Fetishizing globalization simply because it expands the economic pie is the surest way to delegitimize it in the long run .
