The EU &apos;s Rules to Default By 
BRUSSELS - Greece &apos;s ballooning public debt is again throwing Europe &apos;s financial markets into turmoil . 
The answer is simple : the financial system &apos;s entire regulatory framework was built on the assumption that government debt is risk-free . 
Any sovereign default in Europe would shatter this cornerstone of financial regulation , and thus would have profound consequences . 
This is particularly visible in the banking sector . 
Internationally agreed rules stipulate that banks must create capital reserves commensurate to the risks that they take when they invest depositors &quot; savings . 
After all , a government can always pay in its own currency . 
This assumption makes sense , however , only when a government issues debt in its own currency ; only then can it order its central bank to print enough money to pay its creditors . 
Before the introduction of the euro , this was the case in all advanced countries . 
But the countries that adopted the euro can no longer rely on the printing press . 
They are , instead , effectively borrowing in a &quot; foreign &quot; currency ( or , rather , a currency that they cannot individually control ) . 
It should thus have been clear that with the start of European Monetary Union ( EMU ) , participating countries &quot; public debt should no longer have been considered risk-free . 
But it was . 
Indeed , eurozone regulators not only maintained the assumption that the public debt of a bank &apos;s own country was risk-free , but chose to extend it to all eurozone countries , implying that banks did not have to provide additional capital against their holdings of any eurozone public debt . 
This is the key reason why one-third of all public debt in the European Union is held by banks . 
Moreover , given the prevailing assumption that public debt was risk-free , banks were not bound by the usual rules against &quot; large exposures &quot; : they could accumulate as much exposure to any one government as they wanted . 
That is why Greek banks could end up holding more government debt than they have capital . 
A government default would thus wipe out the entire Greek banking system . 
It is now too late to turn back the clock and suddenly force banks to get rid of their excessive holdings of public debt . 
Unfortunately , regulators do not even appear to be learning from the current crisis in order to prevent the next one . 
The EU &apos;s rules on how much capital banks must hold are about to be revised . 
The rules , which are detailed in a 500-page legal proposal , called &quot; CRDIV &quot; and published recently by the European Commission , will increase the amount of capital banks must hold , but only for lending to the private sector . 
Lending to eurozone governments continues to have a zero risk weight . 
This is a mistake . 
The European Commission should have introduced capital requirements on banks &quot; holdings of public debt . 
The justification would be simple : no one can seriously claim that the bonds of all eurozone governments are without risk . 
It should thus be obvious that banks should hold some capital against the risks they assume when lending to governments with particularly high debts or large budget deficits . 
Moreover , the new rules will require banks to hold more liquid assets . 
It is easy to guess which assets the authorities consider liquid : public debt . 
In this way , too , banks will be induced to hold public debt rather than to finance private investment , despite the obvious fact that government bonds can become very illiquid ( for example , those issued by Greece , Ireland , and Portugal ) . 
The definition of what banks should hold for liquidity purposes should have been broadened beyond public debt to include a wide range of private-sector assets based on market size . 
Both key elements of the new banking rules thus go in the same direction : they increase the bias in bank financing against lending to the private sector . 
It is easy to understand why the authorities persist in favoring public debt : the rules are set by finance ministers , who are naturally inclined to give themselves a good deal . 
Lower financing costs for public debt appear to be a net gain to society , because the government then saves on debt service and can keep taxes lower . 
But any gains from lower taxes are more than offset by the losses to the private sector , which , facing higher financing costs , will invest less , in turn lowering economic growth - and thus reducing government revenues . 
But what is proposed now will make lending for investment even less attractive and increase the incentive to concentrate sovereign risk in the banking sector .
