Syriza &apos;s German Fixation ? 
ATHENS - The Greek people have spoken . 
In an historic referendum , they have decisively rejected the deal offered by their country &apos;s creditors . 
Within the ruling Syriza party , however , things are not quite so straightforward . 
Since coming to power in January , Syriza has struggled to balance the need to strike a deal on Greece &apos;s debt with its campaign promise not to sign any agreement that would thrust the country deeper into recession . 
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras &apos;s decision to urge the Greek electorate to vote &quot; No &quot; in the referendum on the latest offer by the country &apos;s creditors suggests that the latter has taken precedence . 
Unsurprisingly , the move was met with angry derision by other eurozone leaders . 
According to the Greek government , the current arrangement has not only transformed Greece into a debt colony ; it threatens the dignity of the Greek people . 
For Tsipras , national dignity is paramount , as exemplified in his visit , mere hours after being sworn in as Prime Minister in January , to a war memorial in Kaisariani , a district of Athens , where 200 Greek citizens were executed by the Nazi occupying forces in 1944 . 
Some observers interpreted the visit as a flippant attempt to needle Germany , which Syriza views as the driving force behind the bailout agreements . 
In fact , Tsipras &apos;s pilgrimage spoke to a long heritage of resistance within the movements making up his party - a heritage that could complicate any attempt he makes to strike a deal . 
Syriza - which comprises a variety of left-wing groups , from those on the far-left to the more moderate social democrats - has roots in the Greek Communist Party , which played an important role in resisting German occupation during World War II . 
Though centrist and right-wing resistance organizations also existed , they were incomparable to their communist-driven counterparts on the left , in terms of both size and influence . 
Left-wing forces proved their potency on March 5 , 1943 , when they paralyzed Athens with a massive strike . 
But , in the civil war that transpired in Greece after WWII between government forces and the Communist Party &apos;s military branch , the latter were crushed , and the party &apos;s members were labeled as traitors . 
This wholesale rejection of communism remained a core component of Greece &apos;s official ideology until the collapse of the country &apos;s military dictatorship in 1974 , when communist organizations again became legal . 
Even through that long period of persecution , Greece &apos;s far-left forces remained proud of their predecessors &quot; role in fighting the German-Italian-Bulgarian occupation , lauding their heroic efforts to save , even briefly , swathes of Greek territory from foreign exploitation . 
After 1974 , the communists staged several cultural events emphasizing this heroism , and small music clubs or boîtes often resounded with the songs of the 1940s left . 
Even today , Greek communists , including several Syriza cadres , portray themselves as the heirs of the left-wing struggle against the Nazi and fascist occupation . 
This is not to say that the organizations linked with Greece &apos;s communist left believe that all Germans harbor an inner Nazi . 
On the contrary , Greek left-wing groups , including Syriza , have rarely , if ever , succumbed to such anti-German sentiments ( at least officially ) . 
Rather , they seek to establish links with the &quot; other &quot; Germany , the one that &quot; expresses solidarity &quot; with the Greek people . 
Syriza , for its part , maintains close contact with Germany &apos;s Left Party ( die Linke ) . 
Formed in 2007 , the Left Party includes former members of the Communist Party that had ruled East Germany , as well as leftists who split from the Social Democratic Party . 
Syriza and the Left Party collaborate in the European Parliament , where both participate in the European United Left / Nordic Green Left group . 
And yet , anti-German discourse has not been completely eliminated . 
A poster of Giorgos Pantzas , a Syriza candidate in the 2012 parliamentary elections , proclaiming &quot; No to the Fourth Reich &quot; and &quot; we are not afraid of the bullets of the Germans &quot; helped him to get elected . 
Moreover , some Syriza members have likened German Christian Democrat politicians , especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , to Nazis . 
To be sure , this is not an official Syriza position . 
Tsipras , for example , was openly critical of a cartoon that portrayed Schäuble in Nazi uniform . 
This attitude implies a willingness to reach what Syriza calls a &quot; dignified compromise &quot; with its European partners . 
Striking such a deal will not be easy , though , as it will require Tsipras not only to overcome the resistance of radical Syriza members of parliament , but also the defiant stance of his country &apos;s creditors .
