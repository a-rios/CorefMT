China &apos;s Repressed SMEs 
BEIJING - Financial repression - government policies that create an environment of low or negative real interest rates , with the goal of generating cheap financing for public spending - has long been a key feature of Chinese economic policy . 
But , with funding costs for businesses trending up , this is finally starting to change . 
Early this year , the State Council , China &apos;s cabinet , made lowering funding costs for businesses , especially small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) , a top priority . 
For its part , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) has engaged in cautious monetary loosening , which includes freeing up more funds for lending by banks that allocate a certain proportion of their total loan portfolio to SMEs . 
The PBOC , through its &quot; pledged supplementary lending &quot; program , has also started lending directly to banks that have promised to use the funds for social housing construction . 
But , so far , efforts to lower funding costs have had a limited impact . 
Indeed , the weighted average interest rate on bank credit to nonfinancial enterprises remains close to 7 % , while economic growth has edged down from 7.4 % year on year in the last three months to 7.3 % in the current quarter . 
The situation may not be dire yet , but it is far from ideal - especially at a time when the Chinese authorities are pursuing structural reform . 
If it loosens monetary policy further - by , say , cutting banks &quot; reserve requirement ratio - the momentum for restructuring could be lost ; and there is no guarantee that the additional liquidity would flow into the real sector . 
But if the PBOC refuses to budge , the combination of high interest rates and slow growth may send the economy into a tailspin . 
In fact , the PBOC has little choice but to engage in monetary-policy loosening . 
The first factor driving up funding costs is the outsize profitability of China &apos;s commercial banks - more than 23 % , on average , for the top five last year - which account for some 35 % of total profits earned by the 500 largest Chinese companies . 
Indeed , the average for banks is nearly four times that for Chinese companies as a whole , for which the average profit is just over 6 % . 
Moreover , slowing economic growth , tighter prudential regulation , and increased liability have made banks much more risk-averse , driving them to demand a significantly higher risk premium from borrowers , who must now not only provide collateral , but also find third parties to guarantee the loans . 
In many cases , banks are requiring a second group of guarantors to guarantee the first group . 
This growing aversion to risk makes it particularly difficult for SMEs to borrow from commercial banks , forcing them to turn to the under-regulated shadow banking sector . 
Meanwhile , real-estate developers and local government financing vehicles ( LGFVs ) , which offer banks a false sense of security and guarantee of profitability , have acquired a major share of financial resources . 
And financial institutions , especially banks , have been using a substantial portion of their funds for financial arbitrage . 
By reducing the amount of funding available to regular firms , especially SMEs , such activities drive up the average interest rate on loans . 
Interest-rate liberalization is exacerbating the situation . 
China has already removed all controls on interest rates on loans . 
And , though it continues to guide interest rates on deposits , banks can easily evade these regulations by selling depositors off-balance-sheet wealth-management products , on which returns are not capped . 
Increases in the cost of funds &quot; sources increase the costs of the funds &quot; uses - that is , credit to enterprises . 
Finally , Chinese banks &quot; activities are impeded by outdated and unnecessary regulations , including limits on how much credit they can extend in a year and a 75 % cap on the loan-to-deposit ratio . 
In order to evade such controls , banks are moving a larger share of their lending activities off of their balance sheets . 
In fact , the rising cost of intermediation - largely a result of the distortions in China &apos;s financial system - is among the most important factors driving the rise in borrowing costs for Chinese businesses . 
That is why further monetary loosening by the PBOC , though necessary to address faltering growth , will not be enough . 
In order to lower funding costs to a reasonable level , without undermining China &apos;s economic-restructuring effort , monetary policy must be combined with well-designed and concerted financial reform . 
Only then can Chinese SMEs finally gain access to the funding they need to thrive .
