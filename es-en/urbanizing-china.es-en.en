Urbanizing China 
BEIJING - Measured by the percentage of people living in its cities , China &apos;s urbanization rate currently stands at about 48 % , according to official statistics . 
Given that the share of city dwellers was only 18 % just 30 years ago , this is remarkable progress . 
But it is still unsatisfactory , because most other countries at a similar stage of development experienced faster urbanization than industrialization . 
China &apos;s urbanization has lagged behind its industrialization , which now is around 70 % when measured by the percentage of the labor force whose income is derived mainly from non-farm activities . 
Another striking difference between China and some other developing countries is that Chinese cities , large and small , lack any sign of significant urban poverty or slums . 
People often attribute this to China &apos;s hukou , or household registration system , which separates the urban privileged and the rural poor from the start of their lives . 
But , although the hukou system may prevent rural people from enjoying some urban benefits and public services , such as public education , health care , or employment insurance , it has never kept rural laborers from moving into cities . 
Indeed , China &apos;s government has actually been encouraging rural laborers to move to cities to find better jobs . 
That is why more than 40 % of China &apos;s labor force , some 300 million people , has shifted over the past 30 years from agriculture to industrial and service sectors , which are now increasingly concentrated in cities . 
As a result , migrant workers with a rural hukou now outnumber workers who hold an urban hukou on average in Chinese cities . 
So if it is not the hukou system that has prevented the growth of slums in China , what has ? 
I believe that the most important institution in preventing dire urban poverty is a unique land system for China &apos;s rural areas . 
China &apos;s entire reform process started with the adoption of the so-called &quot; rural household contract system , &quot; which leases productive land to farm households . 
This meant that collective production was dissolved early in the reform process and private farming prevailed . 
Though farm &quot; collectives &quot; have remained the owners of rural land , households may obtain all &quot; residuals &quot; of their production , which creates the necessary incentive to use land productively . 
They may even transfer the lease to other farm households if their members find better jobs in the cities . 
Households can keep this entitlement for the term of the lease ( now 30 years ) , but they do not have a property right in the land itself . 
If rural workers have financial difficulties , which in other countries often lead to land sales , they can work harder to find other jobs or seek government help . 
But land can never be sold or mortgaged , and its use cannot be changed from farming to other commercial purposes without government permission . 
This peculiar arrangement has generated an important result : if migrant workers lose their urban jobs , they retain some income from their land lease and can return to their village and reclaim the land ( normally within one year ) . 
The small piece of land allocated under the rural household contract system may not make farmers rich , but it serves as a social safety net of last resort . 
This goes a long way toward explaining why China &apos;s urbanization has lagged : the system of land tenure - which seems impossible to replicate in other developing countries - ensures that the reservoir of labor for industrialization and urbanization remains located in country villages , rather than in city slums . 
Although this arrangement provides a smoother path to urbanization , it is a transitional , not a permanent one . 
Migrant workers still feel unable truly to integrate into cities , because their social safety net remains anchored to their rural origins . 
Indeed , the segregation caused by the land system has enlarged rather than narrowed social disparities . 
Given these circumstances , and that Chinese are highly mobile , the country &apos;s urbanization is far from stable . 
To achieve &quot; permanent urbanization , &quot; China must develop a new safety net . 
Announcing the abolition of the hukou system might be easy , but it would mean little without institutions that can cushion the risks faced by rural migrant workers in China &apos;s cities . 
Making public services like education and the formal social safety net available to rural immigrants , even at a lower level due to limited public resources , is the key to success here . 
When that is achieved , rural immigrants will eagerly settle as permanent urban residents , and Chinese society will become more equal in terms of access to public services . 
China &apos;s new five-year plan for economic and social development , to be implemented starting in 2011 , may address the issue in a meaningful way , by aiming for the establishment of a national , universal , and portable social-security system . 
The plan may also require city governments to increase the provision of public goods - including education , health care , and a minimum level of income protection - to non-hukou regular residents . 
Some experiments in this regard have already taken place in cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu . 
Urbanization in China may take generations to complete . 
But , after long debate and hesitation , it is clear that policymakers seem ready to move into the next phase of urbanization by adopting new approaches . 
The main challenge is not infrastructure and urban facilities , however important they are . 
Rather the key to success will be to make rural immigrants to Chinese cities equal citizens in terms of opportunities and public services . 
That may not be achievable overnight . 
But , step-by-step , it can and must be done .
