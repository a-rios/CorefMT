Free Speech , Muhammad , and the Holocaust 
The timing of Austria &apos;s conviction and imprisonment of David Irving for denying the Holocaust could not have been worse . 
Coming after the deaths of at least 30 people in Syria , Lebanon , Afghanistan , Libya , Nigeria , and other Islamic countries during protests against cartoons ridiculing Muhammad , the Irving verdict makes a mockery of the claim that in democratic countries , freedom of expression is a basic right . 
We cannot consistently hold that cartoonists have a right to mock religious figures but that it should be a criminal offense to deny the existence of the Holocaust . 
I believe that we should stand behind freedom of speech . 
And that means that David Irving should be freed . 
Before you accuse me of failing to understand the sensitivities of victims of the Holocaust , or the nature of Austrian anti-Semitism , I should say that I am the son of Austrian Jews . 
My parents escaped Austria in time , but my grandparents did not . 
All four of my grandparents were deported to ghettos in Poland and Czechoslovakia . 
Two of them were sent to Lodz , in Poland , and then probably murdered with carbon monoxide at the extermination camp at Chelmno . 
One fell ill and died in the overcrowded and underfed ghetto at Theresienstadt . 
My maternal grandmother was the only survivor . 
So I have no sympathy for David Irving &apos;s absurd denial of the Holocaust - which he now claims was a mistake . 
I support efforts to prevent any return to Nazism in Austria or anywhere else . 
But how is the cause of truth served by prohibiting Holocaust denial ? 
If there are still people crazy enough to deny that the Holocaust occurred , will they be persuaded by imprisoning people who express that view ? 
On the contrary , they will be more likely to think that people are being imprisoned for expressing views cannot be refuted by evidence and argument alone . 
In his classic defense of freedom of speech in , On Liberty , John Stuart Mill wrote that if a view is not &quot; fully , frequently , and fearlessly discussed , &quot; it will become &quot; a dead dogma , not a living truth . &quot; 
The existence of the Holocaust should remain a living truth , and those who are skeptical about the enormity of the Nazi atrocities should be confronted with the evidence for it . 
In the aftermath of World War II , when the Austrian republic was struggling to establish itself as a democracy , it was reasonable , as a temporary emergency measure , for Austrian democrats to suppress Nazi ideas and propaganda . 
But that danger is long past . 
Austria is a democracy and a member of the European Union . 
Despite the occasional resurgence of anti-immigrant and even racist views - an occurrence that is , lamentably , not limited to countries with a fascist past âˆ’ there is no longer a serious threat of any return to Nazism in Austria . 
By contrast , freedom of speech is essential to democratic regimes , and it must include the freedom to say what everyone else believes to be false , and even what many people find offensive . 
We must be free to deny the existence of God , and to criticize the teachings of Jesus , Moses , Muhammad , and Buddha , as reported in texts that millions of people regard as sacred . 
Without that freedom , human progress will always run up against a basic roadblock . 
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms states : &quot; Everyone has the right to freedom of expression . 
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers . &quot; 
To be consistent with that clear statement - and without the vague qualifications of Article 11 , which threaten to render it meaningless - Austria should repeal its law against Holocaust denial . 
Other European nations with similar laws - for example , Germany , France , Italy , and Poland - should do the same , while maintaining or strengthening their efforts to inform their citizens about the reality of the Holocaust and why the racist ideology that led to it should be rejected . 
Laws against incitement to racial , religious , or ethnic hatred , in circumstances where that incitement is intended to - or can reasonably be foreseen to - lead to violence or other criminal acts , are different , and are compatible with maintaining freedom to express any views at all . 
Only when David Irving has been freed will it be possible for Europeans to turn to the Islamic protesters and say : &quot; We apply the principle of freedom of expression even-handedly , whether it offends Moslems , Christians , Jews , or anyone else . &quot;
