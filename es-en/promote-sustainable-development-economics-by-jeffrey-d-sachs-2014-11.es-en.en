Sustainable Development Economics 
PARIS - Two schools of thought tend to dominate today &apos;s economic debates . 
According to free-market economists , governments should cut taxes , reduce regulations , reform labor laws , and then get out of the way to let consumers consume and producers create jobs . 
According to Keynesian economics , governments should boost total demand through quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus . 
Yet neither approach is delivering good results . 
We need a new Sustainable Development Economics , with governments promoting new types of investments . 
Free-market economics leads to great outcomes for the rich , but pretty miserable outcomes for everyone else . 
Governments in the United States and parts of Europe are cutting back on social spending , job creation , infrastructure investment , and job training because the rich bosses who pay for politicians &quot; election campaigns are doing very well for themselves , even as the societies around them are crumbling . 
Yet Keynesian solutions - easy money and large budget deficits - have also fallen far short of their promised results . 
Many governments tried stimulus spending after the 2008 financial crisis . 
After all , most politicians love to spend money they don &apos;t have . 
Yet the short-term boost failed in two big ways . 
First , governments &quot; debt soared and their credit ratings plummeted . 
Even the US lost its AAA standing . 
Second , the private sector did not respond by increasing business investment and hiring enough new workers . 
Instead , companies hoarded vast cash reserves , mainly in tax-free offshore accounts . 
The problem with both free-market and Keynesian economics is that they misunderstand the nature of modern investment . 
Both schools believe that investment is led by the private sector , either because taxes and regulations are low ( in the free-market model ) or because aggregate demand is high ( in the Keynesian model ) . 
Yet private-sector investment today depends on investment by the public sector . 
Our age is defined by this complementarity . 
Unless the public sector invests , and invests wisely , the private sector will continue to hoard its funds or return them to shareholders in the forms of dividends or buybacks . 
The key is to reflect on six kinds of capital goods : business capital , infrastructure , human capital , intellectual capital , natural capital , and social capital . 
All of these are productive , but each has a distinctive role . 
Business capital includes private companies &quot; factories , machines , transport equipment , and information systems . 
Infrastructure includes roads , railways , power and water systems , fiber optics , pipelines , and airports and seaports . 
Human capital is the education , skills , and health of the workforce . 
Intellectual capital includes society &apos;s core scientific and technological know-how . 
Natural capital is the ecosystems and primary resources that support agriculture , health , and cities . 
These six forms of capital work in a complementary way . 
Business investment without infrastructure and human capital cannot be profitable . 
Nor can financial markets work if social capital ( trust ) is depleted . 
Without natural capital ( including a safe climate , productive soils , available water , and protection against flooding ) , the other kinds of capital are easily lost . 
Investment used to be a far simpler matter . 
The key to development was basic education , a network of roads and power , a functioning port , and access to world markets . 
Today , however , basic public education is no longer enough ; workers need highly specialized skills that come through vocational training , advanced degrees , and apprenticeship programs that combine public and private funding . 
Transport must be smarter than mere government road building ; power grids must reflect the urgent need for low-carbon electricity ; and governments everywhere must invest in new kinds of intellectual capital to solve unprecedented problems of public health , climate change , environmental degradation , information systems management , and more . 
Yet in most countries , governments are not leading , guiding , or even sharing in the investment process . 
They are cutting back . 
Free-market ideologues claim that governments are incapable of productive investment . 
Nor do Keynesians think through the kinds of public investments that are needed ; for them , spending is spending . 
The result is a public-sector vacuum and a dearth of public investments , which in turn holds back necessary private-sector investment . 
Governments , in short , need long-term investment strategies and ways to pay for them . 
They need to understand much better how to prioritize road , rail , power , and port investments ; how to make investments environmentally sustainable by moving to a low-carbon energy system ; how to train young workers for decent jobs , not only low-wage service-sector employment ; and how to build social capital , in an age when there is little trust and considerable corruption . 
In short , governments need to learn to think ahead . 
This , too , runs counter to the economic mainstream . 
Free-market ideologues don &apos;t want governments to think at all ; and Keynesians want governments to think only about the short run , because they take to an extreme John Maynard Keynes &quot; famous quip , &quot; In the long run we are all dead . &quot; 
Here &apos;s a thought that is anathema in Washington , DC , but worthy of reflection . 
The world &apos;s fastest growing economy , China , relies on five-year plans for public investment , which is managed by the National Development and Reform Commission . 
The US has no such institution , or indeed any agency that looks systematically at public-investment strategies . 
The G-20 recently took a small step in the right direction , by placing new emphasis on increased infrastructure investment as a shared responsibility of both the public and private sectors . 
We need much more of this kind of thinking in the year ahead , as governments negotiate new global agreements on financing for sustainable development ( in Addis Ababa in July 2015 ) ; 
Sustainable Development Goals ( at the United Nations in September 2015 ) , and climate change ( in Paris in December 2015 ) . 
These agreements promise to shape humanity &apos;s future for the better . If they are to succeed , the new Age of Sustainable Development should give rise to a new Economics of Sustainable Development as well .
