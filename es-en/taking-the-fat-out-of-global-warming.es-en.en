Taking the Fat Out of Global Warming 
LONDON - Mitigating climate change presents unrivaled opportunities for improving human health and well being . 
Indeed , policies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions promise to bring about substantial reductions in heart disease , respiratory illness , cancer , obesity , diabetes , depression , and road deaths and injuries . 
These health benefits arise because climate policy necessarily affects two of the most important determinants of human health : nutrition and movement . 
Although medical professionals increasingly recognize the health benefits of policies to address climate change , they are not widely appreciated by policymakers themselves . 
The existence of these health benefits implies a dramatic reduction in the net cost of taking strong action to mitigate climate change - which means that failure to understand their importance could have serious environmental consequences . 
Recent research has documented the multiple health benefits of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Meeting emissions targets in the transport sector would require , alongside reductions in car use , modest increases in walking and cycling . 
Based on the epidemiological evidence linking physical activity and health , the resulting increase in physical activity would dramatically reduce rates of chronic disease , with around 10-20 % less heart disease and stroke , 12-18 % less breast cancer , and 8 % less dementia . 
Sustainable transport would also improve our mental health , with an estimated 6 % less depression . 
There would be additional mental-health benefits from more green spaces , less noise pollution , and greater physical fitness . 
Reducing livestock production in order to limit cattle-related methane emissions and deforestation - significant factors contributing to climate change - would also improve human health . 
Fewer livestock would mean fewer animal products in our diet , which would reduce our consumption of harmful saturated fats , leading to a 30 % decline in heart disease . 
Reducing meat consumption should reduce rates of colorectal cancer as well - the second most common type in men , after lung cancer . 
By improving diet and raising levels of physical activity , policies to mitigate climate change would result in a dramatic cut in rates of diseases that mean premature death and disability for hundreds of millions of people worldwide . 
They would also reduce population fatness . 
More than a billion adults are overweight and 300 million are obese , including more than one-third of the US population . 
And British government scientists predict that the United Kingdom will be &quot; a predominantly obese society &quot; by 2050 . 
Indeed , if current trends continue , by 2050 , nine in ten adults in many developed countries will be overweight or obese . 
In middle-income countries , too , average body mass index ( BMI ) is rising steadily . 
This will have a serious impact on health and well being , increasing the risk of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and cancer . 
But developing countries are also at risk . 
Mexico , for example , is second only to the US in terms of the prevalence of obesity . 
The increase in diabetes as a result of population fattening is causing an epidemic of chronic kidney disease in a country where only one in four can expect to receive treatment . 
The experience of Cuba in the 1990 &quot; s confirms the health effects of reducing fossil-fuel consumption . 
During the Cuban energy crisis that followed the cut-off of subsidized Soviet supplies , the proportion of adults who were physically active more than doubled . 
The population &apos;s average BMI fell by 1.5 units , with a halving in the prevalence of obesity , from 14 % to 7 % . 
Deaths from diabetes fell by 51 % , from heart disease by 35 % , and from stroke by 20 % . 
Moreover , there would be less hunger in a de-carbonized world . 
In April 2008 , Evo Morales , the president of poor and increasingly hungry Bolivia , pleaded for &quot; la vida primero , los autos segundos &quot; ( life first , cars second ) , exhorting the wealthy world to stop burning food every time they drive - a reference to Western governments &quot; policies on bio-fuels . 
But car use and food prices were linked long before bio-fuel policies . 
Car use drives up food prices , because oil is a key agricultural input . 
Reducing oil use in the transport sector is essential to preventing starvation in poor countries . 
Until agriculture unshackles itself from dependence on oil , gas tanks in rich countries and stomachs in poor countries will be competing to be filled . 
Eating fewer animal products would reduce food prices as well , because cattle are fed on grain . 
Other policies aimed at mitigating climate change also have positive effects on health . 
Insulating homes in high-income countries in order to save energy would prevent cold-related deaths . 
Likewise , use of fuel-efficient cooking stoves in poor countries would reduce the number of children -amp # 160 ; currently around one million per year - who die from respiratory infections caused or worsened by the burning of solid fuels . 
A de-carbonization program that cuts across all the major areas of energy use , combined with reduced consumption of animal products , would create substantial benefits for human health and welfare . 
As negotiators and policymakers debate the costs of mitigating climate change , they cannot afford to overlook these benefits &quot; immense value .
