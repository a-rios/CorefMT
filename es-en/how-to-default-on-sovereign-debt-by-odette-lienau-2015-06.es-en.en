How to Default on Sovereign Debt 
ITHACA - The financial brinkmanship over Greece &apos;s debts has raised the question of whether ( or when ) the country will default . 
To be sure , it would be far better for Greece and its creditors to reach a negotiated solution . 
But that outcome is far from guaranteed . 
The Greek government barely managed to make a significant payment last month , and even larger payments fall due throughout the summer , starting in June with an installment of more than â‚¬ 1.5 billion on its liabilities to the International Monetary Fund . 
As Greek officials consider their options , they would do well to bear in mind that there are better and worse ways to default on sovereign debt - especially given countries &quot; desire to reestablish their creditworthiness as soon as possible . 
In the coming weeks and months , the Greek government would be wise to consider three guidelines : 
Don &apos;t name-call : Default is painful , even if it does turn out to be the right choice in the long run . 
In the midst of all that pain , it is tempting to point fingers . 
But it is important to resist this urge . 
More likely than not , sovereign debtors will have to interact with the same creditors and international actors again . 
It is hard to know how much harm Argentina &apos;s undiplomatic pronouncements during its default saga did to its efforts at navigating the United States &quot; legal system ; what is clear is that its ill-considered official rhetoric did not help its case . 
In the Greek context , there has already been enough name-calling for several debt crises . 
Issuing a statement of regret at the inability to reach a negotiated solution , offering clear short- and long-term plans to manage the default , and outlining a compelling strategy for recovery and growth would be far preferable . 
Explain yourself : In the aftermath of a default , it may seem that no one is listening to even the most rational of explanations . 
Creditors will likely insist that the default was a terrible mistake and argue that recovery is impossible unless the decision is quickly reversed . 
Some commentators may actually wish an insubordinate country ill , if only to prove a point or teach would-be followers a lesson . 
But other actors , including potential future creditors , could be more open to persuasion . 
Creditworthiness is generally understood to depend on two things : willingness to pay and ability to pay . 
A default is a concrete demonstration of the limits of a state &apos;s willingness to pay , at least in the short term . 
And yet things are not necessarily so black and white . 
A country that is defaulting can emphasize that the rejection of a particular debt payment does not necessarily entail a rejection of the logic of debt payments as a whole . 
In the case of Greece , some investors and commentators may sympathize with the authorities &quot; contention that austerity measures have only hampered its recovery . 
They may accept that a default could be part of a policy package designed to improve the country &apos;s economic fundamentals and thus its capacity to repay its debt in the long term . 
Repay some debt : It sounds counterintuitive , but countries in default should consider paying some of their debts - on their own terms and on a graduated basis - as a way to rebuild creditworthiness . 
If the explanation for a default includes an assertion that payments should be tied to economic recovery , then it can make sense to specify the conditions for resuming payments - and follow through when the conditions are met . 
To be sure , this could weaken a debtor &apos;s leverage - the promise of future repayment - in bringing creditors back to the negotiating table . 
But it would also demonstrate to old and potential new creditors alike not only a capacity , but also a willingness , to make payments , thereby creating incentives for external actors to support economic recovery . 
Even after the Soviet Union &apos;s repudiation of czarist Russia &apos;s debts - perhaps the twentieth century &apos;s most notorious ( and most misunderstood ) debt default - certain creditors expressed interest in lending to the new regime , in part because Soviet agencies repaid debt that they considered legitimate . 
More recently , Ecuador continued payments on the small portion of debt that it considered acceptable after defaulting on its international debts in 2008 ( under circumstances far less extreme than Greece &apos;s ) . 
This repayment contributed to a slow improvement in its credit rating and its eventual return to international capital markets in 2014 . 
Even if Greece reaches an agreement in time to make the first IMF installment due in early June , it may not have enough to cover the even larger payments required of it through the rest of the summer . 
Chances are that the Greek government and its creditors will be back at the negotiating table again . 
A unilateral default , one hopes , will not be necessary . 
But if Greece does take that route , it should seek to make its path as smooth as possible .
