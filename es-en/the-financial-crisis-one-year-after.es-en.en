The Financial Crisis One Year After 
NEW YORK - It is now almost a year since the world economy teetered on the edge of calamity . 
In the span of three days , September 15-17 , 2008 , Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy , the mega-insurance company AIG was taken over by the United States government , and the failing Wall Street icon Merrill Lynch was absorbed by Bank of America in a deal brokered and financed by the US government . 
Non-financial companies could not get working capital , much less funding for long-term investments . 
A depression seemed possible . 
Today , the storm has broken . 
Months of emergency action by the world &apos;s leading central banks prevented financial markets from crashing . 
When banks stopped providing short-term liquidity to other banks and industrial companies , central banks filled the gap . 
As a result , the major economies avoided a collapse of credit and production . 
The sense of panic has subsided . 
Banks are once again lending to each other . 
Although the worst was avoided , much pain remains . 
The crisis culminated in a collapse of asset prices at the end of 2008 . 
Middle-class and wealthy households around the world felt poorer and therefore cut their spending sharply . 
Sky-high oil and food prices added to the pain , and thus to the downturn . 
Enterprises could not sell their output , leading to production cuts and layoffs . 
Rising unemployment compounded the loss of household wealth , throwing families into deep economic peril and leading to further cutbacks in consumer spending . 
The big problem now is that unemployment continues to rise in the US and Europe , because growth is too slow to create enough new jobs . 
Dislocations are still being felt around the world . 
A huge debate has ensued around the so-called &quot; stimulus spending &quot; in the US , Europe , and China . 
Stimulus spending aims to use higher government outlays or tax incentives to offset the decline in household consumption and business investment . 
In the US , for example , roughly one-third of the $ 800-billion two-year stimulus package comprises tax cuts ( to stimulate consumer spending ) ; one-third is public outlays on roads , schools , power , and other infrastructure ; and one-third takes the forms of federal transfers to state and local governments for health care , unemployment insurance , school salaries , and the like . 
Stimulus packages are controversial , because they increase budget deficits , and thus imply the need to cut spending or raise taxes sometime in the near future . 
The question is whether they successfully boost output and jobs in the short term , and , if so , whether they do enough to compensate for the inevitable budget problems down the road . 
The true effectiveness of these packages is not clear . 
Suppose that the government gives a tax cut in order to increase consumers &quot; take-home pay . 
If consumers expect that their taxes will rise in the future , they may decide to save the tax cut rather than boost consumption . 
In that case , the stimulus will have little positive effect on household spending , but will worsen the budget deficit . 
An early assessment of the stimulus packages suggests that China &apos;s program has worked well . 
The sharp fall in China &apos;s exports to the US has been compensated by a sharp rise in the Chinese government &apos;s spending on infrastructure - say , on subway construction in China &apos;s biggest cities . 
In the US , the verdict is less clear . 
The tax cut has probably been saved rather than spent . 
The infrastructure component has not yet been spent because of long lags in turning the US stimulus package into real construction projects . 
The third part - the transfer to state and local governments - almost surely has been successful in maintaining spending on schools , health , and the unemployed . 
In short , the US stimulus effects on spending have probably been positive but small , and without a decisive effect on the economy . 
Moreover , concerns about the enormous US budget deficit , now running at $ 1.8 trillion ( 12 % of GNP ) per year , are bound to increase , not only creating enormous uncertainties in politics and financial markets , but also dimming consumer confidence as households focus their attention on potential future budget cuts and tax increases . 
The US has reached the practical limits of reliance on short-term stimulus spending , and will need to start cutting the budget deficit and fostering alternative pathways to growth . 
When the crisis deepened a year ago , Barack Obama introduced into the presidential campaign the theme of a &quot; green recovery , &quot; based on a surge of investment in renewable energies , new electric vehicles , environmentally efficient &quot; green &quot; buildings , and ecologically sound agriculture . 
In the heat of the battle against financial panic , policy attention turned away from that green recovery . 
Now the US needs to return to this important idea . 
Debt-burdened consumers in the US and Europe will limit their spending for years to come as they rebuild their wealth and pension assets . 
Government policies in the US and other rich countries should stimulate those investments through special incentives . 
These include a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions , subsidies for research and development on sustainable technologies , feed-in tariffs and regulatory incentives for renewable energy , consumer subsidies and other inducements for the uptake of new &quot; green &quot; technologies , and implementation of &quot; green &quot; infrastructure programs , such as mass transit . 
The rich world should also provide the poorest countries with grants and low-interest loans to buy sustainable energy technologies , such as solar and geothermal power . 
The crisis can yet be an opportunity to turn from a path of financial bubbles and excessive consumption to a path of sustainable development . 
In fact , seizing this opportunity is the only recipe for genuine growth that we have left .
