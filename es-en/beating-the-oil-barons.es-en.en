Beating the Oil Barons 
WASHINGTON , DC - Over the past eighteen months , oil prices have more than doubled , inflicting huge costs on the global economy . 
Strong global demand , owing to emerging economies like China , has undoubtedly fueled some of the price increase . 
Reflecting their faith in markets , most economists dismiss the idea that speculation is responsible for the price rise . 
If speculation were really the cause , they argue , there should be an increase in oil inventories , because higher prices would reduce consumption , forcing speculators to accumulate oil . 
The fact that inventories have not risen supposedly exonerates oil speculators . 
But the picture is far more complicated , because oil demand is extremely price insensitive . 
In the short run , it is technically difficult to adjust consumption . 
For instance , the fuel efficiency of every automobile and truck is fixed , and most travel is non-discretionary . 
Though higher airline ticket prices may reduce purchases , airlines reduce oil consumption only when they cancel flights . 
Thus , absent a recession , demand has remained largely unchanged over the past year . 
Moreover , it is relatively easy to postpone lowering oil consumption . 
Consumers can reduce spending on other discretionary items and use the savings to pay higher gasoline prices . 
Credit can also temporarily fill consumer budget gaps . 
Although the housing boom in the United States - which helped in this regard - ended in 2006 , consumer debt continues to grow , and America &apos;s Federal Reserve has been doing everything it can to encourage this . 
Consequently , for the time being the US economy has been able to pay the oil tax imposed by speculators . 
Unfortunately , proving that speculation is responsible for rising prices is difficult , because speculation tends to occur during booms , so that price increases easily masquerade as a reflection of economic fundamentals . 
But , contrary to economists &quot; claims , oil inventories do reveal a footprint of speculation . 
Inventories are actually at historically normal levels and 10 % higher than five years ago . 
Meanwhile , The Wall Street Journal has reported that financial firms are increasingly involved in leasing oil storage capacity . 
The root problem is that financial markets can now mobilize tens of billions of dollars for speculative purposes . 
Absent a change in trader beliefs , the current oil price spike will be broken only by a recession that exhausts consumers &quot; capacity to buffer higher prices , or when the slow process of substitution away from oil kicks in . 
Thus , economic fundamentals will eventually trump speculation , but in the meantime society will have paid a high price . 
Whereas oil speculators have gained , both the US and global economies have suffered and been pushed closer to recession . 
In the case of the US , heavy dependence on imported oil has worsened the trade deficit and further weakened the dollar . 
This sobering picture calls for new licensing regulations limiting oil-market participation , limits on permissible trading positions , and high margin requirements where feasible . 
Sadly , given the conventional economic wisdom , implementing such measures will be an uphill struggle . 
But some unilateral populist action is possible . 
A major form of gasoline storage is the tanks in cars . 
If people would stop filling up and instead make do with half a tank , they would immediately lower gasoline demand .
