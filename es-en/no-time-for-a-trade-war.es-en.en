No Time for a Trade War 
NEW YORK - The battle with the United States over China &apos;s exchange rate continues . 
When the Great Recession began , many worried that protectionism would rear its ugly head . 
True , G-20 leaders promised that they had learned the lessons of the Great Depression . 
But 17 of the G-20 &quot; s members introduced protectionist measures just months after the first summit in November 2008 . 
The &quot; Buy American &quot; provision in the United States &quot; stimulus bill got the most attention . 
Still , protectionism was contained , partly due to the World Trade Organization . 
Continuing economic weakness in the advanced economies risks a new round of protectionism . 
In America , for example , more than one in six workers who would like a full-time job can &apos;t find one . 
These were among the risks associated with America &apos;s insufficient stimulus , which was designed to placate members of Congress as much as it was to revive the economy . 
With soaring deficits , a second stimulus appears unlikely , and , with monetary policy at its limits and inflation hawks being barely kept at bay , there is little hope of help from that department , either . 
So protectionism is taking pride of place . 
The US Treasury has been charged by Congress to assess whether China is a &quot; currency manipulator . &quot; 
Although President Obama has now delayed for some months when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner must issue his report , the very concept of &quot; currency manipulation &quot; itself is flawed : all governments take actions that directly or indirectly affect the exchange rate . 
Reckless budget deficits can lead to a weak currency ; so can low interest rates . 
Until the recent crisis in Greece , the US benefited from a weak dollar / euro exchange rate . 
Should Europeans have accused the US of &quot; manipulating &quot; the exchange rate to expand exports at its expense ? 
Although US politicians focus on the bilateral trade deficit with China - which is persistently large - what matters is the multilateral balance . 
When demands for China to adjust its exchange rate began during George W. Bush &apos;s administration , its multilateral trade surplus was small . 
More recently , however , China has been running a large multilateral surplus as well . 
Saudi Arabia also has a bilateral and multilateral surplus : Americans want its oil , and Saudis want fewer US products . 
Even in absolute value , Saudi Arabia &apos;s multilateral merchandise surplus of $ 212 billion in 2008 dwarfs China &apos;s $ 175 billion surplus ; as a percentage of GDP , Saudi Arabia &apos;s current-account surplus , at 11.5 % of GDP , is more than twice that of China . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s surplus would be far higher were it not for US armaments exports . 
In a global economy with deficient aggregate demand , current-account surpluses are a problem . 
But China &apos;s current-account surplus is actually less than the combined figure for Japan and Germany ; as a percentage of GDP , it is 5 % , compared to Germany &apos;s 5.2 % . 
Many factors other than exchange rates affect a country &apos;s trade balance . A key determinant is national savings . 
America &apos;s multilateral trade deficit will not be significantly narrowed until America saves significantly more ; while the Great Recession induced higher household savings ( which were near zero ) , this has been more than offset by the increased government deficits . 
Adjustment in the exchange rate is likely simply to shift to where America buys its textiles and apparel - from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka , rather than China . 
Meanwhile , an increase in the exchange rate is likely to contribute to inequality in China , as its poor farmers face increasing competition from America &apos;s highly subsidized farms . 
This is the real trade distortion in the global economy - one in which millions of poor people in developing countries are hurt as America helps some of the world &apos;s richest farmers . 
During the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis , the renminbi &apos;s stability played an important role in stabilizing the region . 
So , too , the renminbi &apos;s stability has helped the region maintain strong growth , from which the world as a whole benefits . 
Some argue that China needs to adjust its exchange rate to prevent inflation or bubbles . 
Inflation remains contained , but , more to the point , China &apos;s government has an arsenal of other weapons ( from taxes on capital inflows and capital-gains taxes to a variety of monetary instruments ) at its disposal . 
But exchange rates do affect the pattern of growth , and it is in China &apos;s own interest to restructure and move away from high dependence on export-led growth . 
China recognizes that its currency needs to appreciate over the long run , and politicizing the speed at which it does so has been counterproductive . 
( Since it began revaluing its exchange rate in July 2005 , the adjustment has been half or more of what most experts think is required . ) 
Moreover , starting a bilateral confrontation is unwise . 
Since China &apos;s multilateral surplus is the economic issue and many countries are concerned about it , the US should seek a multilateral , rules-based solution . 
Imposing unilateral duties after unilaterally labeling China a &quot; currency manipulator &quot; would undermine the multilateral system , with little payoff . 
China might respond by imposing duties on those American products effectively directly or indirectly subsidized by America &apos;s massive bailouts of its banks and car companies . 
No one wins from a trade war . 
So America should be wary of igniting one in the midst of an uncertain global recovery - as popular as it might be with politicians whose constituents are justly concerned about high unemployment , and as easy as it is to look for blame elsewhere . 
Unfortunately , this global crisis was made in America , and America must look inward , not only to revive its economy , but also to prevent a recurrence .
