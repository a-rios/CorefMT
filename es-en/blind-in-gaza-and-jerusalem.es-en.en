Blind in Gaza and Jerusalem 
LONDON - I spent the New Year in Sydney , watching the fireworks above the iconic bridge welcome in 2009 . 
The explosions over Gaza that night were not intended to entertain , but rather to break Hamas and discredit it in the eyes of Palestinians . 
It was the latest resort to terrible violence in order to resolve how to share in peace what Christians still like to call the Holy Land . 
Mahatma Gandhi criticized the biblical justification of retribution , &quot; an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . &quot; 
Followed through to its end , he argued , it would mean that all were blind . 
And so it has proved in Palestine and Israel . 
Blind in Gaza , blind in Jerusalem . 
Much of what has happened was predictable , as well over 1,400 men , women , and children have died and more than 4,000 have been injured . 
First , the United States justified the Israeli assault and blamed everything on Hamas , just as it used to pin all responsibility for whatever went wrong on Yasir Arafat and Fatah . 
Second , despite French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s welcome high-profile diplomacy , Europe has been irrelevant , if not quite invisible . 
As Israeli officials point out , Europeans are always there for the photo opportunity . 
The Quartet &apos;s peacemaker , Tony Blair , is as unctuously nugatory as ever . 
He appears on CNN , but has he actually visited Gaza since his appointment in the summer of 2007 ? 
No . 
Third , as usual , Israel has accused of anti-Semitism those who have dared to criticize its disproportionate response to Hamas &apos;s indefensible rocket attacks and its collective punishment of Palestinians . 
An Italian cardinal , who admittedly spoke intemperately , was accused of using the language of Holocaust denial . 
By that standard , does my unqualified criticism of Hamas &apos;s rocket attacks make me an Islamophobe ? 
Coincidentally , the deadly attack on Gaza came at the same time that a clutch of America &apos;s most distinguished would-be Middle East peacemakers published books about how the task should properly be tackled . 
It all sounded a bit like a series of job applications - the war for President Barack Obama &apos;s ear . 
One thing all these experts could agree on is that President George W. Bush was a disaster . 
American policy might as well have been made in Likud &apos;s headquarters . 
Even at the end , when the United Nations Security Council voted on Gaza , Bush was happy to humiliate Condoleezza Rice at Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s bidding . 
These &quot; wise men , &quot; advisers one and all to President Bill Clinton and other presidents , all seem to concede that the failure of the proposed Camp David accord in 2000 could not , after all , be laid solely at Arafat &apos;s door . 
Former Israeli premier Ehud Barak should carry his share of the blame . 
Moreover , they all criticize the Clinton-era practice of routinely clearing America &apos;s policy positions first with Israel , which is hardly likely to win Arab confidence or support . 
The American diplomats &quot; arguments about process did not on the whole carry over into disagreement about the content of a peace deal . 
All more or less agree on this . 
Two states . 
Security guarantees for Israel . 
A Palestinian state within the 1967 borders , adjusted by agreement through mutual land swaps . 
An end to most West Bank settlements . 
No &quot; right of return &quot; for Palestinian refugees , but financial compensation for them . 
Some system of joint or international sovereignty over Jerusalem &apos;s holy places and the division of the city so that it can become the capital of two states . 
Of course , this is what should happen . 
And I suppose that it is conceivable that it could still happen with the help of welcome new mediators like Qatar and Turkey , whose prime minister called Israel &apos;s attack &quot; a serious crime against humanity . &quot; 
But I have begun to wonder whether it will really be possible to achieve peace on this basis . 
Fatah , and Palestinian moderates like President Mahmoud Abbas , have been totally discredited . 
Palestinians on the whole have been further radicalized . 
Hamas , whose engagement and support is essential for any settlement , has sworn revenge . 
Every day , new Palestinian sorrows strike heaven in the face . 
The widows and the mothers of the dead weep and cry out for bloody justice . 
Should we be surprised ? 
Had the British government pursued peace and the destruction of the IRA in Northern Ireland by bombing Catholic Derry , would that have alienated or won over Catholic opinion ? 
On the Israeli side , which political leaders really want a Palestinian state and are prepared to take the political risks associated with trying to establish one ? 
Which of them are strong enough to deal with the West Bank settlers ? 
There will be no peace settlement otherwise . 
Which leaders will teach the facts of life to the more extreme members of the Jewish diaspora in America ? 
Who among Israel &apos;s leaders understands that reconciliation is more important that retribution and revenge ? 
However tough things looked in the past , I have never felt such a sense of despair about Palestine and Israel . 
Reason has been drowned in blood . 
It seems as though the politics of hope have given way to the politics of the cemetery . 
Poor Palestine . 
Poor Israel . 
Who is there now who can still light a candle in the dark ?
