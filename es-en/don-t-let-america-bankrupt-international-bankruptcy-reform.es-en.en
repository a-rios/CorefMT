Don \ u0027t Let America Bankrupt International Bankruptcy Reform 
I am a frequent IMF critic , so when the IMF gets something right , I should acknowledge it . 
The IMF has , at last , recognized the failure of its big bailout policies - failures all too evident in Thailand , Indonesia , Korea , Russia , Brazil , and most recently , in Argentina . 
Three cheers for the IMF . 
Big bailouts allowed countries to briefly maintain over-valued exchange rates , which in turn allowed the rich in these countries to get their money out at more favorable terms than they might have done otherwise . 
These bailouts also allowed Western banks that engaged in imprudent lending to get repaid . 
Meanwhile , as overvalued exchange rates - even if maintained for only a short period - further depressed the economy , the country was left with the burden of repaying billions of dollars in IMF loans . 
Nowhere was the problem more evident than in the 1998 Russian bailout , where only after the &quot; failure &quot; - after the ruble &apos;s devaluation - did growth resume . 
The billions lent to Russia quickly wound up in the Swiss and Cyprus bank accounts of Russia &apos;s oligarchs . 
All of this was evident at the time the money was lent in July 1998 , but it is Russia &apos;s people that today must pay for the IMF &apos;s mistakes . 
Argentina provided the coup de grace to the IMF &apos;s big bailout strategy . 
I , and others , had argued for years for a greater reliance on standstill agreements , restructurings , and bankruptcy . 
Finally , the IMF has come around . 
But it should have been clear all along that the IMF , as a major creditor , could not itself be the bankruptcy judge . 
The conflicts of interest were glaring . 
The IMF has now listened . 
Whether one agrees with the recent proposals made by Ann Krueger , the IMF &apos;s deputy managing director , is not the issue : the fact is that the IMF now recognizes the potential conflict of interest , and has proposed alternative procedures that might deal with the problem . 
Regrettably , the US Treasury immediately threw cold water on the proposals . 
John Taylor , undersecretary of Treasury for International Affairs , and a former colleague of mine at Stanford University ( as was Ann Krueger ) , suggested that matters ought to be left to the market . 
All that is needed , he suggests , are &quot; collective action &quot; clauses that allow the majority ( or a supermajority ) of a group of bondholders to impose their will on a minority , so as to prevent scavengers who , in the past , bought up small stakes in a bond issue and used their position to extract large concessions for themselves . 
Taylor is a distinguished macro-economist , but he has paid little attention either to recent developments in economic theory or experiences in economic policy in the arena of bankruptcy . 
Collective action clauses are important , but they are not enough . 
The IMF long advocated the &quot; hands-off , market-oriented &quot; approach to bankruptcy resolution , and it has mostly been a disaster . 
Korea and Malaysia ignored IMF advice and , instead , their governments took an active role . 
There followed extensive restructuring , and those economies recovered fast . 
Countries that relied on IMF advice fared far less well . 
Economic theory holds that there are incentives for some market participants to delay a resolution , and these are particularly costly in situations such as those in East Asia and Argentina , where corporate distress is prevalent and where the economy faces a major economic downturn . 
The existence of such negative incentives is why bankruptcy law in America allows bankruptcy judges discretion to force recalcitrant creditors to accept a resolution that is in the broader interest . 
Why should principles that make sense within countries - like the US - not be applied in the international arena ? 
As the IMF now recognizes , there needs to be some form of an international arbiter . 
The question is , what guidance should be given to this international bankruptcy referee ? 
The issue is far from academic . 
The US has experienced a fierce debate over bankruptcy reform , demonstrating that there is no simple answer to the appropriate design of bankruptcy law or regulation . 
Bankruptcy is not a matter than can simply be delegated to technocrats as much as the IMF would like to give the impression that such is the case . 
There are efficiency issues ; but there are also distributional concerns . 
The IMF , linked as it is to financial markets , is likely to push for a set of rules that favor those interests . 
More balance is needed . 
The principles of America &apos;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy law - the provision which allows rapid reorganization of firms in ways that maintain its economic activity , should underlay whatever rules are adopted . 
The fact that America can veto even these modest IMF proposals illustrates a fundamental weakness of current international economic arrangements . 
In the UN , five countries hold a veto - largely a historical anachronism . 
India - once a British colony , does not ; 
France does . 
Whatever one &apos;s attitude to these arrangements , the notion that a single country can exercise effective veto power seems inconsonant with basic democratic principles . 
Were America less bent on pursuing unilateralist policies , in pushing against an international rule of law , this might not make much of a difference . 
But the Bush Administration not only ignores basic principles of economics , but also the basic principles underlying international cooperation . 
There needs to be a new way of dealing with crises . 
The big bailout strategies , associated with the Clinton-era IMF of Michel Camdessus , Stanley Fischer , Larry Summers , and Robert Rubin , failed abysmally . 
An alternative is demanded . 
America &apos;s proposal to rely on minor modifications in current arrangements , while relying on the market , though it is a position long advocated by financial markets , will not suffice . 
The IMF has been trying to create an alternative . 
The world cannot allow America to veto its efforts .
