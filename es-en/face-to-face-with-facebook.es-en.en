Face-to-Face with Facebook 
NEW YORK - Long ago , when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was in grade school , I wrote a book ( Release 2.1 : A Design for Living in the Digital Age ) in which I lauded something called &quot; P3 &quot; ( now p3p ) , the platform for privacy preferences . 
I was sure that people would start using P3 or something like it to control access to data about themselves . 
Of course , I was wrong ... for about 10 years . 
Now , at last , it &apos;s starting to happen - though not exactly the way I envisioned it . 
Nor is it exactly the way Zuckerberg envisioned it ... 
While many people are up in arms about Facebook &apos;s shifting privacy policies , millions of others are calmly managing their reputations online , using the tools that Facebook and other social Web sites provide . 
In fact , Facebook has helped them learn how to do that . 
Statistics recently published by the Pew Research Center &apos;s Internet 
American Life Project ( http : / / pewinternet.org / Reports / 2010 / Reputation-Management.aspx ) indicate that young people manage their reputations online more carefully than do older people . 
I don &apos;t think that means that the young care more about privacy ; in fact , I think Zuckerberg is right when he says , &quot; People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people . 
That social norm is just something that has evolved over time . &quot; 
The younger generation is comfortable with sharing precisely because they know how to control it . 
Zuckerberg is right that they don &apos;t necessarily want privacy or what analyst Danah Boyd calls &quot; seclusion , &quot; but they do want &quot; control . &quot; 
They won &apos;t blindly follow defaults . 
Generally , young people post more information of an edgy nature about themselves and about their friends than do older adults , so they are quickly learning the need for specific controls . 
By contrast , older users ( 1 ) are less likely to do stupid things in the first place , and ( 2 ) are less likely to do so in range of a camera . 
( Of course , there are notable exceptions . ) 
But they , too , don &apos;t want default settings that leave them feeling exposed . 
They want to &quot; evolve &quot; on their own , rather than be pushed ( or led unwittingly ) by Facebook . 
In short , the market is working , slowly , and consumers are educating themselves , slowly . 
Facebook has been a big part of that : it has provided the tools to do so , and is constantly tweaking them . 
It has also publicized those tools , often inadvertently , by setting overly public defaults . 
But in its rush to make money , the company seems to have been greedy - and pretty tone-deaf - in its response to critics . The critics may not represent the majority of users , but they deserve a polite and considered response . 
And when the company does screw up - as with Beacon and more recently its plans for user data-sharing with favored vendors such as Pandora - it needs to show more humility . 
That &apos;s not a moral judgment , but a business one . 
If the market is working towards a world where users exercise the power to manage their own reputations , it will ultimately punish companies that become too arrogant . 
But that is only part of the privacy discussion . 
The comforting thing about the kind of data that Facebook primarily deals with is that it &apos;s public . 
If your friends and other people can see it , so can you . 
More troubling is the data you don &apos;t even know about - the kind of data about your online activities collected by ad networks and shared with advertisers and other marketers , and sometimes correlated with offline data from other vendors . By and large , that &apos;s information you can &apos;t see - what you clicked on , what you searched for , which pages you came from and went to - and neither can your friends , for the most part . 
But that information is sold and traded , manipulated with algorithms to classify you and to determine what ads you see , what e-mails you receive , and often what offers are made to you . 
Of course , some of that information could go astray ... 
Personally , I don &apos;t really mind , but there are many people who would , if they understood what was going on in the first place . 
I predict that , whether it &apos;s this year or in ten years , this will become a much greater issue than what information people share openly with friends . 
The challenge is to make this hidden sharing of information less confusing , more explicit , and more transparent before the majority of people discover it for themselves in a way that leaves them feeling deceived . 
I regularly attend advertising industry events and raise this issue , and the answers I get are something along the lines of &quot; what people don &apos;t know won &apos;t hurt them , &quot; or &quot; all we &apos;re doing is giving them ads better targeted to their interests . &quot; 
But people have a way of objecting to being manipulated like that . 
They like to be treated as individuals , not to be put into buckets . 
I keep telling marketers that this is not a threat , but an opportunity . 
Just as Facebook has educated people , clumsily , about privacy controls , so marketers must educate people , ideally more elegantly , about tracking controls . 
I hope it won &apos;t take ten years and a lot of bad publicity for advertisers to figure that out . 
From my own perspective , as I look at the emerging market for people generating and using their own health / behavior data , this commotion is useful . 
People who share health data are likely to be much more adept at managing it than they would have been just a few years ago . 
They will also be fairly skeptical about the companies they entrust it to . 
That ultimately argues for transparency and paid models , so that consumers don &apos;t wonder what other allegiances companies may have . 
&quot; I pay you to manage my data , &quot; is pretty straightforward . 
&quot; I give you my data and you give me a free service &quot; leaves the customer wondering what else the company may do with the data .
