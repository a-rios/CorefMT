Missing America 
BERLIN - Madeleine Albright , the former US secretary of state , once described the United States as the &quot; indispensable nation . &quot; 
Current developments around the world are proving her right . 
But the proof has been almost entirely negative : Today , America &apos;s importance has become apparent from the absence of US leadership in one crisis after another - an absence that is most immediately obvious in Syria . 
In fact , a post-American world is taking shape before our eyes , characterized not by a new international order , but by political ambiguity , instability , and even chaos . 
This is unfortunate , and could turn out to be so dangerous that even die-hard anti-Americans end up longing for the pass√© American century and the US role as a global force for order . 
Both subjectively and objectively , the US is no longer willing or able to play that role . 
There have been many causes : a decade of war in the greater Middle East , with its enormous cost in &quot; blood and treasure &quot; ; the financial and economic crisis ; high public debt ; reorientation toward internal problems ; and a new focus on Pacific affairs . 
I am relatively certain that the US will successfully manage its reorientation and realignment , but the relative weight and reach of its power will nonetheless decline in the new world of the twenty-first century , as others grow in strength and catch up . 
Certainly , America &apos;s global role will not be called into question . 
Nor is India or Russia likely to pose a serious challenge . 
And Europe &apos;s din of conflicting voices appears to preclude it from claiming America &apos;s mantle . 
But , while none of these powers represents a serious alternative to America &apos;s global role , the US will no longer be able to act unilaterally , as it did after the Cold War &apos;s end , and it will be weakened substantially . 
This change has become particularly obvious in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region . 
In the Middle East , the regional order created by the colonial powers , France and Britain , following World War I , was maintained throughout the Cold War and the brief era of unilateral US domination that followed ; the convulsions of recent years , however , could well bring about its end . 
The colonial borders are being called into question , and what will become of Syria , Lebanon , Iraq , and Jordan is difficult to forecast . 
The potential for regional disintegration and reconstitution - a process that can unleash untold violence , as in Syria - is greater than ever . 
Moreover , while there is no new regional hegemon to follow America , there are numerous contenders for the role . 
But none - Iran , Turkey , and Saudi Arabia being the most prominent - is strong enough to decide matters in its own favor . 
Given the lack of a new force for order in the region in the foreseeable future , and the old one &apos;s unwillingness to act , the danger of long-lasting violent confrontation is growing . 
Even if America once again pursued military intervention in the region , its power would no longer be sufficient to enforce its will . 
Indeed , it is precisely because the US , after more than a decade of war , understands this only too well that any American administration will think twice before intervening militarily in the region again . 
Things look different in Asia , where the US not only remains present , but has increased its commitments . 
In East and South Asia , nuclear powers ( China , Russia , India , Pakistan , and North Korea ) or near-nuclear powers ( Japan and South Korea ) are all entangled in dangerous strategic rivalries . 
Add to this a regular dose of North Korean irrationality . 
While the US presence in the region has so far prevented its numerous conflicts and rivalries from intensifying , sources of uncertainty are multiplying . 
Will China be wise enough to seek reconciliation and partnerships with its neighbors , large and small , rather than aiming for regional domination ? 
What will become of the Korean Peninsula ? 
And what implications does Japan &apos;s nationalist turn - and its risky economic policy - hold for the region ? 
Can India and China stem the deterioration in bilateral relations ? 
Is state failure looming in Pakistan ? 
Imagine this situation without America &apos;s military and political strength . 
The region would be dramatically more dangerous . 
At the same time , America &apos;s straitened resources mean that its new global role will require more careful consideration of national interests in setting priorities . 
Clearly , the Asia-Pacific region takes precedence in US calculations . 
This new , more focused and limited American role thus raises the following question for America &apos;s European partners : Can they afford the luxury of being unable to defend themselves without US help ? 
Certainly , America &apos;s guarantee of its NATO allies &quot; security will not become worthless ; but it will become far more difficult to redeem it in full . 
And , if a post-American world entails greater risk of chaos and its consequences than hope for a new , stable order - a risk that affects Europe in particular - then perhaps Europe should reverse course on its apparent determination to dismantle itself .
