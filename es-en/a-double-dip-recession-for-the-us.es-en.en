A Double-Dip Recession for the US ? 
Last winter , America &apos;s central bank - the Federal Reserve - was busy patting itself on the back . 
The Fed &apos;s cut in its basic interest rate to 1.75 % per year seemed to have worked : the recession was ending . 
Despite sobered expectations about the high-tech revolution &apos;s impact on productivity and profits , as well as the jitters inspired by the terror attack on the World Trade Center , American businesses , it was believed , would soon start investing again big-time because borrowing money at 1.75 % was too good a deal to pass up . 
By late spring , those expectations had disintegrated alongside the collapse of Enron , WorldCom , and Arthur Andersen . 
Suddenly , everyone doubted the integrity of the financial accounts of American companies . 
Suddenly , everyone saw just how much America &apos;s system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the 1990s . 
The American stock market fell 15-20 % below its winter levels . 
Spreads between the interest rate at which America &apos;s government could borrow and the interest rates at which America &apos;s corporations could borrow widened . 
Suddenly , the Fed stopped congratulating itself : a 1.75 % interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the Dow-Jones stock market index stands at 10,000 , but not when the Dow-Jones index stands at 8,500 . 
Throughout the summer , corporate investment news remained disappointing . 
More and more analysts began to speak about the possibility of a &quot; double dip &quot; recession . 
Yet throughout all this , the Federal Reserve remained passive . 
The short-term interest rates it controlled didn &apos;t budge . 
Only in mid-August did the Fed hint that interest rates might be cut . 
The informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts . 
First , short-term interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only . 
They would thus have little effect on the longer-term rates that really drive business investment . 
Second , short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would spook the financial markets : if even the Fed thought conditions warranted cuts , the argument went , businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them . 
The Fed &apos;s judgment appeared to be that it was largely ( if not completely ) powerless : it had done all that it could , and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity . 
So the US in 2002 joined Japan in what economists have for sixty-five years called a Liquidity Trap : a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loosely connected to the level of aggregate demand that further reductions are ineffective in fighting a recession . 
America &apos;s situation was not unique : Japan had been in been in thrall to a liquidity trap since the mid-1990s . 
But there had been no other examples since the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
Whether America now really is in a liquidity trap is uncertain . 
How long this state of affairs will last is unknown . Nevertheless , even if America is only on the edge of a liquidity trap , and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon , this is a frightening situation . 
If monetary policy is not effective , the only lever the American government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy : changes in the government &apos;s tax and spending plans to change the government &apos;s direct contribution to aggregate demand . 
But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government - with its complex , baroque , eighteenth-century organization - is incapable of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy . 
It simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through Congress and the bureaucracy . 
An America caught in a liquidity trap is , quite simply , a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management . 
There have been two eras since World War II when policymakers - American policymakers , at least - believed that they had solved the riddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-industrial economy . 
The first was the Keynesian high-water mark of confidence in demand management of the 1960s . 
The second was the decade of successful business-cycle management by Alan Greenspan &apos;s independent , apolitical , and technocratic Fed during the 1990s . 
This second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first . 
Eighty years ago , John Maynard Keynes argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the pre-World War I gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was , and that its successes were the result of a lucky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated . 
Keynes was an optimist in believing that governments could learn to manage the business cycle . 
He would be shocked to look at today &apos;s world : a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment , a Japan mired in a decade of near stagnation , and now an America lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional unexpected economic bad news .
