Taiwan \ u0027s Democratic Taunts 
Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian &apos;s recent call for a law enabling popular referendums quickly turned into an international crisis . 
China , fearing that the law could be used to move Taiwan towards independence , reacted strongly even before the referendum bill was approved by the Legislative Yuan , Taiwan &apos;s parliament . 
Major General Wang Zaixi , Deputy Director of China &apos;s Taiwan Affairs Office , warned of the use of force if Taiwanese authorities &quot; collude with separatist forces to openly engage in pro-independence activities and challenge the mainland and the one-China principle . &quot; 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was slightly more civil . 
In an interview with an American newspaper , he reminded Taiwan that China would &quot; pay any price to safeguard the unity of the motherland . &quot; 
A few days after Wen &apos;s interview , while commenting on recent developments in Taiwan with Premier Wen at his side , US President George W. Bush said that America opposed &quot; any unilateral decision to change the status quo , and the comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo , which we oppose . &quot; 
Facing re-election and preoccupied with Iraq , President Bush cannot afford a crisis in the Far East . 
Indeed , he needs China &apos;s help in persuading recalcitrant North Korea into seriously negotiating nuclear disarmament . 
But President Bush is not alone in facing democratic pressures . 
Taiwan has its own domestic constituencies that need stroking . 
With economic growth slowing to a record 50-year low during his tenure , Chen Shui-bian is seeking ways to divert public attention by assuming the role of a daring leader ready to defend Taiwan &apos;s sovereignty . 
Gone is the moderate policy towards China that Chen espoused previously . 
In a major policy reorientation , he announced last August that there is &quot; one state on each side of the Taiwan Strait . &quot; 
To further differentiate himself from the Kuomintang ( the party that ruled Taiwan for most of the last half century ) and its ally , the People &apos;s First Party , Chen has made the embodiment of local values , safeguarding Taiwan &apos;s sovereignty , and the &quot; two state &quot; theory the theme of his presidency . 
A new constitution , backed by a national referendum , is part of this drive to reshape Taiwan &apos;s identity and distinguish the new generation of politicians from those who arrived as exiles from the mainland . 
Whereas a referendum serves as an election gimmick , it is nonetheless a normal democratic tool almost everywhere , and the strategy would not have caused the stir that it has if the Taiwanese public did not seem to back it . 
Clearly , public opinion in Taiwan regarding relations with China has changed dramatically . 
In the past , the Taiwanese repudiated words like referendum and new constitution , owing to China &apos;s sensitivity . 
But recent polls show that Taiwanese attitudes towards China have changed markedly , and that more and more people are less concerned about what China thinks . 
Few consider China &apos;s rulers to be even remotely friendly , and this growing aversion to the mainland provides daring politicians with room to maneuver . 
But Taiwan &apos;s policy towards China has also undergone a very different kind of overhaul in the last decade or so , with previous confrontations replaced by a new engagement aimed at exploring economic opportunities in the vast Chinese market . 
Taiwan has been a major supplier of foreign capital flowing into China , contributing twice as much as the US and accounting roughly for 20 % of China &apos;s total inflows . 
Taiwan is also the driving force in China &apos;s high-tech industries . 
Estimates suggest that 70 % of the hardware made in China &apos;s IT industry is produced by Taiwan-owned companies . 
Taiwan has also allowed mini-links to be opened so that the residents of Kinmen ( an offshore island ) and Xiamen ( a port city of China ) can enjoy unrestrained travel across the Strait . 
These goodwill gestures have , however , failed to moderate China &apos;s belligerent posture . 
Missile tests aside , China has been trying to cajole America into stopping arms sales to Taiwan . 
The rumored proposal in October 2002 by Jiang Zemin , China &apos;s former president , in a meeting with President Bush to withdraw Chinese missiles in exchange for a termination of US military sales to Taiwan is but one example . 
This hostility extends to almost every field of endeavor . 
China blocked Taiwan &apos;s entry into the Word Health Organization even though the SARS epidemic inflicted heavy casualties on the island earlier this year . 
China also managed to convince three nations to shift loyalty away from Taipei &apos;s meager diplomatic corps during President Chen &apos;s three years in office . 
Worse yet , two of the cases were timed to humiliate Chen - one on the eve of his assumption of the Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship , the other before his stopover in New York while on a state visit to Central America . 
So in terms of cross-Straits stability , China can be said to be every bit as provocative as Taiwan , and matters may yet spin out of control if leaders on both sides continue their recklessness . 
While smaller Taiwan should be careful not to provoke its giant neighbor , China must come to terms with the workings of a functioning democracy . 
Intimidation and suppression can only breed hostility among ordinary Taiwanese .
