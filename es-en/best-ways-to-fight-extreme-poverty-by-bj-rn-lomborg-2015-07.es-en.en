The Best Ways to Fight Extreme Poverty 
COPENHAGEN - In 1950 , people in South Korea and Pakistan earned roughly the same amount of money annually . 
Today , the two countries are scarcely comparable . 
How we can help more of the world &apos;s poorest countries emulate South Korea &apos;s success is one of the most important questions facing the world today . 
Better economic outcomes mean empowering entire populations with better health , more education , longer life , and less vulnerability to challenges like natural disasters . 
Many of the United Nations &quot; proposed 169 development targets for the next 15 years are , at their heart , concerned with poverty reduction . 
But not all targets are equally good . 
The Copenhagen Consensus Center , of which I am director , recently asked 60 teams of economists to evaluate the benefits and costs of these proposed targets , which will come into force to replace the Millennium Development Goals in September . 
One of the least desirable targets seems laudable at first : full employment for all . 
Unfortunately , this is a dream , not a target . 
Economies need some unemployment to allow workers to change jobs , and most governments already focus on job creation . 
Research suggests that politicians and interest groups would use a full-employment target to support expensive , protectionist policies that generate great jobs for some but drive many into the informal economy . 
So it would probably end up doing less good than it would cost , and it is certainly not the way to reduce extreme poverty . 
About 14.5 % of the world &apos;s population , or one billion people , live on less than $ 1.25 a day . 
So why not end extreme poverty by simply transferring enough resources to this billion people to get them to at least $ 1.26 a day ? 
The world &apos;s poorest would be able to feed and educate their children better and become healthier . 
But , in addition to the financial cost , there would be huge administrative challenges , along with corruption and institutional deficiencies . 
When these factors are weighed against the benefits in monetary terms , each dollar spent ending extreme poverty with cash transfers would achieve about $ 5 worth of social value . 
That is not a bad return at all , but there are many better ways to help . 
One possibility is to triple mobile broadband penetration in developing countries . 
This would provide small-scale businesspeople such as farmers and fishermen with market information , enabling them to sell their goods at the highest price - and to boost productivity , increase efficiency , and generate more jobs . 
Our research shows that the benefits , added up , would be worth $ 17 for every dollar spent - making it a very good development target . 
An even better intervention addresses migration . 
More than 200 million people today work outside their home countries . 
As rich countries age , they need more workers . 
At the same time , people from developing countries are more productive in a developed country . 
Easing restrictions on migration would allow young people from developing countries to expand industrialized economies &quot; diminishing workforces - and generate the taxes needed to pay for care for the elderly . 
Such migration would also be good for the developing countries , because migrant workers send home remittances . 
In total , every dollar spent on increased migration would produce more than $ 45 of social good - possibly more than $ 300 . 
While in today &apos;s political climate , increasing migration might be difficult to achieve , it is worth pointing out how effectively it could help the world &apos;s poorest . 
The single development target that would have the biggest impact on global prosperity would be the completion of the Doha trade round . 
Lowering trade barriers would mean that all countries could focus on doing what they do best , making everyone better off . 
Moreover , freer trade would accelerate economic growth , owing to increased innovation and knowledge exchange . 
Heavy reliance on trading in a global market was one of the main reasons that South Korea has developed so rapidly and essentially eradicated its poverty in the last 65 years . 
Economic models indicate that a successful Doha round would make the global economy $ 11 trillion richer each year by 2030 , with most of the benefits going to developing countries . 
Each person in the developing world would earn $ 1,000 more per year , on average . 
For every dollar spent , mostly to pay off Western farmers blocking the current negotiations , the world would achieve more than $ 2,000 of benefits , making free trade a phenomenal investment . 
Each of these proposals - full employment , cash transfers , broadband rollout , freer migration , and lower trade barriers - is covered by at least one of the UN &apos;s 169 development targets . 
Trying to do 169 different things at once would be foolhardy . 
It would mean spending too much time and resources on lower-return priorities , instead of focusing on the targets that promise the biggest impact on the world &apos;s poorest . 
In fact , our research shows that there are 19 phenomenal targets that - like freer trade - should be prioritized above all of the others . 
The final decision about which targets will become global policy will affect the flow of trillions of dollars over the next 15 years . 
In September , when world leaders gather in New York , they need to focus on the smartest ways to boost global prosperity . 
Doing so would help more countries take South Korea &apos;s path and lift their populations out of poverty .
