No Pause , Please 
Pressure is building on the European Central Bank to pause from further increases in interest rates after the New Year . The ECB must not give in . But to pause now when Europe &apos;s economic strength continues at a robust pace carries with it an un-necessary risk to price stability . Even though 2006 has been an excellent growth year for Europe , real interest rates - interest rates expressed in terms of goods and services as opposed to money - have not budged from the beginning of the year . 
This means Europe &apos;s monetary policy continues to stimulate economic growth despite the fact that , by December , money rates will have been raised 150 basis points during 2006 . 
With real rates so low , a pause at the New Year would be pre-mature . 
Some of the pressure for a pause has to do with the French presidential elections this spring . 
A rate increase during the election period clearly would make the central bank even more of an issue in the French campaign than already is the case . 
This is not good . 
Politics must take a back seat when it comes to monetary policy decisions - otherwise , inflationary expectations won &apos;t be firmly anchored for very long . 
A second argument put forth for a pause is the increase in the value-added tax in Germany from 16 to 19 % at the beginning of next year . 
The argument for a pause is that the central bank may want to wait and see how much damage , if any , the VAT hike imposes on the German economy before continuing on with the process of rate hikes . 
But for an inflation-fighting central bank like the ECB , the risks from a pre-mature pause are greater than those from pausing too late . 
With the ECB in its current tightening mode , &quot; better too late than too early &quot; must be its rule of thumb . 
Finally , and perhaps most important , there is the powerful example of the US Federal Reserve . 
Because the Fed has decided to pause , there is substantial pressure  -  coming both from inside and outside the ECB  -  that Europe &apos;s central bank follow suit . 
The effect of Fed &apos;s policies on other central banks should not be underestimated . 
ECB critics already claim there has been a certain &quot; follow the Fed &quot; quality to ECB monetary decisions , notwithstanding clear differences between the two central banks over the role the money supply should play in monetary policy decisions . 
When the Fed dramatically cut interest rates to fight recession , so did the ECB . 
When the Fed kept interest at unusually low levels for an extended period of time , so did the ECB . 
And when the Fed decided to exit this strategy and raise rates in a steady and predictable fashion , so did the ECB . 
This , by the way , may not be mere copycat , but an attempt by Europe &apos;s central bankers , wary of exchange rate volatility , to loosely co-ordinate interest rates to promote stable exchange rates . 
But stabilizing the euro by following the Fed carries with it an unnecessary risk for price stability . 
Europe and the United States are at different phases of the business and interest rate cycles . 
When the Fed paused , the US economy was in a more mature phase of the business cycle  -  and the weight of accumulated interest rate increases greater - than presently is the case in Europe . 
This made pausing in order to see whether past rate hikes sufficiently slow the economy to moderate inflationary pressures a good bet for the US . 
It is not a good bet for Europe , however , where growth momentum remains strong despite some recent backing and filling after the torrid pace of the second quarter , where interest rates remain too low and money supply growth too high . 
&quot; No Pause Please , We &apos;re Europeans ! &quot; is the proper ECB response to those advocating a break after the New Year even if the euro does go up a bit as a result .
