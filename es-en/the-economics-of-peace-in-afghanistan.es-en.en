The Economics of Peace in Afghanistan 
KABUL - Suicide bombings , assassinations of top Afghan leaders , brutal attacks on Charikar and other places close to Kabul , Afghanistan &apos;s capital , and a rapid increase in civilian deaths from drone attacks are jeopardizing the withdrawal of American and NATO forces from the country . 
So pervasive has the violence become that Ahmed Rashid , the renowned expert on the Taliban , has concluded that speeding up the peace process through dialogue with the insurgents is the only option . 
The economics of what an Afghanistan at peace would look like must be a critical part of any negotiations . 
But what , precisely , does the economics of peace entail , and why is it so important ? 
One main objective should be to transform Afghanistan &apos;s vast underground economy , which has thrived , despite the large number of NATO forces , by creating profitable opportunities for Taliban and other groups involved in the fighting . 
To reintegrate these fighters into the productive economy will require a change in policies , including a rapid reactivation of rural development schemes and the promotion of local entrepreneurship , public works , and other legal activities . 
In particular , the United States , together with other donors and NATO troop contributors , should heed &quot; Ten Commandments &quot; during and after the negotiations . 
First , apply the dictum of T.E. Lawrence ( Lawrence of Arabia ) that it is better to let &quot; them &quot; do it than it is to try to &quot; do it better &quot; for them . 
Thus , let national negotiators , local leaders , and communities determine what their economic needs and priorities are , and let insurgents determine their preferred venue for reintegration . 
Unless the participants are empowered and take ownership , programs will not be sustainable , resources will go to waste , and peace will not endure . 
Second , ensure integration - rather than merely coordination - of economic factors into the political and security agenda . 
This would entail using reintegration and other economic programs as a carrot to support the negotiations , and would also support peace and stability in the long run . 
Third , support a peace agreement designed in accordance with the country &apos;s financial and technical capacity to implement it . 
This requires reasonable projections for domestic tax revenue and aid , as well as the right mix of foreign expertise to support the process . 
Avoid overly optimistic projections that lead to unworkable plans and unreasonable expectations , which the government will not be able to fulfill , as happened in Guatemala , for example , when its civil war ended . 
Fourth , channel aid through the central government budget , or through local authorities , so that officials can acquire legitimacy by providing services and infrastructure , and provide subsidies and price-support programs to replace poppies with licit crops such as cotton , which was produced in the past . 
Fifth , ensure that such aid moves quickly from short-run humanitarian purposes - to save lives and feed those giving up war - to reconstruction activities aimed at creating investment , productivity growth , and the sustainable employment that will enable people to live dignified lives . 
What needs to be avoided is a failure - such as occurred in Haiti following its devastating earthquake - to move from the first stage to the second . 
Sixth , establish well-planned and synchronized programs for demobilization , disarmament , and reintegration , which are sine qua non for making the transition from war to peace irreversible . 
In doing so , remember that the &quot; vagueness versus specificity &quot; dilemma also applies to economic issues . 
Too much specificity on some variables and too much vagueness with regard to others required a renegotiation of the arms-for-land agreement in El Salvador to make it implementable . 
Seventh , establish different programs for higher-level commanders , providing more orientation , training , credit , and technical assistance . 
The United Nations acknowledged better results from the &quot; Plan 600 &quot; in El Salvador than from programs for lower-ranking combatants , which lacked such support . 
Eighth , increase support for NGOs with successful records in creating entrepreneurs in rural development , in carpet weaving , jewelry design , or any other activity that Afghans want to develop . 
Active policies to promote new start-ups and local companies &quot; expansion through credit , training , and technical support are imperative . 
Ninth , establish economic reconstruction zones to jump-start sustainable economic activity , create jobs and export earnings , improve aid effectiveness and accountability , and avoid aid dependency . 
The zones could combine integrated rural development for domestic consumption and labor-intensive manufacturing and agro-businesses for export . 
The US and other countries should open their markets to goods produced in these zones . 
Finally , ensure that the political or peace objective prevails at all times , even if it delays economic stability and development . 
This often means accepting that optimal and best-practice economic policies are not attainable - or , indeed , even desirable . 
The independence of the central bank and the &quot; no overdraft &quot; rule for budget financing will almost certainly prove too restrictive to carry out critical peace-supporting activities in Afghanistan . 
In settling the Afghan war , the government and donors should seek to eschew the pattern of unkept promises that has bedeviled reconstruction of the country in the past . 
Only then will Afghanistan be able to break out of its decades-long vicious circle of violence , insecurity , corruption , unemployment , drug trafficking , and aid dependency .
