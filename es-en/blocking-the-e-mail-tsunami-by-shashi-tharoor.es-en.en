Pandora &apos;s Inbox 
NEW DELHI - A half-century before the invention of e-mail , T. S. Eliot asked , &quot; Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge ? 
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ? &quot; 
If he were alive today , contemplating an electronic inbox on a flickering computer , he might well have added , &quot; Where is the information that has been lost in trivia ? &quot; 
It is one of the paradoxes of our times that inventions meant to make our lives easier inevitably end up slowing us down . 
When e-mail first entered my life , I was thrilled ; instead of letters piling up for months as I struggled to find the time to pen replies , faxes not going through , and telegrams that cost an arm and a leg , I now had a cost-free means of communicating instantaneously and efficiently . 
I became an avid and diligent e-mailer . 
And how I regret it . 
I get over three hundred e-mails a day , sometimes twice that . 
Some are urgent ( but not necessarily important ) work-related questions . 
Some are from friends ; because I am an Indian MP , many are from job-seekers , favor-demanders , and petitioners . 
Some are one-line queries ; others are lengthy documents requiring perusal and comment . 
Many are unsolicited junk mail , offering products and services that I never asked for and do not need ; and though an efficient filter catches many of them , it also catches some &quot; real &quot; mail . 
Some are mass mailings , both interesting ( like an international affairs mailing list to which I subscribed years ago , when I innocently believed that I would have time to read its contents ) and diverting ( like my daily update of Doonesbury ) . 
An astonishingly large number are jokes - both verbal and visual - of varying quality . 
Many are campaigns - I received several thousand e-mails recently from Muslim students who do not want exams to be administered on Fridays . 
And increasingly , some are viruses that have infected friends &quot; address books , with attachments that , if opened , could destroy my computer . 
Because they are on the screen , I feel obliged to go through them all , if only to make sure that I do not need to read them . 
When e-mail first came into vogue , one could spend 15-20 minutes a day on it ; now it consumes 2-3 hours . 
And , because one &apos;s other work does not stop , those are hours added to one &apos;s workday , and therefore subtracted from one &apos;s personal life . 
A convenience has become a burden . 
When I am at my computer , I find myself neglecting more important matters that have arrived by &quot; snail mail . &quot; 
E-mails automatically become urgent , because I know that if I do not reply to one immediately , it will soon be swamped by 200 others . 
I find myself scrambling to attend to utterly trivial e-mails only to get past them to the ( possibly ) important ones that lie behind . 
The result is &quot; information fatigue &quot; - a palpable sense of exhaustion , coupled with persistent anxiety about coping with the sheer volume of material to be digested , compounded by an ever-shortening attention span in the face of the ceaseless barrage of data . 
Like Eliot , I felt that I understood more when I knew less , and knew more when I had less information to process . 
This is a global problem - an estimated 294 billion e-mails were sent daily in 2010 , and the figure continues to increase . 
As technology advances , it has become more and more difficult to escape it . 
No longer is e-mail confined to a desktop computer at the office ; the advent of smart phones has allowed people to check their e-mail wherever they are . 
It is almost enough to have one longing again for the day when information was a scarce resource and one had to go out to find it . 
Now so much information is so readily available that the challenge is to sift the wheat from the chaff . 
To paraphrase Kipling , it is clear that the e-mail of the species is deadlier than the mail . 
Addiction to e-mail is increasingly being recognized as a malady . 
The British national lottery operators , Camelot , once tried to ban e-mail on Fridays ; they wanted staff to talk to each other at least one day a week . 
But the experiment was abandoned within a month : people have grown so accustomed to the convenience of copying messages to multiple recipients that walking to their desks is now an unfamiliar idea . 
Part of the problem is that we allow ourselves to be persuaded that new inventions will only make our lives more convenient , rather than also adding to our burdens . 
Just as the telephone did not supplant the postal system , e-mail sits alongside prior methods of communication . 
Now we have more means of reaching each other than ever , but with less worth saying . 
Indeed , there is an inverse relationship between the difficulty and expense of communication , on one hand , and the quality of what is communicated , on the other . 
When telegraph operators were paid by the word , and there was always the risk of garbled transmissions , messages were crisp , succinct , and to the point . 
When neither length nor complexity affects the cost of a message , however , the field is open for irrelevant and unnecessary communication . 
Without even the price of a stamp to deter the prolix , the unmanageable tsunami of e-mail threatens to drown the world in information , unless the servers , switches , and wires that sustain the system burn out first . 
Ease of replication permits matters to get out of hand very quickly . 
I have decommissioned my e-mail account and set up an auto response that gives e-mailers ten other options to reach people who can help them ( including bringing messages to my attention ) . 
So far , it hasn &apos;t made much of a difference : e-mails continue to flood the decommissioned mailbox . 
But it has helped me : I no longer feel obliged to reply .
