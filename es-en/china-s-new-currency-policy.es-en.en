China &apos;s New Currency Policy 
CAMBRIDGE - China &apos;s government may be about to let the renminbi-dollar exchange rate rise more rapidly in the coming months than it did during the past year . 
The exchange rate was actually frozen during the financial crisis , but has been allowed to increase since the summer of 2010 . 
In the past 12 months , the renminbi strengthened by 6 % against the dollar , its reference currency . 
A more rapid increase of the renminbi-dollar exchange rate would shrink China &apos;s exports and increase its imports . 
It would also allow other Asian countries to let their currencies rise or expand their exports at the expense of Chinese producers . 
Why , then , might the Chinese authorities deliberately allow the renminbi to rise more rapidly ? 
There are two fundamental reasons why the Chinese government might choose such a policy : reducing its portfolio risk and containing domestic inflation . 
Consider , first , the authorities &quot; concern about the risks implied by its portfolio of foreign securities . 
China &apos;s existing portfolio of some $ 3 trillion worth of dollar bonds and other foreign securities exposes it to two distinct risks : inflation in the United States and Europe , and a rapid devaluation of the dollar relative to the euro and other currencies . 
Inflation in the US or Europe would reduce the purchasing value of the dollar bonds or euro bonds . 
The Chinese would still have as many dollars or euros , but those dollars and euros would buy fewer goods on the world market . 
Even if there were no increase in inflation rates , a sharp fall in the dollar &apos;s value relative to the euro and other foreign currencies would reduce its purchasing value in buying European and other products . 
The Chinese can reasonably worry about that after seeing the dollar fall 10 % relative to the euro in the past year - and substantially more against other currencies . 
The only way for China to reduce those risks is to reduce the amount of foreign-currency securities that it owns . 
During the past 12 months , China had a current-account surplus of nearly $ 300 billion , which must be added to China &apos;s existing holdings of securities denominated in dollars , euros , and other foreign currencies . 
The second reason why China &apos;s political leaders might favor a stronger renminbi is to reduce China &apos;s own domestic inflation rate . 
A stronger renminbi lowers the cost to Chinese consumers and Chinese firms of imported products as expressed in renminbi . 
A barrel of oil might still cost $ 90 , but a 10 % increase in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate reduces the renminbi price by 10 % . 
Reducing the cost of imports is significant because China imports a wide range of consumer goods , equipment , and raw materials . 
Indeed , China &apos;s total annual imports amount to roughly $ 1.4 trillion , or nearly 40 % of GDP . 
A stronger renminbi would also reduce demand pressure more broadly and more effectively than the current policy of raising interest rates . 
A principal goal of the recently presented 12th Five-Year Plan is to increase household incomes and consumer spending at a faster rate than that of GDP growth . 
The combination of faster household-spending growth and the existing level of exports would cause production bottlenecks and strain capacity , leading to faster increases in the prices of domestically produced goods . 
Making room for increased consumer spending requires reducing the level of exports by allowing the currency to appreciate . 
Looking back on the past year , the 6 % rise in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate might understate the increase in the relative cost of Chinese goods to American buyers because of differences in domestic inflation rates . 
Chinese consumer prices rose about 6.5 % over the past year , while US consumer prices rose only about 3.5 % . 
The three-percentage-point difference implies that the &quot; real &quot; inflation-adjusted renminbi-dollar exchange rate rose 9 % over the past year ( i.e. , 6 % nominal appreciation plus the 3 % inflation difference . ) 
Although this is how governments calculate real exchange-rate changes , it no doubt overstates the relative change in the prices of the goods that Americans buy from China , because much of China &apos;s inflation was caused by rising prices for housing , local vegetables , and other non-tradables . 
The renminbi prices of the Chinese manufactured products that are exported to the US may not have increased at all . 
The renminbi-dollar exchange rate is , of course , only part of the story of what drives China &apos;s trade competitiveness . 
While the renminbi has risen relative to the dollar , the dollar has declined against other major currencies . 
The dollar &apos;s 10 % decline relative to the euro over the past 12 months implies that the renminbi is actually down by about 4 % relative to the euro . 
The Swiss franc has increased more than 40 % against the dollar - and therefore more than 30 % against the renminbi . 
Looking at the full range of countries with which China trades implies that the overall value of the renminbi probably declined in the past 12 months . 
The dollar is likely to continue falling relative to the euro and other currencies over the next several years . 
As a result , the Chinese will be able to allow the renminbi to rise substantially against the dollar if they want to raise its overall global value in order to decrease China &apos;s portfolio risk and rein in inflationary pressure .
