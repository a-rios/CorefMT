Securing a More Secure World 
Committee reports are usually deadly dull , and UN committee reports are among the dullest . 
But the recent report of the UN Secretary General &apos;s High Level Panel on Threats , Challenges , and Change broke that rule . 
Sixteen political leaders and former diplomats combined principle with political realism to produce the most comprehensive proposals for change since the UN was created in 1945 . 
Secretary General Kofi Annan is to present the report in March . 
Then it will be up to governments to act . 
Many early comments focus on the Panel &apos;s recommendations for enlarging the UN Security Council from 15 to 24 members . 
The report proposes two alternatives . 
One would add six new permanent members - such as India , Brazil , Egypt , South Africa , Japan , and Germany - as well as three two-year members . 
The other alternative would create eight semi-permanent members with renewable four-year terms and one additional member chosen for a two-year term . 
Either proposal would entail amending the UN Charter , which requires marshaling the support of a two-thirds majority of the 191 member states , including the five veto-wielding members of the current Security Council . 
Skeptics doubt that this is feasible . 
But focusing on enlargement of the Security Council risks diverting attention from the rest of the Panel &apos;s analyses and 101 recommendations for reform , many of which do not require amending the Charter . 
According to the report , the General Assembly has lost vitality , the Security Council must be more proactive , the Commission on Human Rights suffers from a legitimacy deficit , the Secretariat should be more professional and better organized , and major institutional gaps hinder responses to economic and social threats to international security . 
The report is critical of the organization &apos;s performance on genocide in Bosnia , Rwanda , and Darfur , as well as the late response to HIV / AIDS . 
In the panel &apos;s words , the UN was created above all &quot; to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , &quot; but today the biggest security threats we face &quot; go far beyond states waging aggressive war . 
The preoccupation of the UN founders was with state security . 
When they spoke of creating a new system of collective security they meant it in the traditional military sense . &quot; 
Today the threats are from non-state actors as well as states , and they jeopardize human security as well as that of states . 
Collective security nowadays means a broader sharing of responsibility for each other &apos;s security . 
The Panel deals forthrightly with the new transnational threats posed by terrorists and the spread of weapons of mass destruction . 
Its members agreed that there could be &quot; nightmare scenarios &quot; that combine the two and might require the preventive use of force . 
They urge strengthening the non-proliferation regime through more intrusive inspections , and negotiation of arrangements for internationally guaranteed access to nuclear enrichment and reprocessing services , rather than allowing countries to construct them for themselves . 
They back President George W. Bush &apos;s Proliferation Security Initiative aimed at stopping traffic in weapons of mass destruction . 
On terrorism , they break the long UN impasse over finding a definition , condemning all attacks against civilians , and propose a number of measures that member states should take . 
Regarding preventive use of force , traditional interpretations of Article 51 of the UN Charter ( which provides a right of self-defense ) allow a threatened state to take pre-emptive action in the face of imminent attack , but not to use force preventively against longer term threats . 
The Panel would broaden that interpretation to allow the preventive use of force in some instances , but only if approved by the Security Council . 
The Security Council would judge the legitimacy of such action by whether it met the age-old criteria of just war : the seriousness of the threat , the purpose of the response , whether force is a last resort , whether it is used in a proportionate way , and whether there is a reasonable balance of good and bad consequences . 
In that sense , President Bush won half his argument : preventive force can be justified , but not unilaterally . 
Afghanistan would fit ; 
Critics complain that this approach places too much trust in a Security Council that can be paralyzed by politics and the veto . 
Enlarging the Council could make maters worse . 
A state threatened by terrorist attacks originating in another state might feel less patient than a majority of the Council about what is the &quot; last resort . &quot; 
In Rwanda and Kosovo , the Security Council failed to act in time to save thousands of lives . 
Is there an alternative to waiting for the Security Council and acting unilaterally ? 
Kosovo and Iraq provide instructive examples . 
In the former , the prospect of a Security Council veto prevented action , and a regional organization ( NATO ) acted without UN authorization . 
Although this called the legality of the action into question , the intervention benefited from a widespread sense of political legitimacy that limited its negative effects on international order . 
In the case of the Iraq War , President Bush never established a broad consensus that might have provided legitimacy in the face of a veto . 
Countries such as France and Germany that opposed action in Iraq were willing to use force in Kosovo despite the absence of Security Council authorization . 
If states feel compelled to act in the case of Council stalemate , they should know that they would do less damage to their reputations if they act within the Panel &apos;s guidelines for legitimacy , even if they fail to satisfy its criterion for legality . 
No single report can create a more secure world , but those who support that goal must hope that governments and their publics will consider seriously the Panel &apos;s recommendations .
