The Creative State 
LONDON - The conventional view in mainstream economics today is that governments have little capacity to spark innovation . 
The state should play as limited a role in the economy as possible , the thinking goes , intervening only in cases of &quot; market failure . &quot; 
This is far from the truth . 
In fact , governments can and do play a critical role in spurring innovation - actively creating new markets , instead of just fixing them . 
To be sure , advocates of a limited economic role for government believe that market failure justifies some funding of infrastructure and basic science . 
But such limited intervention can hardly explain the billions of public-sector dollars that have flowed toward downstream applied research , even providing early-stage financing for companies . 
Indeed , in some of the world &apos;s most famous innovation hubs , the state has played a key &quot; entrepreneurial &quot; role , envisioning and financing the creation of entire new fields , from information technology to biotech , nanotech , and green tech . 
In Silicon Valley , for example , the government has acted as a strategic investor through a decentralized network of public institutions : The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , NASA , the Small Business Innovation Research program ( SBIR ) , and the National Science Foundation . 
The sums involved can be staggering , and not just in IT ; large amounts of funding have also been channeled to energy and life sciences . 
In 2011 , for instance , the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) invested $ 31 billion in biomedical research . 
Marcia Angell , a professor at Harvard Medical School , has shown that this financing played a crucial role in the development of some of the most revolutionary new drugs in recent decades . 
Similarly , for some of the most innovative American companies , financing from the SBIR has proved to be more important than private venture capital . 
Examples outside the US include Israel , where the public venture-capital fund Yozma has provided early-stage funding to some of the country &apos;s most dynamic companies , and Finland , where Sitra , the public innovation fund , supplied early financing for Nokia . 
In China , the state-owned development bank is offering billions of dollars in loans to some of the country &apos;s most innovative companies , including Huawei and Yingli Solar . 
These types of public investments are critical in creating and shaping new markets . 
Indeed , government investment played a central role in developing nearly all of the technologies that make the iPhone a smart phone : the Internet , GPS , touchscreens , and the advances in voice recognition underlying Siri . 
Similarly , in many countries , it is the public sector that is leading the way in making green technology possible . 
Recognizing the importance of government investment in promoting innovation and growth implies the need to rethink the conventional wisdom about state intervention . 
Instead of focusing on picking individual technologies or firms , public organizations should act like investors , betting on a diversified &quot; portfolio &quot; of choices . 
Like any other investor , the state will not always succeed . 
In fact , failure is more likely , because government agencies often invest in the areas of highest uncertainty , where private capital is reluctant to enter . 
This means that public organizations must be capable of taking chances and learning from trial and error . 
If failure is an unavoidable part of the innovation game , and if government is crucial for innovation , society must be more tolerant of &quot; government failure . &quot; 
But the reality is that when government fails , there is public outcry - and silence when it succeeds . 
For example , the bankruptcy of the US solar energy firm Solyndra , which received a $ 500 million government-guaranteed loan , triggered partisan protests . 
Yet few have paused to consider that the government provided nearly the same amount to Tesla to help it develop the Tesla S car , a product that is considered an archetype of Silicon Valley innovation . 
What , then , might make the public more accepting of government failure ? 
Private venture capitalists cover their losses from failed investments with their profits from those that succeed ; but government programs are rarely set up to generate significant returns . 
While some argue that the government &apos;s return comes through taxes , the current tax system is not working , owing not only to loopholes , but also to rate reductions . 
When NASA was founded , the top marginal tax rate was over 90 % . 
And capital gains tax has fallen by more than 50 % since the 1980s . 
In order to build support for public investment in higher-risk innovation , perhaps taxpayers should receive a more direct return , by channeling profits into a public innovation fund to finance the next wave of technologies . 
When investments are in upstream basic research , the spillover effect across industries and sectors is sometimes enough of a social reward . 
But other cases might require creating alternative incentives . 
For example , some of the profits from the government &apos;s investment in Tesla could have been recovered through shares ( or royalties ) , and used to cover the losses from its investment in Solyndra . 
Repayment of public loans to business could be made contingent on income , as student loans often are . 
And the prices of drugs that are developed largely with NIH funding could be capped , so that the taxpayer does not pay twice . 
One thing is clear : the current approach suffers from serious shortcomings , largely because it socializes the risks and privatizes the rewards . 
This is hurting not only future innovation opportunities , but also the government &apos;s ability to communicate its role to the public . 
Acknowledging the role that the state has played - and should continue to play - in shaping innovation enables us to begin debating the most important question : What are the new visionary public investments needed to drive future economic growth ?
