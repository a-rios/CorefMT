Who Should Be Bailed Out ? 
CAMBRIDGE - As governments around the world develop policies to deal with failing financial institutions , they should be sure to pick their beneficiaries wisely . 
In particular , they should study and avoid the mistakes made in the AIG bailout in late 2008 . 
A United States Special Inspector General recently issued a report criticizing the US government for failing to insist that AIG &apos;s counterparties in the market for financial derivatives bear some of the costs of bailing out the company . 
Indeed , bailouts of failed institutions should never extend the government &apos;s safety net to such counterparties . 
The AIG bailout was one of the largest in history , with the US government injecting more than $ 100 billion into the company . 
The bailout was brought about by AIG &apos;s large losses on derivative transactions with financial institutions , mostly sophisticated players such as Goldman Sachs and Spain &apos;s Banco Santander . 
After the government &apos;s infusion of funds in September 2008 , AIG &apos;s losses continued to mount , so the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later . 
At this point , the government asked AIG &apos;s derivative counterparties to take a voluntary &quot; haircut &quot; - that is , accept a discount on the amount owed to them . 
When some of these parties refused , the government backed down and financed AIG &apos;s payment of all of its derivative obligations in full . 
The US government felt that it had a weak hand , because it was not prepared to allow AIG to default on any of its obligations . 
This was a mistake . 
The government should have been prepared to place AIG into reorganization under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code and force the derivative parties to take the desired haircut . 
AIG is a holding company , and most of its business is conducted through insurance subsidiaries organized as separate legal entities . 
The huge losses on derivate transactions were generated by AIG &apos;s financial products unit . 
Although this unit was also a separate legal entity , AIG guaranteed its obligations toward derivative counterparties . 
Had the government placed AIG into Chapter 11 reorganization in November 2008 , AIG &apos;s creditors , including its derivative counterparties , would have ended up with the value of AIG &apos;s assets , which consisted mainly of shares in AIG &apos;s insurance subsidiaries . 
Without necessarily affecting the operations of AIG &apos;s insurance subsidiaries , the reorganization process would have simply shifted ownership of AIG &apos;s assets from AIG &apos;s existing shareholders to AIG &apos;s creditors . 
To the extent that the value of these assets would not have been sufficient to cover all of the derivative creditors &quot; claims , they would have had to bear some losses . 
Would that have been an unacceptable outcome ? 
Not at all . 
The government &apos;s reluctance to use such a process might have been motivated by AIG &apos;s major role in insurance markets around the world . 
But a reorganization of AIG and a shift in its ownership should not have been expected to endanger insurance policyholders . 
In any event , concerns about insurance policyholders should have led , at most , to a governmental commitment to back their claims if necessary . 
It did not require taxpayers to bail out the parent company &apos;s derivative counterparties . 
The government might also have been motivated by concerns that losses to the derivative counterparties would deplete the capital of some significant financial institutions at a difficult time . 
Again , such concerns would have been better addressed in different ways - in particular , by providing institutions that needed capital with funds directly , and in return for securities . 
To address a potential capital shortage at Goldman Sachs , say , taxpayers would have been better off providing $ 13 billon to Goldman in exchange for Goldman securities with adequate value , rather than footing the bill for the $ 13 billion that AIG gave to Goldman . 
In the future , governments should not bail out failing financial institutions &quot; derivative counterparties , even when they provide a safety net to some of these institutions &quot; creditors ( such as depositors ) . 
Governments should not only follow such a policy , but also make absolutely clear in advance their commitment to doing so . 
Communicating such a commitment clearly would induce parties to derivative transactions not to rely on a governmental safety net , but to monitor whether their partners have adequate reserves . 
A governmental commitment to exclude derivative creditors from any safety net extended when financial institutions fail would reduce future costs to taxpayers from cases like AIG . 
Indeed , it would reduce the likelihood that cases like AIG would ever arise .
