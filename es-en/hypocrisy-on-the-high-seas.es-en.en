Hypocrisy on the High Seas ? 
Thirty years ago , Australian vessels , with the government &apos;s blessing , killed sperm whales off the West Australian coast . 
Last month , Australia led international protests against Japan &apos;s plan to kill 50 humpback whales . 
Japan , under mounting pressure , announced that it would suspend the plan for a year or two . 
The change in public opinion about whaling has been dramatic , and not only in Australia . 
Greenpeace began the protests against Australian whaling , and the government appointed Sydney Frost , a retired judge , to head an inquiry into the practice . 
As a concerned Australian and a philosophy professor working on the ethics of our treatment of animals , I made a submission . 
I did not argue that whaling should stop because whales are endangered . 
I knew that many expert ecologists and marine biologists would make that claim . 
Instead , I argued that whales are social mammals with big brains , capable of enjoying life and of feeling pain - and not only physical pain , but very likely also distress at the loss of one of their group . 
Whales cannot be humanely killed - they are too large , and even with an explosive harpoon , it is difficult to hit the whale in the right spot . 
Moreover , whalers do not want to use a large amount of explosive , because that would blow the whale to pieces , while the whole point is to recover valuable oil or flesh . 
So harpooned whales typically die slowly and painfully . 
Causing suffering to innocent beings without an extremely weighty reason for doing so is wrong . 
If there were some life-or-death need that humans could meet only by killing whales , perhaps the ethical case against it could be countered . 
But there is no essential human need that requires us to kill whales . 
Thus , whaling is unethical . 
Frost agreed . 
He said that there could be no doubt that the methods used to kill whales were inhumane - he even described them as &quot; most horrible . &quot; 
He also mentioned &quot; the real possibility that we are dealing with a creature which has a remarkably developed brain and a high degree of intelligence . &quot; 
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser &apos;s conservative government accepted his recommendation that whaling be stopped , and Australia soon became an anti-whaling nation . 
While Japan has suspended its plan to kill humpback whales , its Japanese whaling fleet will still kill about 1,000 other whales , mostly smaller minke whales . 
Japan justifies its whaling as &quot; research , &quot; because the International Whaling Commission &apos;s rules allow member nations to kill whales for such purposes . 
But the research seems to be aimed at building a scientific case for a resumption of commercial whaling ; so , if whaling is unethical , then the research itself is both unnecessary and unethical . 
Japan says that it wants the discussion of whaling to be carried out calmly , on the basis of scientific evidence , without &quot; emotion . &quot; 
The Japanese think that humpback whale numbers have increased sufficiently for the killing of 50 to pose no danger to the species . 
On this narrow point , they might be right . 
But no amount of science can tell us whether or not to kill whales . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s desire to continue to kill whales is no less motivated by &quot; emotion &quot; than environmentalists &quot; opposition to it . 
Eating whales is not necessary for the health or better nutrition of the Japanese . 
It is a tradition that they wish to continue , presumably because some Japanese are emotionally attached to it . 
The Japanese do have one argument that is not so easily dismissed . 
They claim that Western countries object to whaling because , for them , whales are a special kind of animal , as cows are for Hindus . 
Western nations , the Japanese say , should not try to impose their cultural beliefs on them . 
The best response to this argument is that the wrongness of causing needless suffering to sentient beings is not culturally specific . 
It is , for example , one of the first precepts of one of Japan &apos;s major ethical traditions , Buddhism . 
But Western nations are in a weak position to make this response , because they inflict so much unnecessary suffering on animals . 
The Australian government strongly opposes whaling , yet it permits the killing of millions of kangaroos each year - a slaughter that involves a great deal of animal suffering . 
The same can be said of various forms of hunting in other countries , not to mention the vast amount of animal suffering caused by factory farms . 
Whaling should stop because it brings needless suffering to social , intelligent animals capable of enjoying their own lives . 
But against the Japanese charge of cultural bias , Western countries will have little defense until they address the needless animal suffering in their own backyards .
