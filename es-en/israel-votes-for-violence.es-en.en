Israel Votes for Violence 
War and violence always have a direct effect on elections . 
Wars account for dramatic shifts in voter preferences , and radical leaders and parties often poll much higher after a round of sharp violence than in normal times . 
Minority ethnic groups are therefore often able to sway the balance of power between major competing forces . 
This appears to have been precisely what has happened in Israel &apos;s recent election . 
Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s right-wing Likud Party and the even harder right Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beiteinu ( Israel is Our Home ) party achieved a dominant result that saw Labor , the dominant party throughout Israel &apos;s history , consigned to a lowly fourth place . 
Throughout the campaign , Israeli leaders competed over who would deal more firmly ( read : violently ) with the Palestinians . 
In the aftermath of Israel &apos;s assault on Gaza , Palestinians hoped that Israel would choose a leader who would focus on the need to end the suffering , lift the siege , and begin rebuilding . 
It appears that just the opposite has happened . 
The last time that Israeli elections were so obviously affected by violence was in 1996 , when polling results shifted wildly in the run-up to the vote , finally allowing Netanyahu a razor-thin win over acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres . 
Competing against an older Peres ( who had taken over after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin ) Netanyahu dyed his hair white to appear more mature , and then took advantage of a badly handled mini-war and the anger of Israel &apos;s Arab voters . 
Now Peres is Israel &apos;s president , while Netanyahu heads Likud . 
But not much has changed : badly handled wars , incomplete peace talks , and a boycott by Israel &apos;s Arab voters made this 2009 election seem almost like a carbon copy of 1996 , when Rabin &apos;s assassination ended the Palestinian-Israeli talks at a crucial time and Peres &quot; ill-advised war on South Lebanon reduced his large lead almost to a tie with Netanyahu . 
The anger of northern Israel &apos;s Arab citizens at the killing of their brethren across the border led to a boycott that cost Peres the few thousand votes he needed to win . 
Israel &apos;s 2009 election is similar in many ways . 
It follows two controversial wars ( although the current nominees were not directly involved in the 2006 war with Hezbollah ) . 
It also follows serious negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , which are said to have moved both sides much closer to each other . 
But wars and violence move electorates to the hawkish right , and Israel &apos;s operation in Gaza was no exception . 
Many Palestinian citizens of Israel , disgusted by the large-scale casualties inflicted on their brethren - and believing that to vote would mean to endorse the political system responsible for the carnage - stayed home once again . 
The most important element now is the new administration in the United States . 
The decisive victory of a candidate who opposed the Iraq war and favors direct talks with Iran will no doubt have a major influence on US-Israel relations and the peace process . 
The appointment of George Mitchell , who opposes Israel &apos;s West Bank settlements , and Mitchell &apos;s decision to open an office in Jerusalem , speaks volumes about what the new Israeli government should expect from the Obama administration . 
The Arab world is also in a state of flux after an emotional 22 days of Israel &apos;s televised bombardment of Gaza . 
Millions of Arabs throughout the Middle East took to the streets , so angered by the inability of anyone to stop the bloodshed that a huge schism has been created . 
Egypt , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and the Palestinian Authority beat a hasty retreat from their moderate and accommodating positions . 
The major stumbling block for the world in trying to relieve the suffering in Gaza is how to finesse the biggest bloc in the Palestinian Legislative Council , Ismael Hanieh &apos;s Islamist list of Reform and Change . 
This challenge has become more interesting with European countries &quot; willingness to deal with a united Palestinian government that includes Hamas &quot; Hanieh . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s pragmatism and refusal to embrace the Bush administration &apos;s &quot; war on terror &quot; will also be a key determinant of the outcome . 
But , beyond band-aid solutions for the deep injuries inflicted on Gaza , Palestinians &quot; biggest concern is to ensure that Israel &apos;s attempt to split Gaza from the West Bank does not become permanent . 
Egypt and the Palestinian Authority have been made to look bad in the eyes of the Arab world , owing to their refusal to make Egypt responsible for Gaza and possibly Jordan for the West Bank . 
But that proposal was a trap that would have destroyed the possibility of an independent , contiguous Palestinian state . 
Despite the election results , Palestinians still hope to re-establish momentum in resolving the remaining points of disagreement with Israel . 
While an international consensus now supports a two-state solution , settling the status of Jerusalem and of Palestinian refugees will be the main obstacles facing the two sides . 
The only hope now for resuming negotiations is the old &quot; only Nixon could open up China &quot; argument , meaning that only a truly hard-right Israeli leader would have the credibility to make peace with the Palestinians . 
But it is now clear to historians that Richard Nixon was determined to make his overture to China from the moment he began his presidency . 
Sadly , the signs that any of Israel &apos;s potential prime ministers are truly prepared to take so bold a step are few .
