Can Hamas Stay in Power ? 
With one-third of the Palestinians &quot; Hamas-led government now under arrest by Israel , the escalation in Israeli-Palestinian relations has moved beyond military confrontation . 
A far more fundamental question has come into view : can a Palestinian government that draws its authority from an agreement with Israel stay in power when it is led by an organization committed to the destruction of Israel ? 
The abduction of an Israeli soldier in the Gaza Strip , as well as the abduction and subsequent murder of an 18-year old Israeli civilian in the West Bank , have brought to the fore that question , which has haunted Israeli-Palestinian relations since Hamas won parliamentary elections in January . 
The international community , led by the &quot; Quartet &quot; ( the United States , the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia ) , has put three conditions to the Hamas government if it wishes to achieve international legitimacy and continue to be supported financially . 
Hamas must recognize Israel &apos;s right to exist , stop all terrorist activities , and commit itself to carry out all previous international agreements signed by the Palestinian Authority . 
To Hamas , however , they appear to undermine its very raison d &apos;etre . 
After all , this is an organization committed to the destruction of Israel - its charter calls for a holy war against all Jews - and the establishment of an Islamic state in all of historical Palestine . 
Indeed , Article 22 of that charter reveals that Hamas views the Jews ( together with the Freemasons and other nefarious organizations like Rotary International and the Lions Club ) , as responsible for the French and Bolshevik Revolutions , World War I , and World War II . 
So it is no great surprise that Hamas rejected the Quartet &apos;s conditions . 
At the same time , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ( Abu Mazen ) , who represents Fatah , which lost the January elections , has tried in vain to find common ground with Hamas through an ambiguous text known as &quot; The Prisoners &quot; Document . &quot; 
This document was intended to serve as an implicit acceptance of Israel &apos;s right to exist . 
But nothing of the sort appears in the truncated text approved by Hamas . 
On the contrary , the text legitimizes continuing attacks against Israeli civilians in the West Bank , making it unacceptable to Israel - and to the international community . 
But the current crisis cannot be solved by words alone . 
One of the paradoxical results of America &apos;s almost messianic belief in elections as a panacea for all the ills of the Middle East is that Hamas - the winner of democratic elections - has gained a degree of legitimacy that it never had before . 
On the other hand , Hamas &apos;s history and current behavior clearly indicate that it regards elections as merely a political tool , and that it is devoid of any commitment to the norms and values underlying democracy . 
Fascist and communist regimes of the past , which followed a similar instrumentalist approach to democracy , come to mind here . 
Yet , at the same time , the US supports Abu Mazen , trying to undermine the Hamas government , thus casting a shadow on the credibility of its own commitment to democracy . 
The current violence may escalate further , and could bring down the Hamas government . 
On the other hand , diplomatic means may bring about the release of the Israeli soldier and put a stop to the firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel - a daily occurrence that has challenged the credibility of the new Israeli government under Prime Minister Ehud Olmert . 
But the fundamental problem is that , until now , at every historical juncture , the Palestinians refused to accept a compromise and consequently failed in nation-building . 
In 1947 , they refused the UN partition plan , which called for the establishments of two states in British Palestine . 
In 1993 , after the Oslo agreements , the Palestinian Authority established under Yasir Arafat became another militarized authoritarian regime , very much like Syria and Egypt , and did nothing to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian refugees . 
It was this failure that brought Hamas to power . 
The current crisis is obviously the first serious test for Olmert and his plans for further withdrawal from Israeli-occupied territories . 
But it is an even greater test for the Palestinians : will they once again be led by a radical and fanatical leadership into another national catastrophe ? 
Or will they finally realize that a future of independence , sovereignty , and dignity is open to them - but only if they grant the Israelis what they rightly claim for themselves ? 
The international community can urge the Palestinians toward a decision . 
But that decision , and its moral costs , remains in the hands of the Palestinians alone .
