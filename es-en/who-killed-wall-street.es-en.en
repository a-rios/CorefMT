Who Killed Wall Street ? 
CAMBRIDGE - You don &apos;t have to break a sweat to be a finance skeptic these days . 
So let &apos;s remind ourselves how compelling the logic of the financial innovation that led us to our current predicament seemed not too long ago . 
Who wouldn &apos;t want credit markets to serve the cause of home ownership ? 
So we start by introducing some real competition into the mortgage lending business . 
We allow non-banks to make home loans and let them offer creative , more affordable mortgages to prospective homeowners not well served by conventional lenders . 
Then we enable these loans to be pooled and packaged into securities that can be sold to investors , reducing risk in the process . 
We divvy up the stream of payments on these home loans further into tranches of varying risk , compensating holders of the riskier kind with higher interest rates . 
We then call on credit rating agencies to certify that the less risky of these mortgage-backed securities are safe enough for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in . 
In case anyone is still nervous , we create derivatives that allow investors to purchase insurance against default by issuers of those securities . 
If you wanted to showcase the benefits of financial innovation , you could not have come up with better arrangements . 
Thanks to them , millions of poorer and hitherto excluded families became homeowners , investors made high returns , and financial intermediaries pocketed the fees and commissions . 
It might have worked like a dream - and until about a year and a half ago , many financiers , economists , and policymakers thought that it did . 
Then it all came crashing down . 
The crisis that engulfed financial markets in recent months has buried Wall Street and humbled the United States . 
The near $ 1 trillion bailout of troubled financial institutions that the US Treasury has had to mount makes emerging-market meltdowns - such as Mexico &apos;s &quot; peso &quot; crisis in 1994 or the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 - look like footnotes by comparison . 
But where did it all go wrong ? 
If our remedies do not target the true underlying sources of the crisis , our newfound regulatory zeal might end up killing useful sorts of financial innovation , along with the toxic kind . 
The trouble is that there is no shortage of suspects . 
Was the problem unscrupulous mortgage lenders who devised credit terms - such as &quot; teaser &quot; interest rates and prepayment penalties - that led unsuspecting borrowers into a debt trap ? 
Perhaps , but these strategies would not have made sense for lenders unless they believed that house prices would continue to rise . 
So maybe the culprit is the housing bubble that developed in the late 1990 &quot; s , and the reluctance of Alan Greenspan &apos;s Federal Reserve to deflate it . 
Even so , the explosion in the quantity of collateralized debt obligations and similar securities went far beyond what was needed to sustain mortgage lending . 
That was also true of credit default swaps , which became an instrument of speculation instead of insurance and reached an astounding $ 62 trillion in volume . 
So the crisis might not have reached the scale that it did without financial institutions of all types leveraging themselves to the hilt in pursuit of higher returns . 
But what , then , were the credit rating agencies doing ? 
Had they done their job properly and issued timely warnings about the risks , these markets would not have sucked in nearly as many investors as they eventually did . 
Isn &apos;t this the crux of the matter ? 
Or perhaps the true culprits lie halfway around the world . 
High-saving Asian households and dollar-hoarding foreign central banks produced a global savings &quot; glut , &quot; which pushed real interest rates into negative territory , in turn stoking the US housing bubble while sending financiers on ever-riskier ventures with borrowed money . 
Macroeconomic policymakers could have gotten their act together and acted in time to unwind those large and unsustainable current-account imbalances . 
Then there would not have been so much liquidity sloshing around waiting for an accident to happen . 
But perhaps what really got us into the mess is that the US Treasury played its hand poorly as the crisis unfolded . 
As bad as things were , what caused credit markets to seize up was Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson &apos;s refusal to bail out Lehman Brothers . 
Immediately after that decision , short-term funding for even the best-capitalized firms virtually collapsed and the entire financial system simply became dysfunctional . 
In view of what was about to happen , it might have been better for Paulson to hold his nose and do with Lehman what he had already done with Bear Stearns and would have had to do in a few days with AIG : save them with taxpayer money . 
Wall Street might have survived , and US taxpayers might have been spared even larger bills . 
Perhaps it is futile to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have blown up in our faces . 
A comforting thought - if you still want to believe in financial sanity - is that this was a case of a &quot; perfect storm , &quot; a rare failure that required a large number of stars to be in alignment simultaneously . 
So what will the post-mortem on Wall Street show ? 
That it was a case of suicide ? 
Murder ? 
Accidental death ? 
Or was it a rare instance of generalized organ failure ? 
We will likely never know . 
The regulations and precautions that lawmakers will enact to prevent its recurrence will therefore necessarily remain blunt and of uncertain effectiveness . 
That is why you can be sure that we will have another major financial crisis sometime in the future , once this one has disappeared into the recesses of our memory . 
You can bet your life savings on it . 
In fact , you probably will .
