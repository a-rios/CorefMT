The Rights of Apes - and Humans 
MELBOURNE - On June 25 , in a historic vote , the Spanish parliament &apos;s Commission for the Environment , Agriculture , and Fisheries declared its support for The Great Ape Project , a proposal to grant rights to life , liberty , and protection from torture to our closest nonhuman relatives : chimpanzees , bonobos , gorillas , and orangutans . 
Other countries , such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom , have taken steps to protect great apes from harmful experimentation , but no national parliament has declared that any animal could be a person with rights . 
The resolution , which the full parliament is expected to adopt , directs the Spanish government to promote a similar European Union-wide declaration . 
It also calls on the government to adopt , within a year , legislation to prohibit potentially harmful experiments on great apes that are not in their interests . 
Keeping great apes in captivity will be allowed for purposes of conservation only , and then under optimal conditions for the apes . 
Moreover , it recommends that Spain take steps in international forums and organizations to ensure that great apes are protected from maltreatment , slavery , torture , being killed , and being made extinct . 
Paola Cavalieri and I founded The Great Ape Project in 1993 to break down the barriers between human and nonhuman animals . 
Researchers like Jane Goodall , Diane Fossey , and Birute Galdikas have shown that great apes are thinking , self-aware beings , with rich emotional lives , and thereby prepared the ground for extending basic rights to them . 
If we regard human rights as something possessed by all human beings , no matter how limited their intellectual or emotional capacities may be , how can we deny similar rights to great apes , who clearly surpass some human beings in their rationality , self-awareness , and emotional bonds with others ? 
To do so would be to display a prejudice against other beings merely because they are not members of our species - a prejudice we call speciesism , to highlight its resemblance to racism . 
The Great Ape Project seeks to change the way we think about great apes , and ultimately , about animals in general . 
The Spanish resolution marks the first official acceptance of that view . 
The use of the term &quot; slavery &quot; in relation to something that it is wrong to do to animals is especially significant , for until now it has been assumed that animals are rightly our slaves , to use as we wish , whether to pull our carts , be models of human diseases for research , or produce eggs , milk , or flesh for us to eat . 
Recognition by a government that it can be wrong to enslave animals is a significant breach in the wall of exclusive moral significance we have built around our own species . 
While Spanish parliamentarians were sympathetically considering the rights of animals , however , in Austria ten leaders of lawful animal-welfare organizations were beginning their fifth week in prison . 
At dawn on May 21 , police burst into 23 separate locations , roused people from their beds , put guns to their heads , and forced one leader of an animal-welfare organization to stand in a public place in his underwear for two hours . 
They seized computers and files , disabling the animal-rights movement as it was on the eve of launching a new initiative to enshrine the protection of animals in the Austrian constitution . 
The ten arrested leaders are being held without charges or specific allegations made against them , under a law aimed at members of criminal organizations such as the mafia . 
The police have presented no evidence that any of those arrested were involved in violence . Yet a court has now remanded all ten to be held in prison until September . 
After 17 days in prison , three people were accused of threatening a press officer for a fashion store by hindering her from driving away . 
Another , Martin Balluch , has been given a 1,500-page police file to justify his arrest . 
In the file , his name is mentioned only three times , all in connection with interviews he gave to the media or articles he wrote . 
Ironically , Balluch , a brilliant man with doctorates in both physics and philosophy , is one of the foremost spokespersons in the worldwide animal-rights movement for pursuing the nonviolent , democratic road to reform . 
In an essay he wrote for In Defense of Animals , a book I edited that appeared in 2006 , he wrote , &quot; No realistic level of guerilla attacks of the kind carried out by the Animal Liberation Front could have hurt the battery farming industry as much as the new Austrian law does . &quot; 
In recent years , Austrian animal-welfare organizations have been remarkably successful in persuading voters and legislators to support laws phasing out cages for egg-laying hens , cages for raising rabbits for meat , and raising animals for fur . 
As Balluch writes : &quot; A law banning a whole industry does far more economic damage to the animal abuse industry than anything else the animal movement could do . &quot; 
The police persecution of the animal movement appears to be an attempt by the conservative party , which controls the Ministry of the Interior , and its animal industry supporters to strike back at a legitimate , peaceful challenge to the way we treat animals . 
That this can happen in a European democracy is shocking .
