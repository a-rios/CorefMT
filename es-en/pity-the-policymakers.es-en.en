Pity the Policymakers 
NEWPORT BEACH - I don &apos;t know about you , but whenever I am in an airplane experiencing turbulence , I draw comfort from the belief that the pilots sitting behind the cockpit &apos;s closed door know what to do . 
I would feel very differently if , through an open door , I observed pilots who were frustrated at the poor responsiveness of the plane &apos;s controls , arguing about their next step , and getting no help whatsoever from the operator &apos;s manuals . 
So it is unsettling that policymakers in many Western economies today resemble the second group of pilots . 
This perception reflects not only the contradictory pronouncements and behavior of policymakers , but also the extent to which economic outcomes have consistently fallen short of their expectations . 
This perception is evident in Europe , the United States , and Japan , where indicators of economic sentiment are deteriorating again , already-weak recoveries are stalling , and over-stretched balance sheets are becoming even more precarious . 
Understandably , companies and households are becoming even more cautious - inevitably making a difficult job for policymakers that much harder . 
In Europe , policymakers have failed to counter an expanding sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone &apos;s periphery , despite many summits and programs , multiple expensive bailouts , and the imposition of painful economic sacrifices on societies . 
Like an airplane piloted in confusion , the European economy has not behaved according to the instructions . 
As Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou put it last week in his powerful letter to the head of the Eurogroup , Luxembourg &apos;s Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker , &quot; The markets and rating agencies have not responded as we had all expected . &quot; 
With outcomes that fall far short of policymakers &quot; projections , it is not surprising that there is little harmony in official circles . 
Narratives increasingly conflict - and in an astonishingly open and unsettling way . 
Disagreement in Europe is not limited to that between &quot; solution providers &quot; ( the troika of the European Central Bank , the European Union , and the International Monetary Fund ) and countries now implementing painful austerity measures ( Greece , Ireland , and Portugal ) . 
Damaging discord has emerged within the troika itself , with a particularly disruptive impasse between Frankfurt , where the ECB resides , and Berlin , the seat of the German government . 
The situation in the US is not as acute as it is in Europe , but policy impotency prevails here , too . 
Despite unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus , economic growth remains sluggish , and unemployment is stuck at a worrisomely high level . 
The medium-term fiscal outlook continues to deteriorate while , in the short term , politicians play with the country &apos;s valuable AAA credit rating by arguing like schoolchildren over how to extend the debt ceiling . 
Then there are the complex technical difficulties facing policymakers , to which US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke referred in his refreshingly candid manner , acknowledging that &quot; We don &apos;t have a precise read . &quot; 
The Fed &apos;s economic manuals , including technical models and historical analyses , shed insufficient light on today &apos;s economic situation . 
Little wonder , then , that the latest release of the closely followed minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting points to a divided body , whose members anticipate divergent paths for monetary policy , with some expecting further accommodation and others expecting a round of tightening . 
Meanwhile , Japan continues to languish . 
Four months after a major earthquake , a devastating tsunami , and the start of persistent nuclear uncertainties , a comprehensive reconstruction program has yet to be launched . 
The resulting economic uncertainties are compounding years of inadequate growth and deteriorating public-debt dynamics . 
Six important issues speak to the problem for policymakers in Europe , the US , and Japan . 
First , all three economic areas are struggling with unsettling de-leveraging dynamics . 
Like oxygen being sucked out of our metaphorical airplane in midflight , deleveraging destabilizes societies and undermines the traditional effectiveness of official policies . 
Indeed , left completely to their own dynamics , these economies would probably shed excessive debt and alter long-standing social contracts in a manner that is both highly disorderly and that leads to economic contraction and a higher risk of another financial crisis . 
Second , domestic de-leveraging dynamics are aggravating other structural impediments . 
While the specifics vary by economic region and sector ( housing , labor markets , credit intermediation , etc . ) , it is a combination with a common and unfortunate outcome : it inhibits economies &quot; ability to grow , and thus to overcome debt overhangs in an orderly way . 
Third , policymakers are operating in a global economy that is in the midst of major re-alignments , as several systemically important emerging economies , led by China , continue to plow through their developmental breakout phase . 
Fourth , in choosing cyclical measures to deal with structural problems , policymakers have complicated matters even more - a reflection , again , of their inability to understand the unusual challenges that they face . 
Fifth , politics is complicating matters significantly . 
The reason is simple : in most cases , the required structural measures involve immediate pain for longer-term gain - a tradeoff that politicians abhor , especially when they are subject to short election cycles . 
Finally , communication has been dreadful . 
Rarely have I witnessed such failure by policymakers to provide a clear vision of their medium-term economic vision - a failure that has added to the general and unsettling sense of uncertainty . 
All of this speaks to why we should pity today &apos;s policymakers , who must confront unusually difficult challenges with abnormally ineffective tools . 
But pity is not a free pass : we should also urge policymakers to shift from their traditional cyclical mindset to one that can better comprehend , and effectively address , the more complicated , yet critically important , structural issues that underlie today &apos;s malaise . 
Unfortunately , this will not happen overnight ; and , in some cases , conditions might have to become a lot worse in order to focus policymakers &quot; minds . 
In the meantime , companies and households lucky enough to be in a position to build precautionary cushions will inevitably continue to do so . 
Others , unfortunately , will be vulnerable to even greater stomach-churning turbulence - without the perceived benefit of a closed cockpit door .
