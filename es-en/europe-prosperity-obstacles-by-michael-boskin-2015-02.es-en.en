A Five-Step Plan for European Prosperity 
WASHINGTON , DC - Though the Greek crisis has been placed on pause , the economic situation in Europe remains bleak . 
Eurozone growth is up slightly from its near-recession levels of a few months ago , but projections by the International Monetary Fund for 2015 and 2016 barely exceed 1 % . 
Unemployment remains above 11 % - and twice that among the young ( and doubled again in countries like Greece and Spain ) . 
Greece &apos;s exit from the eurozone would likely be less disruptive now than it would have been a few years ago . 
The countries most at risk of contagion - Portugal , Spain , and Italy - are less vulnerable now in the eyes of the markets ; the European Union has established a bailout fund ; and the European Central Bank has launched a large bond-buying program . 
The real challenge in Europe is continued stagnation and rising public-sector fiscal pressures in bloated welfare states with rapidly aging populations . 
Restoring growth , opportunity , prosperity , and financial stability will require bold solutions to five inter-related problems . 
The first problem is fiscal . 
The math is simple . 
It was this math that led Mario Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank , to declare that , &quot; The European social model has already gone . &quot; 
Too many Europeans are collecting too many benefits , but so far governments have mostly ducked the issue , taking on massive debt in order to postpone the reckoning . 
Reform that targets social spending at true need is long overdue . 
The second problem is economic : growth in Europe has fallen far short of that in the United States , decade after decade . 
Though economic theory predicts convergence in standards of living , Europe lags behind the US by 30 % or more . 
High taxes and burdensome regulations stifle the labor market and potential new businesses . 
Overgenerous social-welfare payments create disincentives to work , hire , invest , and grow . 
The third problem is the banking crisis . 
In Europe , banks supply roughly 70 % of the credit to European economies , compared to 30 % in the US . 
Fourth , there is the currency crisis . 
The euro &apos;s many benefits - cross-border pricing transparency , lower transaction costs , and inflation credibility - required surrendering independent monetary policies and flexible exchange rates . 
But , given limited interregional transfers and labor mobility , this means that the continent has far less ability to absorb disparate shocks through the operation of so-called automatic stabilizers . 
In the US , by contrast , people in high-unemployment Michigan move to , say , Texas , where jobs are plentiful , even as the federal tax and transfer system automatically shifts money in the opposite direction , cushioning the local downturn . 
Finally , Europe faces a severe governance deficit . 
Citizens are becoming increasingly disenchanted with European elites and supra-national institutions such as the European Commission , which impose rules and regulations that conflict with their countries &apos; economic interests and sovereignty . 
Voters are restless , as the Greek election result demonstrated . 
Nationalist sentiment is rising , and demagogic parties of the far right and left are gaining in every poll . 
Addressing these problems will be difficult , but not impossible . 
The core challenge is fiscal ; 
Europe cannot escape the need to scale back its sclerotic welfare states . 
By recognizing that , and implementing the following series of mutually reinforcing policies , the continent can move beyond its current torpor . 
Gradual fiscal consolidation - reducing the projected future size of government spending , and hence future tax rates - will have to be at the center of the effort . 
This should be combined with the mutualization of some portion of the liabilities of highly indebted countries - defined as a debt-to-GDP ratio above , say , 60 % or 70 % - and modest write-downs in exchange for long-term zero-coupon bonds . 
The &quot; Brady bonds &quot; that the US used to help resolve the Latin American debt crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model . 
Meanwhile , Europe &apos;s zombie banks will have to be rapidly resolved by acquisition or temporary takeover , cleanup , and asset sale , as was done by the Resolution Trust Corporation during the US savings and loan crisis in the 1980s . 
Structural reforms that increase labor-market flexibility and reduce red tape and related obstacles to new business formation must also be implemented . 
Finally , the eurozone should adopt a two-track euro with a fluctuating exchange rate - an idea championed by the American economist Allan Meltzer . 
Systematic rules would have to be developed to determine when members of the eurozone are demoted to &quot; euro B &quot; or promoted to &quot; euro A. &quot; 
Such a halfway house - call it &quot; depreciation without departure &quot; - would avoid some ( but not all ) of the problems of a country &apos;s complete withdrawal from the eurozone . 
It would create its own set of incentives , which , on balance , would pressure individual countries to avoid demotion , just as top-tier football ( soccer ) teams seek to avoid relegation to the minor leagues . 
Together , these policies would reduce sovereign debt , lower interest rates , ameliorate tax pressures , enable countries to increase competitiveness with fewer sacrifices to living standards , and provide Europe with a road map to prosperity . 
Until now , the EU &apos;s leaders have followed the easiest , but least productive path , patching temporary , partial fixes on problems as they erupt . 
The possibility of a brighter economic future should be a prize large enough to evoke the same type of leadership through which Europe rose from the ashes of World War II .
