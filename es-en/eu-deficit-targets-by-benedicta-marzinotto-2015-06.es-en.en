Europe &apos;s Pointless Deficit Targets ? 
BRUSSELS - The fiscal rules of the European Union have undergone some much-needed improvements in recent years , but much more needs to be done . 
In addition to suffering from a lack of clarity on key issues , EU fiscal policy remains overly focused on short-term goals , reflected in its needless emphasis on nominal deficit targets within annual budget cycles . 
To be sure , all EU countries have a real interest in the fiscal sustainability of their fellow members . 
But annual deficits are poor approximations of the likelihood that one member may have to repay another &apos;s debt . 
The fact that the existence of exceptional circumstances can now be invoked to distribute the burden of any needed adjustments over more than one year is helpful . 
But it does not eliminate the short-term bias embedded in the EU &apos;s fiscal rules . 
In a fully integrated market , the annual financing of government deficits should not be an issue , provided the stock of debt is sustainable . 
That is why the EU should strive to create a fiscal framework that has the sole objective of ensuring that its members &quot; debts are sustainable . 
By definition , this target would be country-specific . 
It would not require a headline deficit of below 3 % of GDP in each and every year , in each and every country . 
But it would require a more sophisticated analytical framework than the current one , which merely distinguishes between countries on the basis of whether they meet the EU &apos;s 60 % -of-GDP ceiling on public debt . 
The eurozone is much better positioned to manage fiscal pressures than it once was . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; scheme provides an important backstop for debt sustainability . 
And a banking union , once completed , should contain the risk of financial crisis and contagion . 
Meanwhile , quantitative easing by the ECB has reduced fears that governments will run out of cash , at least for the time being . 
Efforts to make the rules more flexible are a welcome development , but shortcomings remain , particularly given that implementation risks make the macroeconomic effects of rule changes difficult to quantify . 
For example , it is not obvious how to deal with the fact that decisions by large countries have larger externalities , both positive and negative , than those made by their smaller peers , setting the ground for different treatment in a monetary union of supposed equals . 
Nor is it clear what room for discretion has been provided to the European Commission to address such outcomes . 
Above all , long-term fiscal outlooks must be fully embedded in the EU and its member states . 
Institutions will have to be redesigned to accommodate this approach and resolve some of the ambiguities in the current framework , while avoiding discrimination or politicization . 
One possible vehicle for accomplishing this is the independent councils that the EU &apos;s so-called fiscal compact has now made mandatory for every country in the eurozone . 
These councils are tasked with assessing the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts , overseeing compliance with targets , and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability . 
But it remains unclear exactly how they fit into the overall fiscal framework ; indeed , the complexity of EU rules may limit the councils &quot; capacity to fulfill their function . 
Fiscal councils should not be put in the position of trying to interpret the letter of the fiscal compact . 
It would be far better to provide them with the sole task of assessing debt sustainability and advising governments in this regard . 
Their recommendations should be binding , but they should also be focused on the medium term , rather than on annual fiscal outcomes . 
In a few cases , fiscal councils might impose conditions that are even more stringent than current EU rules stipulate , but they would be limited to enforcing the structural balance that each signatory of the fiscal compact has enshrined in its constitution or in equally binding legislation . 
In other cases , the councils &quot; recommendations are likely to be more relaxed on an annual basis than current EU rules . 
Either way , the recommendations would have the advantage of being better adapted to local needs - especially if the councils are accountable to national parliaments . 
The best way to preserve the councils &quot; independence over time would be through top-down monitoring and control at the eurozone level , for example through the establishment of a European Fiscal Council , which would be responsible for ensuring that every national council fulfills its mandate . 
The EFC would be authorized to request an amended assessment of a country &apos;s fiscal trajectory and requirements . 
With such limited authority , there would be no need for the EFC to be accountable or democratically legitimated at the European level . 
In addition to favoring a long-term perspective , this governance structure would also answer some of the questions that arise with increased flexibility . 
Independent national authorities would be better placed not only to assess implementation risks , but also to advocate for structural reforms . 
Moreover , such a system would imply little risk of top-down discrimination against smaller countries . 
As national governments took responsibility for the European objective of fiscal sustainability , annual budget targets imposed by the EU would become obsolete , at which point that should be abandoned altogether .
