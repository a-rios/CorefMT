The Powerlessness of the Powerful 
NEW YORK - Elites are under siege in every corner of the world . 
&quot; Tea Party &quot; activists in exurban America rant and rage against the so-called liberal elites of New York , Washington , and Hollywood . 
In Europe , populist demagogues , such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands , rant and rage against the elitist &quot; appeasers &quot; of Islam . 
In Thailand , red-shirted demonstrators from the country &apos;s rural northeast rant and rage against the military , social , and political elites of Bangkok . 
The first principle of democracy is that government must be based on popular consent , even if the government is made up of parties for which many people did not vote . 
It is clear from the worldwide rage against elected governments that this consent is becoming dangerously threadbare . 
More and more people in democratic countries feel unrepresented , anxious , and angry . 
And they blame the elites . 
The phenomenon is worldwide , but its causes differ from country to country . 
American populism is not the same as Thai populism . 
Culture and race play important roles in the United States - the culture of carrying guns , for example , and the discomfort at having a black , Harvard-educated president who talks like a law professor . 
In Thailand , the rage stems from the perceived neglect of the rural poor by the ruling class , backed by big business , the army , and the king . 
The populist billionaire and former Prime Minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , appeared to be different . 
He used some of his vast wealth to shower money on rural areas . 
Rural people , grateful for his largesse , voted for him twice . 
Authoritarian , crude , and somewhat megalomaniacal ( almost as though he were a king himself ) , Thaksin was a Thai version of Silvio Berlusconi . 
He was removed from office in 2006 , following a bloodless military coup that was supported by the Bangkok middle class , whose members took to the streets in yellow T-shirts ( the color of the Thai monarchy ) . 
Today &apos;s ongoing pro-Thaksin red-shirt rebellion is a form of revenge . 
In Europe , the power of the European Union , often-uncontrolled immigration , and economic globalization are challenging feelings of national belonging , of being represented by national governments , or of sharing national cultures . 
Demagogues who denounce multiculturalism and warn of the &quot; Islamization &quot; of the West are exploiting the resultant fears about the loss of national identity . 
The sense that globalization is creating new classes of haves and have-nots is a factor that inflames most current forms of populism , regardless of national differences . 
At the same time , new technology , without which globalization would not be possible , is being used to mobilize people for populist causes , too . 
The heroine of the US Tea Party movement , Sarah Palin , is as much a creature of twittering and the vast new blogosphere as she is of television and radio - perhaps more so . 
Indeed , the shift of public debate from the mainstream press to the Internet has helped to break down the authority of traditional elites : newspaper editors , political columnists , academics , politicians . 
In cyberspace , anyone can have his or her say . 
This is more democratic , no doubt , but it has made it harder for people to sift nonsense from truth , or demagoguery from rational political debate . 
The tone of populist movements , whether in Europe , Asia , or the US , would suggest that the elites are too powerful , that they dominate the little people , whose voices are drowned out by the liberals , the multiculturalists , and the city slickers . 
This is a common form of populist paranoia , promoted in the US by radio talk-show hosts and Fox television , and in Europe by men like Wilders . 
To some extent , the elites have themselves to blame . 
Immigration in Europe has been messy , and those who complained were too quickly dismissed as racists . 
After endorsing a military coup to get rid of Thaksin , the yellow-shirts of Bangkok can hardly blame the red-shirts for using undemocratic tactics to force the current government to step down . 
American liberals , too , are often guilty of sneering at the tastes and habits of their provincial countrymen . 
There is , however , another way to look at the worldwide surge of populism . 
The real problem of traditional elites may not be too much power , but too little . 
The lack of trust in political elites is linked to a suspicion , which is not entirely irrational , that elected governments have little authority . 
The real power , people suspect , is lodged elsewhere - on Wall Street , in the unelected EU bureaucracy , in the Royal Thai Army and the Royal Palace . 
What people crave in uncertain times is strong leadership from charismatic figures who promise to sweep the stables , get rid of corruption , and stand up for the little man against selfish politicians and against foreigners who threaten us with strange habits and religions . 
Such times are dangerous for democracy , because they endanger popular consent to democratic governments . 
To regain respect , our elected politicians will have to show more authority , not less . 
US President Barack Obama is right to call for more regulation of financial markets . 
In Europe , either the EU must become more democratic , which will take a long time , or national governments must delegate less to the bureaucrats in Brussels . 
Thailand might face the hardest problems . 
Reliance on a self-promoting tycoon like Thaksin is not the best way to boost democracy , but nor is reliance on military coups and kingly intervention . 
Most Thais would agree about the military . 
And it is illegal to even begin to discuss the role of the king . 
But without discussion , democracy is surely doomed .
