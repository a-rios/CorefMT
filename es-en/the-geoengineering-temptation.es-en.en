The Geoengineering Temptation 
NEW BRUNSWICK - Let &apos;s be clear : man-made global warming is real . 
As a result of all the carbon dioxide , methane , soot , and other substances that we human beings pump into the atmosphere every year , global average temperatures have been rising over the past half-century . 
While some northern countries relish the prospect of extracting minerals from an ice-free Arctic Ocean and using the Northwest Passage , global warming is not good for most of the planet . 
After all , it means continued sea-level rise , stronger storms and more frequent flooding , drier and longer-lasting droughts , enhanced heat-stress episodes , ocean acidification ( destroying corals and other sea life ) , and the northward migration of malarial mosquitoes and pine beetles . 
Moreover , fundamental threats to the food and water supply - especially food in the tropics and water in the subtropics - are coming if we continue business as usual . 
Unlike the questions surrounding climate change and its consequences , all of which can be answered by scientists , what we want to do about it depends on values - that is , what is important to us . 
The choices , singly or in combination , are : 1 ) nothing ( the current response ) ; 2 ) mitigation ( reducing emissions of greenhouse gases ) ; 3 ) attempted adaptation to the ongoing climate changes ; and 4 ) geoengineering . 
If you are a big oil or coal company , your choice will be nothing . 
You would choose to continue to make as much money as possible , while the consumers of your products use the atmosphere as a sewer , with no sewerage charge . 
And you would spend money on public-relations firms and charlatans to try to confuse the public about the science so that you could continue this as long as possible , just like tobacco companies did recently about the safety of smoking . 
( Indeed , you would use some of the same firms and charlatans . ) 
But if you are like me , and want to minimize the damage to people and all other living things on Earth , then you choose mitigation and , where necessary , adaptation . 
As for geoengineering , we do not yet have enough information to decide , but preliminary studies show that it presents more problems than it solves . 
There are basically two quite different and separate types of actions that have been labeled geoengineering . 
One , carbon dioxide reduction ( CDR ) , involves removing from the atmosphere the main gas that is causing global warming . 
In general , this is a good idea , but so far it seems rather expensive , and nobody has yet designed a system to then sequester the carbon and keep it out of the atmosphere . 
CDR proposals include artificial trees that use chemicals to capture the CO2 , and then pump it underground or under the ocean ; planting fast-growing trees and then burying them ; and fertilizing the ocean with iron to make plankton grow faster , hoping they will fall to the ocean bottom . 
This last idea has not been shown to work , and may severely damage the entire ocean ecosystem , but the first two are being worked on . 
The other geoengineering idea , solar radiation management ( SRM ) , envisions cooling Earth by putting mirrors in space , pumping salt spray from ships into clouds to make them brighter , or filling the stratosphere with a sulfuric acid cloud , just as volcanic eruptions occasionally do . 
But volcanic eruptions teach us that , while a cloud in the stratosphere would indeed cool the planet and stop ice from melting and the sea from rising , it would also destroy ozone and produce regional droughts . 
There are other potential problems with SRM in the stratosphere . 
For example , it would do nothing to stop ocean acidification . 
More importantly , there is no way for us to decide what temperature Earth should be . 
Whose hand would be on the thermostat ? 
What if Russia and Canada wanted Earth to be warmer , and sinking islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific want it to be cooler ? 
What if the technology was used for military purposes , or a big multinational corporation had a large role ? 
Would you be happy with no more blue skies ( but nice yellow and red sunsets ) , or never being able to see the Milky Way ? 
If we somehow lost the will or means to continue to produce the stratospheric cloud , temperatures would skyrocket , much faster than they are increasing now . 
All this underscores the need for further study . 
We have to be able to quantify the benefits , risks , and costs of geoengineering , and compare them to the benefits , risks , and costs of our other options , so that we can make an informed decision . 
SRM might be needed in a planetary emergency - say , if continued warming rapidly accelerates ice-sheet melting and sea-level rise , or if it accelerates methane and CO2 emissions from thawing tundra , which would then accelerate the warming itself . 
But geoengineering is not a magic solution to global warming . 
Right now , it looks even more dangerous . 
So we must redouble our efforts to shift our economies to a post-carbon world , while still allowing the billions of people without adequate food , water , and education to improve their lives . This offers tremendous economic opportunities , if we can just put a price on the dangers to the planet of current carbon emissions .
