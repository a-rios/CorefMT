The Harm of Regulatory Disharmony 
LONDON - In the alphabet soup of institutions involved in the regulation of global financial markets , the FMLC - the Financial Markets Law Committee - is not very prominent . 
Given that it is based only in London , having grown out of an initiative by the Bank of England 20 years ago , and that most of its members are lawyers , most banks have not even heard of it ( though some of them are represented on its Council ) . 
But the services provided by the FMLC have never been more necessary . 
The FMLC &apos;s mission is to identify and propose solutions to issues of legal uncertainty in financial markets that might create risks in the future . 
As a recent FMLC paper showed , the wave of new regulations implemented since the global financial crisis - many of which were poorly planned or inconsistent across countries - has left a jumbled landscape of legal uncertainties . 
Consider banks &quot; capital requirements . 
The Basel 3 Accord , adherence to which increased the liquidity of all banks and decreased their leverage , is viewed as a firm standard in some parts of the world . 
But , in others , it is regarded as a minimum to which additional rules may be added . 
Such &quot; super-equivalence &quot; or , more colloquially , &quot; gold-plating &quot; creates inconsistencies across jurisdictions , thereby facilitating regulatory arbitrage . 
Likewise , the European Union , in contrast to the United States , regards the leverage ratio as a supervisory optional extra , known as a &quot; Pillar 2 measure &quot; ( which permits supervisors to add additional capital buffers to address a particular bank &apos;s idiosyncratic risks ) . 
And , though both the US and the EU prohibit proprietary trading , they each define it differently . 
There are also inconsistencies between the US and the EU in derivatives-market reform , which the Financial Stability Board has warned could undermine the objectives , set out by the G-20 , of greater standardization of contracts and enhanced transparency . 
And , whereas the Basel standards continue to refer extensively to credit ratings as the basis for assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers , the Dodd-Frank Act in the US moves away from reliance on ratings . 
Such differences - and the FMLC Council lists many more - reflect a dangerous shift in the world &apos;s approach to regulation . 
The early post-crisis enthusiasm for new , globally agreed regulatory standards has given way to a range of national initiatives , driven by domestic political agendas , with little regard for cross-border compatibility . 
More problematic , the peer-review procedures that have been introduced so far will do little , if anything , to resolve the problem . 
Nor do the memoranda of understanding drawn up by national financial regulators offer hope of salvation . 
According to the FMLC paper , &quot; they are usually the subject of interpretative disagreement , are not legally binding , do not benefit from any binding dispute-resolution mechanisms , and do not prevent national authorities from acting unilaterally . &quot; 
So what can be done ? 
The FMLC makes four important recommendations . 
First , the Financial Stability Board should help to reduce avoidable inconsistencies across countries by propagating a set of high-level principles to which all member countries would be expected to conform when introducing new regulations . 
Indeed , the need for such principles should have been recognized in 2009 , when the wave of re-regulation began . 
Second , to address existing regulatory conflicts , the FMLC recommends establishing a &quot; conflict of regulation &quot; framework to determine which legal regime - that of a global firm &apos;s home country or that of its local subsidiary &apos;s host country - has jurisdiction in a specific cross-border dispute . 
The alternative of relying on a third-party multilateral organization to act as mediator in such disputes , the report explains , has little support from G-20 countries . 
Third , the FMLC proposes expanding the Financial Stability Board &apos;s mandate . 
That body , which emerged from the old Financial Stability Forum in 2009 with few powers and no formal status , has only recently become a separate legal entity . 
Strengthening its powers - to include , for example , the establishment of principles for addressing cross-border legal inconsistencies - could go a long way toward addressing the problems raised by regulatory disparities . 
Finally , the FMLC calls for the establishment of a permanent G-20 secretariat to improve continuity and coordination across G-20 presidencies . 
As it stands , political priorities are constantly in flux , with individual dossiers losing their centrality , and even vanishing , from year to year . 
Regulatory uncertainty may not seem like the most exciting topic , which is probably why the FMLC report has attracted so little attention . 
But , as the 2008 global financial crisis starkly demonstrated , it can render markets dysfunctional , with ambiguity about different regulators &quot; responsibilities making it difficult , even impossible , to address the problems caused by failing firms . 
( Former US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner &apos;s crisis memoir makes that point painfully clear . ) 
When I chaired the United Kingdom &apos;s regulatory body , the Financial Services Authority , I believed in the idea that lawyers should be on tap , not on top . 
But they should always be heard . 
The FMLC &apos;s influential lawyers have spoken . 
The world should listen .
