America &apos;s Three Deficits 
BERKELEY - This year began with a series of reports providing tantalizing evidence that economic recovery in the United States is strengthening . 
The pace of job creation has increased , indicators for manufacturing and services have improved , and consumption spending has been stronger than anticipated . 
But it is too early to celebrate . 
Output growth in the US remains anemic , and the economy continues to face three significant deficits : a jobs deficit , an investment deficit , and a long-run fiscal deficit , none of which is likely to be addressed in an election year . 
Although output is now higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2007 , it remains far below what could be produced if labor and capacity were fully utilized . 
That gap - between actual and potential output - is estimated at more than 7 % of GDP ( more than $ 1 trillion ) . 
The output gap reflects a deficit of more than 12 million jobs - the number of jobs needed to return to the economy &apos;s peak 2007 employment level and absorb the 125,000 people who enter the labor force each month . 
Even if the economy grows at 2.5 % in 2012 , as most forecasts anticipate , the jobs deficit will remain - and will not be closed until 2024 . 
America &apos;s jobs deficit is primarily the result of inadequate aggregate demand . 
Consumption , which accounts for about 70 % of total spending , is constrained by high unemployment , weak wage gains , and a steep decline in home values and consumer wealth . 
The uptick in consumption in the last months of 2011 was financed by a decline in the household saving rate and a large increase in consumer credit . 
Neither of these trends is healthy or sustainable . 
With an unemployment rate of 8.5 % , a labor-force participation rate of only 64 % , and stagnant real wages , labor income has fallen to an historic low of 44 % of national income . 
And labor income is the most important component of household earnings , the major driver of consumption spending . 
Even before the Great Recession , American workers and households were in trouble . 
The rate of job growth between 2000 and 2007 slowed to only half its level in the three preceding decades . 
Productivity growth was strong , but far outpaced wage growth , and workers &quot; real hourly compensation declined , on average , even for those with a university education . 
Indeed , the 2002-2007 period was the only recovery on record during which the median family &apos;s real income declined . 
Moreover , job opportunities continued to polarize , with employment growing in high-wage professional , technical , and managerial occupations , as well as in low-wage food-service , personal-care , and protective-service occupations . 
By contrast , employment in middle-skill , white-collar , and blue-collar occupations fell , particularly in manufacturing . 
Hard-pressed American households slashed their savings rates , borrowed against their home equity , and increased their debt to maintain consumption , contributing to the housing and credit bubbles that burst in 2008 , requiring painful deleveraging ever since . 
Three forces have driven the US labor market &apos;s adverse structural changes : 
· 
Skill-biased technological change , which has automated routine work while boosting demand for highly educated workers with at least a college degree . 
· 
Global competition and the integration of labor markets through trade and outsourcing , which have eliminated jobs and depressed wages . 
· 
America &apos;s declining competitiveness as an attractive place to locate production and employment . 
Technological change and globalization have created similar labor-market challenges in other developed countries . 
But US policy choices are responsible for the erosion of America &apos;s competitiveness . 
In particular , the US is underinvesting in three major areas that help countries to create and retain high-wage jobs : skills and training , infrastructure , and research and development . 
Spending in these areas accounts for less than 10 % of US government spending , and this share has been declining over time . 
The federal government can currently borrow at record-low interest rates , and there are many projects in education , infrastructure , and research that would earn a higher return , create jobs now , and bolster US competitiveness in attracting high-wage jobs . 
President Barack Obama has offered numerous proposals to invest in the foundations of national competitiveness , but Congressional Republicans have rebuffed them , claiming that the US faces an impending fiscal crisis . 
In fact , the federal deficit as a share of GDP will shrink significantly over the next several years , even without further deficit-reduction measures , before rising to unsustainable levels by 2030 . 
The US does indeed face a long-run fiscal deficit , largely the result of rising health-care costs and an aging population . 
But the current fiscal deficit mainly reflects weak tax revenues , owing to slow growth and high unemployment , and temporary stimulus measures that are fading away at a time when aggregate demand remains weak and additional fiscal stimulus is warranted . 
At the very least , to keep the economy on course for 2.5 % growth this year , the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits proposed by Obama should be extended through the end of the year . 
These measures would provide insurance to the fragile recovery and add nothing to the long-run fiscal gap . 
So , how should the US economy &apos;s jobs deficit , investment deficit , and long-run fiscal deficit be addressed ? 
Policymakers should pair fiscal measures to ameliorate the jobs and investment deficits now with a multi-year plan to reduce the long-run fiscal deficit gradually . 
This long-run plan should increase spending on education , infrastructure , and research , while curbing future growth in health-care spending through the cost-containment mechanisms contained in Obama &apos;s health-reform legislation . 
Approving a long-run deficit-reduction plan now but deferring its starting date until the economy is near full employment would prevent premature fiscal contraction from tipping the economy back into recession . 
Indeed , enactment of such a package could bolster output and employment growth by easing investor concerns about future deficits and strengthening consumer and business confidence . 
Painful choices about how to close the long-run fiscal gap should be decided now and implemented promptly once the economy has recovered . 
But , for the next few years , the priorities of fiscal policy should be jobs , investment , and growth .
