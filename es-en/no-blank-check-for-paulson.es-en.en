No Blank Check for Paulson 
NEW YORK - US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson &apos;s $ 700billion rescue package has run into difficulty on Capitol Hill . 
Rightly so : it is ill-conceived . 
Congress would be abdicating its responsibility if it gave the Treasury secretary a blank cheque . 
The bill submitted to Congress even had language in it that would exempt the secretary &apos;s decisions from review by any court or administrative agency - the ultimate fulfillment of the Bush administration &apos;s dream of a unitary executive . 
Paulson &apos;s record does not inspire the confidence necessary to give him discretion over $ 700billion . 
His actions last week brought on the crisis that makes rescue necessary . 
On Monday he allowed Lehman Brothers to fail and refused to make government funds available to save AIG . 
By Tuesday he had to reverse himself and provide an $ 85billion loan to AIG on punitive terms . 
The demise of Lehman disrupted the commercial paper market . 
A large money market fund &quot; broke the buck &quot; and investment banks that relied on the commercial paper market had difficulty financing their operations . 
By Thursday a run on money market funds was in full swing and we came as close to a meltdown as at any time since the 1930s . 
Paulson reversed again and proposed a systemic rescue . 
Paulson had gotten a blank cheque from Congress once before . 
That was to deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . 
Within a few weeks the market forced Paulson &apos;s hand and he had to take them over . 
Paulson &apos;s proposal to purchase distressed mortgage-related securities poses a classic problem of asymmetric information . 
The securities are hard to value but the sellers know more about them than the buyer : in any auction process the Treasury would end up with the dregs . 
The proposal is also rife with latent conflict of interest issues . 
Unless the Treasury overpays for the securities , the scheme would not bring relief . 
But if the scheme is used to bail out insolvent banks , what will the taxpayers get in return ? 
Barack Obama has outlined four conditions that ought to be imposed : an upside for the taxpayers as well as a downside ; a bipartisan board to oversee the process ; help for homeowners as well as the holders of the mortgages ; and some limits on the compensation of those who benefit from taxpayers &quot; money . 
These are the right principles . 
They could be applied more effectively by capitalizing the institutions that are burdened by distressed securities directly rather than by relieving them of the distressed securities . 
The injection of government funds would be much less problematic if it were applied to the equity rather than the balance sheet . $ 700billion in preferred stock with warrants may be sufficient to make up the hole created by the bursting of the housing bubble . 
By contrast , the addition of $ 700billion on the demand side may not be sufficient to arrest the decline of housing prices . 
Something also needs to be done on the supply side . 
To prevent housing prices from overshooting on the downside , the number of foreclosures has to be kept to a minimum . 
The terms of mortgages need to be adjusted to the homeowners &quot; ability to pay . 
The rescue package leaves this task undone . 
Making the necessary modifications is a delicate task rendered more difficult by the fact that many mortgages have been sliced up and repackaged in the form of collateralized debt obligations . 
The holders of the various slices have conflicting interests . 
The package can , however , prepare the ground by modifying bankruptcy law as it relates to principal residences . Now that the crisis has been unleashed , a large-scale rescue package is probably indispensable if the crisis is to be brought under control . 
Rebuilding the depleted balance sheets of the banking system is the right way to go . 
Not every bank deserves to be saved , but the experts at the Federal Reserve , with proper supervision , can be counted on to make the right judgments . 
Managements that are reluctant to accept the consequences of past mistakes could be penalized by depriving them of the Fed &apos;s credit facilities . 
Making government funds available should also encourage the private sector to participate in recapitalizing the banking sector and bringing the financial crisis to a close .
