Europe &apos;s Crisis in Ukraine 
STOCKHOLM - How Ukraine &apos;s profound crisis will end is impossible to predict . 
We in the European Union and the United States are doing what we can to secure a peaceful transition to a more stable democracy , and the implementation , at long last , of urgently needed reforms . 
And the agreement now concluded between President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition should create a new possibility for this . 
If the agreement is not honored , Ukraine could well continue its descent into chaos and conflict , which would be in no one &apos;s interest . 
That is why Ukraine &apos;s crisis is a European crisis . 
And , though we cannot know how the crisis will end , we should be very clear about how it started . 
For years , Ukraine sought a closer relationship with the EU . 
Its leaders warmly endorsed the promise of enhanced ties under the EU &apos;s Eastern Partnership , and pushed for an EU Association Agreement , together with a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area . 
When those talks , which began under the previous Ukrainian government , were concluded , the agreement was endorsed by all four presidents and all 14 prime ministers to hold office since Ukraine achieved independence in 1991 . 
But , as the EU and Ukraine were addressing remaining issues ahead of the November 2013 Eastern Partnership summit in Vilnius , where Ukraine was to sign its Association Agreement , something suddenly changed . 
From August onward , Russian policymakers embraced the openly declared aim of knocking Ukraine off the course that it had chosen . 
Russian leaders publicly stated that if Ukraine signed a free-trade agreement with the EU , it would lose its free-trade deal with Russia , and high tariffs would be imposed on all goods and services . 
Severe economic pressure , it was made clear , would become open economic warfare . 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych gave way . 
In explaining to EU leaders that he was not ready to sign the Association Agreement , he was very clear that Russian pressure was responsible for his decision . 
This set in motion the chain of events that has now resulted in carnage and death in the streets of Kyiv . 
For many Ukrainians , Europe was the symbol of hope of a better life ; suddenly , they felt betrayed by a political elite that they had long perceived as being incorrigibly corrupt . 
So , to be clear , it was the Kremlin &apos;s pressure , and the Yanukovych administration &apos;s vacillation , that produced the current crisis . 
Had Yanukovych decided to stand up to Russian pressure , there is no doubt that Ukraine would have faced difficulties . 
But , with an EU Association Agreement and the possibility of solid financial aid and reform assistance from the International Monetary Fund , the Russian measures would not have been sustainable . 
Of course , the reforms asked of Ukraine would have been difficult , but no more difficult than what had been asked of other ex-communist countries that saw their future in and with Europe . 
There would have been light at the end of the tunnel , and , as Ukraine embraced the reform process , it would have been seen as a determined and democratic European country . 
Instead , Yanukovych opted for a short-term strategy narrowly focused on his own political survival - a strategy that the protesters increasingly came to view as a game of deceit and betrayal . 
As the regime started to use violence to repress its opponents , violent opposition groups gained credibility . 
Free trade with both Russia and the EU would obviously have been good for Ukraine &apos;s economy , thus providing a boost to the Russian economy as well , notwithstanding the oft-used but fundamentally bogus argument that EU goods would flow into Russia via Ukraine . 
( Has anyone heard Americans complaining that the free-trade agreement between Mexico and the EU is undermining the US economy ? ) 
Russia is intent on building a new strategic bastion in the form of its proposed Eurasia Union , and it seems determined to force Ukraine to join . 
While publicly grumbling about supposed EU pressure on Ukraine , the reality is that Russia brutally extorted the country into abandoning its EU course . 
That is the source of this crisis ; the facts speak for themselves . 
Even under the best of circumstances , the road back for Ukraine will be difficult . 
Russian pressure and destabilization , and the crisis to which they have led , have created new fissures in Ukraine &apos;s society and have caused further damage to its fragile economy . 
And that damage could , one day , spill over into Russia . 
The Kremlin should have an interest in a stable and reforming neighbor that , like other countries , is also seeking a close relationship with the EU .
