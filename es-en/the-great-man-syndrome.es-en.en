The Great Man Syndrome 
In our globalized age , vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine events . 
Globalized markets , unfettered trade , militant Islam , China &apos;s awakening : these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny . 
But most people don &apos;t see things this way . 
Instead , most people still instinctively look at &quot; great men &quot; as the agents of history , the men ( and women ) who seem to forge events through their political vision , personal charisma , and the force of their moral claims . 
By sheer force of conviction and personality , such figures , many of us believe , can carry the day , bringing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe . 
This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from at least three factors . 
The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world . 
The second , paradoxically , reflects our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians . 
And the third is the result of our media culture , obsessed as it is with putting a &quot; face &quot; to events . 
Confronted with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of &quot; normal &quot; leaders , one looks for new Alexanders to untie the &quot; Gordian knot &quot; and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism . 
For example , structural reforms in Europe are thought impossible to enact unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher . 
In the Middle East , everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat to arise among the Arabs . 
Disillusion with politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders . 
In France for example , the overly flattering commemoration of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand &apos;s death ten years ago primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor , Jacques Chirac . 
Indirect criticism of the present is usually a key element in idealized views of the past . 
The less we expect from a &quot; normal &quot; politician , the more we look for a hero . 
With the world becoming a global stage , the media &apos;s role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential . 
The public demands quick answers to complex problems that , unsolved , risk endangering the planet . 
They need figures with whom they can identify , immediately recognize , and , above all , trust . 
The emergence of an embryonic &quot; world civil society &quot; heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures , holding out the hope of global accountability , but also carrying populist overtones . 
In a world searching for providential leaders , the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical , for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades . 
He has become a nearly revered figure in his country , and large segments of Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region , even as he remains hated in large parts of the Arab and Muslim world . 
Sharon &apos;s transformation from villain to hero within the space of a mere few years is a source of fascination for his people , the region , and the world - all the more so because his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless dispute among historians tomorrow and among politicians claiming to be his faithful heirs today . 
Was Sharon really convinced by demographers that the &quot; Great Israel &quot; that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of a Jewish State , or did his disengagement strategy of &quot; Gaza first &quot; really mean &quot; Gaza last &quot; ? 
For those who support one or the other reading , Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt . 
That Sharon &apos;s stroke could be compared - in terms of political consequences - with the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates that his personality had become associated with hope and security . 
The &quot; bulldozer &quot; had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy , for Americans and , surprisingly , for Europeans , too . 
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement . 
In fact , one may wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because it wanted so much to believe that there was still &quot; hope around the corner &quot; in the Middle East . 
Was this wishful thinking or self-fulfilling prophecy ? 
We will never know . 
What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon &apos;s departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated , and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes . 
Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily . 
Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes , and this is probably a good thing , for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions , which is far from true . 
The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress &quot; at the margin , &quot; but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs . 
Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man , with all the hopes - and dangers - that this entails .
