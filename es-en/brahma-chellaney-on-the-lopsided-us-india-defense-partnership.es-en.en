Arming the Elephant 
NEW DELHI - The rise in US arms sales to India is being widely cited as evidence of the two countries &quot; deepening defense relationship . 
Does the recently issued Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation , which establishes intent to move beyond weapons sales to the co-production of military hardware , mark a turning point , or is it merely a contrivance to placate India ? 
The factors driving the strategic relationship &apos;s development are obvious . 
Since 2006 , bilateral trade has quadrupled , reaching roughly $ 100 billion this year . 
With US military spending slowing and other export markets remaining tight , American defense firms are eager to expand sales to India , which is now the world &apos;s largest arms importer . 
For the US , displacing Russia as India &apos;s leading arms supplier was a major diplomatic triumph , akin to Egypt &apos;s decision during the Cold War to shift its allegiance - and its arms supplier - from the Soviet Union to America . 
The difference is that India can actually pay for the weapons that it acquires . 
And the bills are substantial . 
In recent years , India has ordered American arms worth roughly $ 9 billion . 
It is now purchasing additional US weapons systems - 22 Apache attack helicopters , six C-130J turbo military transport aircraft , 15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters , and 145 M-777 ultra-light howitzers - worth $ 5 billion . 
The value of India &apos;s arms contracts with US firms exceeds that of American military aid to any country except Israel . 
Nirupama Rao , India &apos;s ambassador to the US , has called such defense transactions &quot; the new frontier &quot; in US-India relations and &quot; a very promising one at that . &quot; 
The problem is that India &apos;s defense sector has virtually nothing that it can sell to the US . 
In fact , India depends on imports - not only from major suppliers like the US and Russia , but also from Israel , the world &apos;s sixth-largest arms exporter - to meet even basic defense needs . 
Moreover , India &apos;s leaders have not leveraged the bargaining power afforded by its massive arms purchases to advance national interests . 
They could , for example , try to persuade the US to stop selling arms to Pakistan , or secure better access to the American market for India &apos;s highly competitive IT and pharmaceutical sectors , which are facing new US non-tariff barriers . 
Applying the recent declaration on defense cooperation will not be easy . 
For example , efforts to identify specific opportunities for collaborative weapons-related projects are to be pursued in accordance with &quot; national policies and procedures . &quot; 
Similarly , the declaration merely reiterates America &apos;s position that it supports India &apos;s &quot; full membership &quot; in the four US-led technology-control regimes : the Wassenaar Arrangement , the Nuclear Suppliers Group , the Missile Technology Control Regime , and the Australia Group . 
Given that US policy is to deny sensitive technologies to those outside these regimes , India &apos;s admission would make all the difference in facilitating technology sharing . 
All of this suggests that the US is pandering to India &apos;s desire for a more equal defense relationship . 
It is willing to co-produce with India some smaller defensive systems , such as Javelin anti-tank missiles , in order to pave the way for more multi-billion-dollar deals for US-made systems . 
The Indian media are doing their part to strengthen the illusion of progress , latching onto the phrase &quot; closest partners &quot; in their acclaim for the agreement . 
The irony is that , while America &apos;s pursuit of a stronger defense relationship with India is aimed largely at offsetting an increasingly assertive China , US President Barack Obama has charted a neutral course in Sino-Indian disputes . 
For example , the US has declined to hold joint military exercises in the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh , which China has claimed as &quot; South Tibet &quot; since 2006 . 
As it stands , the US sells mainly defensive weapons systems to India , while Russia , for example , offers India offensive weapons , including strategic bombers , an aircraft carrier , and a lease on a nuclear submarine . 
Would the US be willing to sell India offensive weapons - including high-precision conventional arms , anti-submarine systems , and long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles - that could help to deter Chinese military preemption ? 
As US-India defense cooperation broadens , this question will loom ever larger .
