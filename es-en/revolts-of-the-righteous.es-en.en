Revolts of the Righteous 
It has become fashionable in certain smart circles to regard atheism as a sign of superior education , of a more highly evolved civilization , of enlightenment . 
Recent bestsellers suggest that religious faith is really a sign of backwardness , the mark of primitives stuck in the dark ages who are yet to catch up with scientific reason . 
Religion , we are told , is responsible for violence , oppression , poverty , and many other ills . 
It is not difficult to find examples to back up such assertions . 
But can religion also be a force for good ? 
Indeed , are there cases where religious faith comes to the rescue even of those who don &apos;t have it ? 
Since I have never had either the benefits or misfortunes of adhering to any religion , it might smack of hypocrisy for me to defend those who have . 
But watching the Burmese monks on television defy the security forces of one of the world &apos;s most oppressive regimes , it is hard not to see some merit in religious belief . 
Burma is a deeply religious country , where most men spend some time as Buddhist monks . 
Even the most thuggish Burmese dictator must hesitate before unleashing lethal force on men dressed in the maroon and saffron robes of their faith . 
The Burmese monks , together with nuns in pink robes , were soon joined by students , actors , and others who want to be rid of the military junta . 
But it was the monks and nuns who took the first step ; they dared to protest when others had mostly given up . 
And they did so with the moral authority of their Buddhist faith . 
Romantics might say that Buddhism is unlike other religions - indeed , more a philosophy than a faith . 
But Buddhism has been a religion in different parts of Asia for many centuries , and , like any other belief , it can be used to justify violent acts . 
One need only look at Sri Lanka , where Buddhism is lashed to ethnic chauvinism in the slow-burning civil war between Buddhist Singhalese and Hindu Tamils . 
Just as the Buddhists risked their lives to stand up for democracy in Burma , Christians have done so in other countries . 
The Marcos regime in the Philippines was doomed in the mid-1980 &quot; s from the moment the Catholic Church turned against it . 
Thousands of ordinary citizens defied the tanks when Marcos threatened to crush &quot; People Power &quot; with force , but the presence of priests and nuns gave the rebellion its moral authority . 
Many political dissidents in South Korea were inspired by their Christian beliefs , and the same is true in China . 
And no one can deny the religious authority of Pope John Paul II as a spur to Poland &apos;s rebellion against Communist dictatorship in the 1980 &quot; s . 
True believers would no doubt see the hand of God in these stirring events . 
Ferdinand Marcos &apos;s main opponent , Cory Aquino , actually boasted of having a direct pipeline to the Lord . 
As a non-believer , I am bound to treat such claims with skepticism . 
But the moral power of religious faith does not need a supernatural explanation . 
Its strength is belief itself - belief in a moral order that defies secular , or , indeed , religious dictators . 
Active resisters to the Nazis during World War II were often devout Christians . 
Some sheltered Jews  -  despite their own prejudices  -  simply because they saw it as their religious duty to do so . 
Nor does faith have to be in a supernatural being . 
Men and women who found strength in their belief in Communism resisted the Nazis with equal tenacity . 
Despite the horrific violence of Islamist fanatics , it should not be forgotten that the mosque can also be a legitimate basis for resistance against the mostly secular dictatorships in the Middle East today . 
In a world of political oppression and moral corruption , religious values offer an alternative moral universe . 
This alternative is not necessarily more democratic , but it can be . 
Nevertheless , the danger of all dogmas , religious or secular , is that they lead to different forms of oppression . 
The revolt against Soviet domination in Afghanistan was led by holy warriors who then imposed their own form of misrule . 
Moreover , charismatic leadership can be problematic even when it takes a benign form . 
The Madonna-like status of Cory Aquino in the Philippines was inspiring in the heady days of People Power , but did little to bolster the institutions of a secular democracy . 
In Poland , once the battle against Communism was won , the Solidarity movement was soon sundered by conflicts between secular democrats and believers who looked to the Church for guidance . 
Faith has an especially important role to play in politics in circumstances where secular liberals are rendered impotent , as in the case of Nazi occupation , Communist rule , or military dictatorship . 
Liberals are most needed when compromises have to be made , but not nearly as useful when faced with brute force . 
That is when visionaries , romantics , and true believers are driven by their beliefs to take risks that most of us would regard as foolhardy . 
It is , on the whole , not beneficial to be ruled by such heroes , but it is good to have heroes around when they are needed .
