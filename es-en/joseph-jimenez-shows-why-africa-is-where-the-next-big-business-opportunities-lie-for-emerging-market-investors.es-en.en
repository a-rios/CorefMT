A Healthier , Wealthier Africa 
ZURICH - The BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) have long been the focus of emerging-market investors . 
But it is in Africa , a region with the world &apos;s second-fastest growth , where the next big business opportunities lie . 
In about one-third of the continent &apos;s 55 countries , annual GDP growth is above 6 % , and Sub-Saharan Africa grew at an estimated 5.1 % pace in 2013 . 
Foreign investors report that their return on investment in Africa is higher than in any other emerging region . 
By 2040 , the continent &apos;s working-age population will total an estimated 1.1 billion people , providing businesses with a larger labor pool than even China or India . 
Moreover , economic expansion is taking place not just in urban centers , but in small towns and villages as well . 
However , Africa also faces major challenges . 
One of the biggest concerns is inadequate health care . 
Preventable and treatable diseases plague the population . 
Life expectancy is 14 years below the global average . 
Nearly one in 20 adults in the 15-49 age group in Sub-Saharan Africa lives with HIV - roughly six times the global average . 
Every minute , an African child dies from malaria . 
Africa &apos;s rapid economic growth and urbanization are also creating new health challenges . 
Non-communicable diseases are projected to become the most common causes of death by 2030 . 
The number of diabetes cases , for example , is expected nearly to double over the next two decades . 
If left unaddressed , the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases could jeopardize Africa &apos;s economic potential . 
To avoid this , three critical areas of health care must be addressed : technology , infrastructure , and education . 
Africa has witnessed some remarkable technological leaps . 
A decade ago , telecoms infrastructure was almost non-existent . 
Today , one in six people owns a mobile phone , the benefits of which go far beyond easy communication . 
Africa has pioneered the use of mobile banking , with local players like M-Pesa and global corporations like Citi demonstrating how new technology can provide vital financial services to the unbanked population . 
Mobile money and digital wallets accessed on cellphones eliminate the need for physical cash in rural areas , where financial services are limited and carrying large amounts of cash is risky . 
Joining this mobile-phone revolution , Novartis is working with five African governments and private-sector partners to improve drug distribution and monitor the supply of anti-malaria medicines in rural areas , using text messaging and electronic mapping . 
Previously , patients would travel to distant health clinics only to find that the medicines that they needed were no longer in stock . 
Now , thanks to the SMS for Life project , vital medicines can be quickly redistributed to where they are most needed . 
A second crucial aspect of improving Africa &apos;s health care is infrastructure . 
Good rail lines , roads , and ports allow products and services to be distributed widely at lower cost , and to benefit from economies of scale . 
This is an essential component of any country &apos;s economic development . 
And nowhere are the benefits more evident than in the provision of health care . 
Fortunately , several companies are rising to the challenge . 
Coca-Cola , for example , is contributing its supply-chain expertise to map out health facilities and implement stock-management software to support the distribution of bed nets , contraceptives , anti-AIDS drugs , and vaccines to remote villages . 
Meanwhile , Novartis is piloting a &quot; social venture &quot; business model to give poor people in remote villages access to vital medicines that are packaged in small , affordable doses . 
Finally , education is one of the most powerful tools for reducing poverty and generating sustainable , inclusive economic growth . 
But , given limited resources and few teachers , too many children are being left behind . 
Public-private partnerships are helping to change this . 
The IT company Cisco , for example , works with NGOs to connect communities and help students develop skills in information and communications technology . 
Poor education also affects health . 
Although Africa accounts for one-seventh of the world &apos;s population , it bears one-quarter of the global disease burden , yet has a mere 2 % of the world &apos;s doctors . 
Unsurprisingly , many health problems stem from ignorance about diseases and basic hygiene . 
So Novartis has formed a partnership with the Earth Institute , the United Nations , and private-sector groups to train and deploy by 2015 a million community health workers in Sub-Saharan Africa to deliver basic treatment and preventive care , and to track disease outbreaks . 
The idea is that local people will learn how to support their communities , rather than rely on handouts , and thereby lift themselves out of poverty permanently . 
Africa is increasingly showing signs of its promise , but innovative solutions to improve its people &apos;s health are essential if the continent is to approach its potential . 
This will require more than philanthropy : it will demand new commercial models that solve health-care issues , help the economy to grow , and benefit those who invest in Africa &apos;s future .
