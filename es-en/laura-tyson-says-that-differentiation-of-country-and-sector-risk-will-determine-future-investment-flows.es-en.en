Sentiment and Sensibility in Emerging Markets 
BERKELEY - Emerging market economies have experienced hard times in recent months . 
Net capital flows to these economies declined by an estimated $ 122 billion , or about 9.6 % year on year , in 2013 , and fell sharply again during the first two months of this year . 
What is driving the decline , and how long will it continue ? 
Global investors have become more risk-averse in response to expectations of tighter monetary conditions in the United States and Europe , as well as concerns about China &apos;s slowing growth and its negative effects on global demand and commodity prices . 
The unexpected Crimea crisis , anxiety about Russia &apos;s intentions in the region , and Western sanctions have further unnerved already skittish investors . 
From 2002 to 2007 , and again after the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 , capital flows to emerging economies surged , as global investors searched for yield in conditions of slow growth and recession in developed countries , low interest rates , and ample liquidity . 
During this period , investors overlooked individual countries &quot; economic and political risks , lumping very different economies into a single &quot; asset class , &quot; which was viewed as a one-way bet . 
Flows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , portfolio equity , and portfolio debt to emerging markets reached record highs , with portfolio debt , the most volatile and most sensitive to sudden shifts in investor sentiment , growing the fastest . 
Unfortunately , several emerging economies - with the notable exception of China - relied on these abnormally large capital flows to finance domestic demand , and their current accounts slid into unsustainably large deficits . 
Their real exchange rates also appreciated , eroding external competitiveness . 
The emerging economies hit hardest by short-term capital outflows and equity-market declines during the last year had experienced large appreciations in their real exchange rates and large deteriorations in their current-account positions . 
In response to heightened sensitivity to risk and unanticipated losses on their emerging-market assets , investors have become more discriminating , differentiating among countries and sectors . 
Mexico , with its popular and reform-minded government , strong growth , and a current-account deficit below 2 % of GDP , has gained favor with investors , who have turned away from Brazil , with its political risk , faltering growth , and yawning external deficit . 
At the sector level , businesses providing consumer goods to the growing middle class in emerging markets have become more attractive to global investors , while capital-intensive and cyclical businesses have lost their luster . 
Three of the largest emerging markets - India , China , and Russia - confront distinctive challenges . 
India is suffering from a marked growth slowdown , substantial fiscal and current-account deficits , labor-market rigidities , and uncertainty about economic policy until after its month-long general election ends in May . 
The Russian economy was slowing even before the Kremlin &apos;s destabilizing incursion into Crimea . 
Now Russia is teetering on the brink of recession and expects capital outflows to top $ 70 billion during the first quarter of this year , exceeding the outflows for all of 2013 . With its excess of domestic saving and its maintenance of capital controls , China is comparatively insulated from volatility in short-term flows . 
But global investors &quot; sentiment about China manifests itself in a variety of ways , including in the Hong Kong stock market , where many Chinese companies have dual listings , and in the performance of China-tracking exchange-traded funds . 
Right now , sentiment is decidedly bearish , reflecting concerns about slowing growth , excessive buildup of local-government debt , and possible defaults in the shadow banking sector . 
Aggregate capital flows to emerging markets are likely to rebound later this year , but not all countries and all sectors will benefit . 
A sharp slowdown in China would have negative spillover effects on manufacturing exporters like Korea and Taiwan and commodity exporters like Brazil and South Africa . 
Stronger-than-expected growth could trigger an increase in long-term US interest rates , encouraging investors to shift more of their holdings from emerging market assets to US assets . 
And now there are new risks emanating from worsening East-West relations , escalating sanctions on Russia , and possible contagion effects on other emerging-market countries . 
Over the long term , however , the outlook for investing in emerging-market economies , particularly those with strong macroeconomic fundamentals , stable political environments , and an expanding middle class , is promising . 
The current wave of industrialization and urbanization - associated with faster productivity growth as resources move to higher-productivity activities - is far from over . 
With faster population and productivity growth , most emerging-market economies &quot; relative growth advantage over the developed economies will remain sizeable , albeit smaller than in the last decade . 
Major emerging-market multinational corporations like Samsung , Tata , and Alibaba will also drive growth in their home countries and foster FDI flows among emerging markets . 
Stronger interest by institutional investors in emerging-market assets should also boost future capital flows . 
As part of long-term portfolio-diversification strategies , many large institutional investors have set targets for the share of their funds in emerging-market assets . 
When retail investors sold off their holdings of such assets during the summer of 2013 , institutional investors kept buying . 
The next several months are likely to be marked by volatility in capital flows to emerging economies , with significant pressure on vulnerable countries . 
For both retail and institutional investors who distinguish between individual countries &quot; and sectors &quot; prospects , emerging markets will remain attractive long-term investment opportunities .
