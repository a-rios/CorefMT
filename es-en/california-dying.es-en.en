California Dying 
Berkeley - While the new Obama administration is commanding global attention , America &apos;s future may be written - as so many times before - in and by its largest state . 
Once the lodestar for American optimism and achievement , California now illustrates the difficulties confronting the United States - and how much more can still go wrong domestically . 
The most populous and wealthiest of America &apos;s 50 states , California has long been a beacon of opportunity for talented and enterprising people from all over the world . 
One in every four California residents was born in a foreign country . 
California &apos;s two most famous industries , Silicon Valley and Hollywood , depend on infusions of talent from abroad . 
Its robust agricultural sector is a massive exporter of food , benefiting from the growing appetites of consumers in developing countries . 
Yet California &apos;s technological and entrepreneurial might - standing alone , the state would be the world &apos;s eighth largest economy - coexists with a dysfunctional political system that has brought it to the edge of fiscal bankruptcy . 
On May 19 , the state &apos;s voters , in a special election , rejected an array of tax increases and spending cuts required to balance its budget . 
Now , California faces either an embarrassing federal bailout or a prolonged period of rule by judges , who under California law have the power to vacate labor agreements , abrogate contracts , and generally restructure the state &apos;s financial commitments . 
For President Barack Obama , California &apos;s crisis imperils his own reform agenda . 
Because other American states also face tough fiscal conditions , the political price of bailing out California may be bailing out dozens of other states too . 
A massive state bailout , while adding enormously to pressure on Obama &apos;s government , would expose the weak link in the US system of governance . 
So-called &quot; unitary &quot; nations such as Britain , France , China , or Kenya , essentially have a single set of government obligations : one national police force , one employer for all public school teachers , one overall pension system , etc . 
Making sense of these asymmetries is difficult . 
When financial markets concentrate on the fiscal health of the federal government , they miss the extent of government obligations as a whole . 
The complexity of American governance threatens the benefits of Obama &apos;s decision to stimulate the economy through deficit spending . 
While the national government expands , state governments , such as California &apos;s , contract . 
Moreover , California &apos;s crisis is more than an economic one . 
California is the most diverse US state ; more than half of its 37 million people are non-white . 
For believers in the benefits of diversity , California represents the largest social experiment in human history , bringing people of different backgrounds together in a way unimaginable in , say , Germany , China , or Brazil . 
California &apos;s governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , was an immigrant ( from Austria ) before he was a movie star . 
In his six years in office , he has repeatedly tried to bypass a polarized state legislature - even the annual budget requires a two-thirds majority - by appealing directly to voters . 
Ballot initiatives were created 100 years ago to empower ordinary citizens , but in recent decades the process has been captured by self-serving elites . 
Even as California &apos;s roads fall apart and public institutions decline - the result of too little spending and public workers who are too expensive - the state continues to operate the finest set of public universities in the US . 
But the secret of the University of California &apos;s success is its ability to obtain ever-higher amounts of funding from private sources and the federal government . 
Disengagement from the California polity also is true of the state &apos;s economic engines . 
Intel , the world &apos;s biggest chip maker and a Silicon Valley mainstay , hasn &apos;t built a factory in California for more than 20 years . 
Hollywood shoots an increasing number of films elsewhere . 
Agriculture relies heavily on illegal workers from Mexico , who live temporarily near the fields and take their earnings back home . 
How to forge a single community out of a state so diverse remains an elusive challenge . 
Some influential people , including Schwarzenegger , say the state needs a new constitution that would restrict ballot initiatives and make budgets easier to pass . 
More radical thinkers insist that California is ungovernable and should be broken into two or even three states . 
Creating more Californias would of course require the approval of the federal government in Washington , where elected representatives from California - mainly from Obama &apos;s Democratic Party - have more power today than at perhaps any time in US history . 
Nancy Pelosi , the House majority leader , is from San Francisco . 
Californians run the two most powerful House committees , Energy and Commerce and Education and Labor . 
Two of the most influential senators also come from California . 
Why these Washington politicians are idle while their state slides towards ruin says much about what &apos;s broken in American politics . 
Schwarzenegger is a Republican , so Democrats privately wish him to fail . 
There &apos;s a deeper problem : politicians across the spectrum , beholden to special interests , are habituated to denying serious problems . 
Obama will be forced to help craft a compromise to keep the state financially afloat . 
Yet as a condition , he may insist that Californians , who are already among the most heavily taxed Americans , pay more . 
If Californians refuse , Obama could face a widening revolt - against the idea of expanded government as the chief response to what ails America at home .
