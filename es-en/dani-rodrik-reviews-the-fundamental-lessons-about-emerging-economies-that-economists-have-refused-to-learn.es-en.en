Death by Finance 
PRINCETON - How quickly emerging markets &quot; fortunes have turned . 
Not long ago , they were touted as the salvation of the world economy - the dynamic engines of growth that would take over as the economies of the United States and Europe sputtered . 
Economists at Citigroup , McKinsey , PricewaterhouseCoopers , and elsewhere were predicting an era of broad and sustained growth from Asia to Africa . 
But now the emerging-market blues are back . 
The beating that these countries &quot; currencies have taken as the US Federal Reserve begins to tighten monetary policy is just the start ; everywhere one looks , it seems , there are deep-seated problems . 
Argentina and Venezuela have run out of heterodox policy tricks . 
Brazil and India need new growth models . 
Turkey and Thailand are mired in political crises that reflect long-simmering domestic conflicts . 
In Africa , concern is mounting about the lack of structural change and industrialization . 
And the main question concerning China is whether its economic slowdown will take the form of a soft or hard landing . 
This is not the first time that developing countries have been hit hard by abrupt mood swings in global financial markets . 
The surprise is that we are surprised . 
Economists , in particular , should have learned a few fundamental lessons long ago . 
First , emerging-market hype is just that . 
Economic miracles rarely occur , and for good reason . 
Governments that can intervene massively to restructure and diversify the economy , while preventing the state from becoming a mechanism of corruption and rent-seeking , are the exception . 
China and ( in their heyday ) South Korea , Taiwan , Japan , and a few others had such governments ; but the rapid industrialization that they engineered has eluded most of Latin America , the Middle East , Africa , and South Asia . 
Instead , emerging markets &quot; growth over the last two decades was based on a fortuitous ( and temporary ) set of external circumstances : high commodity prices , low interest rates , and seemingly endless buckets of foreign finance . 
Improved macroeconomic policy and overall governance helped , too , but these are growth enablers , not growth triggers . 
Second , financial globalization has been greatly oversold . 
Openness to capital flows was supposed to boost domestic investment and reduce macroeconomic volatility . 
We have long known that portfolio and short-term inflows fuel consumption booms and real-estate bubbles , with disastrous consequences when market sentiment inevitably sours and finance dries up . 
Governments that enjoyed the rollercoaster ride on the way up should not have been surprised by the plunge that inevitably follows . 
Third , floating exchange rates are flawed shock absorbers . 
In theory , market-determined currency values are supposed to isolate the domestic economy from the vagaries of international finance , rising when money floods in and falling when the flows are reversed . 
In reality , few economies can bear the requisite currency alignments without pain . 
Sharp currency revaluations wreak havoc on a country &apos;s international competitiveness . 
And rapid depreciations are a central bank &apos;s nightmare , given the inflationary consequences . 
Floating exchange rates may moderate the adjustment difficulties , but they do not eliminate them . 
Fourth , faith in global economic-policy coordination is misplaced . 
America &apos;s fiscal and monetary policies , for example , will always be driven by domestic considerations first ( if not second and third as well ) . 
And European countries can barely look after their own common interests , let alone the world &apos;s . 
It is na√Øve for emerging-market governments to expect major financial centers to adjust their policies in response to economic conditions elsewhere . 
For the most part , that is not a bad thing . 
The Fed &apos;s huge monthly purchases of long-term assets - so-called quantitative easing - have benefited the world as a whole by propping up demand and economic activity in the US . 
Without QE , which the Fed is now gradually tapering , world trade would have taken a much bigger hit . 
Similarly , the rest of the world will benefit when Europeans are able to get their policies right and boost their economies . 
The rest is in the hands of officials in the developing world . 
They must resist the temptation to binge on foreign finance when it is cheap and plentiful . 
Officials face a simple choice : maintain strong prudential controls on capital flows , or be prepared to invest a large share of resources in self-insurance by accumulating large foreign reserves . 
The deeper problem lies with the excessive financialization of the global economy that has occurred since the 1990 &quot; s . 
It is true , but unhelpful , to say that governments have only themselves to blame for having recklessly rushed into this wild ride . 
It is now time to think about how the world can create a saner balance between finance and the real economy .
