Lessons from the Kaczyńskis \ u0027 Poland 
The defeat of the Kaczyński twins &quot; Law and Justice Party ( PiS ) in Poland brought sighs of relief across Europe . 
Many governments waste good economic times by postponing the reforms needed to build a prosperous future . 
The PiS-led government , elected in 2005 , inherited a fast-growing economy , but did nothing to strengthen that legacy . 
Instead , privatization was blocked , while fiscal reforms and deregulation remained paper proposals . 
Indeed , the Kaczyński government embarked on a program of anti-reform . 
The separation of powers ( an independent judiciary and central bank ) was undermined in favor of a &quot; strong &quot; state . 
The PiS captured the public media , the general prosecutor &apos;s office was politicized , and , with the use of the media , was turned into a tool of party propaganda aimed at showing that Poland was ruled by malicious hidden forces , known as the układ , which cheated Poles and kept them poor . 
Anyone who disagreed with this diagnosis or criticized the PiS &apos;s methods , particularly those used by its leader , Jarosław Kaczyński , was promptly classified as belonging to the układ . 
No one was spared . 
Indeed , Lech Wałęsa and Władysław Bartoszewski , the Polish Mandela , were ruthlessly attacked . 
Contrary to popular cliché , PiS &apos;s victory in 2005 did not result from &quot; reform fatigue , &quot; since there were not many reforms implemented in 2000-2005 ( except for an ambitious but partially blocked attempt at fiscal consolidation ) . 
This explanation seems dubious elsewhere , too . 
In Slovakia , the reformist leader Mikuláš Dzurinda won the 1998 elections after having implemented a tough stabilization program , and he could have continued to govern after the 2006 elections if not for disagreements in his coalition . 
In the Czech Republic , a reformist government was elected in 2006 , and in Hungary , political divisions rather than reform fatigue dominates electoral campaigns . 
Of course , it is not easy for reformers to win elections . 
On the contrary , reforms usually are undertaken only when the signs of an impending crisis are so strong that it is increasingly difficult to ignore them , or after the crisis has already &quot; educated &quot; voters . 
( However , if the crisis follows reforms , populist politicians may win by blaming the reforms , instead of their incomplete nature , as in Argentina . ) 
Reformers can win elections if they are better at public communication than the populists . 
Bad policies are , more often than not , easier to sell than good ones . 
In Poland in 2005 , the issue was mainly corruption . 
The PiS jumped on the anticorruption bandwagon and strengthened its appeal by linking the fight against corruption to the vision of hidden forces supposedly perverting Polish society and democracy . 
If not for that , the results of the 2005 elections would most likely have been quite different . 
To criticize anticorruption campaigns is risky , because words can be twisted to imply indifference . 
Therefore , let me first present my anticorruption credentials : as Deputy Prime Minister in 1999 I was the first Polish politician to ask the World Bank to prepare a report on corruption in Poland and ways to eradicate it . 
In my public life , I emphasized eliminating discretionary regulations - the main source of both inefficiency and corruption . 
Interestingly , all the available measures of actual corruption were already declining before the Kaczyński twins were elected . 
For example , the index of the frequency of paying bribes , calculated by the World Bank and EBRD , was 2.7 in 1999 and 2.03 in 2005 ( the value of 1 is the minimum ) . 
The corruption tax ( the percentage of sales paid in bribes ) declined from 1.22 % in 2002 to 0.7 % in 2005 . 
Poland now has a huge gap between the levels of perceived and actual corruption . 
On perception , it fares much worse than Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Greece , while it fares better - or at least not worse - on indicators of actual corruption . 
For example , the percentage of respondents admitting to paying bribes in 2006 was 5 % in Poland and 17 % in the Czech Republic and Greece . 
The index of the frequency of paying bribes in 2005 was 2.03 in Poland , 2.22 in Slovakia , 2.09 in the Czech Republic , and 2.37 in Greece . 
The corruption tax in 2005 was 0.7 % in Poland , 0.93 % in Slovakia , and 0.63 % in Hungary . 
Of course , Poles should not settle for today &apos;s levels of corruption . 
Instead , the battle with corruption should aim at removing its root causes : the scope of the discretionary public sector and the suppression of market forces . 
This is the only path that promises both less corruption and more economic growth . 
Combating corruption through increased punitive action , while leaving intact a bloated and discretionary public sector , will only paralyze public officials , delay important decisions , and play into the hands of cynical demagogues and political fanatics .
