Confronting Fear 
WASHINGTON , DC - Even as the squeeze in interbank lending has started to ease after the rescue of financial systems across the advanced countries , falling economic indicators have sent stock markets tumbling . 
Pressures on emerging-market countries , which were once thought by many to have &quot; decoupled &quot; from the rest of the world , have intensified as foreign loans are called in and assets sold off . 
With fear gripping consumers , companies , and countries worldwide , talk has turned from a moderate advanced-country recession to a major world depression . 
A sense of despondency has set in that nothing can be done to stop it . 
What is going on ? 
Were the measures taken two weeks ago to shore up the financial system simply wrong ? 
Absolutely not . 
The provision of liquidity , the recapitalization of banks , more uniform deposit insurance across the advanced countries - these were all correct and necessary measures . 
But they were only the first installment on what needs to be done . 
In the advanced countries , the fall in asset values and , more generally , fear of what comes next has shattered consumer and business confidence . 
Consumption is dropping , and companies are cutting investment . 
The financial crisis has created a sharp fall in demand , what economists call a &quot; Keynesian recession . &quot; 
To help confidence revive , there is no alternative but to use macroeconomic tools to boost demand and sustain output . 
Monetary policy can be used in countries where interest rates remain high , but its effectiveness in a credit squeeze is likely to be limited . 
Fiscal policy must , therefore , play a central role . 
Fiscal expansion is always risky , as it adds to debt and raises dangers later . 
But , given where we are , the benefits exceed the costs in countries with sustainable debt . 
Emerging-market countries face an additional problem . 
Not only must they contend with the prospect of falling exports and confidence ; they also are the latest victims of a financial crisis that started in the United States , traveled to Europe , and now has swept across their borders . 
Foreign banks are cutting credit . 
Foreign investors are repatriating their funds on an unprecedented scale . 
Ironically , the measures being taken to resolve the crisis in advanced countries are making it more attractive to bring money home , making life harder for emerging-market countries . 
In order to shore up their financial systems and overall demand , emerging-market countries must be ready to take actions similar to those pursued by the advanced countries . 
But the recent prosperity of many of these countries has come from access to global capital . 
A sudden stop to such flows is a severe blow and raises special challenges that cannot be solved by these countries alone . 
So the advanced countries must be ready to provide the required financing , and to do so on an unprecedented scale . 
The alternative is the prospect of widespread debt default , banking controls , and protectionism - an outcome that would set back these countries , and the global economy as a whole , for years to come . 
The IMF has the wherewithal to commit up to $ 250 billion . 
We have set in motion the internal procedures and facilities that will allow us to provide resources quickly , with conditions limited to the core crisis-policy response at hand . 
In addition , the Fund is working on a new liquidity line to provide resources immediately to strongly performing emerging markets with sound policies and fundamentals . 
This should give confidence to investors . 
But , given the scale of capital flows , I am also urging the governments and central banks of the advanced countries to provide parallel financing to the IMF &apos;s crisis-response programs . 
I also am convinced of the need to find ways to bring into play the resources of countries with large reserves . 
The Fund will play its part , but all these actions are needed to reinforce the credibility of the coordinated global response to the crisis . 
We must also think ahead - especially in regard to low-income countries in Africa . 
Because of their limited participation in international financial markets , these countries have , so far , been somewhat shielded from the storm . 
But it is an uneasy calm that probably will not last . 
Many low-income countries will suffer from the decline in commodity prices . 
Others , including those that were becoming the new frontier in emerging markets , may see their access to foreign capital dry up . 
They , too , will need help from the international community . 
Lending by the IMF and global development banks , and the maintenance of donor aid at current levels , will be essential if we are to avoid new human tragedies . 
The dynamics of fear are potentially catastrophic , but these dynamics can be broken . 
Whatever the problems in the financial system , the massive improvements over the years in technology , productivity , and social progress - the real fundamentals - are a genuine testament to the power of globalization as a force for good . 
It may be too late to avoid a recession in the advanced countries and a slowdown in emerging and low-income countries .
