Obama &apos;s Nuclear Agenda 
CAMBRIDGE - The announcement of a secret uranium enrichment facility located on a military base in Iran has sharpened President Barack Obama &apos;s efforts to place nuclear proliferation issues at the top of the world agenda . 
2010 will be a critical year . 
In September , both at the United Nations and at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh , many countries agreed to work on Obama &apos;s nuclear agenda . 
But , in the midst of those meetings , it was revealed that Iran has been secretly building a second enrichment facility with the potential to produce weapons-grade uranium . 
In early October , Iranian officials met in Geneva with representatives of the permanent members of the UN Security Council ( plus Germany ) and agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the hitherto secret plant . 
In addition , the Iranians said that they would export their existing low-enriched uranium to be fabricated into nuclear fuel outside of Iran . 
If these measures are implemented , they will represent important steps . 
There has been widespread fear that Iran would abrogate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and use its enrichment facilities to develop a nuclear weapon . 
It is not yet clear whether words will be matched with deeds . 
Meanwhile , the United States and Russia , whose stockpiles contain more than 90 % of the world &apos;s nuclear weapons , are negotiating in Geneva to produce a strategic arms reduction treaty to replace their START I arms-control agreement , which expires in December . 
If those talks are successful , they may yield cuts of up to one-third of all strategic nuclear warheads . 
The US Senate would then consider the new treaty for ratification next year . 
The Obama administration is also consulting with Congress on when to re-submit the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , which was rejected by the Senate 10 years ago . 
International agreements regulating the size and composition of national defenses have often been controversial in the Senate . 
The new strategic arms-reduction treaty , which is still a work in progress , and the CTBT have already aroused skepticism from opposition legislators and opinion-makers . 
If Obama submits both treaties to the Senate in 2010 , he will need to convince the public that they serve an integrated strategy for enhancing national and international security . 
If he fails and the Senate rejects one or both of the treaties , it could have a strong negative effect on the non-proliferation regime . 
In May , 189 member states of the NPT will meet in Vienna to review its status . 
When the NPT entered into force in 1970 , it was intended to limit the number of nuclear-weapons states to five ( the US , the Soviet Union , Britain , France , and China ) . 
Overall , the treaty has been a success . 
Many people , including President John F. Kennedy , believed in the 1960 &quot; s that there would be dozens of countries with nuclear weapons by now , and that their use would be highly probable . 
Fortunately , this has not been the case . 
Since 1970 , three states that never signed the treaty have acquired nuclear weapons ( India , Israel , and Pakistan ) . 
In addition , North Korea violated its treaty obligations and exploded two crude devices . 
Iran &apos;s suspected nuclear-weapons program has now raised new fears that the global nonproliferation regime may unravel . 
Averting that danger will require multiple , coordinated , and sustained efforts for many years to come , but ratification of post-START and the CTBT would help . 
For example , a new arms-reduction agreement would improve the US-Russian relationship , and that , in turn , could translate into a more constructive Russian position on Iran in the Security Council . 
Senate approval of the CTBT would also restore America &apos;s credibility in its efforts to get other countries to forgo nuclear testing . 
Next March , Obama will host a Global Nuclear Security Summit with the aim of developing new means to combat nuclear smuggling and terrorism . 
In addition , his proposed long-term goal of abolishing nuclear weapons will require a great deal of preparatory work before it becomes an operational rather than an aspirational objective . 
Obama will need to begin discussions with the Russians , for example , on how to handle the question of short-range nuclear weapons , and how to regulate anti-ballistic missile defenses to maintain stability in a world of fewer offensive weapons . 
At some point , he must open discussions with countries like China , France , and Britain to understand better the conditions for transparency and verification that would be necessary for a clearer path toward eventual elimination of nuclear weapons in accordance with Article VI of the NPT . 
At the same time , Obama cannot allow these long-term issues to divert his attention from crucial short-term issues . 
So long as the world remains a dangerous place with several nuclear weapons states , Obama must reassure its allies about the credibility of American guarantees of extended deterrence . 
Otherwise , reductions that create anxieties in other countries could lead them to develop their own weapons and thus increase the number of nuclear weapons states . 
Obama will also need to pursue negotiations to persuade North Korea to return to the Six-Party talks with the objective of eventually giving up its nuclear weapons ( as South Africa once did ) . 
And , of course , he will need to pursue the negotiations with Iran to persuade them to keep their word and remain in the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state . 
How successful Obama is in managing the domestic politics and international diplomacy of his nuclear agenda will be an important factor in his effectiveness as a world leader . 
Even more important , his progress in 2010 will say a lot about the world &apos;s ability to maintain the existing 60-year taboo against the use of nuclear weapons .
