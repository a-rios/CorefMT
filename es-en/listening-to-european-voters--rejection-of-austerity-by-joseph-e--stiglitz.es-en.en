What is Italy Saying ? 
NEW YORK - The outcome of the Italian elections should send a clear message to Europe &apos;s leaders : the austerity policies that they have pursued are being rejected by voters . 
The European project , as idealistic as it was , was always a top-down endeavor . 
But it is another matter altogether to encourage technocrats to run countries , seemingly circumventing democratic processes , and foist upon them policies that lead to widespread public misery . 
While Europe &apos;s leaders shy away from the word , the reality is that much of the European Union is in depression . 
The loss of output in Italy since the beginning of the crisis is as great as it was in the 1930 &quot; s . 
Greece &apos;s youth unemployment rate now exceeds 60 % , and Spain &apos;s is above 50 % . 
With the destruction of human capital , Europe &apos;s social fabric is tearing , and its future is being thrown into jeopardy . 
The economy &apos;s doctors say that the patient must stay the course . 
Political leaders who suggest otherwise are labeled as populists . 
The reality , though , is that the cure is not working , and there is no hope that it will - that is , without being worse than the disease . 
Indeed , it will take a decade or more to recover the losses incurred in this austerity process . 
In short , it is neither populism nor shortsightedness that has led citizens to reject the policies that have been imposed on them . 
It is an understanding that these policies are deeply misguided . 
Europe &apos;s talents and resources - its physical , human , and natural capital - are the same today as they were before the crisis began . 
The problem is that the prescriptions being imposed are leading to massive underutilization of these resources . 
Whatever Europe &apos;s problem , a response that entails waste on this scale cannot be the solution . 
The simplistic diagnosis of Europe &apos;s woes - that the crisis countries were living beyond their means - is clearly at least partly wrong . 
Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt / GDP ratios before the crisis . 
If Greece were the only problem , Europe could have handled it easily . 
An alternative set of well-discussed policies could work . 
Europe needs greater fiscal federalism , not just centralized oversight of national budgets . 
To be sure , Europe may not need the two-to-one ratio of federal to state spending found in the United States ; but it clearly needs far more European-level expenditure , unlike the current miniscule EU budget ( whittled down further by austerity advocates ) . 
A banking union , too , is needed . 
But it needs to be a real union , with common deposit insurance and common resolution procedures , as well as common supervision . 
There will also have to be Eurobonds , or an equivalent instrument . 
European leaders recognize that , without growth , debt burdens will continue to grow , and that austerity by itself is an anti-growth strategy . 
Yet years have gone by , and no growth strategy is on the table , though its components are well known : policies that address Europe &apos;s internal imbalances and Germany &apos;s huge external surplus , which now is on par with China &apos;s ( and more than twice as high relative to GDP ) . 
Concretely , that means wage increases in Germany and industrial policies that promote exports and productivity in Europe &apos;s peripheral economies . 
What will not work , at least for most eurozone countries , is internal devaluation - that is , forcing down wages and prices - as this would increase the debt burden for households , firms , and governments ( which overwhelmingly hold euro-denominated debts ) . 
And , with adjustments in different sectors occurring at different speeds , deflation would fuel massive distortions in the economy . 
If internal devaluation were the solution , the gold standard would not have been a problem in the Great Depression . 
Internal devaluation , combined with austerity and the single-market principle ( which facilitates capital flight and the hemorrhaging of banking systems ) is a toxic combination . 
The European project was , and is , a great political idea . 
It has the potential to promote both prosperity and peace . 
But , rather than enhancing solidarity within Europe , it is sowing seeds of discord within and between countries . 
Europe &apos;s leaders repeatedly vow to do everything necessary to save the euro . 
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s promise to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; has succeeded in providing a temporary calm . 
But Germany has consistently rejected every policy that would provide a long-term solution . 
The Germans , it seems , will do everything except what is needed . 
Of course , the Germans have reluctantly come to accept the necessity of a banking union that includes common deposit insurance . 
But the pace with which they accede to such reforms is out of kilter with the markets . 
Banking systems in several countries are already on life support . 
How many more will be in intensive care before a banking union becomes a reality ? 
Yes , Europe needs structural reform , as austerity advocates insist . 
But it is structural reform of the eurozone &apos;s institutional arrangements , not reforms within individual countries , that will have the greatest impact . 
Unless Europe is willing to make those reforms , it may have to let the euro die to save itself . 
The EU &apos;s Economic and Monetary Union was a means to an end , not an end in itself . 
The European electorate seems to have recognized that , under current arrangements , the euro is undermining the very purposes for which it was supposedly created . 
That is the simple truth that Europe &apos;s leaders have yet to grasp .
