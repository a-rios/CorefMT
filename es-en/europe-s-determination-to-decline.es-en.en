Europe &apos;s Determination to Decline 
S√ÉO PAULO - In a heroic case of finding a silver lining in the bleakest of all situations , the European Union climate commissioner has concluded that the global economic crisis and recession actually provided a lucky break for everyone . 
Commissioner Connie Hedegaard says that the slowdown in economic activity will make it easier for the EU to achieve its 2020 goal of ensuring that greenhouse-gas emissions are 20 % below their 1990 level . 
In fact , Hedegaard believes that cutting emissions has become so easy that European leaders should be more ambitious and unilaterally aim for a 30 % reduction below the 1990 level - an idea that has won support from David Cameron &apos;s new British government . 
This may seem like good news , but it is not , because there is a strong correlation between economic growth and carbon emissions . 
For almost all countries , higher emissions come from higher growth rates . 
And if you restrict carbon emissions without providing affordable alternative energy sources , GDP will falter . 
In other words , by advocating even deeper cuts in emissions , Hedegaard is , in effect , calling for an even deeper recession . 
It &apos;s worth noting that even before its current economic difficulties , Europe was unable to keep up with the growth rates of the United States , not to mention the emerging economies of India and China . 
To stay in the game , the EU acknowledged a decade ago that it needed to become uniquely inventive . 
Hence , the European Council &apos;s Lisbon Strategy of 2000 , which centered around a pledge to increase general research-and-development spending by 50 % over the following decade . 
Unfortunately , Europe has done no such thing ; if anything , R D spending has actually declined slightly since then . 
This is especially regrettable because R D in green energy technologies is really the only viable long-term strategy for reducing fossil-fuel consumption without crippling the world economy . 
European politicians instead seem to have become increasingly committed to the notion that global warming is the world &apos;s most urgent problem . 
Some conspiracy-minded commentators even suggest that this is related to Europe &apos;s lack of competitiveness : instead of trying to keep up , they say , Europe has decided to find a way to slow everyone else down . 
One needn &apos;t accept this Machiavellian view to recognize that trying to cut back on the use of fossil fuels in the absence of practical alternatives is a recipe for economic stagnation . 
This seems to be a driving factor behind China and India &apos;s refusal to go along with Europe &apos;s plans at last December &apos;s global climate summit in Copenhagen . 
The German magazine Der Spiegel recently got hold of a tape of the final negotiating session . 
It is instructive to hear the baffled reactions of European leaders like Germany &apos;s Angela Merkel , France &apos;s Nicolas Sarkozy , and Britain &apos;s Gordon Brown as their developing-country counterparts served notice of their refusal to consign their populations to continued poverty in order to solve a problem that the rich countries created . 
Attempts in 2010 to rekindle commitment to a global carbon-emission deal have failed . 
Both the outgoing head of the UN climate-change secretariat and Commissioner Hedegaard have admitted the obvious : a deal is extremely unlikely to be reached at the next major summit in Mexico at the end of the year . 
Nonetheless , Europe has continued to pursue its quixotic course , even without a global treaty on reducing carbon emissions . 
And make no mistake about it : the EU &apos;s unilateral emission restrictions are not only economically destructive - likely to cost Europe an estimated $ 250 billion a year by 2020 - but are also astonishingly ineffective . 
Climate models uniformly show that that for all the economic havoc that such carbon cuts would likely wreak , they would have a negligible impact on global temperatures . 
The widely used RICE climate-economic model shows a miniscule drop of 0.05 degrees Centigrade over the next 90 years . Despite the huge outlay , the difference in climate by the end of the century would be practically indiscernible . 
Unfortunately , it seems as if Europe has decided that if it can &apos;t lead the world in prosperity , it should try to lead the world in decline . 
By stubbornly pursuing an approach that has failed spectacularly in the past , Europe seems likely to consign itself to an ever-dwindling economic position in the world , with fewer jobs and less prosperity . 
Even the most optimistic-minded would struggle to find a silver lining in that outlook .
