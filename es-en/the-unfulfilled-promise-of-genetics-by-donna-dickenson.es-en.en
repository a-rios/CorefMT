DNA at 60 
LONDON - On April 25 , 1953 , Francis Crick and James Watson published a one-page paper that many believed would revolutionize biological research . 
Building on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins , they had discovered DNA &apos;s double-helix structure , providing the first glimpse into how organisms inherit and store biological information . 
But , 60 years later , has their discovery really had the transformative impact that the world expected ? 
The media marked the publication &apos;s 60th anniversary with much fanfare , hailing the breakthrough that &quot; ushered in the age of genetics , &quot; and calling it &quot; one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time . &quot; 
The British newspaper The Guardian featured the headline , &quot; Happy Birthday , DNA ! 
The golden moment that changed us all . &quot; 
To some extent , they are right . 
The finding forms the basis of genetics and has opened up promising new research areas , such as synthetic biology , in which biological systems are created or modified to perform specific functions . 
Likewise , it has facilitated important innovations , such as pharmacogenetic cancer treatment , in which drugs target specific genetic defects within cancer cells . 
Moreover , DNA has acquired a certain mystique in popular culture . 
According to Dorothy Nelkin and Susan Lindee , it has become a sacred entity - the modern equivalent of the Christian soul , an individual &apos;s essence . 
While some forms of biological determinism , such as the belief that race or gender dictates a person &apos;s destiny , have been widely rejected , the idea that a person can be genetically predisposed , say , to get into debt , become a ruthless dictator , or vote regularly in elections remains socially acceptable . 
But , almost from the beginning - and most intensely since 1971 , when Time magazine published a special section entitled &quot; The New Genetics : Man into Superman &quot; - science and society alike have tended to overestimate the impact of genetics . 
When the Human Genome Project published the first draft of the fully sequenced human genome in 2000 , Henry Gee , an editor of the journal Nature , predicted that scientists would be able &quot; to alter entire organisms out of all recognition to suit our needs and tastes &quot; by 2099 . 
&quot; We will have extra limbs , if we want them , &quot; he asserted , &quot; maybe even wings to fly . &quot; 
Thirteen years later , Gee &apos;s prediction looks increasingly unlikely , with the Human Genome Project so far having failed to meet expectations . 
Indeed , in 2010 , the science writer Nicholas Wade lamented that , a decade after the project was launched , geneticists were &quot; almost back to square one in knowing where to look for the roots of common disease . &quot; 
For example , a 12-year study of 19,000 white American women found that 101 genetic markers that had been statistically linked to heart disease had no predictive value . 
Self-reported family histories , by contrast , proved very accurate in predicting the disease . 
In fact , most diseases are not caused by single genes . 
As a result , after a few early successes with atypical single-gene disorders such as Huntington &apos;s disease , progress has stalled . 
Common variants typically explain a small fraction of genetic risk . 
Genetics has been a source of particularly high hopes when it comes to cancer treatment . 
Between 1962 and 1985 , cancer-related deaths in the United States rose by 8.7 % , despite the use of aggressive chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy , highlighting the dangers of a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment . 
An understanding of the genetic determinants of patients &quot; therapeutic response , it was believed , would enable doctors to develop individualized treatment programs , sparing more responsive patients from harmful overtreatment . 
But patients are not the only variable . 
Cancer , too , is heterogeneous , even in patients with the same diagnosis . 
After sequencing the entire genomes of 50 patients &quot; breast cancer tumors , researchers found that only 10 % of the tumors had more than three mutations in common . 
According to a recent study mapping genetic mutations in 2,000 tumors , breast cancer can actually be divided into ten subgroups . 
Similarly , a genome-wide analysis of malignant cells from four kidney-cancer patients showed that , while they were related , they had mutated in many different directions . 
Two-thirds of the genetic faults identified were not repeated in the same tumor , let alone in any other metastasized tumors in the body . 
Given that a pharmacogenetic drug targets one mutation in the tumor , it will not necessarily work on the other mutations . 
In addition , as the cancer adjusts to the drug , further mutations are likely to occur , diminishing the drug &apos;s efficacy . 
To be sure , pharmacogenetics has made a profound difference for some patients . 
Barbara Bradfield , one of the original subjects in research trials for the pharmacogenetic cancer drug Herceptin , has now been stable on the drug for more than 20 years . 
But such success stories are far too rare to constitute a &quot; golden age &quot; of genetics . 
The high price of such drugs is limiting their impact as well . 
Herceptin can cost up to $ 40,000 annually , and newer cancer drugs cost even more , making them prohibitively expensive for most patients . 
The US Supreme Court is currently faced with the question of whether genes can be patented . 
If the court upholds the biotechnology company Myriad Genetics &quot; patents on two genes which , in some variants , are linked to higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer , the company will retain exclusive rights to use the genes in research , diagnosis , and treatment for two decades , preventing rivals from developing cheaper alternatives . 
Women have already been denied access to a diagnostic test , because insurers refuse to pay the company &apos;s high prices . 
Manufacturers claim that gene patents , which now cover 25-40 % of the human genome , are vital to recouping their investments . 
But such patents mar DNA &apos;s &quot; birthday &quot; celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research - if only they could afford them .
