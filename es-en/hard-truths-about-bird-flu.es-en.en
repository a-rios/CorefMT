Hard Truths about Bird Flu 
The issues surrounding the possibility of a pandemic of the H5N1 strain of avian flu are extraordinarily complex , encompassing medicine , epidemiology , virology , and even politics and ethics . 
Moreover , there is tremendous uncertainty about exactly when H5N1 , which now primarily affects birds , might mutate into a form that is transmissible between humans , and how infectious and lethal it might be . 
It is thus hardly surprising that commentaries about avian flu often miss the mark . 
A recent New York Times editorial , for example , decried wealthy countries &quot; &quot; me first &quot; attitude toward a possible H5N1 pandemic , because &quot; &#91; t &#93; he best hope of stopping a pandemic , or at least buying time to respond , is to improve surveillance and health practices in East Africa and Asia , where one would probably begin . &quot; 
To be sure , good surveillance is needed in order to obtain early warning that a strain of H5N1 flu transmissible between humans has been detected , so that nations around the world can rapidly initiate a variety of public health measures , including a program to produce large amounts of vaccine against that strain . 
But the massive undertaking required to &quot; improve health practices in the poorest countries of the world &quot; plays better on the editorial page than on the ground . 
Intensive animal husbandry procedures that place billions of poultry and swine in close proximity to humans , combined with unsanitary conditions , poverty , and grossly inadequate public health infrastructure of all kinds , make it unlikely that a pandemic can be prevented or contained at the source . 
It is noteworthy that China &apos;s chaotic effort to vaccinate 14 billion chickens has been compromised by counterfeit vaccines and the absence of protective gear for vaccination teams , which might actually spread disease by carrying fecal material on their shoes from one farm to another . 
In theory , it is possible to contain a flu pandemic in its early stages by performing &quot; ring prophylaxis &quot; - using anti-flu drugs and quarantine aggressively to isolate relatively small outbreaks of a human-to-human transmissible strain of H5N1 . 
According to Johns Hopkins University virologist Donald S. Burke , &quot; it may be possible to identify a human outbreak at the earliest stage , while there are fewer than 100 cases , and deploy international resources - such as a WHO stockpile of antiviral drugs - to rapidly quench it . 
This &quot; tipping point &quot; strategy is highly cost-effective . &quot; 
However , a strategy can be &quot; cost-effective &quot; only if it is feasible . 
Although ring prophylaxis might work in Minneapolis , Toronto , or Zurich , in the parts of the world where flu pandemics begin , the probability of success approaches zero . 
In places like Vietnam , Indonesia , and China - where the pandemic strain will likely originate - expertise , coordination , discipline , and infrastructure are lacking . 
The response in Turkey - where as many as 50 possible cases have appeared in the eastern part of the country - is instructive . 
Officials in that region warned the government on December 16 of a surge in bird deaths , but it took 12 days for an investigation to begin . 
When a fourteen-year-old boy became Turkey &apos;s first avian flu mortality last week ( soon followed by two siblings ) , a government spokesman criticized doctors for mentioning the disease because they were &quot; damaging Turkey &apos;s reputation . &quot; 
This is ominously reminiscent of China &apos;s initial response to SARS in 2003 . 
For now , it seems that all of the human H5N1 infections have been contracted from contact with infected poultry . 
But the situation in Turkey is what the outbreak of a human to human pandemic could look like at its earliest stages : the rapid spread of confirmed cases ( and deaths ) from an initial site to nearby villages and cities . 
We would expect to see a large number of illnesses among both employees and patients in hospitals where the victims are treated , and soon someone ( perhaps even a carrier who is not ill ) would spread it to Ankara , Istanbul , Tbilisi , Damascus , Baghdad , and beyond . 
The anti-flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza are extremely expensive and in short supply . 
History suggests that if we were to make these drugs available to poor countries for ring prophylaxis , they would often be administered improperly - such as in sub-optimal doses - in a way that would promote viral resistance and only intensify a pandemic . 
Or perhaps they would be sold on the black market to enrich corrupt government officials . 
A politically incorrect but rational strategy would be for rich countries to devote resources to developing countries primarily for surveillance . 
They would obtain timely warning of the existence of an H5N1 strain that is transmissible from human to human , but would focus the vast majority of their funding on parallel , low- and high-tech approaches - vaccines , drugs , and other public health measures - that would primarily benefit themselves . 
If the pandemic were to begin relatively soon - say , within a year or two - there would be little that could be done to attenuate significantly the first wave of infections . 
But , if we &apos;re ready to rush the pandemic strain into an emergency program to manufacture vaccine , we could possibly blunt the second wave . 
A flu pandemic will require triage on many levels , including not only decisions about which patients are likely to benefit from scarce commodities such as drugs , vaccines , and ventilators , but also broader public policy choices about how best - among , literally , a world of possibilities - to expend resources .
