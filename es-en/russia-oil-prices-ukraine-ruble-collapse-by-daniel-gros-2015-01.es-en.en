The Russian Threat Runs Out of Fuel 
BRUSSELS - For Europe , the defining event of 2014 was Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region . 
The Kremlin &apos;s actions directly challenged key principles that have guided Europe for more than six decades , particularly the renunciation of the use of force to alter national borders . 
But Russia is in no position to sustain its aggressive foreign policy . 
It has often been argued that Russia was reacting to the perceived encroachment on its &quot; near abroad &quot; by the European Union and NATO . 
But history suggests a simpler explanation : A decade of steadily rising oil prices had emboldened Russia , leaving it ready to seize any opportunity to deploy its military power . 
Indeed , the Soviet Union had a similar experience 40 years ago , when a protracted period of rising oil revenues fueled an increasingly assertive foreign policy , which culminated in the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan . 
Oil prices quadrupled following the first oil embargo in 1973 , and the discovery of large reserves in the 1970s underpinned a massive increase in Soviet output . 
As a result , from 1965 to 1980 , the value of Soviet oil production soared by a factor of almost 20 . 
Burgeoning oil wealth bolstered the regime &apos;s credibility - not least by enabling a significant increase in military spending - and rising economic and military strength gave the Soviet Union &apos;s geriatric leadership a rejuvenated sense of invulnerability . 
The invasion of Afghanistan was not merely an improvised response to a local development ( a putsch in Kabul ) ; it was also a direct result of this trend . 
Putin &apos;s reaction to the Euromaidan demonstrations in Ukraine followed a similar pattern . 
In both cases , a seemingly low-cost opportunity was viewed as yielding a large strategic gain - at least in the short run . 
Indeed , while the devastating consequences of the Soviet Union &apos;s Afghan adventure are now well known , at the time the invasion was viewed as a major defeat for the West . 
The Soviet army &apos;s retreat in 1988 is usually ascribed to the Afghan insurgency , led by Pakistan-trained mujahedeen with support from the United States . 
But the decline in oil prices during the 1980s , which cut the value of Soviet output to one-third of its peak level , undoubtedly played a role . 
Indeed , it led to a period of extreme economic weakness - a key factor in the Soviet Union &apos;s dissolution just three years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan . 
During the 1990s , Russia was too preoccupied with its own post-Soviet political turmoil to object to EU or NATO enlargement to the east . 
Nor did it have the wherewithal , as its own production and oil prices continued to decline , hitting a trough of $ 10 per barrel in 1999-2000 . 
Russia &apos;s stance changed gradually during the early 2000s , as world oil prices - and Russian output - recovered , reinvigorating the country &apos;s economic base at a time when its leadership was becoming increasingly autocratic . 
Only then did Russia start to claim that the US and its European allies had offered some implicit pledge not to expand NATO eastward . 
With oil prices steadily rising , the value of Russian oil production reached a new peak , roughly ten times the 1999 level , in 2008 ; 
Russia invaded Georgia the same year . 
Though prices collapsed during the Great Recession of 2009 , they quickly recovered , with the value of Russian output reaching another peak in 2012-2013 - precisely when Russia &apos;s position on the EU-Ukraine association agreement hardened . 
Given that the EU and Ukraine had already been negotiating the deal for more than two years , without much reaction from Russia , the EU was blindsided by the Kremlin &apos;s sudden sharp objections . 
Clearly , Russia &apos;s attitude toward its near abroad is not quite as erratic as it may seem . 
When oil prices rise , Russia expresses its latent resentments more aggressively , often employing its military . 
Moreover , at higher prices , the oil industry crowds out other export sectors that support open markets and a less aggressive foreign policy . 
The Soviet war in Afghanistan was followed by a long-term decline in oil prices . 
The recent price slide - to $ 50-60 per barrel , halving the value of Russia &apos;s oil production - suggests that history is about to repeat itself . 
And oil prices are not Russia &apos;s only problem . 
Western sanctions , which seemed to constitute only a pinprick a few months ago , appear to have inflicted serious damage , with the ruble having lost nearly half its value against the US dollar last year . 
Though financial markets will calm down when the ruble &apos;s exchange rate settles into its new equilibrium , Russia &apos;s economy will remain weak , forcing the country &apos;s leaders to make tough choices . 
Against this background , a stalemate in the Donbas seems more likely than an outright offensive aimed at occupying the remainder of the region and establishing a land corridor to Crimea - the outcome that many in the West initially feared . 
President Vladimir Putin &apos;s new Novorossya project simply cannot progress with oil prices at their current level . 
To be sure , Russia will continue to challenge Europe . 
But no amount of posturing can offset the disintegration of the economy &apos;s material base caused by the new equilibrium in the oil market . 
In this sense , the US has come to Europe &apos;s rescue in a different way : Its production of shale oil and gas is likely to play a greater role in keeping Russia at bay than NATO troops on Europe &apos;s eastern borders .
