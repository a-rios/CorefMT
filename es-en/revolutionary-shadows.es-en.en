Revolutionary Shadows 
VIENNA - What happens after the euphoria of revolution fades ? 
Today &apos;s Eastern Europe , some two decades after the revolutions of 1989 , may offer a salutary warning for today &apos;s defiant and jubilant Arab youth that they must remain vigilant . 
Ever since I left Romania for exile in 1986 , my returns have been rare and tense . 
Although the schedule for my most recent trip was overwhelming , and offered little real contact with ordinary people , I could still grasp - from daily newspapers , TV programs , and conversations with friends - the profound economic , political , and moral crisis engulfing the country . 
Mistrust and anger toward a corrupt and inefficient political class , coupled with skepticism about democracy - even nostalgia for communism - is to be found nowadays not only in Romania , but also in some other parts of Eastern Europe . 
Some 70 % of Romanians reportedly now claim to regret the death of Comrade Nicolae Ceau≈üescu , whose summary execution in 1989 elicited general enthusiasm . 
Of course , the source of such an astonishing finding is difficult to trust , like everything else in Romanian politics , but the vulgar and radical coarsening of public discourse - now peppered with old-new xenophobic elements - is clear enough . 
I was offered a taste of this as a guest on a well-respected TV cultural program . 
I was amused that the debate focused not on my books , but on issues like the &quot; Jewish cultural mafia &quot; and the &quot; exaggerated &quot; anti-Semitism of past and present Romania . 
My interviewer was kinetic , taking over the dialogue with insinuations and personal interventions . 
I assumed that I was supposed to be provoked into unguarded comments , a method that fashionable TV journalists everywhere use nowadays . 
But I faced a new surprise the following week , when , on the same TV program , the hostess was rather passive towards her guest , a militant journalist turned mercenary journalist , as he confessed his admiration for Corneliu Zelea Codreanu , the &quot; Captain &quot; of the Iron Guard , the far-right Orthodox terrorist organization of the pre-war years . 
The journalist considered Codreanu a &quot; Romantic hero . &quot; 
A group of Romanian intellectuals , including me , protested in an Open Letter against this effort to rehabilitate a murderer and propagandist of hate and xenophobia . 
Romanian TV answered promptly that it understood that victims of anti-Semitic crimes might feel hurt by such a program , but that the program had not promoted this kind of propaganda , offering the bizarre interview with me the previous week as proof of the channel &apos;s good faith . 
But the debate didn &apos;t end there . 
Soon after , the national committee for the media condemned the program . 
And soon after that , some leading intellectuals condemned the national committee &apos;s condemnation as an affront to freedom of speech.No one mentioned the danger of inciting an already radicalized audience . 
In fact , the responses from members of the public to these controversies were mostly of a vulgar nationalistic and anti-Semitic tone . 
Romania is not alone , of course , in reliving this dark comedy . 
Revitalization of the extreme right in Hungary and the rise of &quot; National Bolshevism &quot; in Russia , where Tolstoy is now re-condemned by the Orthodox Church as a proto-communist , suggest a deeper and more pervasive atavistic longing . 
I was reminded of my last class at Bard College before my trip to Romania . 
We were discussing Thomas Mann &apos;s Death in Venice . 
Commenting on the moment when &quot; Asiatic cholera &quot; kills the great and troubled writer Gustav von Aschenbach , a brilliant Asian student pointed out that Mann related the disease to the &quot; pestilence &quot; of the Ganges delta , which traversed China and Afghanistan , Persia and Astrakhan , and &quot; even Moscow , &quot; before reaching Europe through the &quot; city of the lagoon . &quot; 
She noted with gravity today &apos;s migrations from poor to prosperous countries , the globalization of evil , the contradictions and conflicts of modernity , the angry terrorist response to it , and the contrast between a rational , pragmatic West and a more idealistic and superstitious East , prone to religious fanaticism and political extremism . 
It was a relief to listen to my student &apos;s well-articulated opinions and to see in her the hope of a new , cosmopolitan generation . 
But her example was also an unavoidable reminder of the great dangers of our time . 
I needed that hope , for what I saw in Eastern Europe had depressed me as much as what I was seeing in the United States , my adopted homeland . 
For someone who lived through two totalitarian systems , it is almost unbearable to contemplate America &apos;s decline . 
Although we refugees , immigrants , exiles , and outcasts do not boast ad infinitum that &quot; we are the best , &quot; as many Americans do , we still believe that the US remains a powerful guarantor of freedom and democracy , and we consider its incoherence part of its liberty . 
For far different reasons , the US , and the entire world , seems condemned to simplification of thought , action , and feeling in the service of immediate , quotidian efficiency . 
Of course , art and culture can offer a respite from the oversimplifications of our age - a respite that we need more than ever if we are to reckon with the destiny behind and before us . 
But we also need modesty about ourselves and our societies . 
Some years ago , I proposed that every country should add to its monuments to heroism some monuments to its national shame . 
After all , guilt is as significant as courage in any human enterprise . 
To remember and reflect on how we have wronged other people and nations may benefit a country &apos;s citizens as much as celebrating great deeds . 
Monuments to shame would not resolve the insoluble problems of humanity &apos;s fate on Earth , but they might slow the advance of its dark side - in Eastern Europe , the Arab world , and everywhere else .
