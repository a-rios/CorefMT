China and Russia in the New World Disorder 
Can Kosovo achieve independence without the tacit consent of Russia , and can there be a humanitarian and political solution to the tragedy in Darfur without the active goodwill of China ? 
The two crises have nothing in common , but their resolution will depend in large part on whether these two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council use their veto power . 
Comparing the respective abilities of Russia and China to block key international initiatives makes no sense in itself , but it does constitute a useful tool for understanding the transformation of the international system that is now taking place as a direct consequence of the relative decline of America &apos;s global power . 
The key question is this : Is Russia taking giant steps in the &quot; wrong direction &quot; while China is taking &quot; minuscule &quot; steps in the &quot; right direction &quot; ? 
Superficially , Russia and China may give the impression that they are pursuing the same path when they both proclaim with pride that they are &quot; back &quot; on the world stage . 
But this boast means different things for each country . 
For China , a deeply self-confident country , to be &quot; back &quot; simply means regaining the country &apos;s historical centrality in the world after an absence of more than two centuries . 
After all , at the end of the eighteenth century , China became the world &apos;s first producer of manufactured goods , and it perceives itself as a center of civilization unequalled by any other in Asia , if not the world . 
China &apos;s renewed self-confidence is based on its remarkable economic prowess , which is derived not from natural resources , but from productivity and creativity . 
Whatever the huge political , social , and economic tensions may exist , there is a &quot; feel good &quot; factor in China , a sense of progress , with the 2008 Olympics in Beijing figuring as the symbolic moment that will proclaim to the world the scale of the country &apos;s achievements . 
Above all , with the exception of the Taiwan issue , China is a satisfied status quo power when it comes to the evolution of the international system - a patient actor that finds it perfectly legitimate to behave and to be seen as the world &apos;s number two power . 
By contrast , the Russians remain insecure about their status in the world . 
Russia &apos;s explosive &quot; revisionist &quot; behavior on the eve of the recent G8 summit is an indication of the Kremlin &apos;s &quot; unsatisfied &quot; nature . 
Because they know they are less potent , particularly in demographic and economic terms , Russians feel they have to do &quot; more . &quot; 
For them , to say &quot; Russia is back &quot; means that the humiliating Yeltsin years are over , and that they now must be treated as equals , particularly by the United States . 
Russians are nostalgic not for the Cold War as such , but for the international status they lost when it ended . 
Now that America is no longer a &quot; hyperpower &quot; with no strategic challengers , Russia has reasserted its status as a &quot; superpower , &quot; a claim that is not necessarily supported by reality . 
Unlike the Chinese , the Russians do not create economic wealth , but merely exploit their energy and mineral resources . 
Moreover , unlike the Chinese , they have not always been confident of their position in the world . 
Torn between Europe and Asia in cultural and political terms , victimized by a dark , narcissistic instinct that pervades their reading of their past and their visions of the future , it should surprise no one that Russia is now behaving like a &quot; revisionist &quot; power . 
Unsatisfied with their inner identity , it is only natural that Russians should demand changes that make them feel more secure and proud . 
Less than 20 years ago , the Czech Republic and Poland were part of their sphere of influence , so Russians understandably cannot accept the US unilaterally implanting its security system there . 
Of course , in their respective judgments on Russia and China , the West - and Europeans in particular - may be demonstrating selective emotions . 
&quot; We &quot; tend to be less demanding of China than of Russia , because we tend to see Russia as &quot; European &quot; ( at least culturally ) . 
As a result , the culture of physical violence and verbal provocation that is gaining ground in Putin &apos;s Russia is deeply disturbing , whereas we tend to judge Chinese misdeeds with a greater sense of distance , if not indifference . 
But the differences between Russia and China today may prove to be less significant tomorrow if the deterioration in the Middle East imposes a sense of collective responsibility on all five permanent members of the UN Security Council . 
It is one thing for Russia and China to exploit America &apos;s growing difficulties from Gaza to Kabul ; but it is quite another if the situation deteriorates to the point of general destabilization in the region . 
Indeed , the Middle East &apos;s deepening problems may impose a sense of restraint in Russia and China by forcing them to calculate not in terms of their global &quot; nuisance value &quot; vis-Ã -vis the West , but in terms of their ability to make a positive and stabilizing contribution to the world order .
