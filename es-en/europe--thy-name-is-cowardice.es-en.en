Europe , Thy Name is Cowardice 
The writer Henryk Broder recently issued a withering indictment : &quot; Europe , your family name is Appeasement . &quot; 
That phrase resonates because it is so terribly true . 
Appeasement cost millions of Jews and non-Jews their lives as England and France , allies at the time , negotiated and hesitated too long before they realized that Hitler needed to be fought and defeated , because he could not be bound by toothless agreements . 
Later , appeasement legitimized and stabilized Communism in the Soviet Union , then East Germany , then throughout the rest of Eastern Europe , where for decades inhuman , repressive , and murderous governments were glorified . 
Appeasement similarly crippled Europe when genocide ran rampant in Bosnia and Kosovo . 
Indeed , even though we had absolute proof of ongoing mass murder there , we Europeans debated and debated , and then debated still more . 
We were still debating when finally the Americans had to come from halfway around the world , into Europe yet again , to do our work for us . 
Europe still hasn &apos;t learned its lesson . 
Rather than protecting democracy in the Middle East , European appeasement , camouflaged behind the fuzzy word &quot; equidistance , &quot; often seems to countenance suicide bombings in Israel by fundamentalist Palestinians . 
Similarly , it generates a mentality that allows Europe to ignore the nearly 500,000 victims of Saddam &apos;s torture and murder machinery and , motivated by the self-righteousness of the peace movement , to harangue George W. Bush as a warmonger . 
This hypocrisy continues even as it is discovered that some of the loudest critics of American action in Iraq made illicit billions - indeed , tens of billions - of dollars in the corrupt UN &quot; oil-for-food &quot; program . 
Today we are faced with a particularly grotesque form of appeasement . 
How is Germany reacting to the escalating violence by Islamic fundamentalists in Holland , Britain , and elsewhere in Europe ? 
By suggesting - wait for it - that the proper response to such barbarism is to initiate a &quot; Muslim holiday &quot; in Germany . 
I wish I were joking , but I am not . 
A substantial fraction of Germany &apos;s government - and , if polls are to be believed , the German people - actually believe that creating an official state Muslim holiday will somehow spare us from the wrath of fanatical Islamists . 
One cannot help but recall Britain &apos;s Neville Chamberlain on his return from Munich , waving that laughable treaty signed by Adolf Hitler , and declaring the advent of &quot; peace in our time . &quot; 
What atrocity must occur before the European public and its political leadership understands what is really happening in the world ? 
There is a sort of crusade underway - an especially perfidious campaign consisting of systematic attacks by Islamists , focused on civilians , that is directed against our free , open Western societies , and that is intent upon their utter destruction . 
We find ourselves faced with a conflict that will most likely last longer than any of the great military clashes of the last century - a conflict conducted by an enemy that cannot be tamed by &quot; tolerance &quot; and &quot; accommodation &quot; because that enemy is actually spurred on by such gestures . 
Such responses have proven to be signs of weakness , and they will always be regarded as such by the Islamists . 
Only two recent American presidents have had the courage needed to shun appeasement : Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush . 
America &apos;s critics may quibble over the details , but in our hearts we Europeans know the truth , because we saw it first hand . 
Reagan ended the Cold War , freeing half of Europe from nearly 50 years of terror and slavery . 
In the meantime , Europe sits back in the multi-cultural corner with its usual blithe self-confidence . 
Instead of defending liberal values and acting as an attractive center of power on the same playing field as the true great powers , America and China , it does nothing . 
On the contrary , we Europeans present ourselves , in contrast to the supposedly &quot; arrogant Americans , &quot; as world champions of &quot; tolerance , &quot; which even Germany &apos;s interior minister , Otto Schily , justifiably criticizes . 
Where does this self-satisfied reaction come from ? 
Does it arise because we are so moral ? 
I fear that it stems from the fact that we Europeans are so materialistic , so devoid of a moral compass . 
For his policy of confronting Islamic terrorism head on , Bush risks the fall of the dollar , huge amounts of additional national debt , and a massive and persistent burden on the American economy . 
While we criticize the &quot; capitalistic robber barons &quot; of America because they seem too sure of their priorities , we timidly defend our welfare states . 
It could get expensive , &quot; we cry . 
So , instead of acting to defend our civilization , we prefer to discuss reducing our 35-hour workweek or improving our dental coverage , or extending our four weeks of annual paid vacation . 
Or perhaps we listen to television pastors preach about the need to &quot; reach out to terrorists , &quot; to understand and forgive . 
These days , Europe reminds me of an old woman who , with shaking hands , frantically hides her last pieces of jewelry when she notices a robber breaking into a neighbor &apos;s house . 
Appeasement ? 
That is just the start of it . 
Europe , thy name is Cowardice .
