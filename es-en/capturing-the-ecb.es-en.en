Capturing the ECB 
NEW YORK - Nothing illustrates better the political crosscurrents , special interests , and shortsighted economics now at play in Europe than the debate over the restructuring of Greece &apos;s sovereign debt . 
Germany insists on a deep restructuring - at least a 50 % &quot; haircut &quot; for bondholders - whereas the European Central Bank insists that any debt restructuring must be voluntary . 
In the old days - think of the 1980 &quot; s Latin American debt crisis - one could get creditors , mostly large banks , in a small room , and hammer out a deal , aided by some cajoling , or even arm-twisting , by governments and regulators eager for things to go smoothly . 
But , with the advent of debt securitization , creditors have become far more numerous , and include hedge funds and other investors over whom regulators and governments have little sway . 
Moreover , &quot; innovation &quot; in financial markets has made it possible for securities owners to be insured , meaning that they have a seat at the table , but no &quot; skin in the game . &quot; 
They do have interests : they want to collect on their insurance , and that means that the restructuring must be a &quot; credit event &quot; - tantamount to a default . 
The ECB &apos;s insistence on &quot; voluntary &quot; restructuring - that is , avoidance of a credit event - has placed the two sides at loggerheads . 
The irony is that the regulators have allowed the creation of this dysfunctional system . 
The ECB &apos;s stance is peculiar . 
One would have hoped that the banks might have managed the default risk on the bonds in their portfolios by buying insurance . 
And , if they bought insurance , a regulator concerned with systemic stability would want to be sure that the insurer pays in the event of a loss . 
But the ECB wants the banks to suffer a 50 % loss on their bond holdings , without insurance &quot; benefits &quot; having to be paid . 
There are three explanations for the ECB &apos;s position , none of which speaks well for the institution and its regulatory and supervisory conduct . 
The second is that the ECB knows that the financial system lacks transparency - and knows that investors know that they cannot gauge the impact of an involuntary default , which could cause credit markets to freeze , reprising the aftermath of Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse in September 2008 . 
Finally , the ECB may be trying to protect the few banks that have written the insurance . 
None of these explanations is an adequate excuse for the ECB &apos;s opposition to deep involuntary restructuring of Greece &apos;s debt . 
The ECB should have insisted on more transparency - indeed , that should have been one of the main lessons of 2008 . 
Regulators should not have allowed the banks to speculate as they did ; if anything , they should have required them to buy insurance - and then insisted on restructuring in a way that ensured that the insurance paid off . 
There is , moreover , little evidence that a deep involuntary restructuring would be any more traumatic than a deep voluntary restructuring . 
By insisting on its voluntariness , the ECB may be trying to ensure that the restructuring is not deep ; but , in that case , it is putting the banks &quot; interests before that of Greece , for which a deep restructuring is essential if it is to emerge from the crisis . 
In fact , the ECB may be putting the interests of the few banks that have written credit-default swaps before those of Greece , Europe &apos;s taxpayers , and creditors who acted prudently and bought insurance . 
The final oddity of the ECB &apos;s stance concerns democratic governance . 
Deciding whether a credit event has occurred is left to a secret committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , an industry group that has a vested interest in the outcome . 
If news reports are correct , some members of the committee have been using their position to promote more accommodative negotiating positions . 
But it seems unconscionable that the ECB would delegate to a secret committee of self-interested market participants the right to determine what is an acceptable debt restructuring . 
The one argument that seems - at least superficially - to put the public interest first is that an involuntary restructuring might lead to financial contagion , with large eurozone economies like Italy , Spain , and even France facing a sharp , and perhaps prohibitive , rise in borrowing costs . 
But that begs the question : why should an involuntary restructuring lead to worse contagion than a voluntary restructuring of comparable depth ? 
If the banking system were well regulated , with banks holding sovereign debt having purchased insurance , an involuntary restructuring should perturb financial markets less . 
Of course , it might be argued that if Greece gets away with an involuntary restructuring , others would be tempted to try it as well . 
Financial markets , worried about this , would immediately raise interest rates on other at-risk eurozone countries , large and small . 
But the riskiest countries already have been shut out of financial markets , so the possibility of a panic reaction is of limited consequence . 
Of course , others might be tempted to imitate Greece if Greece were indeed better off restructuring than not doing so . 
That is true , but everyone already knows it . 
The ECB &apos;s behavior should not be surprising : as we have seen elsewhere , institutions that are not democratically accountable tend to be captured by special interests . 
That was true before 2008 ; unfortunately for Europe - and for the global economy - the problem has not been adequately addressed since then .
