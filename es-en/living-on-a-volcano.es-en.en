Living on a Volcano 
As I write this , violent clashes with the police have been going on for nearly two weeks in the suburbs of Paris and other French cities , with cars being set on fire at a rate of nearly 1,000 per night . 
Why is this happening ? 
How far can it go ? 
The existence of thousands of unemployed young people , without income or roots , idle and knowing only violence to express their quest for recognition , is not particularly French . 
Everyone remembers the Watts , Newark , and Detroit riots in the United States in the 1960 &quot; s , and the riots in Liverpool in the UK in the early 1980 &quot; s , as well as in Bradford , Oldham , and Burnley in recent years . 
Likewise , France witnessed riots in Vaux-en-Velin , near Lyon , 20 years ago . 
So it is important to distinguish what is common to many developed countries and what is specific to France . 
All the developed economies have undergone profound changes over the last 30 years . 
We have gone from managerial to stockowner capitalism , from economies with large doses of state direction to far more deregulated markets , from the active and expansive social policies of the 1960s &quot; and 1970 &quot; s to a world in which such spending is constantly shrinking . 
Although wealth has been growing constantly - GDP has more than doubled in the last 50 years - the share of wages in the total has diminished by 10 % , even while millions of the rich have become much richer . 
Everywhere , this has meant massive pauperization of the least favored part of the population . 
In rich countries , mass poverty , which seemed to have been eliminated around 1980 , has reappeared . 
Access to good education , and even more so to the labor market , is increasingly restricted for many young people , especially those who come from poor or single-parent families or from minority ethnic backgrounds , languages , or religions . 
These people feel rejected and unrecognized . 
&quot; Because they want to break us , we will break everything &quot; is the motto that best expresses their mood . 
There are untold reservoirs of social violence in all of our lands . 
But against this shared background , France exhibits some important distinctive features . 
First , demography : for the last 50 years France has had much higher fertility rates than the rest of Europe - 1.9 children per woman , compared to the European average of 1.6 and the German or Spanish rates of 1.3 . 
In Germany , every generation entering the labor market is smaller than the one exiting it . 
In France , by contrast , 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation - and this does not include immigration , which , although slowing recently , represents a large number of job seekers . 
As rates of economic growth have declined , this has meant growing unemployment . 
Then there is geography : France &apos;s massive urban concentration around the capital - Paris and its suburbs contain nearly 20 % of the population - is unique in Europe . 
The sheer number of confused and disoriented young people has overwhelmed the French system &apos;s capacity to integrate them - even though its capacity in this regard is , in fact , impressive . 
Indeed , France has opened its public educational system to an extraordinary degree , refusing all group rights to minorities , but vigorously affirming personal rights , including full access to all social services , regardless of language , religion , or skin color . 
The system is cracking , but only because of the limits of its absorptive capacity , not because of its core principles . 
In these circumstances , every French politician has known for the last 20 years that France has been living with a growing risk that isolated incidents might coalesce into a critical mass of violence . 
The task of social workers and police , therefore , is to try to resolve - quickly and discreetly - each particular incident , in order to dampen the revolt . 
What needs to be done also has been well known since 20 years ago , when a nonpartisan report by a cross-party group of big-city mayors unanimously agreed on measures to be taken : efficient repression , highly developed social prevention , a permanent local police presence , and a renewed effort at reintegrating delinquents . 
The difficulty with implementing this policy has been that its preventive aspects - social support and reintegration of delinquents - appear to the frightened population living in the affected areas as being &quot; soft on crime &quot; and overly generous . 
It believes only in repression and says so openly . 
As a result , local police forces have been reduced from 20,000 to 11,000 , while the national riot police ( CRS ) have been reinforced . 
France is now experiencing a practical demonstration of this insane and totally inefficient policy , with the Minister of the Interior , Nicolas Sarkozy , providing a telling illustration of the new orientation when he described the rebellious young as &quot; scum . &quot; 
It was the proverbial match thrown by a careless smoker into a parched forest . 
The young responded with a vengeance to Sarkozy &apos;s provocation . 
The main risk now is that events in the suburbs of large French cities will serve as an example to other young people , whether in the less urban areas of France or in other European countries , who feel socially excluded and are , perhaps , just as prone to violent outbursts . 
Solving the problems underlying the French revolt will require time , discretion , mutual respect , community-based social and police work - rather than a centralized , repressive approach - and a lot of money .
