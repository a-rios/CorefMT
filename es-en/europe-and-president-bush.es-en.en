Europe and President Bush 
ROME : What does the future hold for transatlantic relations ? 
That question arises with every new American administration . 
Because worries about a &quot; widening Atlantic &quot; gap have existed since the early 1970s , it is tempting to proceed as if transatlantic relations will remain on roughly the same wavelength as before . 
The truth is , however , that the US and the EU are rapidly evolving along their own paths : both sides of the Atlantic thus face the challenge of managing an ever more complex relationship . 
Two other temptations must also be resisted . 
On the European side is the temptation to speed the emergence of the Union as an international actor by constantly claiming autonomy or independence from the US . 
Lingering anti-American undertones , of course , will invariably surface for , as in any long unbalanced relationship , the junior partner will tend to make declaratory statements that generate misperceptions . 
Europeans should not succumb to this temptation , for the move from dependency to equal partnership is not measured by rhetoric . 
Instead , Europeans must assume a fairer share of the transatlantic burden , putting in place a truly common European foreign policy , and think and act as a regional power with a global outreach . 
If the Euro succeeds as a global currency , which I believe it will , and if Europe &apos;s rapid reaction force becomes a reality soon , as I also think it will , the EU will have secured the preconditions for a more equal partnership - literally by putting its money ( and soldiers ) where its mouth is . 
On the American side , the temptation is to overplay its &quot; sole superpower &quot; role by acting unilaterally . 
But this is loneliness disguised as leadership and is not in America &apos;s interest . 
National interests can no longer be effectively pursued unilaterally ; 
US global interests are served best by multilateral action and bodies . 
Even if , in military terms , America remains the sole superpower , military might is of limited use in the daily conduct of foreign policy . 
America would benefit not less than Europe from an effective system of global governance in the achievement of its goals - be it freer trade , a viable non-proliferation regime , containment and prevention of regional conflicts , or better regulated financial markets . 
To this end , the US has a vital stake in the EU &apos;s coming of age as an international actor . 
It should therefore do away with the traditional ambivalence of demanding a more mature and active Europe on one hand , all the time feeling uncomfortable with it on the other . 
True , America officially welcomed the launching of a common European security and defense policy . 
But recurring signs of US nervousness about the nature of this process exist . 
Americans often ask whether it is all about better European capabilities - which would be fine for NATO - or about European integration ( i.e. instrumental to a political project ) . 
My response is that it is about both , and that Washington should support both . 
A sober assessment of this process leads me to assert that a more capable and united Europe will usher in a more effective Atlantic Alliance and not , as some believe , in American disengagement from European commitments . 
What the EU aims at is not a duplication of NATO structures or an alternative to the Atlantic Alliance . 
The EU is preparing to deal - jointly with US forces or with purely European forces when NATO as a whole decides not to engage - with crises in and around Europe . 
More than defense - which will remain NATO-centered - Europe is building up its security role as a regional stabilizer : a role that EU enlargement to include candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe will strengthen . 
For , contrary to what is often said in America &apos;s Congress , Europe already bears the lion &apos;s share of the peacekeeping burden ( let alone reconstruction aid ) in the Balkans . 
If Europe &apos;s foreign and defense policies succeed , NATO should become more European . 
Washington , however , should not worry about this : if Europeans see the Alliance as a more European organization they are more likely to commit themselves ( in budgetary terms , too ) to its success . 
A similar logic of partnership applies to enlargement . 
The concept of Europe is not immutable , and rightly so . 
On the basis of a broad notion of security and stability , EU enlargement is every bit as important as deepening the EU . 
Here a common transatlantic approach to both EU and NATO enlargement would enhance stabilization and integration in post-Cold War Europe - to everyone &apos;s benefit . 
A new and functional division of labor between Europeans and Americans is thus conceivable , provided it retains the framework of common political commitments and shared responsibilities . 
What should not be pursued is a rigid , vertical and artificial division of labor , whereby the US plays the lone global leader ( with Europe simply following ) while the EU concentrates exclusively on enlarging its &quot; house &quot; ( with the US disengaging from Continental security ) . 
This would be unhealthy and make the transatlantic compound unsustainable . 
The antidote is a genuine sharing of choices and decisions . 
If divisive decisions must be taken , healthy partnership requires that they be discussed openly and honestly . 
A case in point is the issue of National Missile Defense . 
No matter what policy the Bush administration adopts , European reservations and doubts should be taken into account . 
If Europeans want to have some influence here , they must play a unitary role by , say , encouraging America to update the ABM Treaty in agreement with Moscow . 
That would help strategic stability , prevent antagonizing Russia ( which remains a fundamental factor in European security ) and avoid deteriorating the security climate in Asia . 
The same is true of dealing with so-called &quot; rogue States &quot; : here again , a better combination of US and European strategies could produce a more effective approach , based on a blend of engagement and resolve . 
A new division of labor , and a new sharing of responsibilities , depends as much on economics as on security . 
A stable Euro makes stronger cooperation possible and desirable : not only to prevent global financial instability but to avoid the risk of conflicting currency blocs arising . 
Provided that the Bush Administration pragmatically pushes for more trade liberalization , we will be able to deepen transatlantic market integration , which will act as a boost for our economies . 
Scope will also then exist for revitalizing the WTO , for which a strong European-American commitment is a necessary precondition , though not the entire solution . 
Here a serious reassessment of our negotiating tactics and old habits is needed . 
The WTO , but also the IMF and World Bank , must understand the evolving needs of those societies most vulnerable to the impact of globalization . 
We need to reach out to the rest of the world in a more open and persuasive way . 
The G-8 process , which Italy chairs this year , will test such resolve - on which rests the legitimacy of the entire process . 
A renewed Euro-American partnership based on our own respective styles and instruments in foreign policy will benefit both sides . 
The EU is rightly searching for its identity as a collective actor . 
As Europe changes , so too does America - in terms of its demographic and social composition , economic and political structures , geopolitical orientation and national psychology . 
Granted , transatlantic diversity might cause occasional squabbles . 
However , mutual interaction and equal partnership remain the only response - especially if they are reflected into long overdue reforms of multilateral institutions and increased global governance . 
Operating within multilateral frameworks , however tiresome , has more often than not served US national interests as well as those of Europe . 
A stronger EU is America &apos;s natural partner , occasional competitor , but certainly not a rival . 
It is the duty of governments on both sides of the Atlantic to persuade their publics of this .
