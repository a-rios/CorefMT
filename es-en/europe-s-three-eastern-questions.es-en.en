Europe &apos;s Three Eastern Questions 
WASHINGTON , DC - Today , the European project is shaking . 
Of course , I am confident that the eurozone &apos;s ongoing sovereign-debt crisis will be overcome , and that a more integrated and effective Europe will emerge . 
But , to get to that improved Europe , not only must the sovereign debt crisis be resolved ; relations with three major countries to Europe &apos;s east - Turkey , Russia , and Ukraine - will need to be put on more secure footing . 
I was of the generation in my country that lived through the transition from dictatorship to democracy four decades ago . 
For us , the European Union was a dream . 
Indeed , we used to quote Ortega y Gasset : &quot; If Spain is the problem , Europe is the solution . &quot; 
I continue to believe , very deeply , that Europe is the solution , particularly for societies that need to deepen - if not establish - a democratic tradition . 
Closer relations between Europe and Turkey , Russia , and Ukraine can deliver for them many of the same benefits that we in Spain always associated with Europe . 
Turkey is , of course , already a candidate for EU membership , but accession negotiations are moving very slowly , which is strategically unwise , because Turkey &apos;s great authority in the wider Middle East is vitally important to Europe ( and probably greater than its own ) . 
From Syria to all of the Arab Spring countries , Turkey &apos;s influence is highly significant , and further cooperation with the EU can only prove beneficial . 
The EU has created a channel of communication with Turkey on political matters . 
But it has not resolved the relationship &apos;s endgame . 
My passionate hope is that Turkey becomes an EU member , because a country that is Muslim , democratic , and overwhelmingly young could strengthen the Union in vital ways . 
The debate around Turkish membership is set to become hotter in the second half of this year , when Cyprus assumes the EU &apos;s rotating presidency . 
Turkey , to be blunt , will not recognize today &apos;s divided Cyprus as the sole representative of that island . 
Further complicating matters is the discovery of oil close to the Cypriot coast . 
Anyone planning to drill there will become embroiled in a major maritime dispute , with Cyprus claiming that the reserves lie within its territorial waters , and Turkey countering that Cyprus has no territorial waters , because Cyprus , at least for the Turks , does not exist . 
Russia has become a different type of complicating factor for Europe . 
Vladimir Putin , who has now returned to the presidency , may be the same person as before , but Russia has changed . 
The recent wave of protests in Moscow and throughout the country has exposed the limits of his power . 
I believe that Putin understands this , which is an important fact for future diplomacy . 
In the next few days , the formation of Russia &apos;s new government will reveal much about power relations between conservatives and liberals . 
Notably , billions of dollars of public property are at stake , owing to a privatization plan designed by former President Dimitri Medvedev . 
Here , the EU has a framework - the Partnership for Modernization , negotiated with Medvedev - that could potentially be very positive . 
Russia &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2011 should also help to ensure that it plays by international rules , as occurred with China when it joined the WTO . 
Russia &apos;s adherence to the WTO &apos;s legal framework should begin to make economic relations with it much more stable and predictable . 
Previously , Russia &apos;s admission to the WTO had been blocked by Georgia , which lifted its veto last year after a feat of elegant diplomacy that established a border-control mechanism without recognizing the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia either as part of Georgia or as independent countries . 
That solution , while complicated , is a good outcome for the region . 
Given the scale of Ukraine &apos;s current problems and dysfunction , an elegant solution may neither be available nor sufficient . 
Ukraine , with which I have been engaged since its independence , has been a great frustration to me . 
I was involved in the negotiations that helped to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Orange Revolution of 2004-2005 . 
But subsequent infighting between the revolution &apos;s leaders , Yulia Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko , was so destructive that Viktor Yanukovych , whose efforts to manipulate the 2004 presidential election incited the revolution , is now President and Tymoshenko is in jail . 
For the EU , Ukraine continues to be a serious problem . 
A comprehensive free-trade and association agreement with the Union remains unsigned , owing to the incarceration of Tymoshenko and others . 
Fortunately , given the Union &apos;s attraction for most ordinary Ukrainians , there is still hope that simple realism will persuade Yanukovych and Ukraine &apos;s ruling elite to return to a path that would allow for the association agreement to be signed . 
Europe &apos;s soft power has changed many things in many countries over the past two decades , spurring leaders and citizens to reform their economies and embrace or strengthen democratic values and institutions . 
It can continue to do so in Turkey , Russia , and Ukraine , or , through inattention and inaction , Europe could lose credibility , influence , and economic opportunities .
