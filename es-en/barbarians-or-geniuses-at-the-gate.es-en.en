Barbarians or Geniuses at the Gate ? 
MUNICH - Europe is currently experiencing a huge wave of migration between its east and west . 
This movement resembles the Great Migrations ( Völkerwanderung ) that marked Europe between the fourth to sixth centuries . 
Within the first year of Romania &apos;s accession to the EU on January 1 , 2007 , for example , roughly a million Romanians migrated to Italy and Spain . 
More than 800,000 East Europeans have become workers in the United Kingdom over the past four years , most coming from Poland . 
Indeed , in the last two years alone , 1.5 million Poles emigrated , and overall probably more than two million have done so since Poland &apos;s EU accession in 2004 . 
On a smaller scale , the migration of Ukrainians to the Czech Republic , Bulgarians to Turkey , and British citizens to Spain is also noteworthy . 
Because Germany still restricts the immigration of dependent workers from eastern EU countries , most of its immigrants come as self-employed or economically inactive people . 
In Munich , the number of self-employed tilers increased in 2004 and 2005 , the first two years after the first eastern enlargement wave , from 119 to 970 . 
But despite restrictions , by 2005 Germany had absorbed 37 % of all migrants from Eastern Europe that came before and after eastern EU enlargement , whereas Italy had absorbed 22 % , Greece 11 % , Switzerland 8 % , and the UK only 3 % . 
In the same year , 13 % of the population living in Germany was foreign born , more than in Britain ( 10 % ) , France ( 7 % ) , Spain ( 5 % ) , or Italy ( 3 % ) . 
The immigration waves of the last two years to Britain , Spain , and Italy will have significantly changed these figures , but the information needed to update the statistics is not yet available . 
Nowadays , people move faster than statistical offices can count them . 
Before the EU &apos;s eastern enlargement , many studies predicted the likely migration waves . 
The forecasts of the proportion of East Europeans who were expected to move west within a 15 years ranged from 2.5 % to 6 % . 
Given that about 5 % of the Polish population has now emigrated within a period of only four years , despite immigration restrictions by important target countries , these estimates were much too cautious . 
Before enlargement , it was politically incorrect to discuss possible waves of migration to the West , as EU politicians saw this as an obstacle to the enlargement process . 
Now that enlargement has taken place , it is easier to discuss migration objectively . 
This immigration is not an invasioni barbariche , as Italians refer to the Völkerwanderung , although the orders of magnitude are comparable . 
As migrants move between markets with well-defined property rights , immigration in principle is beneficial for both the immigrants and the target country . 
The immigrant receives a higher wage than at home , and the target country benefits from cheap labor , which creates more value than it costs . 
But in practice , immigration is often not as beneficial as it could be , because the target country has a rigid wage structure that prevents the additional jobs needed to employ the immigrants from being created . 
If , for example , a target country provides minimum wage guarantees and replacement incomes for the domestic unemployed , immigrants simply force domestic residents into the care of the welfare state . 
This is not a problem of immigration as such , but of poorly designed domestic social and labor market institutions . 
To be on the safe side , host countries often try to limit immigration to skilled workers , because they join segments of the labor market in which sufficient downward wage flexibility provides immigrants with additional jobs . 
But countries have so far had mixed success in attracting skilled immigrants . 
The most successful countries in this regard have been the Anglo-Saxon countries ( Canada , Ireland , Australia , the United States , and the UK , in that order ) , as well as Denmark and Norway . 
More than one-third of immigrants to these countries have tertiary education , with Canada and Ireland at 45 % . 
In the more unsuccessful countries - Italy , Austria , Germany , France , Portugal , and the Netherlands - the proportion of immigrants with a tertiary education is below a quarter . 
In Italy , the share is just 11 % - the lowest in the available statistics . 
The brain drain to the Anglo-Saxon countries , the US in particular , is astounding . 
The graduating classes of top American universities are packed with foreign students , and 27 % of physicians practicing in the US today come from abroad . 
America &apos;s postwar growth and dynamism largely resulted from skilled immigrants . 
Before and after World War II , many skilled people came from Europe , Germany in particular ; in recent decades , Asian immigrants dominate , with India , Pakistan , and the Philippines occupying the top ranks . 
Today &apos;s brain drain is not only from emerging and developing countries to richer countries , but also from European countries to the US . 
In most research disciplines , European-born &quot; superstars &quot; work and teach in the US rather than in Europe , and , according to a study by Gilles Saint-Paul , it is the superstars in particular who generate growth and prosperity for a country . 
Of course , people with a decent tertiary education are also important for a country &apos;s economy , and here the loss of some European countries is substantial . 
While only 3 % of Spanish and 4 % of French people with tertiary education live abroad , 7 % of Italians and 9 % of Germans do . 
Surprisingly , Ireland and the UK lead in this category , with 34 % and 17 % , respectively . 
This may reflect the high interchange in both directions between the Anglo-Saxon countries , or replacement migration in which skilled people arrive from elsewhere as the domestic skilled migrate to other Anglo-Saxon countries . 
The European landscape will change as rapidly in the course of this century as it did at the time of the Völkerwanderung . 
History will have many tales to tell about what this really meant for the Continent . 
At the moment , though , the casual observer is still rather clueless .
