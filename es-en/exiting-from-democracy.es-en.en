Exiting from Democracy ? 
Both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair urgently need a plausible exit strategy from Iraq . 
That they want to get out , now that their reasons for the war have so dramatically collapsed and domestic support is fading , is beyond doubt . 
But neither wants to leave in ignominy , with their last man dramatically lifted of an embassy rooftop by helicopter . 
Both Bush and Blair want to leave Iraq , if not with a victory , then at least with some sense of &quot; mission accomplished . &quot; 
Judging from their recent statements , the scenario that they are concocting is simple . 
In January , there will be elections in Iraq . 
The resulting government will then ask the occupation troops to leave , say , within a year . 
Withdrawal will begin next spring . 
While that scenario is simple , reality is not . 
The first nagging question is this : will there actually be elections next January ? 
Prime Minister Iyad Allawi assures the world that there will be , and President Bush echoes his words . 
More neutral observers - and indeed , the daily news bulletins about bombings and hostage taking and &quot; insurgents &quot; - cast doubt on that prospect . 
The probability of Iraqi elections being held this coming January must be lower than 50 % , and we can be certain that these will not be free and fair elections throughout the entire country . 
Indeed , Iraq no longer deserves to be described as a united country . 
It has now joined the growing list of the world &apos;s failed states and can at best be described as a potential federation of three states plus the unruly city of Baghdad . 
Without elections , the Coalition is in trouble . 
What other exit strategy can it devise ? 
Above all , however , Iraq is in trouble . 
What other way forward is there for that unhappy former country ? 
The answer need not be all despair . 
It may be that rethinking strategy in the light of new facts will open a way forward . 
After all , it might be the case that national elections in a place groping for a democratic future are not the best first step on the road to a liberal order . 
This is notably the case where entrenched groups - Kurds , Shiites , Sunnis - compete for central power . 
Elections , in such a case , may not even be wise at all - indeed , they may prove to be counterproductive . 
History suggests that elections do not create democracies . 
They confirm that the conditions for a democratic order are present . 
Thus , they are not the first step in the process of democratisation , but the last step in a preparatory phase in which at least two conditions have been created . 
The first condition is a settled territorial arrangement . 
In &quot; tribal &quot; societies , this is not easy to bring about . 
Bosnia &apos;s experience reveals why this is so . 
However much one may favor multiethnic nation-states , once such a construction has failed , it is imperative to listen to popular sentiment . 
Viable units will emerge that are less than ideal but at least capable of creating legitimate government - meaning a government that is both effective and acceptable . 
It would be disastrous to destroy the emergent Iraqi-Kurdish entity in the name of an abstract and no-longer existent greater Iraq . 
Anyone who experienced occupied Germany after World War II , as I did , remembers that the first postwar elections held there were local and regional . 
In fact , they established what are now the Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany . 
The second condition that must be satisfied before elections can be credible is security . 
Initially , this may be an issue for the military . 
Security requires not just troops , but laws and their enforcement . 
What one might call &quot; the liberal order &quot; requires at least two institutional ingredients . 
One is democracy , including elections and governments held to account by parliaments and ultimately the people . 
The other is the rule of law . 
Lord Ashdown , the High Representative of a coalition of countries in Bosnia-Herzegovina , has set a good example of how the rule of law can be established . 
It requires persons of great courage to become judges , and strong authorities to enforce their judgments . 
In a Muslim country , such a strategy would , moreover , provide protection against hijacking of the law by religious fanatics . 
It would establish what might be called the &quot; Turkish solution . &quot; 
Turkey &apos;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has taken up this very challenge , first set by his great predecessor Kemal Atatürk nearly a century ago . 
Perhaps what Iraq needs most is not a ballot box , but an Atatürk . 
Such a strategy would be less simple than merely holding highly imperfect elections . 
It would make the exit of occupation forces more complex and perhaps more drawn-out . 
It would , however , have a more lasting impact on democratic development than a dubious process by which a limited number of people go to the polls to elect an ineffectual central government . 
Such a strategy might even lead to an outcome about which those who want Iraq to join a free world can genuinely say : mission accomplished .
