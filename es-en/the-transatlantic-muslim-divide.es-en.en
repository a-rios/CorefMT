The Transatlantic Muslim Divide 
Compared with the tension that exists in Muslim communities across Europe , America &apos;s Muslims are a more contented lot . 
A recent Pew Forum study found Europe &apos;s Muslims to be &quot; markedly less well off than the general population , frustrated with economic opportunities and socially isolated , &quot; while most American Muslims say that &quot; their communities are excellent or good places &quot; to live ; 71 % say they can succeed in the US if they work . 
63 % of American Muslims report no conflict between religious devotion and living in modern society . 
Although 53 % of US Muslims think that life is more difficult since the terrorist attacks of 2001 , most think that this is the fault of the government , not their neighbors . 
Indeed , 73 % said they had never experienced discrimination while living in America . 
Moreover , 85 % said suicide bombing is rarely or never justified , and only 1 % said violence to defend Islam was &quot; often &quot; permissible . 
&quot; What emerges , &quot; according to Amaney Jamal , an adviser to Pew , &quot; is the great success of the Muslim American population in its socioeconomic assimilation . &quot; 
Yet &quot; assimilation &quot; is not what succeeds . 
&quot; Assimilation &quot; means dissolving into the mainstream , but Muslim-Americans do not , remaining devoutly Muslim in a country overwhelmingly Christian . 
America &apos;s Muslims do not so much assimilate as participate in economic , political , educational , and social life . 
This might reflect a self-selection process : only the most educated Muslims immigrate to America , as poor social services allow only the best-prepared to survive . 
Yet even middle-class Muslims in Britain become alienated , and , unlike the Muslim poor in Europe , poor Muslims in America don &apos;t express alienation or sympathy with al-Qaeda . 
It can be argued that only those poor eager for the harsh but open possibilities of American life immigrate to the US . 
Why do US Muslims do well while remaining devout and distinctive-looking ? 
Why can they participate without assimilating ? 
Two factors seem significant : first , relatively porous economic , political and educational arenas that allow immigrants entry to these key areas of American life . 
Despite the discrimination and poverty that immigrants often suffer initially , barriers to economic and political participation are relatively low . 
The second factor is America &apos;s pluralistic public sphere , an arena not without religion but with many religions , which are visible and active in civil life as the basis for institutions , publications , and symbols that influence values and conduct . 
The US is not a secular society ; it is a religiously pluralistic one with secular legal and political structures . 
Indeed , America &apos;s secular institutions were designed to support pluralism . 
They allow people of many creeds to work in them - a workplace of multiple faiths . 
The prohibition against a state religion together with freedom of conscience preserves the plurality of religion in civil life . 
This design was crafted not only from enlightened principle but from necessity : America needed to persuade people to cross the ocean and endure the hardships of the frontier and , later , industrialization . 
Freedom to practice one &apos;s religion was an advertisement for America . 
The benefit of that accidental generosity was the American deal : immigrants have to participate in the economic and political fracas of the nation , but without much of a social service safety &quot; net . &quot; 
On the other hand , they can get in . 
And they can keep not only their private faith but practice it publicly . 
Tolerance for other people &apos;s religion is the price paid for tolerance of one &apos;s own . 
Prejudice has tended to fall as participation increases . 
It has been in no one &apos;s interest to disturb this live-and let-live pragmatism for very long . 
One result of the deal is the paradoxical-sounding &quot; familiarity with difference . &quot; 
Because immigrants participate in America &apos;s economic and political arenas , Americans are used to different sorts of people and so distinguish those differences that might damage the country from those that will not . 
Americans , indeed , are familiar with difference , or at least they tend not to panic . 
Even after 2001 , there were only a few anti-Muslim incidents . 
Europe , however , demands greater assimilation and offers a less porous economy and politics . 
This means less participation and thus less familiarity with difference on the host country &apos;s side . 
On the immigrants &quot; side , there is more resentment against the host , more lassitude about the economy and politics , possible violence or an insistence on maintaining symbolic differences - ironically , in a society less able to accept them precisely because of its discomfort with difference . 
This is Europe &apos;s headscarf debate in a nutshell . 
It speaks to none of the barriers to participation or to immigrant responses to them , but demands symbolic assimilation . 
But such demands are a dead end . 
To get out of it , greater entry into the economy and politics is needed , but also less demand for quick-fix assimilation . 
All the religions that descend from Abraham have internal mechanisms for change that allow them to reckon with new circumstances in ways that the confessional community can respect . 
Both fundamentalism and the demands of assimilation - be like us , now ! - pre-empt these mechanisms . 
They should be allowed to work . 
This , sadly , is a road to the ghetto .
