The Dismal Economist &apos;s Joyless Triumph 
NEW YORK - I have long been forecasting that it was only a matter of time before America &apos;s housing bubble - which began in the early days of this decade , supported by a flood of liquidity and lax regulation - would pop . 
The longer the bubble expanded , the larger the explosion and the greater ( and more global ) the resulting downturn would be.ampnbsp ; 
Economists are good at identifying underlying forces , but they are not so good at timing . 
The dynamics are , however , much as anticipated . 
America is still on a downward trajectory for 2009 - with grave consequences for the world as a whole . 
For example , as their tax revenues plummet , state and local governments are in the process of cutting back their expenditures . 
American exports are about to decline . 
Consumer spending is plummeting , as expected . 
There has been an enormous decrease in ( perceived ) wealth , in the trillions , with the decline in house and stock prices . 
Besides , most Americans were living beyond their means , using their houses , with their bloated values , as collateral . 
That game is up.ampnbsp ; 
America would be facing these problems even if it were not simultaneously facing a financial crisis . 
America &apos;s economy had been supercharged by excessive leveraging ; now comes the painful process of deleveraging . 
Excessive leveraging , combined with bad lending and risky derivatives , has caused credit markets to freeze . 
After all , when banks don &apos;t know their own balance sheets , they aren &apos;t about to trust others . &quot; ampnbsp ; 
The Bush administration didn &apos;t see the problems coming , denied that they were problems when they came , then minimized their significance , and , finally , panicked . 
Guided by one of the architects of the problem , Hank Paulson , who had advocated for deregulation and allowing banks to take on even more leveraging , it was no surprise that the administration veered from one policy to another - each strategy supported with absolute conviction , until minutes before it was abandoned for another . 
Even if confidence really were all that mattered , the economy would have sunk . 
Moreover , what little action has been taken has been aimed at shoring up the financial system . 
But the financial crisis is only one of several crises facing the country : the underlying macroeconomic problem has been made worse by the sinking fortunes of the bottom half of the population . 
Those who would spend don &apos;t have the money , and those with the money aren &apos;t spending . 
America , and the world , is also facing a major structural problem , not unlike that at the beginning of the last century , when productivity increases in agriculture meant that a rapidly declining share of the population could find work there . 
Nowadays , increases in manufacturing productivity are even more impressive than they were for agriculture a century ago ; but that means the adjustments that must be made are all the greater . 
Not long ago , there was discussion of the dangers of a disorderly unwinding of the global economy &apos;s massive imbalances . 
What we are seeing today is part of that unwinding . 
But there are equally fundamental changes in the global balances of economic power : the hoards of liquid money to help bail out the world lie in Asia and the Middle East , not in West . 
Globalization has meant that we are increasingly interdependent . 
One cannot have a deep and long downturn in the world &apos;s largest economy without global ramifications . 
I had long argued that the notion of decoupling was a myth ; the evidence now corroborates that view . 
Many in the developing world have benefited greatly from the last boom , through financial flows , exports , and high commodity prices . 
Now , all of that is being reversed . 
Indeed , it is the ultimate irony that money is now flowing from poor and well-managed economies to the US , the source of the global problems . 
The point of reciting these challenges facing the world is to suggest that , even if Obama and other world leaders do everything right , the US and the global economy are in for a difficult period . 
The question is not only how long the recession will last , but what the economy will look like when it emerges . 
Will it return to robust growth , or will we have an anemic recovery , Ã  la Japan in the 1990 &quot; s ? 
Right now , I cast my vote for the latter , especially since the huge debt legacy is likely to dampen enthusiasm for the big stimulus that is required . 
Without a sufficiently large stimulus ( in excess of 2 % of GDP ) , we will have a vicious negative spiral : a weak economy will mean more bankruptcies , which will push stock prices down and interest rates up , undermine consumer confidence , and weaken banks . 
Consumption and investment will be cut back further . 
Many Wall Street financiers , having received their gobs of cash , are returning to their fiscal religion of low deficits . 
It is remarkable how , having proven their incompetence , they are still revered in some quarters . 
What matters more than deficits is what we do with money ; borrowing to finance high-productivity investments in education , technology , or infrastructure strengthens a nation &apos;s balance sheet . 
The financiers , however , will argue for caution : let &apos;s see how the economy does , and if it needs more money , we can give it . 
But a firm that is forced into bankruptcy is not un-bankrupted when a course is reversed . 
The damage is long-lasting.ampnbsp ; 
If Obama follows his instinct , pays attention to Main Street rather than Wall Street , and acts boldly , then there is a prospect that the economy will start to emerge from the downturn by late 2009 . 
If not , the short-term prospects for America , and the world , are bleak .
