Modernizing Corporate Taxation 
BERKELEY - How to tax the income of multinational corporations ( MNCs ) was an unlikely headline topic at the recent G-8 summit in Ireland . 
It will be a key agenda item at the upcoming G-20 summit in Russia as well . 
Given these companies &quot; significance to national and global economic performance , world leaders &quot; focus on the arcane intricacies of corporate taxation is easy to understand - perhaps nowhere more so than in the United States . 
As the US embarks on the difficult path of corporate tax reform , it should heed the United Kingdom &apos;s example . 
Even as it champions multilateral cooperation to ensure that MNCs pay their &quot; fair &quot; share , the British government has slashed its corporate rate , exempted the active foreign income of British MNCs from the national corporate tax , and enacted a &quot; patent box &quot; that stipulates a 10 % tax rate on qualified patent income . 
As a result of years of cuts in corporate tax rates by other countries , the US now has the highest rate among the advanced economies . 
Reducing the top US federal rate , currently at 35 % , to a more competitive level - the OECD average is around 25 % - would encourage investment and job creation in the US by both domestic and foreign MNCs . 
Paying for a rate cut by eliminating various corporate credits and deductions would simplify the code and trim the cost of compliance . 
It would also enhance efficiency by curbing tax-based distortions in companies &quot; investment decisions ( what and where ) and their choices concerning how to finance investments and which organizational forms to adopt . 
The Obama administration and Congressional leaders from both parties agree that a cut in the corporate tax rate should be revenue-neutral . 
Other advanced industrial countries have paid for corporate rate reductions partly by restricting depreciation and other deductions . 
Despite lower tax rates , corporate tax revenues have not declined in these countries and represent a larger share of GDP than they do in the US . 
In addition to reducing its corporate tax rate , the US needs to reform the way it taxes its MNCs &quot; foreign earnings . 
All other G-8 countries ( and most OECD countries ) boost their MNCs &quot; competitiveness by taxing only their domestic income , exempting most of their foreign earnings from domestic taxation ( an approach known as a territorial system ) . 
The US , by contrast , taxes its MNCs &quot; worldwide income , with taxes paid elsewhere credited against their US tax liability to avoid double taxation . 
The worldwide system puts US-based MNCs at a competitive disadvantage . 
They must pay the high US corporate rate on profits earned by their affiliates in low-tax foreign locations , while foreign MNCs headquartered in territorial systems pay only the local tax rate on such profits . 
Current US law blunts this disadvantage by allowing US companies to defer paying US tax on profits earned abroad by foreign affiliates until they are repatriated to their US owners . 
As a consequence of both the high US tax rate and deferral , US-based MNCs have a strong incentive to keep their foreign earnings abroad . 
Indeed , their non-US affiliates currently hold an estimated $ 2 trillion in accumulated foreign earnings . 
These earnings are &quot; locked out &quot; and unavailable to finance investment and job creation in the US , without incurring significant additional US taxes . 
Moreover , US companies incur efficiency costs from the suboptimal use of deferred earnings and higher levels of debt , as well as the burden of maintaining worldwide tax strategies . 
And these costs , estimated at 1-5 % of deferred earnings , have been rising rapidly in recent years , in line with the growing share of foreign markets in US-based MNCs &quot; revenues . 
A territorial system would address the competitiveness disadvantages , the &quot; lock-out &quot; effect , and the inefficiencies of the US &apos;s worldwide approach . 
But it would not reduce incentives for US corporations to shift their reported profits to low-tax jurisdictions ; on the contrary , such incentives would be even stronger in a pure territorial system . 
Given increasing globalization of business activity ; the rising importance of intangible capital that is difficult to price and easy to move ( for example , patents and brands ) ; competitive cuts in national corporate tax rates ; and the spread of tax havens , income shifting and the resulting tax-base erosion have become a major policy concern throughout the OECD . 
In response , other developed economies have used a variety of techniques to create &quot; hybrid &quot; territorial systems aimed at countering tax-base erosion . 
Such systems include transfer-pricing rules based on OECD guidelines ( used by the US as well ) , limits on interest deductibility , and domestic taxation of some kinds of income earned in low-tax locations where companies report large earnings but carry out little real economic activity . 
As part of comprehensive corporate tax reform that includes a revenue-neutral rate cut , the US Congress is currently considering a hybrid territorial reform and evaluating several measures to counter tax-base erosion and income shifting , including those used by other advanced countries . 
Republican Congressman David Camp , who is leading the legislative effort in the House of Representatives , has proposed an innovative alternative that rests on the &quot; destination principle &quot; : MNCs &quot; taxable earnings should be based largely on where their products are sold , rather than on where the companies are headquartered , where their production and financing occur , or where their profits are reported . 
Camp &apos;s proposal would significantly reduce incentives to move manufacturing abroad for tax reasons . 
By contrast , both America &apos;s worldwide system and other countries &quot; hybrid territorial systems rely on an &quot; origin or source principle &quot; that bases taxation largely on where input costs and production activities are located . 
The US last reformed its business tax code in 1986 , when it had one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world and the competitive dynamics of the global economy were very different . 
It is time for another comprehensive corporate tax reform , one that reduces the tax rate , broadens the tax base , and adopts a hybrid territorial approach with effective base-erosion safeguards .
