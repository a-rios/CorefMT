A Democratic Hurricane 
NEW YORK - Nothing concentrates the mind like a full-blown crisis . 
Like millions of other people in New York City , I heard Hurricane Sandy rattling my windows and battering my doors . 
I was luckier than many . 
Rattling is all it did . 
For many years , experts have been warning that such storms would overwhelm the city &apos;s antiquated urban infrastructure . 
Salt water came streaming into open subways . 
Damage to the power supply reduced a third of Manhattan to a pre-modern state of darkness . 
And that was just New York . 
No one can say with certainty that this particular storm was caused by global warming , but almost all experts agree that the effects of polar-ice melt and sea-level rise will make future storms worse . 
In this sense , Hurricane Sandy was like gun violence . 
Throughout the campaign season - and despite several highly publicized mass shootings in this period - neither President Barack Obama nor his challenger , Mitt Romney , wished to discuss the problem of laws in many states that allow almost anyone to carry lethal weapons and spray death around at random . 
The reason , of course , is that there are not enough votes to be gained in addressing these matters . 
Even if a majority of Americans agree that climate change is real , future disasters seem a long way off , or might happen somewhere else , so why worry about them now ? 
Perhaps more should be done to protect New York , among many other places , against future flooding , but , as a former city official told an interviewer : &quot; Until things happen , people aren &apos;t willing to pay for it . &quot; 
Does this point to a serious weakness in the democratic system ? 
Most voters , after all , think about their immediate interests - less taxation , more jobs , lower gasoline prices , and so on - and not about planning for the future , which is , in any case , unpredictable . 
We want to feel good right now . 
The future will take care of itself . 
There is something to be said for this attitude . 
The kind of politics that imposes sacrifices for the sake of future utopias has caused immense human suffering in the service of a variety of impossible ideals . 
Better , then , to stick to the here and now . 
Yet postponing , for the sake of immediate gratification , a certain degree of planning for the future collective good can be as disastrous as indulging in utopian schemes . 
Perhaps there are some non-utopian ways of transcending selfish interests and doing what is necessary . 
For example , in various countries , voters have been tempted to elect business tycoons : enough with politicians bickering over selfish interests - let the can-do strongmen take charge and run countries like corporations . 
Silvio Berlusconi was one such figure . 
Mitt Romney , in a milder , less flamboyant manner , has appealed to these sentiments as well : he knew how to run an investment company , so why not the US federal government ? 
In practice , however , such tycoon politicians have their own interests and gratifications to pursue . 
Berlusconi did indeed run Italy the way he runs his companies : like a private fiefdom , promoting cronies , intimidating critics , and paying people vast sums of money in exchange for their slavish devotion . 
And , two years after the earthquake in L &apos;Aquila in 2009 , which killed hundreds of people , nothing much had been done to reconstruct the city , despite an initial flurry of publicity stunts showing Berlusconi , posing in a fireman &apos;s hat , personally taking charge . 
What about the more serious-minded technocrats who run the Leninist-capitalist People &apos;s Republic of China ? 
The &quot; Chinese model , &quot; combining a capitalist economy with authoritarian government , has frequently been hailed as superior to the messy , dithering , compromising ways of liberal democracies . 
With no need to concern themselves about elections , China &apos;s leaders can afford to plan for the longer term and do what is necessary without being impeded by petty selfish interests or a carping press . 
These arrangements have indeed made it possible for China to build entire cities in a matter of years , as well as high-speed railways , opera houses , stadiums , industrial parks , massive dams , and whatnot . 
Many people have been lifted out of poverty , and those with the right political connections have become enormously rich . 
But the lack of transparency in this type of autocracy has also led to massive corruption and huge blunders , not to mention the growing signs of ecological ruin . 
Chinese critics of the government , or even those who simply wish to report mistakes or wrongdoing , are silenced with a heavy hand : beatings in police stations , draconian jail sentences , or even murder . 
That is what happened to the parents who openly expressed their anger about the ill-constructed school buildings that collapsed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake , killing their children . 
The children died because corrupt local officials had allowed developers to enrich themselves by using inferior building materials . Despite its flaws , a system in which elected officials are held publicly accountable and can be voted out of office is still preferable to rule by tycoons or technocrats . 
And , sometimes , radical changes are made , even in democracies , though a severe crisis often is required to mobilize voters behind a collective push for essential reform , as was true of the Great Depression in the 1930 &quot; s , which led to Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal . 
Perhaps Hurricane Sandy will spur US citizens and politicians to take climate change seriously - and to implement public policies aimed at protecting America &apos;s cities and coastlines . 
If so , we can only hope that this crisis will not have come too late .
