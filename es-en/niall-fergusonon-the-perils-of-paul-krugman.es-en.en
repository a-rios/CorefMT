Civilizing the Marketplace of Ideas 
CAMBRIDGE - &quot; When men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , &quot; US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in a famous dissenting opinion in 1919 , &quot; they may come to believe ... that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas - that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out . &quot; 
Like any market , however , the marketplace of ideas needs regulation : in particular , its participants should be bound by norms of honesty , humility , and civility . 
Moreover , every idea-trader should adhere to these principles . 
Of course , politicians through the ages have polluted the marketplace of ideas with invective . 
But in American politics , surprisingly , there has been progress . 
According to a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center , there has been less incivility in Congress in recent years than in the 1990 &quot; s or the 1940 &quot; s . 
Republican Senator Ted Cruz was widely condemned for his aggressive questioning of incoming Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel back in January . 
But casting aspersions on a nominee &apos;s patriotism was the norm in the McCarthy era ; it is less common today . 
Academia , by contrast , appears to be moving in the opposite direction . 
A &quot; social science &quot; like economics is supposed to be free of partisan vitriol . 
Yet economists now routinely stoop to ad hominem attacks and inflammatory polemics . 
As economists go , they do not come much mightier or more influential than Paul Krugman . 
A Nobel laureate who teaches at Princeton University , Krugman is also a columnist for the New York Times , whose commentaries and blog , &quot; The Conscience of a Liberal , &quot; are read with an almost religious fervor by liberal ( in the American sense ) economists and journalists around the world . 
He is a Twitter superstar , with more than a million followers . 
A dozen ardent epigones blog in sync with him , re-posting the wisdom of the master . 
Many people today naively believe that the Internet is an unmitigated boon for free speech . 
They underestimate the extent to which such a concentration of online power corrupts , just as surely as all forms of power corrupt . 
Since Krugman and I began debating fiscal and monetary policy back in 2009 , I have become increasingly alarmed by the way he abuses his power . 
Last week , I resolved to speak out in a three-article series , published squarely in the heart of the liberal blogosphere , the Huffington Post . 
As historians are trained to do , I based my argument on the archives . 
By quoting his past writings , I showed , first , that Krugman &apos;s repeated claims to have been &quot; right about everything &quot; in his economic commentary are false . 
Although ( like many others ) he identified a housing bubble in 2006 , he did not foresee the financial chain reaction that would fuel a global crisis . 
Having failed to predict the US crisis , he then incorrectly predicted the imminent disintegration of Europe &apos;s monetary union , publishing more than 20 statements on that subject in 2011 and 2012 . 
He has never admitted these errors ; on the contrary , he has retrospectively exaggerated his own prescience . 
Second , Krugman &apos;s claim that a vastly larger fiscal stimulus would have generated a more rapid economic recovery in the US depends entirely on conjecture . 
But the macroeconomic model on which he bases his claim can hardly be called reliable , given its manifest failures to predict either the crisis or the euro &apos;s survival . 
Moreover , at least one of his pre-crisis columns flatly contradicts his view today that current - or even higher - levels of federal debt carry no risk whatsoever . 
So he has no right to claim , as he has , &quot; a stunning victory &quot; in &quot; an epic intellectual debate . &quot; 
Finally - and most important - even if Krugman had been &quot; right about everything , &quot; there would still be no justification for the numerous crude and often personal attacks he has made on those who disagree with him . 
Words like &quot; cockroach , &quot; &quot; delusional , &quot; &quot; derp , &quot; &quot; dope , &quot; &quot; fool , &quot; &quot; knave , &quot; &quot; mendacious idiot , &quot; and &quot; zombie &quot; have no place in civilized debate . 
I consider myself lucky that he has called me only a &quot; poseur , &quot; a &quot; whiner , &quot; &quot; inane &quot; - and , last week , a &quot; troll . &quot; 
Far from engaging in Holmes &apos;s free trade in ideas , Krugman has been the intellectual equivalent of a robber baron , exploiting his power to the point of driving decent people away from the public sphere - particularly younger scholars , who understandably dread a &quot; takedown &quot; by the &quot; Invincible Krugtron . &quot; 
My preferred solution would be accountability . 
But I have given up hope that the New York Times will perform its proper editorial function . 
So , instead , I would suggest the intellectual equivalent of an antitrust law . 
For every word that Krugman publishes , he must henceforth commit to having first read at least a hundred words by other writers . 
I cannot guarantee that reading more widely will teach him honesty , humility , and civility . 
But it will at least reduce his unjustifiably large share of the marketplace of economic ideas . 
As a Supreme Court justice , of course , Holmes opposed antitrust regulations . 
But his arguments in this area failed his own &quot; test of truth , &quot; for they lacked &quot; the power ... to get ... accepted in the competition of the market . &quot; 
Holmes accepted defeat with his customary grace . 
It is high time that Krugman - right or wrong - learned to behave that way , too .
