The Honor of Exile 
The Romanian sculptor Brancusi once said that when the artist is no longer a child , he is dead . 
I still don &apos;t know how much of an artist I have become , but I grasp what Brancusi was saying . 
I can grasp - even at my age - my childish enduring self . 
Writing is a childish profession , even when it becomes excessively serious , as children often are . 
My long road of immaturity began more than half a century ago . 
It was July 1945 , a few months after I returned from a concentration camp called Transnistria . 
I lived that paradisiacal summer in a little Moldavian town , overwhelmed by the miraculous banality of a normal , secure environment . 
The particular afternoon was perfect , sunny and quiet , the room &apos;s semi-obscurity hospitable . 
I was alone in the universe , listening to a voice that was and wasn &apos;t mine . 
My partner was a book of Romanian fairy tales with a hard green cover , which I had been given a few days before when I turned the solemn age of 9 . 
That is when the wonder of words , the magic of literature started for me . 
Illness and therapy began at the same time . 
Soon , too soon , I wanted myself to be part of that family of word wizards , those secret relatives of mine . 
It was a way of searching for &quot; something else &quot; beyond the triviality of everyday life , and also of searching for my real self among the many individuals who inhabited me . 
I must confess that I also tried , several times , to get rid of that inner self , to find a surrogate capable of representing me better on the social scene . 
I studied engineering , not only because I wanted a profession that might protect me from the daily political demagogy , but also because I hoped it would protect me from that essential self I had discovered on an unforgettable post-war July afternoon . 
Yet the need for something drastically different and higher than the framed daily routine of an engineer and a citizen of the socialist paradise did not diminish . 
In that doubled estrangement , reading and writing proved to be , again and again , a saving disease . 
Finally , I was able to hear my own voice in my own book , which also had , as it happened , a green cover . 
In the world-circus the poet looks like an Augustus the Fool , ill-equipped for everyday life in which his fellow men offer and receive their share of edible reality . 
Yet his weakness may be seen as an unconventional and devious strength , his solitude a deeper kind of solidarity , his imagination a shortcut to reality . 
Inevitably , in the bright public square , Augustus the Fool , the poet , faces the Clown of Power . 
All human tragicomedy may be seen , occasionally , in this encounter , in the history of Circus as History . 
Nonetheless , the totalitarian experience remains incomparable in its pathology , in its masks and mendacity . 
An artist who has lived under tyranny ( and even one who hasn &apos;t ) cannot ignore the barrier that separates the two roles . 
For a writer , the exile par excellence - always a &quot; suspect , &quot; as Thomas Mann said - language is his placenta . 
More than for any other &quot; alien &quot; in his country , language is for a writer not only an achievement , but a spiritual home . 
Through language he feels rich and stable ; and when he is fully in charge of his wealth , he gains his citizenship , a sense of belonging . 
Language is always home and homeland for a writer . 
To be exiled from this last refuge represents the most brutal decentering of his being , a burning that reaches all the way to the core of creativity . 
I postponed the decision to leave Romania because I was childish enough to fool myself that I didn &apos;t live in a country , that I lived only in a language . 
Eventually , I took the language , the home , with me , as a snail does . 
It still is my childish refuge , my place of survival . 
Topics such as totalitarianism or exile may say a lot about my life and my writing , but however important , they don &apos;t in themselves tell about a piece of literature . 
Even in collective tragedies and extreme situations , the writer is searching , through his own vision , strategy , and style , for the destiny of the individual , for the human specificity of weakness and resilience and dreams , for the ambiguities and limits and surprises of individuality caught in the social deadlock . 
I hope that even in the dark frame of such topics the light of the human soul and mind , its contradictions and potential , the ceaseless questions about love and death , about commitment and cowardice , about solitude and solidarity , about the tragicomedy of humans reveal , for better or worse , the imprint of the author . 
I was , in fact , more preoccupied with the &quot; gray zone &quot; in which I saw a kind of rainbow zone of truth , allowing me to search beyond undifferentiated darkness for individual features , and thus to introduce in the apparent uniformity of the extreme situation unsettling nuances . 
As liberating as it was , going from internal exile into exile itself was a no easy experience . 
I have learned , however , in the more than ten years that have passed since I felt that burning , to honor exile , doing so in the name of all that is challenge and epiphany , of all the doubts and the lifelong apprenticeship it implies , for its emptiness and richness , for the unfettering of myself and the clash within myself . 
The stranger consciously or unconsciously is always a potential or partial exile and all real writers are perpetual exiles from this world , even when , like Proust , they hardly leave their rooms . 
More and more , exile is an emblem of our time . 
Everywhere , people face the contradiction between centrifugal , cosmopolitan modernity and the centripetal need ( or at least nostalgia ) for belonging . 
It is impossible to predict what place , if any , literature will have in the future . 
I don &apos;t dare to believe , as Dostoevsky did , that beauty can save our world . 
But we may hope that it can play a role in consoling and redeeming our loneliness . 
We may hope that its promise of beauty , its challenge of truth , its redefinition of goodness , its unpredictable playfulness will be difficult to abandon even in uncertain and dangerous times . 
The artist remains , no matter how childish it may seem , a secret laborer of love . 
He daily reinvents the premises of the difficult search ; he honors his reader , a stranger similar and dissimilar , with the gift of an exacting love . 
Thus he can continue his never-ending adventure and humanize his shipwreck wherever he may be .
