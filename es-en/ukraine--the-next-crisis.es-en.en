Ukraine : The Next Crisis ? 
The Russian invasion of Georgia has sent shock waves throughout the West and the former Soviet space - especially Ukraine . 
Indeed , Ukraine could be the next potential crisis . 
Georgia &apos;s increasingly pro-Western course , including growing ties to NATO , has been a thorn in Moscow &apos;s side . 
Georgia &apos;s army is small , ill-equipped and no match for Russia &apos;s , as was amply demonstrated this month . 
Ukraine &apos;s integration into NATO , by contrast , would have far-reaching strategic consequences , ending any residual Russian hopes of forming a ampquot ; Slavic Unionampquot ; composed of Russia , Belarus and Ukraine - a dream that still beats in the breast of many Russians . 
It would also have important implications for the Russian defense industry , notably air defense and missile production . 
In short , the real source of Moscow &apos;s anxiety and strategic angst is Ukraine &apos;s future political and security orientation . 
Georgia has largely been a side show . 
Russia has a number of means of pressuring Ukraine short of using military force . 
One is energy . 
Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian energy , particularly gas . 
Russia has used the gas issue as a foreign policy instrument . 
Ukraine currently pays $ 179 per 1,000 cubic meters for gas from Russia - more than three times what it paid in 2004 - and there have been reports that Moscow is considering a further doubling of the price . 
Russia &apos;s long-term strategy is to try to gain control of Ukraine &apos;s pipelines by transferring them to a joint venture , as it has done in Belarus , thus enabling it to control both supply and distribution of gas to Ukraine . 
The Black Sea Fleet is another potential source of tension . 
Under an agreement signed in 1997 , Ukraine granted Russia basing rights for the fleet at Sevastopol in Crimea until 2017 . 
Ukraine has been pressing Russia to begin discussions on the fleet &apos;s withdrawal . 
Crimea itself represents a third potential flash point . 
Crimea is the only region in Ukraine where ethnic Russians constitute an overwhelming majority of the population ( 58 per cent ) . 
Khrushchev transferred the peninsula to Ukraine in 1954 as a gift to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the unification of Ukraine and Russia . 
At the time , the gesture was largely symbolic , as Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and few could envisage an independent Ukraine . 
Separatist pressures emerged in Crimea immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
They subsided after 1995 largely because the Russian separatists were divided , and Moscow , facing separatist pressures in Chechnya , showed little inclination to support them . 
However , separatist pressures , while diminished , continue to exist in Crimea . 
Given Crimea &apos;s historic ties to Russia and its majority ethnic Russian population , many Ukrainian officials fear that Russia could try to foment separatist movements in Crimea as a means of putting pressure on Ukraine to curb its ties to the West . 
Moscow &apos;s tactics in Abkhazia and South Ossetia provide cause for concern in this regard . 
Russia encouraged and supported separatist movements in both entities , then used the separatist tensions to justify sending ampquot ; Russian peacekeepersampquot ; into the regions . 
Moreover , it granted Russian citizenship to Abkhaz and South Ossetian residents , and then justified its recent invasion of Georgia on the grounds that it had an obligation to protect Russian citizens . 
Western allies have a strong strategic interest in supporting Ukrainian democracy and Ukraine &apos;s Euro-Atlantic integration . 
As the Georgian crisis has underscored , there are limits to the ability to influence developments in a region where Russia has strong strategic interests and a preponderance of military power . 
Thus Europe and the United States need to be very careful about making security commitments they are unwilling or unable to carry out . 
This does not mean that Moscow should be given a veto over Ukraine &apos;s security orientation or that Ukraine can never become a member of NATO . 
The door for Ukraine to join NATO should remain open . 
But with Russia in a defiant mood and refusing to fully withdraw its troops from Georgia , now is not the time to accelerate efforts to bring Ukraine into the Alliance . 
Poking an angry bear is not a wise policy . 
Ask Mikheil Saakashvili .
