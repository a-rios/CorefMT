Rolling the Dice in Cyprus 
PRINCETON - The task was never going to be an easy one : impose losses worth about € 5.8 billion ( $ 7.5 billion ) on lenders to the Cypriot government and depositors with the country &apos;s banks . 
And now that effort has led Europe to its latest impasse . 
In marathon negotiations , the Cypriot government , under the supervision of the troika ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) , agreed to a one-time &quot; tax &quot; on bank deposits . 
But , despite an amendment to exempt accounts containing less than € 20,000 , the Cypriot parliament overwhelmingly rejected the plan , leaving Cyprus - and Europe - in limbo . 
There were other options . 
Lee Buchheit , the veteran sovereign-debt attorney who should have been in the negotiating room , and Mitu Gulati of Duke University have proposed an elegant &quot; reprofiling &quot; of Cyprus &apos;s € 15 billion sovereign debt that would instantly reduce the financing pressure on the country . 
Instead , the initial decision was to confiscate just under € 3 billion from accounts containing less than € 100,000 - the cutoff for deposit insurance . 
Make no mistake : this would have been the greatest policy error since the start of the financial crisis five years ago . 
Indeed , the proposal amounted to a rupture with the near-universal agreement that small depositors should be considered sacrosanct . 
After all , televised news footage of panicked depositors in long lines outside banks and at ATMs can cause immeasurable financial damage far beyond a country &apos;s borders . 
Historians will argue whether forcing Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy in September 2008 precipitated the subsequent global financial crisis . 
Vincent Reinhart , formerly of the US Federal Reserve and now at Morgan Stanley , has argued that the Lehman decision was correct ( the error came earlier , with the bailout of Bear Stearns , which created an expectation that all banks would be bailed out ) . 
Private risks must be privately borne . 
By contrast , the proposal to impose losses on small Cypriot depositors had no redeeming justification whatsoever . 
As in Ireland , the most vulnerable were being asked to take the hit , while large depositors were let off lightly and other lenders were to be spared . 
There has never been an official explanation of why lenders to a sovereign should not share the pain , despite the &quot; no bailout &quot; principle on which the eurozone was founded . 
Most observers cite the authorities &quot; concern that if any sovereign does not honor its debts , all sovereign borrowers will be penalized . 
In mid-2007 , Cyprus qualified for eurozone membership by meeting the stringent Maastricht criteria , intended to ensure that new entrants would behave responsibly and flourish in the secure environment provided by the currency union . 
In the months leading up to the decision , the IMF urged Cyprus to take all necessary steps to ensure a favorable outcome . 
The benefits of Cyprus &apos;s adoption of the euro may never be clear . 
By 2009 , the IMF &apos;s Article IV Staff Report was already ringing the alarm bells . 
Public debt was still low , but growing rapidly ; the current-account deficit was ballooning ( reaching 15 % of GDP in 2008 ) ; and the banks had gone Icelandic , with assets worth more than three times Cyprus &apos;s GDP . 
As the report noted , the huge and highly concentrated banking sector &apos;s problems could &quot; quickly escalate to systemic proportions with serious economic repercussions . &quot; 
And so they have . 
This is a remarkable outcome , given that the risks have been so well known and understood . 
Indeed , the Cypriot authorities have been engaged in ongoing discussions with the troika for the past year . 
Compounding that error was the absence of any substantive decision concerning how to extricate Cyprus from its downward spiral . 
Cypriot debt , we are told , will rise to 140 % of GDP , but will fall to about 100 % of GDP in less than a decade . 
This appears to be another replay of the Greek scenario , with targets for reducing the debt burden repeatedly missed , until more drastic steps become inevitable . 
Most important , no restructuring of Cypriot banks appears imminent ; on the contrary , the intent seems to be to keep large depositors from fleeing and preserve the highly risky system . 
The Central Bank of Cyprus has provided large loans to Cypriot banks under the Emergency Liquidity Assistance arrangement , implying that the collateral offered did not meet the standards of the ECB . 
More train wrecks are in the making . 
The problems in Cyprus now threaten international financial stability . 
If the idea of a European banking union is serious , now is the moment to advance it . 
That means reaffirming the commitment to deposit insurance , closing unviable banks , and recapitalizing the rest with European ( not Cypriot ) funds . 
The troika &apos;s decision on Cyprus was akin to policymaking by rolling the dice . 
The coming days will reveal the extent of the immediate damage that it has caused . 
Could the Cypriot setback catalyze a fresh start ?
