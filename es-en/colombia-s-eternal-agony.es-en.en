Colombia &apos;s Eternal Agony 
Colombia is in better shape today than it has been for years , thanks largely to President Alvaro Uribe &apos;s leadership , but it remains a bizarre place , one facing strange and intractable challenges . 
Colombia &apos;s FARC guerrillas have held some of their kidnapping victims for many years . 
Child soldiers still linger in paramilitary groups , and there are compromising video recordings of leading Colombian politicians and drug lords . 
Perhaps weirdest of all , there are imprisoned guerrillas who refuse to be set free , and a government that insists on liberating them , even against their will . 
Uribe was re-elected just over a year ago by a landslide , a tribute to the popularity and effectiveness of his &quot; democratic security &quot; policy of combating both the guerrillas and the country &apos;s generalized violence . 
Latin America &apos;s oldest standing two-party system was decimated in that election , as the Polo Democrático presidential candidate won more votes than the Liberal Party &apos;s contender , finally giving electoral expression to left-wing forces that had never been able to see more potential for change at the ballot box than by fighting in the mountains . 
Negotiations on Colombia &apos;s Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) with the United States had been finalized . 
Even the questionable deal Uribe cut with the right-wing paramilitary AUC groups , pardoning up to 30,000 of their members for often horrendous crimes in exchange for their disarmament , appeared successful . 
With Uribe in charge , Colombia seemed to be on a roll . 
But much of this success has since been squandered , with both Colombia and Uribe now in deep trouble . 
The so-called parapolítica scandals have rocked Uribe &apos;s government , forcing the resignation of some cabinet ministers , and embarrassing others , including the president himself . 
Photographs , videos , and audio recordings of politicians and paramilitary thugs ( including one who boasts of having personally killed more than 300 of his enemies ) have discredited a political elite that , while never very popular , has now had some of the worst suspicions that many held about it graphically confirmed . 
For years human rights activists and scholars suspected the obvious : the emergence of an enormous , vicious , well-armed , and well-trained parallel army to fight the guerillas was not some spontaneous act . 
It was , many believed , a deliberate policy devised and carried out by the official military and the political elite to wage war &quot; off the books . &quot; 
The parapolítica or paragate revelations seem to confirm another suspicion as well : the distinction between the paramilitaries and the drug cartels , like that between the guerrillas and the cartels , is a nuanced one . 
Unfortunately , these revelations come at the worst possible moment . 
Colombia &apos;s FTA with the US was in danger the moment the US Republicans lost their majority in both houses of Congress last November . 
Now it appears that President George W. Bush &apos;s closest ally in the hemisphere will not only have its FTA rejected , owing to human rights concerns in the US House and Senate . 
Moreover , it might also lose Plan Colombia , the huge - and hugely controversial - American aid program that has funneled tens of billions of dollars into Colombia since the late 1990 &quot; s , ostensibly to fight the drug cartels , but also , in fact , to wage counter-insurgency . 
Uribe has spent weeks directly and personally lobbying key American legislators , and he is undoubtedly his own best advocate . 
But , just as former US Vice-President Al Gore recently refused to share a dais with Uribe in Miami , many members of Congress refuse to approve a trade agreement or an aid package that may link them to a government tainted by egregious human rights abuses , complicity with drug lords , or both . 
The US has never really wanted to include human rights issues in trade agreements ; at best , and only when forced , US presidents have consented to incorporating labor and environmental chapters . 
The European Union thinks differently ; in its economic cooperation and free trade agreement with Mexico , for example , it insisted on - and achieved - the inclusion of a &quot; democracy clause &quot; that made its economic benefits conditional on ongoing respect for democratic rule and human rights . 
Colombia &apos;s blemished human rights record is affecting its government &apos;s international standing and providing ammunition for those who wish to sabotage the FTA . 
For example , protectionist Democrats in the US Congress have been able to insulate themselves from charges of opposing free trade if they scuttle Colombia &apos;s FTA , because they will most likely ratify the deals for Panama and Peru . 
Can Uribe survive his current travails ? 
The answer is almost certainly yes , unless the parapolítica mess reaches him directly , or the US explicitly rejects the FTA and postpones or attaches conditions to renewal of funding for Plan Colombia . 
Uribe &apos;s political demise would hurt everyone , but the rejection of the FTA on human rights grounds could set a healthy precedent . 
In a region where threats to democracy and human rights are growing , linking trade and economic policy to these considerations is not a bad idea . 
Uribe may not deserve such a fate , but history works in strange ways .
