Are Stock Markets Really Becoming More Short Term ? 
CAMBRIDGE - In a recent commentary , I examined whether increasing pressure from more rapid stock trading is inducing corporate managers to obsess more over quarterly results , impairing their capacity to run their firms for the long term . 
But I noted how pressures from governments and rapid technological change are potentially just as powerful as those from stock-market trading . 
How carefully can one plan for the long term in , say , the eurozone , if the currency itself is at risk ? 
And how long should brick-and-mortar retailers &quot; time horizons be if distribution is moving online ? 
It is regularly argued ( to the point of having become conventional wisdom ) that cheap and easy portfolio reconfiguration , technical trading strategies , and investors &quot; moves from one sector to another force managers to pay too much attention to immediate financial results . 
And , as trading accelerates , the pressures increase . 
But , even if managers and boards at publicly traded firms focus excessively on their quarterly results , and even if median stock-holding periods have shortened greatly in recent decades , it is difficult to know whether stock-market trading has become more rapid in ways that would make managers pay even more attention to quarterly results . 
We must draw some very basic - but insufficiently recognized - distinctions about averages . 
One way to measure the average stock-holding period and its change over the past quarter-century is to add up all holding periods of all investors at the end of the year and divide the total by a weighted average of the stockholders . 
The result - the mean - is the average holding period . 
Alternatively , we might line up all of the holders from shortest to longest and check how the holding period for the one in the middle has changed - the median . 
Often , these two ways to measure an average will have the same result and show the same rate of change . 
But when they differ , the difference should affect our thinking about the phenomenon . 
For stock markets , the difference may be important . 
Consider something not involving stock trading . 
Imagine a suburb of Seattle with a population of 10,000 and an average annual per capita income of $ 50,000 in 1970 . 
By 1980 , the average soars to $ 100,000 . 
What was the source of this spectacular increase ? 
Was it superior education , good policing , infrastructure development , or something else ? 
Can policymakers elsewhere study what the suburb was doing right and imitate it ? 
Now consider that mean wealth doubled in Redmond , Washington , as a result of Bill Gates &quot; success . 
By 1980 , his meager 1970 income of $ 50,000 had increased to , say , $ 50 million . 
Is it meaningful to say that average income in Redmond had doubled in the decade , when income was unchanged for everyone else ? 
The median , unchanged over the decade , would better describe the suburb &apos;s average income . 
Whether Redmond &apos;s average wealth increased depends on how you look at it . 
For stock markets , consider this possibility : 100 shareholders each hold 100 shares of the XYZ Corporation for three years . 
They sell their shares after holding them for three years to other investors , who in turn hold their shares for three years and then re-sell them . 
The average holding duration for each shareholder is three years . 
Thereafter , 90 do what they have always done - hold for three years . 
But the other 10 sell their shares every four months to a new set of shareholders . 
One might be tempted to say that the average duration for holding stock in the XYZ Corporation was only 20 months , while in the good old days it was 36 months . 
In other words , holding duration was nearly halved . 
And , if we think managers are paying more attention than ever to quarterly results , we might think we have found the culprit . 
But what is the best way to interpret the change in the holding duration for policymaking purposes ? 
For 90 % of the shareholders , nothing has changed and their holding period has not shortened . 
This analytic problem is hardly unique to short-termism . 
When a distribution is skewed and not symmetrical around a middle value , the mean can fail to describe properly the population and its change over time . 
Emerging evidence suggests that this may well be the case in the stock market . 
A team of finance economists - Martijn Cremers , Ankur Pareek , and Zacharias Sautner - recently assembled data examining a related issue . 
They find that holding durations for two of America &apos;s primary shareholders , Fidelity and Vanguard , have not budged since 1985 . 
More broadly , the duration of holdings by mutual funds and pension funds - America &apos;s core stockholder class - increased during the quarter-century from 1985 to 2010 . 
In 1985 , the duration for stock holding in the United States was 1.2 years ; by 2010 , it had increased to 1.5 years . 
A fringe of rapid traders may well have greatly reduced the mean duration of stock holding , but , for the bulk of traditional American shareholders , the duration did not change . 
These results fit badly with the typical argument that short-termism has increased in recent decades . 
Maybe the stockholder base was too short-term-oriented a quarter-century ago - maybe the original 1.2 year ( mean ) average holding period was too short . 
But , if American management has become more short-termist in the ensuing quarter-century and even more attentive to quarterly financial results , the reason does not seem to be a shortening of core shareholders &quot; holding period . 
The media , corporate players , and lawmakers seem not to be thinking about the problem - and how to measure it - properly .
