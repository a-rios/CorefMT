Bretton Woods III 
SINGAPORE - Many analysts and observers believe that the global imbalances that characterized the world economy in the years before the 2008 crisis have substantially dissipated . 
But , while it is true that China &apos;s current-account surpluses and America &apos;s deficits have somewhat moderated since then , have the imbalances really been corrected ? 
More important , can the post-crisis global economy enjoy both growth and balance ? 
To answer these questions , it is important to understand the imbalances &quot; underlying dynamics . 
An economy &apos;s current account is the difference between its investment rate and its savings rate . 
In 2007 , the United States had a savings rate of 14.6 % of GDP , but an investment rate of 19.6 % , generating a current-account deficit . 
By contrast , China had a fixed investment rate of 41.7 % of GDP and a savings rate of 51.9 % , reflected in a large surplus . 
Since 2007 , the US current-account deficit has narrowed , but not because of a higher savings rate . 
Rather , the external deficit has been squeezed by a collapse in investment activity , while America &apos;s overall savings rate has fallen below 13 % of GDP , owing to worsening government finances . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s savings rate remains stubbornly high . 
The surplus has narrowed because investment has been ramped up even higher , to roughly 49 % of GDP . 
In other words , the Americans save even less today than they did before the crisis erupted , and the Chinese invest even more . 
Any future recovery in the US economy will almost certainly trigger a revival in investment activity . 
American businesses have postponed much-needed capital spending and , with American airports and bridges in appalling condition by developed-country standards , investment in infrastructure is crucial as well . 
Indeed , it is very likely that reviving growth will lead to larger current-account deficits , even if the savings rate improves and domestic energy production curtails oil and gas imports . 
China has the opposite problem . 
In order to sustain growth , it needs to continue to invest half of its $ 9 trillion annual GDP - no easy task for a country that already has brand new highways and airports . 
In fact , over the next decade , as China attempts to move up the value chain into services and adjusts to a shrinking workforce , its investment requirements will shrink - and its investment rate will fall sharply . 
Of course , China &apos;s savings rate will also decline , but Japan &apos;s experience since the 1980 &quot; s demonstrates how a sharp fall in investment can generate large and persistent current-account surpluses , even when the savings rate is falling and the currency is appreciating . 
Indeed , a stronger currency can paradoxically feed external surpluses , while discouraging investment in export-oriented industries . 
The implication is that the post-crisis global economy will not be characterized by balance , but by a return to large macroeconomic imbalances . 
But , although many economists will consider this problematic , history shows that symbiotic imbalances have characterized virtually all periods of global economic expansion . 
The Roman Empire ran a persistent trade deficit with India for centuries . 
Although the resulting outflow of gold caused monetary debasement in the Roman Empire , Indo-Roman trade remained the backbone of the global economy . 
Similarly , Spain ran persistent deficits in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , paid for by Andean silver . 
The resulting flood of liquidity caused a global boom that benefited economies from Elizabethan England to Mughal India . 
And 1870-1913 , another period of rapid growth and globalization , was not characterized by balance ; it was funded by the United Kingdom , acting as the world &apos;s &quot; bank . &quot; 
In the last 60 years , the US has underpinned global growth by running persistent current-account deficits . 
Under the Bretton Woods system , the US ran deficits that enabled war-torn Europe and Japan to rebuild . 
In return , Europe funded the US deficits . 
The system broke down when European countries , particularly France , decided to stop funding those deficits . 
But the economic model persisted , with Asian economies stepping in to finance the US deficits , while using the US market to grow rapidly . 
China is the latest and largest beneficiary of the economic model dubbed &quot; Bretton Woods II . &quot; 
Clearly , periods of global growth are almost always characterized by symbiotic imbalances . 
But , while each of these episodes was characterized by macroeconomic distortions caused by the imbalances , they lasted for years , or even decades . 
So , the real question is what the next generation of symbiotic imbalances will look like . 
It is likely that China will soon return to running very large current-account surpluses - potentially large enough to fund the US , with plenty left over for the rest of the world . 
As this capital cascades through the global financial system , it will re-inflate the economy . 
In the &quot; Bretton Woods III &quot; system , China will transform from &quot; factory to the world &quot; to &quot; investor to the world . &quot; 
Like all imbalanced systems , it will have its distortions , but the arrangement could last for many years .
