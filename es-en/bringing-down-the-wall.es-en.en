Bringing Down the Wall 
A quiz for history buffs . 
Twenty years ago - on June 4 , 1989 - three events shaped a fateful year . 
Which do you remember most vividly , and which most changed the world ? 
a ) The bloody denouement of the protests on Tiananmen Square . 
c ) The Polish elections . 
The victory of the famed opposition trade-union movement , Solidarity , in Eastern Europe &apos;s first free election since 1946 was eclipsed by the violent crackdown in Beijing and Khomeini &apos;s tumultuous passing . 
Yet no single event did more to bring down communism in Europe - and thus to re-shape the post-war international order . 
The next few months will bring all sorts of commemorations of communism &apos;s end , particularly of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 . 
To many , it was a glorious moment , emblematic of the West &apos;s victory in the Cold War , and one that seemed to come out of the blue . 
But if you watched the Eastern Bloc &apos;s disintegration from the ground , you would know that the process was far longer and more complex than most people realize . 
The Polish election was a point of no return , the moment when forces for change became irreversible . 
They gathered momentum after a summer of labor strikes , when Poland &apos;s communist chief , General Wojciech Jaruzelski , concluded that the country &apos;s economic troubles were too grim to face alone . 
Why not enlist the help of Poland &apos;s opposition , he reasoned , if not to solve the problems , then at least to share the blame for them ? 
And so , after six months of bargaining , a historic deal was struck . 
Poland would hold free and fair parliamentary elections , and Solidarity would compete . 
It never occurred to the ruling communists ( or to Solidarity ) that they might lose . 
Never in their wildest dreams did they imagine being driven from power altogether . 
Yet that is what happened . 
In retrospect , it is astonishing that there should have been any doubt . 
Solidarity &apos;s campaign was all chutzpah . 
An iconic campaign poster captured the public mood : a picture of a gun-slinging Gary Cooper as the sheriff in the classic western High Noon . 
June 4 was the day of reckoning in Dodge City East . 
On that bright Sunday morning , as spring turned to summer , voters wasted little time in dispatching Poland &apos;s communists to the abattoir . 
On their dying day , Poland &apos;s communists managed one last perversity , a final and unwitting act of utter self-humiliation . 
They devised an electoral system whereby Poles would not vote for candidates of their choice , but would cross out those they did not want - which is to say , each and every communist . 
Everywhere you looked , people were excising hated autocrats . 
Here , at long last , was Poland &apos;s long-awaited popular uprising , revenge for December 1980 , when Jaruzelski declared martial law , banned Solidarity , and threw its leaders in jail . 
Revolution by deletion ! 
The pen , at last mightier than the sword , became a weapon of glorious retribution , wielded with style . 
Some voters slashed their ballots boldly , decapitating the old regime with flourishing strokes . 
Others savored the moment , perhaps puffing a cigarette as they reveled in this or that deletion . 
Pfft ! 
Pfft ! 
Pfft ! 
By contrast , the communists &quot; campaign was all but invisible . 
In all of Warsaw , only a couple government candidates bothered to put up posters . 
Most counted on the party &apos;s media monopoly to carry their message , such as it was : &quot; Vote Lezek , a good communist . &quot; 
To their credit , the regime accepted its inevitable loss with remarkable grace . 
At three p.m. on the day after the vote , Jaruzelski summoned top party officials . 
&quot; A political solution will have to be found . &quot; 
By that , he meant no violence and no doctoring the ballot count . 
The communists would have to live with the result . Twenty years later , I remain mystified . 
Those of us covering Eastern Europe knew that Solidarity would win . 
We knew , too , that its peaceful victory would be a lesson for the rest of the bloc . 
For anti-communists everywhere , the Polish election was extraordinarily encouraging . 
Thanks to Poland , what only days before had seemed impossible was , suddenly , possible . 
There were other signs . 
In May , Hungarian reformers began tearing down the fence along their border with Austria - a hole in the Iron Curtain . 
In Moscow , Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of a &quot; Common European House &quot; and repudiated the interventionist Brezhnev Doctrine . 
Yet when the Wall tumbled down , experts and world leaders alike were unanimous . 
The Cold War had lasted so long that change seemed unimaginable until freedom burst forth .
