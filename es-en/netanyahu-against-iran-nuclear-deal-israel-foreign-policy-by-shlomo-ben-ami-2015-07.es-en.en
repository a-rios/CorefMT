The Horseman of the Jewish Apocalypse 
TEL AVIV - The nuclear agreement reached by Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( China , France , Russia , the United States , and the United Kingdom ) , plus Germany , is not about Iran &apos;s capitulation , as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu wished . 
And it is about as imperfect as any negotiated agreement between disputing parties can be . 
Nonetheless , it creates a solid framework to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons for the next 10-15 years - and that is a very positive development . 
Netanyahu , if he wished , could take a lot of the credit for this achievement . 
Had he not fueled global hysteria over Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , the crippling international sanctions regime that eventually pushed Iran to a deal might never have been implemented . 
But Netanyahu has stubbornly insisted that the agreement is a strategic fiasco , citing its ambiguities in matters such as the mechanism of inspection , the number of centrifuges Iran will be allowed to maintain , and the conditions for re-imposing sanctions if Iran breaches the accord . 
In pursuing this course , Netanyahu has not only missed the opportunity to claim a major diplomatic victory ; he has also reinforced Israel &apos;s international isolation . 
Netanyahu is now doing all he can to persuade the US Congress to pass a &quot; resolution of disapproval . &quot; 
This is highly unlikely to occur , especially in an election year , given that it would require 13 Democratic senators and 48 Democratic representatives to break with US President Barack Obama . 
Indeed , Netanyahu &apos;s effort is succeeding only in turning Israel into an increasingly divisive partisan issue in US politics . 
That is a dangerous game : The US has broken with the international community to support Israel in the past ; it is less willing to do so today . 
Even if Netanyahu managed to secure such a Congressional resolution , doing so would not serve his interests . 
Given that the resolution would affect only US sanctions , it might not nullify the agreement , with the lifting of sanctions by all other international powers proving sufficient motivation for Iran to uphold its end of the bargain . 
Worse , Iran could then decide to gallop toward the bomb , now with the support of countries like China and Russia , within an increasingly fragmented international system . 
Despite the obvious problems with Netanyahu &apos;s position , dismissing it would be a mistake . 
Contrary to popular belief , he is not just a cynical politician in search of an agenda to deflect attention away from growing domestic problems and the conflict with Palestine . 
His obsessive focus on Iran - not to mention the seemingly irrational calculus that is driving him toward a politically suicidal confrontation with the US , his country &apos;s most important benefactor - stems from deep-rooted convictions , a system of political thought , and his own perspective on Jewish history . 
Netanyahu is an ideologue of Jewish catastrophe . 
His view of Jewish history reflects that of his father , the historian Benzion Netanyahu , who went to America in the 1940s to challenge the Allies &quot; failure to rescue European Jewry from the Holocaust , and thus to mobilize support for Zionism . 
In fact , Netanyahu remembered his father &apos;s efforts in his address to the US Congress last March . 
But Netanyahu goes a step further than remembering the past . 
Zionism was supposed to enable the Jews to break with their history . 
Netanyahu , however , has imbued the Israeli state &apos;s existence with all of the Jewish people &apos;s past anxieties , pains , and struggles . 
It does not matter that Israel possesses , according to foreign sources , a nuclear arsenal , as well as a robust economy and a strong alliance with the world &apos;s most powerful country ; for Netanyahu , it is essentially an old Jewish ghetto , attempting to hold out against relentless threats . 
In this Hobbesian worldview , the threats can stem from virtually any development - political , strategic , or otherwise - and amount to existential challenges to the entire Jewish nation . 
The only way to avoid catastrophe is to remain constantly vigilant . 
By this logic , risks and challenges cannot be approached with a view toward resolution ; they must be held up as reminders for the Jewish people to keep up their guard . 
Netanyahu would dismiss as political lunacy the notion that the nuclear agreement opened a 10-15-year window for creative statesmanship to reshape regional politics . 
A regional system of peace and security based on an accord with Arab countries that includes nuclear non-proliferation is , he would argue , the agenda of na√Øve dreamers , not of a leader so aware of the lessons of Jewish history . 
Palestine is no different from Iran , from this perspective . 
The Palestinian conflict is unsolvable , too ; at best , it can be managed . 
With Hamas control in Gaza reinforcing the view of Palestine as a threat , the issue galvanizes the Israeli-Jewish nation . 
If Israel is to reverse its shift toward international isolation , and help build a stable regional security environment , it must change its approach . 
Paranoia and antagonism must give way to sober politics , with Israeli leaders discussing potential strategic compensation with the US , working with other powers to address Iran &apos;s support for Hamas and Hezbollah , and considering a credible revival of peace negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas . 
Israel &apos;s Labour Party , which is now debating whether to join Netanyahu &apos;s government , should consider carefully whether it can bring about such a shift . 
If it cannot , and no other force emerges to do the job , Netanyahu &apos;s prophecies of doom risk becoming self-fulfilling .
