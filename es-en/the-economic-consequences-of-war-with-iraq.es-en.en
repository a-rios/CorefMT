The Economic Consequences of War with Iraq 
War with Iraq seems inevitable , with or without the support of the UN . 
The economic costs of such a war could be huge , both in direct American outlays for war and its aftermath , and in the indirect spillovers on the world economy . 
This war would take place against a background of weak economic conditions globally , and would exacerbate those weaknesses , perhaps throwing the world economy into recession . 
The economic outcome of war could well depend on the diplomatic context . 
If America acts alone , the likely costs of war to the world economy will be higher than if it has the backing of the UN . 
The costs of war must be balanced against the costs of alternative actions . 
A high cost of war is certainly not a case for inaction , especially in the face of a serious risk that Iraq could obtain , and eventually use , weapons of mass destruction . 
Yet pursuing war where diplomatic means - weapons inspections , threats of retaliation in the face of Iraqi aggression , readiness of the UN to act if dangers from Iraq become imminent - might suffice could result in huge and avoidable economic ( as well as other ) costs . 
The traditional textbook view of war is that war stimulates an economy , at least in the short term . 
But that simple view of wartime economics is too narrow to describe the possible effects of an Iraqi war . 
We must also recognize that a war with Iraq , even a limited war , could profoundly disrupt the international flow of goods , services , and investments upon which our global economy now rests . 
These disruptive effects would not only dampen production , but would undermine investor and consumer confidence and thereby limit both private investment and consumer spending . 
The direct macroeconomic stimulus that could arise from military spending may be overwhelmed by the uncertainties and disruptions that would accompany military conflict . 
Such uncertainties are already visible . 
Oil prices have risen several dollars a barrel since late summer . 
Since June , US and world stock markets have declined by around 20 % in dollar terms . 
Each rise in the probability of war has tended to push the markets down further . 
The modern world economy is built upon a complex network of global economic connections , and those connections are directly threatened by war . 
War would pose obvious and direct risks to shipping , notably shipping of oil from the Middle East . 
The increased costs could further depress the drop of cross-border capital flows that has been underway for two years , since the end of the US stock market boom . 
The decline in cross-border flows intensified after the September 11 attacks last year . 
Foreign direct investment in many developing regions has dried up , and emerging markets that depend on such capital flows , particularly in South America , have seen their economies thrown into a renewed financial crisis . 
Even if the US economy might experience some short-term demand boost from increased military spending , the rest of the world would not . 
Most countries would feel only negative effects - disruptions of trade , higher oil prices , withdrawals of international capital , cutbacks on investment plans - without any offsetting direct stimulus . 
America &apos;s macroeconomic situation is also worrisome . 
The Bush Administration &apos;s fiscal policies , combined with the bursting of the US financial bubble of the late 1990s , have pushed America onto an unstable fiscal trajectory . 
In contrast to budget surpluses &quot; as far as the eye could see , &quot; the US now has large budget deficits that will linger for many years to come . 
War with Iraq would likely cause those budget deficits to soar . 
Rising budget deficits will poison US domestic politics and lead to budgetary gridlock . 
That in turn , could lead to a loss of consumer confidence . 
Since consumer spending has been the remaining bulwark of the US economy since the collapse of the financial bubble , war with Iraq could puncture the last point of stability in the US economy . 
Of course , US policymakers have a hidden &quot; ace in the hole . &quot; 
They believe that the war will be quick , virtually effortless , and self-financing , as the US. effectively gains control of Iraqi oil supplies , which will not only drive down world oil prices but also finance Iraq &apos;s postwar reconstruction . 
An alluring prospect , but perhaps improbable . 
War might not be quick at all . 
Postwar Iraq could be unstable even if the war is brief . 
An alternative scenario is huge uncertainty and turmoil throughout the Middle East , with major disruptions in oil flows , for political if not military reasons . 
The geopolitical costs of a unilateral US war will be even higher . 
A quick and successful war , strongly and explicitly backed by the UN , offers the greatest chance of avoiding a huge negative economic fallout . 
A war that pits America against the world could call into doubt the progress of globalization , particularly international trade negotiations . 
Moreover , if the US acts alone , no doubt the post-conflict costs that America will bear alone will be higher as well . 
Open and deep political divisions between America and other major countries will incite a loss of investor confidence , undermining global economic stability .
