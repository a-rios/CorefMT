Asia &apos;s Fragile Special Relationship 
NEW DELHI - &quot; Tzu-Ch &apos;in asked Tzu-Kung a few questions ; 
Tzu-Kung answered : ... Our Master gets things ( done ) by being cordial , frank , courteous , temperate , deferential . 
That is our ... way . &quot; 
But will Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao live up to that standard , as conveyed in the Analects of Confucius , on his current visit to India ? 
The world has a variety of &quot; special relationships . &quot; 
The United States &quot; partnership with the United Kingdom is one forged in war - and a pillar of the West for more than a half-century . 
The US-Soviet rivalry of the Cold War era was special in that relations between those two countries shaped the fate of the world until the USSR imploded . 
The US and China are said to be forging a new special relationship . 
But , in looking toward the future of Asia - and , indeed , the future of world diplomacy - it is the relationship between the world &apos;s two most populous countries and largest emerging economies , India and China , which will increasingly set the global agenda . 
Japan &apos;s change of military doctrine for the first time since the start of the Cold War - a shift that implicitly makes China the greatest threat - suggests that the Chinese leadership needs to take a hard look at its regional grand strategy . 
Wen &apos;s priorities for his trip to India are clear : trade , security , and , far behind , the territorial disputes between the two countries . 
Such an approach might make tactical diplomatic sense , as long as there is no background clatter . 
But it lacks a sense of strategic urgency , which , given rising international tensions across Asia , amounts to a serious strategic blunder . 
The sources of those tensions are clear : North Korea &apos;s shelling of South Korea &apos;s Yeonpyeong Island and its flaunting of a modern , previously unknown , nuclear plant ; the US-led armada now cruising through the South China and Yellow Sea ; and China &apos;s claim that the South China Sea is an area of vital national interest akin to Tibet . 
In its bilateral relations with India , China &apos;s shift in focus from its claims on the Northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh to Jammu and Kashmir is enormously worrisome . 
Indeed , around Gilgit in Kashmir , China &apos;s People &apos;s Liberation Army has greatly enhanced its troop presence . 
Small wonder that , on the eve of Wen &apos;s visit , China &apos;s ambassador in New Delhi finds relations between the two countries to be &quot; very fragile , easily damaged , and difficult to repair . &quot; 
But , despite all this diplomatic friction , Wen &apos;s entourage for his visit is dominated by a large business delegation . 
Currently , both countries &quot; economies are thrusting confidently forward ; both are thirsty for more and bigger markets . 
India is growing at an annual rate of around 9 % ; 
So the opportunities for trade between the two are certainly enormous . 
But , for both countries , economic growth is not hurdle-free . 
India &apos;s economy is continuing to grow , but faces rising inflation , fiscal and current-account deficits , a slowdown in agricultural growth , and infrastructure bottlenecks . 
China &apos;s problems arise mainly from widening income disparities , which are inciting hitherto unheard of levels of labor unrest - though this should not be viewed as a precursor to change of the sort that marked the rise of the Solidarity trade union and the end of communism in Poland . 
But labor unrest and the desire to maintain 10 % growth suggest that China should be taking the lead in ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula and preventing other political developments from derailing its economy . 
After all , as the Chinese leadership knows , only continued strong growth will provide the government with the wriggle room it needs to begin to revalue the renminbi . 
Revaluation of its currency is necessary in part because the undervalued renminbi has become yet another a source of friction in Asia , as many in the region now believe the Chinese are using their currency as a &quot; policy weapon . &quot; 
To untangle the complex policy web surrounding the renminbi &apos;s value will demand greater regional stability , not less . 
Yet China &apos;s international grand strategy does not appear to reflect this . 
Instead , it remains focused on Northeast Asia , Tibet , Taiwan , and on its aspirations to move into the Indian Ocean , that great global highway of trade in the twenty-first century . 
China &apos;s leaders recognize that their country needs time , space , and peace for economic development . 
Yet their pursuit of a dominant position on the strategic chokepoints in the Indian Ocean undermines these goals by raising tensions not only with India , but with Asia &apos;s other powers and the US . 
By contrast , India &apos;s most important national security concerns - the unsettled border between the two countries , and Beijing &apos;s ties with Pakistan , which often operates as a Chinese surrogate - are closely connected to China : Both factors are directly linked to China &apos;s perceived threat to India &apos;s Himalayan territory and its rapid development of strategic infrastructure in that region . 
India &apos;s concerns also focus on China &apos;s ongoing supply of arms , including missiles and nuclear weapons technology , to Pakistan . 
No amount of discussion over trade can obscure the true issues of vital concern between China and India . 
China may take comfort in remaining focused on non-core issues , because such an approach suggests tactical cooperation with India . 
That is a convenient international ploy , but it leaves the sources of bilateral discord unattended . 
The idea of collaboration only in areas of interest to China while neglecting issues of substance to India is untenable , even in the short term . 
Indeed , neglect of the core disputes is what has resulted in the relationship &apos;s &quot; extreme fragility . &quot; 
India cannot and will not abandon its territorial sovereignty , or its pursuit of secure land borders or a greater balance in trade . 
These are challenges that cry out for clarity , not diplomatic fudges . 
But surely two great and ancient civilizations can find their way to the type of &quot; cordial , frank , courteous , temperate , deferential ... &quot; relations that would have pleased Confucius .
