France &apos;s Judicial Revolution 
PARIS - A new and important acronym has entered the French political lexicon : QPC , which stands for the rather austere-sounding &quot; Priority preliminary ruling on the question of constitutionality . &quot; 
Under QPC , which was part of the constitutional reforms that France implemented in July 2008 , any citizen involved in legal proceedings can now contest the constitutionality of a legislative provision . 
This is a far-reaching innovation . 
France has long been characterized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau &apos;s philosophy , which placed the law - the expression of the General Will - at the absolute top of the hierarchy of judicial norms . 
As a result , a veritable allergy to assessing the constitutionality of any law has long held sway . 
Not until Charles de Gaulle &apos;s 1958 Constitution was even a limited assessment of a law by the Conseil Constitutionnel ( Constitutional Council ) allowed , and then only with extensive precautions . 
Indeed , the Constitutional Council made its assessments a priori , one month after adoption of the law , and only four officials could initiate a review : the president , the prime minister , and the presidents of the National Assembly and the Senate . 
This list was broadened in 1974 to include any 60 members of the National Assembly or the Senate , thus allowing the opposition to submit the laws adopted through parliamentary majority to some examination of their constitutionality . 
But the idea that any citizen could challenge the constitutionality of legislation , as is possible in many European countries and the United States , was inconceivable . 
One year after its implementation in March 2010 , the reform has shown impressive results . 
Of the 400 cases examined by both Supreme Courts , 120 were referred to the Constitutional Council , which has issued 102 rulings , including 22 striking down the challenged legislation . 
The reform has allowed the Constitutional Council to reconsider a whole set of laws that had never before been submitted for constitutional review , mainly because they were drafted prior to 1958 . 
One of the most emblematic decisions concerned the code of criminal procedure , with the Council repealing several articles concerning the legal custody of defendants inside police stations . 
Other decisions have dealt with taxation , social legislation , or electoral laws . 
But nothing has done as much to cement the QPC &apos;s standing as the recent motion submitted by a lawyer in the ongoing criminal proceedings against former President Jacques Chirac , who is charged with having created fictitious jobs at the Paris City Council when he was mayor . 
The Court &apos;s President complied with the lawyer &apos;s motion to adjourn the proceedings until the Constitutional Council ruled on the constitutionality of the laws under which Chirac is charged . 
We will find out in the coming weeks whether the Cour de Cassation ( Court of Final Appeal ) will agree to refer the matter to the Council . 
France is thus joining the cohort of countries that , over the past half-century or so , have developed within their legal culture a judicial form of constitutional review of legislation . 
Indeed , in June 2009 , Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court strengthened its political role by demanding that ratification of the European Union &apos;s Lisbon Treaty be accompanied by a law warranting powers of co-decision to the German Parliament . 
More recently , in October 2009 , the United Kingdom , despite having no written constitution , replaced its supreme judicial body , which sat in the House of Lords , with a Supreme Court . 
The recent legal revolution in France is no less important , even if it is still in a transitional phase . 
With the QPC , the entire process of assessing the constitutionality of legislation has gained greater acceptance in French legal practice . 
It is no longer the privilege of the political class : testing a law for its constitutionality has become a right of all citizens . 
At the same time , after one year of implementation , the Constitutional Council has avoided a drift toward a &quot; government of judges , &quot; instead indicating a genuine desire for dialogue with other institutions , notably policymakers . 
For example , when answering a request to deal with marriage and the right of homosexual couples regarding adoption , the Council refused to substitute itself for the legislature , which it considered the only competent body to rule on the matter . 
Thus , an equilibrium of sorts between constitutional review and a concern not to cause excessive legal instability has been found . 
As the Constitutional Council gets closer to functioning like a Supreme Court , its membership , still heavily influenced by politics , will need to be reassessed .
