The New Transatlantic Stalemate 
WASHINGTON , DC - Senator Barack Obama &apos;s recent European tour hints that the Illinois senator is Europe &apos;s choice to be America &apos;s next president . 
But Europeans should not expect too much . 
While Obama would likely restore civility and politeness to transatlantic discourse , the sources of friction are more profound . 
The geo-political interests of Europe and America have been drawing apart , and may well continue to do so , no matter who is president . 
Halting this progressive alienation will require major changes in outlook and policy on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The United States will have to stop defining its transatlantic interests in terms of its hegemonic mindset , and Europe will have to take fuller charge of its own region . 
To call interests &quot; geopolitical &quot; underscores the influence of geography in shaping those interests . 
As Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill once famously agreed : &quot; When all is said and done , Great Britain is an island , France the cape of a continent ; 
America another world . &quot; 
Both understood that for centuries the English Channel has been a formidable geopolitical barrier to a durable sharing of interests between Britain and France . 
If the Channel has been such a barrier , durable bonds across the Atlantic seem implausible . 
In other words , from this perspective , the world &apos;s two richest and most powerful economic spaces , the European Union and the US , are bound to be rivals , even when they are allies . 
A shared enemy did underpin America &apos;s alliance with parts of Europe over much of the twentieth century . 
That enemy , however , was also European - first Germany , then Russia . 
In effect , the shared transatlantic geopolitical interest was between the US and one part of Europe against another . 
With the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 , the transatlantic alliance confronted new realities . 
The interests of both the EU and the US were expansively redefined . 
With no massive Soviet army in the middle of Germany , Europe was no longer firmly divided into Western and Eastern hemispheres . 
Mitteleuropa revived and Germany reunified . 
Western Europe evolved from a &quot; Community &quot; to a &quot; Union , &quot; and its states became less firmly bound to American protection . 
The Soviet demise encouraged US political elites to construct a &quot; unipolar &quot; view of America &apos;s global position and interest . 
This trend accelerated as the current Bush administration attempted to construct unilateral global hegemony out of the &quot; War on Terror , &quot; which provoked growing disquiet in &quot; Old Europe . &quot; 
While America &apos;s invasion of Afghanistan was widely seen as justified , the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq produced an open break between the US and its two major continental allies , France and Germany , which were supported by Russia and China . 
A great Eurasian bloc suddenly appeared in opposition to America &apos;s hegemonic global pretensions , prefiguring a new fluidity in geopolitical relationships , if not a tectonic shift in alignments . 
The effectiveness of Franco-German resistance to American hegemony was qualified , though , by the reactions of other European states . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s Prime Minister Tony Blair did his best to resurrect Churchill &apos;s special relationship , and Britain was joined by Italy and Spain , together with nearly all the states of New Europe . 
The Franco-German couple could no longer claim to speak for the EU as a whole . 
European plans for a Common Foreign and Security Policy and for closer defense cooperation seemed brutally discredited . 
Slowly , however , Europe has seemed to grow more cohesive in its opposition to American unipolar policies and pretensions . 
And , after his re-election in 2004 , Bush grew more conciliatory . 
Blair &apos;s departure left Bush increasingly isolated diplomatically , with changes of government in Berlin and Paris bringing only superficial improvements . 
Deteriorating economic conditions at home implied stricter limits on American intervention abroad . 
It is difficult to know where this uneasy transatlantic d√©tente of 2008 will lead . 
It is now clear that European and American geopolitical interests are not automatically in harmony . 
Europeans do not accept the Bush administration &apos;s strategic vision , and the US is unable to pursue that vision without European support . 
The reasons for Europe &apos;s defection are eminently geopolitical . 
To Europe &apos;s east lies Russia , to its south the Muslim world . 
Europe needs good relations with both in order to penetrate growing markets , tap sources for raw materials and energy , and ensure its own domestic stability , whereas many Europeans believe that US policies alienate these regions . 
In these circumstances , the transatlantic alliance survives less from genuinely shared interests than from inertia . 
Can anything restore the old transatlantic harmony ? 
A forceful revival of Russian imperialism , or a war of civilizations with the Muslim world , might provide a threat so overbearing that a frightened Europe would resume its Cold War dependency on America . 
But Europe will not be eager to embrace such a future . 
It may be careful not to alienate America , but it will struggle to build a collaborative relationship with its regional neighbors . 
Of course , America &apos;s definitions of its role in the world may change . 
America &apos;s unipolar expectations have not been ratified by events . 
Indeed , there is now considerable opposition to that vision in the US itself . 
Yet today too much power is agglomerated in Washington to be contained successfully within a purely national constitutional structure . 
Checks and balances at home require a correlative balance of power abroad . 
Constructing such a balanced state system for itself on a regional scale has been postwar Europe &apos;s great achievement . 
Implementing that system has depended heavily on a supportive America . 
Perhaps it is time for Europe to return the favor . 
Balancing , it seems , is always necessary , even among friends . 
And among friends balancing is also more likely to be successful . 
That Europe can find the will , the means , and the confidence to play that role cannot be taken for granted . 
What does seem clear is that a cohesive and strong Europe on good terms with its neighbors will not fit easily into a close transatlantic alliance with an America actively pursuing global hegemony .
