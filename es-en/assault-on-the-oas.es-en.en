Assault on the OAS 
MEXICO CITY - These last few weeks have been unfortunate for Latin America . 
In addition to the massive earthquakes that struck Haiti and Chile , the region has also been shaken by a hunger-strike death in Cuba and a growing crackdown on human rights and opposition in Venezuela . 
Making matters worse , the region also witnessed a superficially silly but actually dangerous attempt by the ALBA countries - Cuba , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Ecuador , Bolivia , and Paraguay - to create , with the acquiescence of Mexico , Brazil , and Argentina , a regional organization excluding the United States and Canada . 
The hope is that this new grouping will eventually supplant the Organization of American States . 
The OAS will have to decide on March 24 whether to re-elect Chilean diplomat and politician José Miguel Insulza as its Secretary General . 
It should , because Insulza is probably the only figure who can both learn from and correct the OAS &apos;s mistakes of the past five years , and thus save it from oblivion . 
The crackdown on freedom of the press , the rule of law , and electoral processes in Venezuela - as reported by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , and , most recently , in a damning , 300-page report by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission - has been steadily worsening . 
The OAS can involve itself in domestic electoral , political , or human rights issues only if a majority of its members mandates it to do so , and countries like Mexico and Brazil are fearful of picking fights with Venezuela . 
Nevertheless , Hugo Chávez is right to be nervous . 
Legislative elections next September will be more challenging for Chávez than on previous occasions . 
Electric power blackouts , a prolonged drought , inflation , and shortages are making life increasingly difficult for ordinary Venezuelans , and Chávez &apos;s standing in opinion polls is dropping . 
So is his international stature and popularity , especially after a Spanish judge accused him of conspiring to assassinate former Colombian president Andrés Pastrana in Madrid back in 2002 . 
Moreover , Chávez has suffered several regional setbacks recently , and all have domestic repercussions . 
The death of Cuban hunger striker and dissident Orlando Zapata , while Latin leaders were pow-wowing in Cancún and creating their new organization , unleashed a wave of indignation against the Castro brothers in the US , Europe , and Latin America ( though not among its governments , which all remained silent ) . 
Chávez knows that his personal security depends on the permanent protection of the Cuban intelligence services . 
Any change in government in Havana would leave him in a tight spot . 
But , just as Chávez is worried about rumblings and dissidents in Cuba , the island &apos;s leaders are concerned about the news from Caracas ; they know they cannot survive without Chávez &apos;s oil and subsidies . 
That is why the Castro brothers dispatched the regime &apos;s number three boss , Ramiro Valdez , who has been involved in Cuban security since 1959 , to keep watch on matters in Venezuela . 
Venezuela &quot; s circle of friends in the region is shrinking . 
The new Honduran and Chilean presidents are not allies , unlike their predecessors . 
The end of President Alvaro Uribe &apos;s re-election bid in Colombia will complicate life for the Caracas caudillo , removing a pretext for his own perpetuation in power . 
It may also give way to a president in Bogota who advocates a tougher line with Chávez than Uribe did . 
Given all of this , as well as Chávez &apos;s penchant for spectacular antics and the Cubans &quot; skill in taking the diplomatic offensive , the ALBA countries may be preparing some major Latin American mischief . 
Honduras was suspended from the OAS last year , after the June coup that overthrew elected president Manuel Zelaya . 
Subsequently , the interim government was able to resist pressure from abroad to restore him , held a previously scheduled election , and handed power over to a new , democratically-elected president , Porfirio Lobo , who has now been recognized by the US , the EU , and several , though not all , of the region &apos;s governments . 
Chávez , the Cubans and their allies , however , want no part of Lobo , and vetoed his attending the Cancún summit where the new Latin American organization was conceived . 
That it might appear absurd to invite Cuba , which has not had an elected president since the 1950 &quot; s , and not Lobo , who was cleanly elected just months ago , did not seem to worry either Mexican host Felipe Calderón or his colleagues . 
But the problem is that the OAS will be holding its annual assembly in June this year in Peru , and several countries  -  Canada , Costa Rica , the US , Colombia , Panama , Peru itself , and probably Chile - will push to have Honduras re-admitted . 
Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Ecuador , Paraguay , and possibly Argentina will refuse . 
The outcome may well be that these countries leave the OAS , and seek refuge in the new organization that they just established . 
Mexico and Brazil will not follow , but would not oppose the move , either . 
The fact that the Cancún meeting provided no funds , location , charter , or staff for the new organization will not matter : Latin American leaders are used to building castles in the air . 
But even a purely rhetorical structure would probably sound the death knell of the OAS , and weaken its human rights instruments , which have proved increasingly valuable and effective . 
The main challenge facing the OAS - if it survives the departure of the radical left - is to close the loopholes in its basic documents regarding the collective defense of democracy and human rights . 
These loopholes consist in not defining precisely what an interruption to constitutional rule signifies - just the overthrow of an elected president , or also shutting down a legislature or TV station ? - and giving the OAS teeth beyond suspension of members for violating its precepts . 
This review should be the main task of the re-elected Secretary-General , together with keeping the OAS united and defending Latin American democracy against the ALBA onslaught .
