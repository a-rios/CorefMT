Kerry and Europe 
Those whom the gods would destroy , they grant their wishes . 
Those in Europe and around the world who yearn for a victory by John Kerry in the US presidential election ought to keep that bit of ancient Greek wisdom in mind . 
During the Cold War , America was the natural leader of the Atlantic community , but the price of this leadership was that the US had to accept the autonomy and influence of its European allies . 
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , President Bush embarked on a unilateral foreign policy . 
The traditional Atlantic alliance was replaced by what the US called &quot; coalitions of the willing , &quot; where &quot; the mission determines the coalition , &quot; not historic alliances . 
This policy divided Europe . 
It has also fueled deep divisions in the US presidential campaign , with one of the most potent arguments used by Kerry being that he will restore trust between America and its allies ; that as president he will recruit international help in Iraq . 
America undoubtedly needs more allies to bring Iraq &apos;s chaos under control and to build an Iraqi state that is seen as legitimate both by Iraqis and the world . 
Allies are seen as an answer to America &apos;s twin credibility and legitimacy deficits in its occupation of Iraq . 
But can a Kerry-led US get a fresh start in Europe ? 
Will a President Kerry really be able to rally allies to America &apos;s side ? 
Iraq &apos;s mayhem has hardened the antagonism of countries like France and Germany , which led the opposition to the war in the first place . 
Even countries that rallied to Bush &apos;s call for help , like my homeland , Poland , are now wary of their involvement . 
Consider the attitudes of France and Germany . 
Their leaders can scarcely hold their tongues , so badly do they want a Kerry victory . 
But they are not going to change their policy to help Kerry win , and they won &apos;t change even if he does . 
As a gesture intending to boost Kerry &apos;s chances , German Defense Minister Peter Struck suggested that his country might reconsider its position on troops in Iraq . 
But Chancellor Gerhard Schröder instantly shot down that trial balloon , declaring : &quot; To be clear , we will send no troops to Iraq . &quot; 
Actually , Germany , like most European countries , is politically and logistically unable to send meaningful military forces to Iraq . 
France , which did ponder sending 15 000 soldiers to Iraq had the UN given its blessing to the war , is as clear as Schröder . 
According to Michel Barnier , France &apos;s Foreign Minister , &quot; Neither today , nor tomorrow , &quot; will French troops be sent . 
Both countries firmly believe that military success in Iraq is impossible . 
So will transatlantic relations remain as poisoned as they are now if Kerry wins ? 
Is Texas swagger merely to be replaced by the distinguished disdain of a Boston Brahmin ? 
This is probably too pessimistic . 
Europe cannot give an openly negative answer to Kerry &apos;s request for help , because that would be a slap in the face to the most pro-European American likely to be elected president anytime soon . 
Such a rejection would not only put transatlantic relations even more at risk than they are today ; it would also put relations 
So some compromise must be found should Kerry win . 
Fortunately , one is possible . 
The first part is purely face-saving : both parties must simply declare their good will . 
Today , European leaders are unlikely to throw even that slender lifeline to Bush . 
The reality behind such a declaration is that Europe would deliver low-level military and economic involvement in Iraq . 
Most European leaders understand the tiny wiggle room that Kerry will have if elected . 
The near certainty that the House of Representatives will be in Republican hands , and perhaps the Senate , too , means that America &apos;s Congress will pounce on any supposed attempt by Kerry to &quot; sell out &quot; Bush &apos;s war . 
But there is a second , more fundamental , part to any viable compromise : a redefinition of transatlantic relations . 
The key point here is joint recognition that a fundamental transatlantic community of values exists , and that both sides need each other . 
That transatlantic community must jointly feel responsible for maintaining peace and stability in the world . 
The US must accept this principle , and recognize that Europe is a partner , not merely a servant , whether willing or unwilling , of American orders . 
If burdens are to be shared , decisions must be shared as well . 
This will require that America recognize the validity of Europe &apos;s view of the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the major roadblock toward a peaceful Middle East . 
Europe , for its part , must not only show that it feels responsible for the world , but that it is ready and willing to act accordingly by contributing in a significant way to reconstructing Iraq . 
Europe &apos;s military means may be limited , but it has important experience in peacekeeping and &quot; state building &quot; that can be brought to bear . 
Is Europe really ready to undertake such an effort if its wish for a Kerry victory comes true ?
