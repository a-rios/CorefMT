The False Promise of Later Retirement 
EU Economics Commissioner Pedro Solbes warns that Europe &apos;s shrinking population will soon hit the Continent &apos;s economies hard . 
Reforms to defuse the crisis are needed . 
Alain Jousten examines one alluring but false reform that is often discussed . 
Social welfare systems are shaking as never before . 
Not only in Europe , but in parts of North and South America , and Asia as well . 
A collapse in fertility rates , coupled with longer life expectancy , is driving a rapid and pronounced aging of populations . 
Worse still , the demographic threat is being heightened by the way most countries finance their public pension schemes . 
Many retirement systems rely heavily on a pay-as-you-go ( PAYG ) philosophy . 
Rather than forcing each generation to pay for its own retirement , benefits paid to today &apos;s pensioners are financed by contributions from the young . 
Inter-generational solidarity , however , is only as strong as the number of entrants into the labor force . 
When this number falls as a result of lower fertility rates , and when higher life expectancy swells the ranks of pensioners , the only way to sustain PAYG systems is to decrease the level of benefits relative to contributions . 
The technical remedies for restoring financial balance are rather straightforward and entail either explicit or implicit measures . 
An explicit remedy is to raise revenues through higher contributions , increased labor force participation , stronger productivity growth , or larger transfers from general tax revenue . 
Alternatively , the number of working years required to qualify for a full retirement benefit can be increased . 
What is the most effective method ? 
Many experts advocate raising the official retirement age as an efficient tool , because it would-in theory , at least-increase the pool of contributors while shrinking the pool of benefit recipients . 
Unfortunately , this intuitively simple expectation does not fit with what actually happens in most industrialized countries . 
What actually happens is that the average retirement age is sometimes noticeably lower than the earliest eligible age for the normal retirement system . 
The period between departure from paid employment and entry into PAYG programs is bridged on a country-specific basis by a plethora of public , private , or mixed early-retirement benefit arrangements , such as unemployment insurance , disability insurance , or some form of severance pay . 
Besides the generosity of benefits , there is the issue of when one can first claim them . 
Individuals respond to the incentives created by the variety of early-retirement and retirement programs . 
The accessibility of early retirement varies widely across different countries and different sectors . 
While paths to retirement as early as age 50 exist in some countries , in others the lowest eligible age is much higher . 
Recent studies show that financial incentives to promote earlier retirement are sometimes powerful , so much so that continuing to work becomes a prohibitively expensive . 
The implicit tax from working another year and forgoing pension benefits can sometimes be close to a person &apos;s net earnings during that year . 
This type of extreme financial incentive is particularly true in some countries like Belgium or the Netherlands with easily accessible early retirement schemes - schemes which , to boot , often fail to adjust benefit levels to offset their longer duration . 
It is argued that early retirement systems cater to needs that are different from those addressed by traditional PAYG schemes . 
Many European governments used compulsory early retirement to push down the unemployment rate , effectively reducing the number of applicants for any given job by ridding the labor market of older , more expensive workers . 
Such policies also facilitated structural change , as older workers often lack the skills required in emerging economic sectors . 
However , early retirement schemes also imply tremendous-and often neglected-costs for government budgets and the pension systems by increasing benefit payments while reducing contributions . 
But even leaving aside the fiscal implications , many labor economists now believe that early retirement has failed to open up jobs for young people and reduce unemployment rates . 
Early retirement policies everywhere stand in clear need of reform . 
It is illogical to continue subsidizing a compulsory exit from the labor force while simultaneously trying to safeguard public retirement systems in the face of tremendous demographic challenges . 
It is all the more irrational in view of the rather modest effects early retirement plans have on unemployment in general , and on youth unemployment in particular . 
But reform should not be confined to public retirement systems . 
Instead , change must be comprehensive and include an overhaul of the myriad pathways to early retirement . 
An increase in the official retirement age - currently close to 65 in most countries - is pointless to the extent that many people no longer exit the labor force directly into official retirement systems . 
In Belgium , for example , only one-third of men exit the labor force directly to one of the public retirement systems . 
The rest pass through some type of early retirement scheme . 
Tightening the rules governing accessibility to different early retirement systems is more likely to be effective than raising the &quot; official &quot; retirement age . 
But reform of early retirement rules should not completely cut off access to social insurance programs before , say , age 60 . 
There is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in any population , so it is neither fair nor desirable that everyone should be forced to retire at the same age .
