Delusional Germany 
BERLIN - In recent days , Germany &apos;s representative on the European Central Bank &apos;s governing council has expressed strong disagreement with the ECB &apos;s decision on November 7 to cut its benchmark interest rate . 
Now the European Commission has opened an investigation into whether or not Germany &apos;s huge current-account surplus is causing economic damage in the European Union and beyond . 
This investigation and criticism of Germany &apos;s export-based growth model has incited outrage in Germany . 
Is Germany becoming a scapegoat for Europe &apos;s problems , or is it really out of step with the EU and the world economy ? 
Germans have long been among the most europhile of peoples , but their mood has gradually been turning against Europe and its common currency , the euro . 
An openly anti-euro political party has emerged , and , though it did not make it into the Bundestag in September &apos;s general election , it has fertile ground to grow . 
This is tragic , because Germany should be driving the development of a persuasive vision for Europe &apos;s future . 
Three illusions are responsible for the German public &apos;s growing aversion to European integration - and for many Germans &quot; failure to understand that Germany has the most to lose from the euro &apos;s collapse . 
For starters , Germans are convinced that they have weathered the crisis extraordinarily well . 
Although GDP growth slowed sharply in 2009 , it recovered quickly ; 
Likewise , the unemployment rate has fallen throughout the crisis , reaching 5.2 % , the lowest level since reunification . 
And the German government &apos;s commitment to fiscal consolidation enabled it to achieve a surplus last year ; by 2018 , the fiscal surplus is expected to amount to 1.5 % of GDP . 
Such figures have fueled the perception that Germany &apos;s economy is booming , and that its future would be even brighter if the eurozone &apos;s weaker economies were not dragging it down . 
But , viewed from a longer-term perspective , Germany &apos;s economic performance is actually rather disappointing . 
A DIW Berlin study shows that , since the monetary union &apos;s launch in 1999 , Germany has recorded some of the eurozone &apos;s lowest rates of GDP and productivity growth . 
Moreover , real wages have barely risen ; for more than 60 % of German workers , they have actually fallen . 
Wages have risen substantially more elsewhere in Europe , despite the depth of the economic crisis . 
Given that Germany also has one of the eurozone &apos;s lowest investment rates , its GDP growth is likely to be among Europe &apos;s slowest in the coming years , making significant wage increases unlikely . 
Of course , Germans are not entirely wrong ; the crisis in Europe &apos;s periphery is weakening Germany &apos;s economic-growth prospects . 
But they should remember that , only a decade ago , Germany was the &quot; sick man of Europe , &quot; and that strong growth and dynamism elsewhere in Europe contributed substantially to its recovery . 
And they must recognize that Europeans are all in the same boat ; what is good for Europe is good for Germany , and vice versa . 
The second illusion that blinkers many Germans is that other European governments are after their money . 
As a result , Germany has been reluctant to engage fully in the debate about a European banking union , owing to the belief that it would expose German taxpayers to major risks and unknown costs through bank restructuring and deposit insurance . 
Similarly , Germans have been critical of the ECB &apos;s monetary-policy instruments , especially its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program , with opponents appealing to the German constitutional court to invalidate the OMT scheme &apos;s conditional purchases of eurozone government debt . 
Such opposition seems counter-intuitive , given that the ECB &apos;s mere announcement of the OMT program calmed sovereign-debt markets and reduced borrowing costs in peripheral countries . 
Indeed , simply by providing a credible backstop against the risk of a eurozone collapse , the scheme has become one of the most successful measures introduced by any central bank in recent history . 
The most reasonable explanation for Germany &apos;s response is that many Germans harbor a deep mistrust of other European governments , and thus believe that they cannot be counted on to avoid insolvency . 
Germany &apos;s third illusion is that the current crisis is ultimately a euro crisis . 
While it is tempting to scapegoat the common currency , the fact is that the euro has brought huge economic and financial benefits to Germany , owing to increased trade , greater price stability , more competition , and improved efficiency . 
Furthermore , the eurozone crisis does not have the characteristics of a currency crisis . 
The euro is not overvalued or poorly managed , which would undermine competitiveness and erode confidence in the currency &apos;s long-term stability . 
On the contrary , the remarkable resilience of the euro &apos;s exchange rate vis-à-vis all other major currencies demonstrates enduring faith in the euro &apos;s viability and stability . 
What financial markets no longer believe is that governments will do what it takes to rescue Europe from the crisis . 
The argument that the crisis stems from the eurozone not being an optimal currency area is similarly flawed . 
No economy is an optimal currency area ; there are substantial differences among US states and even across Germany &apos;s Länder . 
The main challenge to the euro &apos;s long-term viability is the lack of political will to implement complementary policies , such as a banking union and a credible fiscal union . 
While the eurozone economy &apos;s outlook has improved , it is not out of danger . 
A deep crisis in any member country is likely to become contagious . 
Given Germany &apos;s trade and financial openness , as well as the leadership responsibility that accompanies its economic strength , it would face particularly high costs . 
Against this background , Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s third government , once it is formed , must rid the country of the illusions that are preventing it from playing a proactive and constructive role in ensuring that Europe functions as a union . 
Such an undertaking requires , above all , the restoration of trust among European countries . 
While that will undoubtedly be difficult to achieve , it is Germany &apos;s only real option - and Europe &apos;s real hope .
