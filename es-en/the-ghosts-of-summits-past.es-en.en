The Ghosts of Summits Past 
PRINCETON - The world is confronted by a dramatic financial crisis that many policymakers believe is more severe than the interwar Great Depression . 
Before 2008 , experts said that a new Great Depression was impossible because of the strength and the depth of the cooperative mechanisms set up at the end of World War II . 
The G-20 summit has thus created enormous expectations that internationalism may once again overcome a plethora of economic problems . 
Unfortunately , the magnitude of the expectations alone suggests that disappointment is almost certain . 
The symbolism of the location is unfortunate , as it carries a reminiscence of the main abortive attempt to manage the world economy during the Great Depression . 
The 1933 World Economic Conference also met in London , at the Geological Museum , with an even broader range of participants from 66 countries . 
The participants at the 2009 summit may not visit the Geological Museum , but they will have to deal with the specter of conferences past , for the failure in 1933 offers important lessons for our current leaders . 
First , as with the G-20 summit , everyone expected the London Conference to fail . 
The plenary meeting was paralyzed by the way in which the preparatory commissions had worked . 
Monetary experts argued that an agreement on currency stabilization would be highly desirable , but that it required a prior agreement on the dismantling of trade barriers - all the high tariffs and quotas that had been introduced in the course of the depression . 
Trade experts met in parallel and made the mirror image of this argument . 
They agreed that protectionism was obviously a vice , but thought that it was a necessary one that could not be addressed without monetary stability . 
Only leadership by a determined great power , prepared to sacrifice its particular national interests in order to break the resulting impasse , might conceivably have saved the meeting . 
Indeed , the second lesson of the London Conference of 1933 consists in governments &quot; unwillingness in times of great economic difficulty to make sacrifices that might entail a short-term cost . 
Even if the result would have been longer-term stability , the immediate political consequences were too unpleasant . 
In adverse economic circumstances , governments felt vulnerable and unsure , and they could not afford to alienate public support . 
Finally , faced by a realization of inevitable failure , participants look for a scapegoat . 
The 1933 Conference looked like a classic detective novel in which every party had a reason to be a suspect . 
Britain and France had turned away from internationalism , adopting trade systems known as &quot; Imperial Preference , &quot; which favored their vast overseas empires . 
Germany &apos;s president had just appointed Adolf Hitler &apos;s radical and aggressive government . 
The German delegation was led by Alfred Hugenberg , who was not a Nazi but wanted to show that he was an even more implacable nationalist than Hitler himself . 
The Japanese government had just sent troops into Manchuria . 
Of all the major powers in London , the United States looked the most reasonable and internationalist by far . 
It had a new , charismatic president , who was known as an Anglophile and a cosmopolitan spirit . 
Franklin Roosevelt was already taking vigorous action against the depression , and was trying to reorder the failed US banking system . 
Roosevelt did not know what line to take at the conference , and his stream of advisers offered inconsistent counsel . 
At last , he lost patience and announced that for the moment the US had no intention of stabilizing the dollar . 
This message , delivered on July 3 , 1933 , was known as &quot; the bombshell . &quot; 
Roosevelt talked about the need to restore &quot; the sound internal economic system of a nation &quot; and condemned the &quot; old fetishes of so-called international bankers . &quot; 
Everyone pretended to be shocked at the failure of internationalism . 
In 2009 , we face a similar set of circumstances . 
The lines of conflict have been clearly drawn in advance . 
The US wants the world to embark on macroeconomic stimulus programs , and thinks that the complicated task of reinventing and reordering financial supervision and regulation can wait . 
Many European countries cannot afford a stimulus package , owing to overstretched public finances , and instead want to make progress on the international regulation of banking . 
The alibis for failure are also already prepared . 
The new summit is unlikely to produce either a coordinated stimulus package or a detailed blueprint for a foolproof system of financial regulation . 
Throughout the meeting , participants will be waiting for the moment when one of the leaders ( maybe Angela Merkel ) loses patience and makes the obvious and true remark that the process is a waste of effort . 
Then everyone will denounce this honest politician for having wrecked internationalism . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , it was the autocratic and belligerent governments of Germany and Japan that could derive the most capital from the failure of the London conference . 
Failure at today &apos;s London conference is also likely to be used as a rhetorical weapon against the large Western governments , and to provide a rationale for implementing new forms of state capitalism .
