Turkey and Europe : Two Trains on a Collision Course ? 
By intervening in Lebanon , Europeans have made a far-reaching , risk-fraught , and , at the same time , correct decision . 
The reason is that the future of Europe &apos;s security will be determined in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East . 
Europe , whether it likes it or not , has taken on a new , strategic role in the region . 
Should it fail , the price will be high . 
In view of the serious risks that Europe has assumed , in full awareness of the consequences , it is of the utmost importance that a European &quot; Grand Strategy &quot; for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East be developed , so that Europe can calmly and clearly define its interests . 
In any serious variation of this Grand Strategy , Turkey will need to play a central role - politically , militarily , economically , and culturally . 
Safeguarding Europe &apos;s interests today means establishing a strong link - indeed an unbreakable bond - with Turkey as a cornerstone of regional security . 
Successful modernization and democratization of Turkey - with a strong civil society , the rule of law , and a modern economy - will not only be hugely beneficial for Turkey , but will also export stability and serve as a model for transformation in the Islamic world . 
Above all , the successful modernization of a large Muslim country will make a decisive contribution to Europe &apos;s security . 
Since the days of Kemal Atatürk , the founder of modern Turkey , the modernization of Turkey has relied on its Western or European perspective . 
For the last 43 years , this perspective has been largely defined by Turkey &apos;s interest in joining the European Union and by the EU &apos;s promise of accession . 
But at the very moment when even slightest glance at the crisis-ridden region on Europe &apos;s eastern flank - Iran , Iraq , Syria , the Middle East conflict , Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus , Islamic terrorism , emigration , and threats to Europe &apos;s energy supplies - should make clear Turkey &apos;s paramount importance to European security , Europe is reveling in its disinterest in the state of European-Turkish relations . 
This autumn , the European Commission is scheduled to issue a progress report on accession negotiations with Turkey . 
A dangerous situation may well emerge , as this report threatens to derail the whole process . 
The key dispute is over Cyprus . 
Turkey has refused to open its ports , airports , and roads to the Republic of Cyprus , as it is obligated to do by the Ankara Protocol , which set the terms of Turkey &apos;s accession negotiations . 
Turkey explains its refusal by the EU &apos;s failure ( as a result of a veto by the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia ) to fulfill its own promise to open up trade with Northern Cyprus , which is under Turkish rule . 
The EU made these promises at the Council of Europe in December 2003 and formally at the Council of Foreign Ministers in April 2004 . 
So it is Ankara - and not the EU ! - that has a legitimate point here . 
When the Ankara Protocol was agreed , the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan achieved something that , until then , had been considered impossible : he shattered the decades-old opposition of Turkish Cypriots to a compromise between the two parts of the divided island . 
Turkish Northern Cyprus accepted UN Secretary General Kofi Annan &apos;s plan ( massively supported by the EU ) to resolve the long-standing conflict . 
But the Greek South , goaded and inflamed by its government , rejected it . 
It would be deeply unjust and outright foolish if the EU Commission &apos;s report holds Turkey responsible for its refusal to make further concessions to Greek Cyprus ( now an EU member ) , while refusing to blame the government in Nicosia , which is the real cause of the blockage . 
Some in the EU - mainly in France , Germany , and Austria - seem smugly pleased by the prospect of a clash on this issue , believing it will force Turkey to give up its drive for membership . 
But this attitude is irresponsible . 
The EU is about to commit a grave strategic error by allowing its report this autumn to be guided by the short-sighted domestic policy considerations of some of its important member states . 
And what perspective would Turkey have outside the EU ? 
Pan-Turkish illusions ? 
A return to the Orient and to Islam ? 
None of these will work . 
But Turkey will not sit idly on Europe &apos;s doorstep . 
Europe &apos;s attitude is pushing Turkey towards forging alliances with its traditional regional rivals , Russia and Iran . 
These three powers , each of great importance to Europe , have been rivals for many centuries . 
So an alliance between them would seem a near impossibility . 
Yet Europe seems bent on achieving the impossible , to the Continent &apos;s detriment . 
Within Turkey , opinion polls suggest that frustration with Europe is intensifying , while Iran is viewed with increasing favor . 
A sense of alienation towards the West is spreading , and Turkey &apos;s diplomatic relations with Russia have reached a hitherto unknown intimacy . 
Of course , there is vast domestic resistance to Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU . 
The final result of the accession process is therefore an open question for both sides . 
Admittedly , Turkey has a long way to go . 
But to endanger this process here and now , in full awareness of the possible costs , is an act of very costly stupidity on the part of the Europeans - and stupidity is the worst sin in politics . 
In European-Turkish relations , two trains are racing headlong towards each other . 
Neither Turkey nor Europe can afford the all-too-foreseeable crash .
