Capitalists for Inclusive Growth 
LONDON - In 2012 , the Pew Research Center found that 85 % of self-described middle-class adults in the United States believe that it is more difficult now than it was a decade ago for people like them to maintain their standard of living . 
The share of Americans who say that they are in the lower-middle or lower class has risen from a quarter of the adult population in 2008 to around a third today . 
And Pew &apos;s research found that only 63 % of those surveyed believe that hard work leads to success , down from 74 % in 1999 . 
These statistics , which represent popular sentiment in the world &apos;s largest economy , should raise significant concerns for governments and business leaders elsewhere , particularly in countries challenged by stagnant growth and rising levels of youth unemployment . 
Indeed , in January , the IMF revised its near-term outlook for eurozone growth downward , to -0.2 % in 2013 . 
Meanwhile , official data from Spain indicate that the jobless rate rose to 26 % ( almost six million people ) in the last three months of 2012 , the highest figure since the mid-1970 &quot; s , with the rate of youth unemployment reaching 55 % . 
The need for growth - specifically , the kind of inclusive growth that can provide jobs for the vast number of out-of-work young people and combat rising levels of income inequality - has never been more vital . 
Nevertheless , today &apos;s debates about how to achieve sustainable , inclusive growth are too narrowly focused on the role of governments and policymakers . 
The role of the private sector - with its multinational reach , vast piles of cash , and ability to innovate - has been neglected . 
There are three main areas to which business should turn its attention if capitalism is to function in a more inclusive way and meet society &apos;s most pressing needs . 
First , companies should work to overcome skills / jobs mismatches by investing in vocational training and apprenticeships . 
Companies like Rolls-Royce and British Gas operate impressive apprenticeship schemes that add value for their businesses by creating a pipeline of talented recruits . 
Other initiatives have been established to scale up these efforts by engaging multiple companies to create entry-level positions for the significant number of young people who are currently unemployed . 
Second , just as a collective effort is needed to strengthen the skills of national workforces , so , too , an industry commitment is required to support small and medium-size enterprises ( SMEs ) as part of the wider business environment . 
In its 2011 fiscal year , Hewlett-Packard used more than 600 SMEs in its supply chain in the United Kingdom , representing nearly 10 % of its spending on suppliers . 
HP aims to increase this share to more than 15 % by the end of 2013 with the addition of a further 150 SMEs , thereby fueling what it rightly regards as the engine of UK economic growth . 
Similarly , in March 2012 , a consortium of large corporations led by IBM created the web-based Supplier Connection to make it easier for small businesses to become suppliers to large companies . 
Currently , the members of Supplier Connection purchase more than $ 150 billion in goods and services annually through their global supply chains . 
Finally , public corporations must be managed for the long term , and should be rewarded by investors for being more inclusive . 
For example , Unilever has rejected the short-term pressures of capital markets by ending quarterly earnings reporting and broadening its focus to advance greater social interests , rather than just the interests of its shareholders . 
But enlightened companies require enlightened investors . 
The Ontario Teachers &quot; Pension Plan is exemplary in its commitment to supporting the best governance practices in the companies in which it invests , and it has reaped large benefits from this approach : the Plan has earned average annual returns of 10 % since its inception in 1990 . 
The idea that underlies all of these initiatives , and the notion of inclusive capitalism itself , is that companies must be managed for the long term . 
Companies that follow this approach are concerned with the skills of their future workforces ; seek to build loyal and productive supplier bases ; and make investment decisions based on sustainable value creation , not short-term profitability . 
There is no contradiction between delivering high returns and adopting a long-term approach . 
Furthermore , as companies begin to adopt these practices , a rising tide will lift all boats : with greater support , SMEs , which currently account for 99 % of businesses and two-thirds of private-sector employment in the European Union , will be able to invest in research and development , and to hire more employees . 
In turn , large companies will receive the benefits of faster innovation , rates of youth unemployment will fall , and the hollowing out of the middle class - and its faith in future living standards - will be reversed . 
It is this type of profoundly positive influence on prospects for shared prosperity and inclusive growth that currently eludes national governments .
