Rockets into Ploughshares 
MOSCOW : The first law of scientific research - that it costs big money - is as immutable as the laws of gravity . 
So no surprise that Russian science fell into a black hole due to economic upheaval in the decade following communism &apos;s collapse . 
Economic freedoms that transformed Russia for good and ill brought despair to laboratories and research institutes as budgets were slashed and bright young scientists fled abroad while others ( most famously the mathematician turned oligarch Boris Berezovsky ) moved into banking and other businesses . 
This internal and external brain drain will impact Russia &apos;s economy for decades to come . 
It is also an unintentional gift from Russia to the West . 
The scale of this transfer of intellect may be unsurpassed in human history , and is greater than the flight of scientists from Nazi Germany in the 1930s . 
Take the institution which I headed for thirty-five years , the physics department of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Techniques ( MIPT ) , comparable to America &apos;s acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
During the last ten years 1500 graduates from our Institute left for the US . 
According to a common means of assessment , educating a scientific specialist at a high level costs approximately $ 1million dollars . 
Thus , one Russian institute alone subsidized America with scientists with a nominal value of $ 1.5billion ! 
Of course , the seeds of the collapse of Russian science were sown in the Soviet era , when three-quarters of scientific research was financed by the military . 
Without that Cold War imperative , science became an easy target for Kremlin budget cutters . 
But more than the bloated branches of military science were slashed . 
Over the past decade expenditures on total scientific research were reduced to less than 5 % of their former value . 
Oceanographic and geological research , traditionally strong in Russia , have virtually ceased to exist . 
Harsh reforms have followed this starvation diet . 
Before 1991 there were 4,500 research and development ( R &amp; D ) institutes in Russia . 
About five hundred belonged to the prestigious Academy of Sciences and worked mainly in basic science . 
The remaining &quot; branch institutes &quot; - industrial research facilities , design bureaus , field stations and so on - belonged to one or another ministry . 
Government privatized some 1,100 branch institutes , making their finances somebody else &apos;s problem . 
But privatization is brutal , because most of these bodies are ill-prepared to survive in a free market . 
For no system exists in Russia to translate research into marketable products and technologies . 
No system of venture capital - ie , one where investors support promising new scientific developments - exists . 
There is neither financial nor tax support for it . 
Russian banks would not know where to begin . 
Moreover , there are no technology parks of the type often connected with universities in the West and which facilitate the translation of achievements in modern science into useful applications . 
Without these support systems , Russia will continue to lose not only good people , but hope for its future . 
Yet , all is not lost . 
Compared to R &amp; D activities , fundamental research is cheap and it is here that , although damaged , a solid Russian tradition remains that can be built upon . 
Asia &apos;s tiger economies have a strong high-tech base but are not noted for their scientists . 
Once our economy adopts - if it does - we will have a base of knowledge to feed off of . 
Adaptation is underway . 
Old structures are crumbling and being replaced . 
The Russian Academy of Science , the most powerful body in Russian science , has opened itself to new blood , increasing the number of specialists by 20 % in recent years . 
Outside influences also matter . 
Financial and moral support from George Soros &apos;s International Science Foundation , for example , buoyed a peer review system established in 1992 within the Russian Foundation for Basic Research . 
Peer review is vitally important to the coming generation of scientists . 
With a viable peer review system in place , the chances of getting money is directly related to performance . 
The RFBR &apos;s main drawback is that it hands out only 6 % of the national science budget . 
By comparison , 90 % of civilian research in America is peer reviewed . 
Yet , despite continuing bias toward state control , the system is opening up . 
The Internet also assists this opening as it favours transmission of information and connections to and from Russia and the world . 
Russians , because of their high level of education , are very receptive to the Internet and use it with great familiarity . 
But it is not nearly enough . 
Despite open borders , scientific contacts , participation in conferences , even the exchange of publications , remain problematic . 
Isolation , indeed , is unbridgeable for some . 
A generation of scientists and R &amp; D workers - those too old and entrenched to uproot their lives and adapt , but too young to retire - have no where to go . 
Many are in formerly powerful research centers now wasting away , some form entire populations in once closed research cities and one institute towns that were wholly dependent on a single defence institute or project . 
Their fate is like that experienced by the generation of Russian serfs liberated in the mid-19th century . 
After a lifetime under the yoke , feudal or communist , freedom is not an easy thing to get used to . 
Those who do adapt provide a model for all Russia . 
Modern science is democratic and meritocratic . 
Open to talent , and only talent , people who discover something new are recognized and rewarded . 
In science , a dictatorship of reason is combined with the freedom of ideas . 
That fusion is what all Russia needs , a reconciliation of the cold-minded calculations of the market with the search for truth . 
In that reconciliation lies the future of Russian science and of Russia itself .
