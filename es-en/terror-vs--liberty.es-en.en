Terror vs. Liberty 
The terrorism that we have come to associate with Al Qaeda is special in many ways . 
It is global , technologically sophisticated , but , above all , it is not about an achievable political objective . 
It is not aimed at creating a united ( Catholic ) Ireland , an independent Basque country , or even a Palestinian state , but at a particular worldview and those who represent it . 
It is aimed at what used to be called the West , that is , a liberal order of things , a free world . 
Because the United States is the most visible and powerful representative of that free world , it is aimed against America and its closest allies in Europe and elsewhere . 
This is a critical fact to remember . 
What we describe under the heading of Al Qaeda is an essentially negative , destructive movement . 
It does not offer an alternative view of the modern world other than the implicit claim that modernity is neither necessary nor desirable . 
Moreover , that claim , when made by men who appear to be religious leaders , is almost certainly dishonest . 
Such leaders are using religion for their own highly modern political purposes ; they use it to organize and mobilize their supporters - to commit individual or collective suicide , if need be . 
In this they are not entirely dissimilar from the totalitarian leaders of fascist movements , who likewise built on popular frustration to pursue an essentially destructive purpose in the name of anti-modern beliefs and promises . 
Violence born from such sources is difficult to fight . 
Signs of frustration with modernity are never hard to find . 
They are present in highly developed countries , but above all in entire regions of the world that are suspended between a yesterday that no longer exists and a tomorrow that has not yet come into being . 
How , then , do free countries deal with terrorist expressions of organized frustration ? 
Without doubt , the first priority for any free country must be to protect its citizens and assets against acts of terrorist violence . 
Given a globalized movement of fury , this is not simple . 
It requires measures that do not come easily to citizens , groups , and authorities steeped in a tradition of liberalism and tolerance . 
We must accept that there are limits to tolerance . 
Opting out of the values and customs of free societies is problematic , but it is ultimately acceptable . 
Non-aggressive demonstrations of difference - including Islamic headscarves worn by students or teachers in largely Christian countries - should be bearable . 
But violence should never be tolerated . 
The monopoly on the use of violence exercised by democratic states must be preserved , which may involve expelling non-citizens who choose violence or advocate its use , and the detention of citizens who have practiced or threatened it . 
However , it is of critical importance that the treatment of terrorists and those suspected of terrorist acts remains strictly within the rule of law . 
Indefinite detention without trial is as unacceptable as defining people as &quot; illegal combatants , &quot; to whom no rules of any kind apply . 
The status of the prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay and the recent incidents of possibly systematic humiliation and torture of Iraqi prisoners cast doubt on the very values on which a liberal order is based . 
Such incidents make one wonder whether the terrorists have , in the end , achieved their aim of destroying the West and what it stands for . 
Terrorism aimed at the destruction of the liberal order is a test of that order . 
This is particularly so if one accepts - as I do - intervention in the internal affairs of countries in order to prevent genocide or the murderous suppression of minorities and opposition groups . 
But intervention must never borrow methods from those against whom it is undertaken . 
This applies also to the intervening powers &apos; objectives . 
Terrorism of the Al Qaeda type is basically destructive . 
Any response must be basically constructive . 
The frustration of many in the economically developed countries is , like the frustration of entire countries in developing regions , a challenge . 
This challenge cannot really be met by simply promising unlimited opportunities , as they uniquely exist in America . 
It requires a sense of social responsibility that accompanies and cushions the painful process of modernization . 
People who are suspended between a lost past and a future not yet gained need help . 
Such assistance will not yield immediate results , but awareness of the medium term - which means readiness to face it by delaying immediate gratification - is also a sign of a liberal order . 
Thus , fighting Al Qaeda is not a war . 
It is partly self-defense , partly an assertion of the rule of law in difficult circumstances , and partly a constructive effort to redress the causes of frustration .
