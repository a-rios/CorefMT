Ollanta Humala &apos;s Limited Options 
BUENOS AIRES - The big question in Latin America today is this : Will Peru &apos;s newly elected president , Ollanta Humala , orient his country toward Venezuela &apos;s Hugo Chávez and his radical allies ? 
Or will he choose the path taken by Brazil &apos;s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the region &apos;s other moderate politicians ? 
Humala &apos;s own ambiguous words offer little guidance . 
So the direction in which he intends to lead must be read from his actions , and these are unlikely to be definitive in the short term . 
Peru &apos;s domestic and international situation , however , will frame his main decisions . 
Humala is no novice politician rising to victory on charm and luck . 
In the presidential election of June 2006 , he received 45.5 % of the vote - not enough to defeat Alan García , but sufficient to show how deeply he had tapped into the hopes and trust of many Peruvians . 
At that time , populism seemed an unstoppable force in Latin America . 
Fueled by an oil boom and vast social spending , Chávez was flying high , blessed and supported by the aging but still active Fidel Castro . 
Across the región , Chávez &apos;s influence was strong . 
His backing was a decisive influence in the election of Bolivia &apos;s President Evo Morales in 2006 , and the following year he supported Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Rafael Correa in Ecuador , though his impact on their victories is hotly debated . 
In 2006 , Humala praised Chavez &apos;s policies as a sign of a new era in Latin America . 
But , in the recent presidential campaign , he suggested that his policies would resemble those of Lula , not Chávez . 
In particular , he would seek to emulate Lula &apos;s efforts to include vast sectors of the population in the benefits of a strong economy . 
Today , with Venezuela &apos;s economy mired in high inflation and overly dependent on oil , Chávez is fading as a regional model and guide . 
He has also been startled by the rise of domestic opposition . 
So Brazil &apos;s mix of diversified economic growth and redistribution is a far more appealing example . 
Indeed , a major reason for Humala &apos;s victory was García &apos;s inability to secure the benefits of growth for Peru &apos;s poorest people . 
Humala &apos;s main campaign argument was that he would not risk the &quot; success &quot; of Peru &apos;s economy , but would , on the contrary , strengthen it . 
His fight against poverty and social exclusion would be undertaken as part of that effort . 
Humala comes to power in a regional environment of moderation and growing economic integration , which he would disturb at his peril . 
García recently signed an economic agreement with Chile , Colombia , and Mexico , called Pacto del Pacífico , which is destined to reorient Latin America &apos;s economies . 
These countries will jointly seek to develop a bigger presence in Asian markets , and to offer developed countries a safe option for capital investments in emerging markets . 
Moreover , each of the countries has bilateral free-trade agreements with the others and with the United States ( though the US Congress has yet to approve the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement , as it is officially known ) . 
Breaking with these strategic policies would harm Peru &apos;s economy . 
It would also harm Humala &apos;s domestic political base and isolate him in the region . 
He would not be able to lean on Brazil , the moderating regional power , but would inevitably fall under the sway of Chávez and Morales , deterring foreign investors and harming the country &apos;s foreign relations . 
Cuba is out of the question as a patron , due to its preoccupation with Raúl Castro &apos;s efforts to reshape its depleted economy in an improbable bid for Chinese-style capitalism in a one-party state . 
So Humala &apos;s Latin American options are limited : Venezuela , Brazil , or the countries of the Pacto del Pacífico . 
Although the last two options might be difficult to merge -Mexico might not want the competition of such a large player as Brazil - they are not mutually exclusive . 
In fact , Brazil &apos;s leaders have good reason to be flexible : their country needs the access to the Pacific that Peru and Chile offer . 
The local stock market &apos;s fall immediately after Humala &apos;s victory is a clear sign that the most influential forces in the Peruvian economy will continue to press for deeds , not promises - deeds that benefit their interests , of course . 
Humala most likely will not follow market dictates robotically . 
But he will not be able wholly to avoid them . 
Finally , there is the question of political effectiveness . 
Humala &apos;s coalition , Gana Perú , will have a plurality of representatives in Peru &apos;s congress , but will need the votes of ex-president Alejandro Toledo &apos;s party to have a controlling majority . 
Toledo , a Stanford graduate and a moderate politician , supported Humala during the campaign and provided him with economic advisers , which proved to be decisive in establishing the credibility of Humala &apos;s retreat from radical policies . 
Both the internal and external environments in which Humala finds himself - and the fact that he won by a margin of only three percentage points - seem to call for moderation and consensus . 
Half of Peru &apos;s citizens did not side with him . 
Polarization may have proved functional to winning an election , but Humala will have to broaden his support in order to forge the consensus he needs in order to govern .
