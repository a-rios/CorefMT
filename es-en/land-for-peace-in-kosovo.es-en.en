Land for Peace in Kosovo 
BELGRADE - Chasing impossible dreams has driven Serbia and Kosovo into a corner . 
A return to armed conflict may be impossible - at least for now - given NATO &apos;s military presence in Kosovo ( though it will be halved in the next few months to only 5,000 troops ) . 
An opening for talks between Serbia and Kosovo was created by a joint European Union-Serbia resolution at the United Nations , which sets out a framework for dialogue . 
This was a triumph for the EU &apos;s foreign-policy chief , High Representative Baroness Catherine Ashton , who secured the backing of EU member states ( even from the five that do not recognize Kosovo &apos;s independence ) , the United States , and both Serbia and Kosovo . 
The resolution reflects the stark reality that Serbia now faces . 
Much as Serbia still considers Kosovo to be one of its provinces , key parts of the international community have invested too much financial and political capital in Kosovo to want to reopen the question of its political status . 
Serbia also must face the fact that EU membership is impossible until the dispute is resolved . 
The EU wants to avoid another Cyprus , where a candidate country partly occupies a member country . 
Closer to home , the recent spat between Croatia and Slovenia over their maritime border almost scuppered Croatia &apos;s accession plans . 
But Kosovo &apos;s government also has an interest in a settlement . 
In its haste to declare independence unilaterally , Kosovo condemned itself to an uncertain future internationally . 
The UN resolution pushed by Ashton neither refers to nor endorses Kosovo &apos;s independence . 
Indeed , as things now stand , Kosovo cannot join the EU , NATO , or the UN , two-thirds of whose members , including two permanent Security Council members ( Russia and China ) , do not recognize its independence . 
Despite their harsh rhetoric , both sides know that they need to give ground - and not just figuratively . 
A formal , mutually acceptable partition of Kosovo - a territorial exchange of the type that almost everyone concedes is the only viable solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict - could achieve a full and final settlement . 
Apportioning to Serbia three municipalities in the north of Kosovo ( Leposavić , Zubin Potok , and Zvečan ) around the town of Mitrovica , and the town itself north of the Ibar River , would remove a major obstacle . 
This ethnic Serb-majority area of some 70,000 people has become increasingly restive since Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence . 
Kosovo could probably never govern this territory , whose ethnic Albanian inhabitants have mostly left . 
Indeed , there is little goodwill towards Kosovo &apos;s government in the Serb-dominated North ( Ibarski Kolašin ) , partly because it failed to prevent the area from being overrun with criminal gangs . 
Moreover , the UN and EU contingents , and the NATO forces in Kosovo , have been unable or unwilling to enforce the government &apos;s writ in Ibarski Kolašin , and scant attention has been paid to its shambolic economy . 
In contrast to this neglect , Serbia &apos;s government - at considerable cost - maintains a large public payroll and parallel administration so as to retain its influence . 
Local Serbs fear that the government in Priština simply wants to impose its will on Serb-majority areas rather than engaging with them as Kosovo citizens equal under the law . 
The case for partition is historical as well : these districts were part of Serbia until Tito redrew Yugoslavia &apos;s internal borders in the 1950 &quot; s . 
If Serbia were to gain parts of northern Kosovo , its government would have to concede sovereignty over the isolated parts of southern Kosovo where Serb communities still live , such as Strpce and Novo Brdo . 
Guarantees of minority civil and political rights would be required , as well as assurances for the preservation of Serbian Orthodox religious sites such as the Pec Monastery . 
What might clinch a final , mutually acceptable settlement would be an offer by Serbia to hand over a part of its territory in the Albanian-majority Preševo valley , on Kosovo &apos;s eastern flank . 
Such a courageous and forward-looking demonstration of Serbia &apos;s willingness to swap land for peace would arouse nationalist sentiment at home , but it would put enormous pressure on Kosovo to offer its own concessions . 
The idea of partitioning Kosovo in this way is not new . 
Dobrica Ćosić , a Serbian writer and political theorist , proposed it in the 1970 &quot; s , perhaps mindful of the inevitable fragility of post-Tito Yugoslavia . 
Since then , the idea has been largely dismissed by Western powerbrokers . 
Martti Ahtisaari , the former Finnish President and Nobel laureate , who could claim to be the father of the Kosovan nation , dismisses the idea out of hand . 
Only such international intransigence - and that of the Kosovo government - stands in the way of partition as an equitable and fair solution . 
Serbia &apos;s dynamic and mainly youthful mainstream political elite appears prepared to turn a corner and make sacrifices to secure Serbia &apos;s long-term future in the EU ( and possibly NATO ) . 
Kosovo &apos;s apparent unwillingness to compromise until now can be partly blamed on its unstable political landscape ( the government collapsed in late October and fresh elections were called ) . 
Moreover , northwestern Kosovo is potentially an important mining area , and thus a source of employment and revenue that the government is understandably loath to surrender . 
Opponents of partition fear opening a Pandora &apos;s Box of other Balkan issues . 
Republika Srpska would seek to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina and join Serbia , they say , and northern Macedonia would try to join Albania . 
But these countries &quot; territorial integrity and international borders , unlike Kosovo &apos;s , have been settled and recognized around the world for 15 years . 
The status quo is untenable in the longer term . 
Both sides will undermine their own strategic interests if they maintain an all-or-nothing approach . 
And Kosovo officials should consider that if the impasse continues for much longer , the West &apos;s massive financial support for their state will become increasingly difficult to defend , especially given fiscal austerity at home .
