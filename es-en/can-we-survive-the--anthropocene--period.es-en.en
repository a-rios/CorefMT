Can We Survive the &quot; Anthropocene &quot; Period ? 
For the past three centuries , humans &quot; effects on the global environment have escalated . 
Most importantly , our emissions of carbon dioxide may cause global climate patterns to depart significantly from their natural course for many millennia to come . 
It seems appropriate to assign the term &quot; Anthropocene &quot; to the current , in many ways human-dominated , geological epoch , supplementing the Holocene - the warm period of the past 10-12 millennia . 
The Anthropocene Period could be said to have started in the latter part of the eighteenth century , when analyses of air trapped in polar ice showed the beginning of growing global concentrations of CO2 and methane . 
This date also happens to coincide with James Watt &apos;s design of the steam engine in 1784 . 
Mankind &apos;s growing influence on the environment was recognized as long ago as 1873 , when the Italian geologist Antonio Stoppani referred to the &quot; anthropozoic era , &quot; defined by a &quot; new telluric force , which in power and universality may be compared to the greater forces of earth . &quot; 
In 1926 , V. I. Vernadsky similarly acknowledged the increasing impact of mankind on &quot; &#91; t &#93; he direction in which the processes of evolution must proceed , namely towards increasing consciousness and thought , and forms having greater and greater influence on their surroundings . &quot; 
Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin used the term &quot; noösphere &quot; - the world of thought - to mark the growing role of human brain-power in shaping its own future and environment . 
Humans &quot; rapid expansion in terms of population and per capita use of Earth &apos;s resources has continued apace . 
During the past three centuries , the human population has increased ten-fold , to more than six billion , and is expected to reach 10 billion in this century . 
As a result , 30-50 % of the planet &apos;s land surface is now exploited by humans . 
At the same time , the methane-producing cattle population has risen to 1.4 billion , contributing to the increasing rate of destruction of tropical rainforests , which releases carbon dioxide and contributes to faster species extinction . 
Land conversion for grazing ( and construction ) , together with crop tillage , has also caused soil erosion at 15 times its natural rate . 
Indeed , at its current pace , anthropogenic soil erosion would fill the Grand Canyon in 50 years . 
Similarly , dam building and river diversion have become commonplace , as humans &quot; water consumption has risen nine-fold over the past century , to the point that mankind now uses more than half of all accessible fresh water - roughly two-thirds of it for agriculture . 
Fisheries remove more than 25 % of the primary production in upwelling ocean regions and 35 % in the temperate continental shelf . 
Moreover , energy use has grown 16-fold during the twentieth century , causing 160 million tons of atmospheric sulfur-dioxide emissions per year - more than twice the total of natural emissions . 
Likewise , more nitrogen fertilizer is applied in agriculture than is fixed naturally in all terrestrial ecosystems , and nitric-oxide production from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass also surpasses natural emissions . 
At the same time , of course , human consumption of fossil fuels , together with our agricultural activities , have caused substantial increases in concentrations of &quot; greenhouse &quot; gases - CO2 by 30 % and methane by more than 100 % . 
Indeed , these concentrations are higher than at any point in the past 400 millennia , with more growth to follow , because so far these effects have largely been caused by only 25 % of the world population . 
The consequences are numerous and profound : acid precipitation , photochemical &quot; smog &quot; and global warming , among others . 
Hence , according to the latest estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , Earth will warm by 1.4-5.8 ° C during this century . 
Many toxic substances are released into the environment , even some that are not toxic but nonetheless are highly damaging - for example , the chlorofluorocarbons that caused the Antarctic ozone hole ( and which are now regulated ) . 
Things could have become much worse : the ozone-destroying properties of halogens have been studied since the mid-1970 &quot; s . 
More by luck than by wisdom , this catastrophic situation did not develop . 
Unless there is a global catastrophe - a meteorite impact , a world war , or a pandemic - mankind will remain a major environmental force for many millennia . 
As a result , scientists and engineers face a daunting task during the Anthropocene era : to guide us towards environmentally sustainable management . 
This will require appropriate human behavior at all levels , and may well involve internationally accepted , large-scale geo-engineering projects to &quot; optimize &quot; climate . 
At this stage , however , we are still largely treading on terra incognita .
