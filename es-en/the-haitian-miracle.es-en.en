The Haitian Miracle ? 
This spring &apos;s presidential election in Haiti sadly re-enforced the country &apos;s blighted reputation . 
The paradox is that today Haiti has a chance , perhaps the best in its modern history , to escape from its long history of extreme poverty and turmoil . 
A mere one-hour flight from Miami , the country struggles with poverty levels akin to the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa . 
But , whereas many parts of the world are extremely poor because of their isolation , Haiti is extremely poor despite its proximity to the world &apos;s largest market . 
Now , Haiti can turn its geography into a competitive advantage , but only if the United States helps . 
Haiti recalls a famous lament once heard about another US neighbor , Mexico : &quot; So far from God and so close to the United States . &quot; 
As with Mexico , Haiti &apos;s proximity to the US has cut both ways in its history . 
However , proximity has also meant US meddling . 
Haiti was the second country , after the US , to win its independence from Europe , following a slave rebellion in 1804 . 
But America regarded Haiti as a threat rather than as a colleague in freedom , refusing to extend diplomatic recognition until after the outbreak of the Civil War , which finally brought an end to slavery in the US . 
Even after recognition by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862 , relations remained sour . 
Haiti was exploited and occasionally occupied by US troops , rather than being regarded as a legitimate partner in trade and diplomacy . 
Meanwhile , Haiti &apos;s ecological and demographic conditions posed huge development challenges that have never been overcome . 
The island is hit regularly by devastating hurricanes . 
It has been massively deforested , and its soils have been depleted of nutrients . 
Tropical diseases remain killers to this day . 
A devastating economic blow occurred in the mid-nineteenth century , when Europe learned to produce sugar from a temperate-zone crop , beets , rather than from tropical sugar cane . 
World sugar prices collapsed , and Haiti fell into deeper disarray . 
Extreme poverty bred illiteracy and miserable governance , which in turn intensified hunger , disease , and instability . 
Haiti &apos;s recent economic history is marked by a remarkable and tragic downslide since the mid-1980 &quot; s , exacerbated by sometimes well-intentioned but typically disastrously executed US diplomacy . 
In an attempt to push Haiti toward democracy , the US imposed economic sanctions , which crippled Haiti &apos;s fragile and newly emerging export sector , especially apparel and other labor-intensive production . 
Unemployment soared . 
The US then entered into a destructive 15-year relationship with Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who is massively popular among Haiti &apos;s poor , but distrusted by most of the business sector and many leading US politicians . 
When Aristide came to power in 2001 , the Bush administration cut off most international aid , thereby helping to send the economy into a freefall . 
Aristide &apos;s government was ousted under highly contested circumstances in 2004 . 
The newly elected president , Rene Preval , is a highly talented and experienced agronomist , and thus has the perfect background to revive Haiti &apos;s degraded rural economy . 
With the US market close by , Haiti could achieve a remarkable recovery of exports of horticulture , fruits , and other agricultural products , as well as tourism and light manufactured goods . 
The key will be for the new government to provide a sound framework which combines key public investments - roads , power , soil nutrients , improved seed varieties , public health , safe water - with confidence-building outreach to the business community and fruitful relations with the US and other donor countries . 
This time , the US has a strong interest in cooperating fully to promote economic progress : another round of failure would only provoke chaos , including massive numbers of new refugees to the US . 
The gap between Haiti &apos;s performance and its potential is now so large that great gains can be achieved in income levels , farming , health , education , and more . 
Crop yields are below one ton of cereal per hectare of farmland - far less than half of what is readily achievable if farmers are helped to gain access to fertilizers , improved seeds , and basic infrastructure . 
Similarly , health conditions are horrendous , but could be improved dramatically just with immunization , de-worming , safe water , antibiotics , and anti-malaria bed nets . 
Community health workers could be trained in a matter of months to extend basic health care throughout rural areas , which could then be better mobilized to fend off the debilitating results of future hurricanes . 
On the economic front , Haiti can become a profitable exporter of tropical crops such as groundnuts , mangos , cut flowers , string beans , and bamboo - a source of progress among Haiti &apos;s Caribbean-basin neighbors . 
Preval &apos;s own hometown has successfully used a modest level of external donor support to create new rural cooperatives to market improved crops . 
And , with its beautiful beaches and remarkable arts and music , Haiti could once again become a major tourist destination . 
Indeed , Haiti can become an inspiration for many other fragile and impoverished new democracies . 
The US , France , Canada , and other major donor countries must not miss this historic opportunity to give vital help to Preval &apos;s democratically elected new government .
