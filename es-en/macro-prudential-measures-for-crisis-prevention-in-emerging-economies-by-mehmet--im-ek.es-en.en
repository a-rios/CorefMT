The Wisdom of Crisis Prevention 
ANKARA - Regardless of how differently governments may formulate policy , ensuring financial stability is their common responsibility . 
This calls for real and effective policy coordination and an overarching macro-prudential governance framework at both the domestic and international levels . 
The simple truth is that the cost of preventing financial crises is much lower than the costs imposed by them after they erupt . 
After all , financial crises are directly linked to significant output declines and unemployment spikes ; and , equally important , they often severely damage social cohesion . 
Five years from its outbreak , the fallout from the financial crisis and recession triggered by the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers continues . 
In many advanced economies , real GDP remains lower than its pre-crisis level . 
Unemployment rates and budget deficits are higher , and public debt / GDP ratios are at record levels . 
Macro-prudential policies are not a substitute for sound macroeconomic policies ; nonetheless , they are essential to preventing large asset bubbles and distortions in financial markets , and thus to reducing the risk of adverse shocks to both markets and the real economy . 
For example , Turkey &apos;s 2001 financial crisis stemmed mainly from the lack of an effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking sector . 
The crisis led to a 30-percentage-point jump in the public-debt ratio . 
Real GDP contracted by 5.7 % , and unemployment rose by 4.9 percentage points . 
Since then , Turkey has focused on financial stability and structural reforms , which have strengthened economic performance and made the country more resilient to shocks . 
Indeed , Turkey did not have to spend a penny of taxpayers &quot; money on bank recapitalization or rehabilitation during the global financial crisis . 
But the cost of bank bailouts during Turkey &apos;s self-inflicted crisis 12 years ago amounted to approximately 25 % of GDP . 
Thanks to Turkey &apos;s strong fundamentals and macro-prudential framework in 2008 , the global financial crisis has left no lasting impact on the Turkish economy . 
Recovery was rapid and strong , with real GDP growth averaging nearly 9 % in 2010-2011 . 
Turkey &apos;s unemployment rate is currently at its lowest point in a decade , and the public-debt ratio is significantly below the pre-crisis level . 
Turkey &apos;s experience suggests that the design of a macro-prudential framework should take into account both domestic and international financial linkages . 
The international framework should , above all , capture the risks and spillover effects arising from systemically important financial institutions . 
The development and implementation of the Basel III banking standards are essential to introducing countercyclical capital buffers and additional loss absorbency for these institutions . 
In terms of domestic measures , a country &apos;s institutional architecture is a core element in ensuring financial stability and effective policy coordination and cooperation . 
Turkey has established a Financial Stability Committee to oversee effective and timely implementation of policies directly affecting the financial sector , and an Economy Coordination Board to monitor and evaluate issues concerning overall economic stability . 
Both bodies have served to enhance the operational design and implementation of macro-prudential policies . 
For example , the inflation-targeting regime implemented by the Central Bank of Turkey has been revised to incorporate financial stability , and a new monetary-policy framework has been in effect since the end of 2010 . 
Monetary policy is now drawing on a more comprehensive toolkit , such as the policy rate , the interest-rate corridor , required-reserve ratios , and the reserve-option mechanism . 
Turkey &apos;s Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency and other authorities have also adopted macro-prudential measures . 
In 2011 , for example , the BRSA adopted a loan-to-value regulation on mortgages in order to limit rapid credit expansion stemming from growth in consumer loans . 
Earlier , in 2009 , the BRSA adopted another important measure that barred households from borrowing in foreign currency , thus sparing them the effects of exchange-rate volatility . 
Regarding the banking sector , stress tests have been applied since 2004 , and a target capital-adequacy ratio of 12 % has been maintained since 2006 . 
Even during the crisis , banks &quot; capital-adequacy ratios were higher than the Basel II requirement of 8 % , and their distribution of profits has been under the BRSA &apos;s close supervision since 2008 . 
As a result , ample reserve funds have been created on the banks &quot; balance sheets and return on equity has remained high . 
Turkey has also amended its tax laws to penalize excessive external borrowing by non-financial firms and to introduce significant incentives aimed at encouraging long-term household savings . 
Yet , despite these measures , the situation remains worrying . 
With the outbreak of the global crisis , major advanced economies employed unconventional monetary policies , leading to massive capital flows to emerging-market economies , which lowered borrowing costs and increased access to credit . 
While emerging-market countries &quot; public-sector balance sheets are stronger than ever - with low deficits and debt accompanied by large foreign-currency reserves - household and corporate leverage have risen . 
This has increased the vulnerability of many emerging markets to a sharp reversal in capital flows . 
This is particularly true of emerging countries that , like Turkey , have been running large current-account deficits . 
With Turkey &apos;s external deficit equivalent to 6 % of GDP , the authorities have adopted a macro-prudential framework that combines policies to reduce exchange-rate volatility in the very short term with measures to increase domestic savings and promote the real sector &apos;s international competitiveness in the long run . 
It is a model that other emerging economies should consider as well .
