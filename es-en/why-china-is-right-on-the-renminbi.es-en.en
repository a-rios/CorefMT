Why China is Right on the Renminbi 
BERKELEY - After a period of high tension between the United States and China , culminating earlier this month in rumblings of an all-out trade war , it is now evident that a change in Chinese exchange-rate policy is coming . 
China is finally prepared to let the renminbi resume its slow but steady upward march . 
We can now expect the renminbi to begin appreciating again , very gradually , against the dollar , as it did between 2005 and 2007 . 
Some observers , including those most fearful of a trade war , will be relieved . 
Others , who see a substantially undervalued renminbi as a significant factor in US unemployment , will be disappointed by gradual adjustment . 
They would have preferred a sharp revaluation of perhaps 20 % in order to make a noticeable dent in the US unemployment rate . 
Still others dismiss the change in Chinese exchange-rate policy as beside the point . 
For them , the Chinese current-account surplus and its mirror image , the US current-account deficit , are the central problem . 
They argue that current-account balances reflect national savings and investment rates . 
China is running external surpluses because its saving exceeds its investment . 
The US is running external deficits because of a national savings shortfall , which once reflected spendthrift households but now is the fault of a feckless government . 
There is no reason , they conclude , why a change in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate should have a first-order impact on savings or investment in China , much less in the US . 
There is no reason , therefore , why it should have a first-order impact on the bilateral current-account balance , or , for that matter , on unemployment , which depends on the same saving and investment behavior . 
In fact , both sets of critics have it wrong . 
China was right to wait in adjusting its exchange rate , and it is now right to move gradually rather than discontinuously . 
The Chinese economy is growing at potential : forecasts put the prospective rate for 2010 at 10 % ; the first-quarter flash numbers , at 11.9 % , show it expanding as fast as any economy can safely grow . 
China successfully navigated the crisis , avoiding a significant slowdown , by ramping up public spending . 
But , as a result , it now has no further scope for increasing public consumption or investment . 
To be sure , building a social safety net , developing financial markets , and strengthening corporate governance to encourage state enterprises to pay out more of what they earn would encourage Chinese households to consume . 
But such reforms take years to complete . 
In the meantime , the rate of spending growth in China will not change dramatically . 
As a result , Chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether the recovery in the US is real . 
If it is , China &apos;s exports will grow more rapidly . 
And if its exports grow more rapidly , they can allow the renminbi to rise . 
Without that exchange-rate adjustment , faster export growth would expose the Chinese economy to the risk of overheating . 
But , with the adjustment , Chinese consumers will spend more on imports and less on domestic goods . 
Overheating having been avoided , the Chinese economy can keep motoring ahead at its customary 10 % annual pace . 
Evidence that the US recovery will be sustained is mounting . 
As always , there is no guarantee . 
Because the increase in US spending on Chinese exports will be gradual , it also is appropriate for the adjustment in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate to be gradual . If China recklessly revalued its exchange rate by 20 % , as certain foreigners recommend , the result could be a sharp fall in spending on its goods , which would undermine growth . 
Moreover , gradual adjustment in the bilateral exchange rate is needed to prevent global imbalances from blowing out . 
US growth will be driven by the recovery of investment , which fell precipitously during the crisis . 
But , as investment now rises relative to saving , there is a danger that the US current-account deficit , which fell from 6 % of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5 % of GDP last year , will widen again . 
Renminbi appreciation that switches Chinese spending toward foreign goods , including US exports , will work against this tendency . 
By giving American firms more earnings , it will increase corporate savings in the US . 
And it will reconcile recovery in the US with the need to prevent global imbalances from again threatening financial stability . 
Chinese officials have been on the receiving end of a lot of gratuitous advice . 
In managing their exchange rate , they have gotten it exactly right .
