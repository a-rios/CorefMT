Why I Published \ u0027The Tiananmen Papers \ u0027 
The Chinese leadership &apos;s penchant for secretiveness is proverbial . 
But the veil that exists over how that omnipotent party makes important decisions is being lifted somewhat because a volume of unique materials about the behind-the-scenes events surrounding the infamous Tiananmen massacre of 1989 is being published this month . 
The materials contained in that book , which I brought out of China and decided to make public , consist of hundreds of documents , including minutes and transcripts of meetings at which the most important leaders of the People &apos;s Republic deliberated on how to handle the Tienanmen demonstrations ; key speeches ; notes on crucial telephone conversations between leaders ; classified reports from security agencies ; and dispatches from the police and military . 
Taken as a whole , these documents provide a rare glimpse into the modus operandi of China &apos;s leaders . 
As a witness and participant in the Tiananmen events , and as someone with access to the historical archive , I felt it my duty to publish this record of the decisions that lay behind what happened . 
The real truth of what happened in l989 was locked in secret Party archives in Beijing for over a decade . 
I chose to involve myself in this personally risky project because I believe those who wish to serve China must reflect deeply on the lessons of the Tiananmen events . 
Despite undergoing great changes in the years since 1989 , China needs not only to reverse the verdict on the June 4th movement as &quot; a counter-revolutionary rebellion , &quot; but also to restart its stalled process of political reform and democratization . 
I believe that these documents will help serve those elusive ends . 
Although the massacre in Tiananmen Square of June 4 , 1989 happened over ten years ago , it has not faded from people &apos;s memories . 
Chinese history seems frozen at that date . 
Far too many questions about those events remain unanswered . 
The first step in achieving an accurate , complete , and objective re-evaluation of what happened must involve , as Deng Xiaoping famously said , a &quot; search for truth in facts . &quot; 
Only then can the true face of history be restored . 
I believe that the following four lessons should guide those who are working for change in China and have motivated my actions in this case . 
First , even though the Chinese Communist regime has become thoroughly corrupt , it has strengthened itself through economic growth and improvement in people &apos;s lives . 
These achievements have enabled it to intensify its organizational penetration into almost every corner of society . 
No political force in China can stand up to it . 
People who do not like what the Party does must realize that they have nowhere else to turn ; they can rely only on themselves . 
Even though the end of communism in China may seem a foregone conclusion , the fall of the Chinese Communist Party will be accomplished not by an outside force but only by its own members . 
Second , given the lock that the Communist Party holds on all the levers of power , the building of democracy in China depends on forces rooted inside China . 
Those who have worked overseas for democracy , freedom , and the rule of law and who have sought the support of the international community have done necessary work . 
But real solutions to China &apos;s problems must be sought at home . 
Third , change from inside is possible because the Chinese Communist Party today resembles the Communist Party of the Soviet Union around 1989 . 
What looks on the outside like a solid structure can break into pieces overnight . 
The Chinese Communist Party has long since ceased to be a traditional Communist party . 
It is now a m√©lange of factions with diverse goals and differing ideologies . 
The differences between radicals and conservatives in the Party are now sharper than those between the Party and its historic rival , the Kuomintang . 
The key force pushing for political change is the pro-democracy faction within the Party . 
So what will replace the Chinese Communist Party will probably be a new force that emerges from inside the party ; a group that regrets the errors of the Communist system , a group committed to establishing a healthy democracy . 
This group will unite with forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a truly democratic system . 
Fourth , reversal of the verdict on June 4th is an historical inevitability , as well as the wish of most of China &apos;s people . 
June 4th weighs on the spirits of every Chinese patriot ; almost every Chinese person knows that official reevaluation is just a matter of time . 
Indeed , the Party &apos;s top leadership has been divided about the event ever since it occurred . 
Today , many of those responsible for the decision to crack down - notably Deng Xiaoping and others of the Party Elders - have died . 
So calls to reverse the verdict are growing , both inside and outside the Party . 
These calls will eventually form the mainstream , and the liberal forces within the Party will undoubtedly respond by seizing a historic opportunity not only to reverse the verdict but to move toward discarding the Communist system . 
Chinese democracy still has a long , hard road before it . 
Among other things , it needs a class of well-educated activists it lost when many young people left China to study and build a better life elsewhere . 
Even if risk and a large degree of self-sacrifice are required , these young people should return to join those in China , including those within the Communist Party , that are working for change . 
As Lu Xun said , &quot; A true warrior dares to stare the sadness of life in the face and to see the blood that drips there . &quot;
