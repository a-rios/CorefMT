Saudi Arabia &apos;s Iraq Dilemma 
Saudi Arabia broke ranks with the Arab world &apos;s opposition to military action against Iraq when Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal announced that the kingdom would allow the use of its military bases if the UN sanctions an attack on Iraq . 
The official Saudi press explains the new stance as reflecting the government &apos;s desire to abide by Security Council resolutions . 
But it also underscores the Saudi regime &apos;s growing feelings of internal fragility and external vulnerability . 
Domestic pressure on the Saudi royal family , the al-Sauds , arises from widespread opposition to any war against Iraq , as well as to America &apos;s military presence . 
Dissent comes not only from the street , but also from the Wahhabi religious establishment , the al-Sauds &quot; longstanding ally and source of their legitimacy . 
External pressure arises specifically from the US , Saudi Arabia &apos;s primary strategic protector . 
The al-Sauds have no easy option . 
They fear that cooperation with the Americans may not guarantee long-term stability , and worry that concessions on so fundamental an &quot; Arab &quot; cause as Iraq will further undermine their domestic legitimacy . 
How much erosion of legitimacy occurs will depend not only on whether war with Iraq takes place , but on what happens during the build-up and preparations for war : the media and propaganda struggles , and the political alliances that are forged . 
Should an attack on Iraq take place , the Saudi regime does not want to be marginalized as America embarks on its policy of &quot; regime change &quot; ; it also does not want to be America &apos;s next target . 
So , among a bad set of options , the least bad appears to be cooperation with the US . 
Yet cooperation with the US may not gain the al-Sauds much , because Saudi relations with America are strained to the breaking point . 
Ever since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last year , the regime - once central to American strategic interests in the region , has been made to feel dispensable by the US , which drops strong hints that there are alternatives to Saudi military bases , even to Saudi oil . 
Although the Saudis were not included in President Bush &apos;s &quot; axis of evil , &quot; some American policymakers now view the country as a &quot; kernel of evil . &quot; 
Al-Qaeda &apos;s terrorist network is seen as arising directly from fundamentalist Wahhabi teachings , which constitute an integral part of the Saudi regime . 
Problems with America run parallel with the regime &apos;s rising domestic problems . 
War against Iraq will invariably be divisive and weaken the kingdom &apos;s already delicate unity . 
Shi &apos;as in the oil-rich east , who feel ambivalent about their &quot; Saudi-ness &quot; and are labeled as heretics by the Wahhabi authorities , will likely welcome regime change in Iraq if it enhances their ties with Iraqi co-religionists , which would bolster their political confidence . 
The population of Asir , the tribal area bordering Yemen from which most al-Qaeda recruits originate , is also alienated . 
Saudi Arabian participation in a war on Iraq could strengthen the appeal of al-Qaeda &apos;s message there , invigorating calls for jihad against America &apos;s military presence and the al-Sauds . 
Meanwhile , the Hejazis , who originate in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina , are alienated not only from the political process , but also from the religious establishment because they are not Wahhabi . 
They might welcome a return of their old Hashemite rulers to the Iraqi throne , an option discussed for any &quot; regime change &quot; that follows Saddam Hussein &apos;s ouster . 
However , if war reinforces the Arab sense of defeat , Hejazi adherence to bin Laden &apos;s message may grow . 
In the face of this domestic antagonism , the al-Sauds have few tools . 
The advent of Arab satellite television and the Internet limits the government &apos;s ability to control public opinion . 
A declining economy has made the rising generation rebellious . 
War on Iraq could also reduce the importance of Saudi oil in world markets because increased Iraqi production is likely when sanctions are lifted . 
As al-Saud political and economic control declines , and in the absence of democratic reforms , the regime &apos;s policy seems certain to shift from patronage to repression . 
Making matters worse , the al-Sauds realize that American demands will persist after any war on Iraq is concluded . 
America wants to restrict the influence of the Wahhabi religious establishment , reform the educational system , and bring about moves towards democracy . 
To appease the Americans , discussions are taking place about shifting state religious oversight to marginal tasks such as operating schools for memorization of the Koran and regulating tourism . 
The Wahhabi establishment &apos;s role would begin to be limited purely to the social sphere . 
Such an attempt to secularize the state might backfire , however , as the regime could become even more vulnerable to accusations that it is an American lackey . 
For there is nothing at hand to replace the legitimizing sanction provided by the Wahhabis . 
To survive , the Saudi regime needs not only American guarantees , but also the support of the rising middle class . 
To attract that support , some steps towards freedom of the press have been taken , but censorship remains strict . 
Some educated people , however , emboldened by the satellite network al-Jazeera and its likes , seem poised to step beyond the current limits of toleration . 
So the Saudi dilemma has been heightened , not lessened , by its changed stance on Iraq . 
Ties with America may have been strengthened , but at the cost of upsetting the Saudi people . 
As war talk builds in the months ahead , the regime &apos;s room for maneuver will narrow even more .
