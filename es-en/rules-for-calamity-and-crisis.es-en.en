Rules for Calamity and Crisis 
NEW YORK  -  
Two nurses came into her hospital room to prepare for a transfusion . 
One clutched a pouch of blood and the other held my daughter &apos;s medical dossier . 
The first read aloud from the bag , &quot; Type A blood , &quot; and the other read aloud from the file , &quot; Alexa Holmes , Type A blood . &quot; 
They then proceeded , following a script , to switch props and roles , the first nurse reading from the file , &quot; Alexa Holmes , Type A blood , &quot; and the second reading from the bag , &quot; Type A blood . &quot; 
Why do well-trained professionals , when struggling with a rapidly unfolding emergency , adhere to rules laid down in advance ? 
The principal reason is that in times of crisis people fall into predictable but avoidable errors , largely because of panic . 
Over time , detailed protocols have evolved for such confusing situations to encourage cool-headedness and minimize the risk of avoidable error . 
The value of improvisation in the face of novel threats does not imply that existing rules should be peremptorily discarded . 
This point is almost trite , but it remains virtually unnoticed by last-ditch defenders of the Bush administration &apos;s foreign policy . 
Even today , the leading Republican presidential candidates suggest that the rule of law is an unaffordable luxury in the battle with al-Qaeda . 
They claim that constitutionalism and due process , if meticulously followed , reduce the government &apos;s &quot; flexibility &quot; in devising ways to prevent terrorist attacks . 
It is easy to imagine situations in which flexibility can be increased by curtailing individual rights and abandoning pre-established decision-making rules . 
An administration that has consistently boasted of its willingness to bend ( and sometimes break ) the law to meet an unprecedented threat has become notorious not for its flexibility , but for its rigidity . 
Might there be a causal relation between the Bush administration &apos;s cavalier , if not hostile , attitude toward law and its dazzling inability to acknowledge mistakes and manage midstream readjustments ? 
Could it be that a willingness to flout the law and circumvent the Constitution tends to produce not nimbleness , but obduracy and intransigence ? 
Just as adherence to rules can improve the performance of emergency-room personnel , so due process and constitutionalism can improve the performance , especially in a crisis , of law-enforcement officers and national-security policymakers . 
Requiring the government to test the factual basis of its decision to use force is not a shackle to be thrown off , but an incentive for forethought and a psychologically stabilizing support . 
A government that routinely makes fundamental national-security decisions based on undisclosed information , which no one outside a tiny circle of partisan loyalists ever has a chance to assess , is unlikely to make wise choices . 
The idea that executive officials will fight terrorism more effectively when they know that no one is watching is farfetched . 
A presidency that , having dismantled traditional checks and balances , is never compelled to provide coherent reasons for its policies , is soon likely to have few coherent reasons for its policies . 
The self-defeating proclivities of such laxly monitored executive power are now visible for all to see . 
Consider the decision radically to loosen evidentiary standards when deciding to incarcerate terrorist suspects in Guant√°namo Bay or elsewhere . 
The result has been to encourage liars to clog the system with disinformation and false leads while discouraging honest people from reporting what they observe , lest an innocent neighbor be incarcerated on the basis of misperceptions . 
But excessive secrecy leads to scarce resources being diverted into wild-goose chases . 
Obligatory consultation with independent and informed people may be annoying , but it can avert misunderstandings and accelerate the painful process of correcting blunders . 
Having invaded an oil-rich Arab country that played no role in the terrorist attack of September 11 , 2001 , the United States has imprudently allowed itself to be sucked into its attackers &quot; primitive logic of collective punishment and group revenge . 
It thereby abandoned the most essential pillar of the rule of law , namely the individualization of culpability . 
Restricting criminal liability to actual perpetrators , carefully excluding clansmen and kin , is a fragile historical innovation aimed at interrupting spirals of bloody inter-communal violence . 
The administration arguably devoted most of its counterterrorism efforts not to law enforcement operations , but into &quot; war &quot; in Muslim lands because it failed to keep a cool head in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on New York and Washington . 
It thereby inadvertently confirmed the jihadists &quot; vilest propaganda , suggesting that Muslims worldwide can , for no apparent reason , become targets of America &apos;s lethal fury . 
The surest way to rouse violent resistance is to communicate to people that there is nothing they can personally do to avoid being attacked . 
That is yet another reason why flouting inherited rules and protocols , in the name of national security , has made , and will continue to make , the terrorist threat catastrophically worse .
