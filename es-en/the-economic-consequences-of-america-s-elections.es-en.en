The Economic Consequences of America &apos;s Elections 
STANFORD - November &apos;s mid-term elections were a sharp rebuke to the vast expansion of government spending , deficits , and debt in the United States . 
Elected in the midst of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 , President Barack Obama and the Democratic leadership of Congress seemed surprised when the public rejected their stimulus , health-care reform , and energy policies by large margins . 
Of course , some of the huge increase in expenditure and debt has been the result of the recession , and of the defense and other spending legacies of President George W. Bush . 
Thus , the election results should not be viewed primarily as an endorsement of the Republicans , but as a rebuke to the Democrats &quot; agenda , which voters believed was out of touch with their concerns , interests , and values . 
The Republicans took control of the House of Representatives , netting more than 60 seats - the most in over 70 years - and six Senate seats . 
They gained in every part of the country , but especially in the industrial heartland from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin . 
They also won many governorships and took over many state legislatures ; both will play a vital role in redrawing Congressional and legislative districts in the reapportionment next year following the 2010 census . 
With divided government , many expect partisan gridlock on major legislation . 
Moreover , the changed Congressional landscape will be better for trade-related legislation . 
The Republicans &quot; protectionist wing is smaller than the Democrats , &quot; which may eventually help free-trade agreements between the US and countries such as South Korea and Colombia , as well as a revival of the moribund Doha round of global trade-liberalization talks . 
Likewise , economic ( but not other ) tensions between China and the US should be a little easier to manage . 
&quot; Global rebalancing &quot; requires surplus countries such as China to boost consumption , while deficit countries such as the US save more ( which requires sharply lower budget deficits and increased private saving ) . It will get a more sympathetic hearing from the new Congress than from President Obama , who was soundly rebuked at the Second G-20 Summit for demanding more deficit-financed spending . 
The new Congress will not support Obama &apos;s additional stimulus plans , such as a national infrastructure bank . 
Republicans will want to reform federal infrastructure spending - which is already substantial - rather than add to it . 
They are committed to rolling back spending to 2008 levels . 
In short , they want to ensure that the spending explosion is indeed temporary , not entrenched in a new baseline for the federal budget . 
But Obama &apos;s veto power is a big obstacle to reversing his policies . 
While Republicans will be able to make some inroads on reducing spending and preventing tax hikes , making good on their vow to &quot; repeal and replace &quot; Obama &apos;s signature health-care reform would require a Republican to be elected as president in 2012 . 
A showdown also looms over tax policy . 
Obama &apos;s temporary first-year expensing proposal for capital purchases ( a good idea as part of a permanent corporate-tax overhaul ) could get folded into broader tax legislation . 
Obama wants to let the cuts expire at the end of this year , but only for those with incomes over $ 250,000 . 
Republicans will mount substantial pressure to extend the tax cuts for all , as well as to prevent expansion of the so-called alternative minimum tax ( which applies if it is larger than the regular tax ) from hitting millions more taxpayers . 
Indeed , the lower marginal rate ought to be made permanent , but accompanied by spending control , with broader tax reform to come later . 
Another important feature of the new Congress will be heightened polarization . 
The center of gravity of the remaining Democrats has moved to the left , because the vast majority of defeated Democrats were moderates from swing districts . 
Likewise , the Republicans elected several conservative senators and a sizeable number of more conservative House members . 
This will make compromise even more difficult , as will partisan positioning in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election . 
Meanwhile , most political analysts do not expect Obama to make as large a move to the political center as President Bill Clinton did when the Republicans took control of Congress after the 1994 mid-term elections . 
Clinton then worked with Republicans to balance the budget and reform welfare , easily winning re-election in 1996 . 
But Obama starts much further left than Clinton , making a move to the middle a longer trek if he decides to embark on it . 
That means that a period of legislative stalemate looms over many of the big issues . We are likely to see some spending consolidation , but less than in Great Britain and other European countries . 
Temporary extension of most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts is also likely . 
And trade liberalization may be an area where Obama and Congress can agree . 
Inaction in other areas will be bad news for many . 
And that is good news for the US - and for the global economy .
