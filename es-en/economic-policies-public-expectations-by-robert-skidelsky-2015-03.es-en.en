Messed-Up Macro 
ITHACA - Until a few years ago , economists of all persuasions confidently proclaimed that the Great Depression would never recur . 
In a way , they were right . 
After the financial crisis of 2008 erupted , we got the Great Recession instead . 
Governments managed to limit the damage by pumping huge amounts of money into the global economy and slashing interest rates to near zero . 
But , having cut off the downward slide of 2008-2009 , they ran out of intellectual and political ammunition . 
Economic advisers assured their bosses that recovery would be rapid . 
And there was some revival ; but then it stalled in 2010 . 
Meanwhile , governments were running large deficits - a legacy of the economic downturn - which renewed growth was supposed to shrink . 
In the eurozone , countries like Greece faced sovereign-debt crises as bank bailouts turned private debt into public debt . 
Attention switched to the problem of fiscal deficits and the relationship between deficits and economic growth . 
Should governments deliberately expand their deficits to offset the fall in household and investment demand ? 
Or should they try to cut public spending in order to free up money for private spending ? 
Depending on which macroeconomic theory one held , both could be presented as pro-growth policies . 
The first might cause the economy to expand , because the government was increasing public spending ; the second , because they were cutting it . 
Keynesian theory suggests the first ; governments unanimously put their faith in the second . 
The consequences of this choice are clear . 
It is now pretty much agreed that fiscal tightening has cost developed economies 5-10 percentage points of GDP growth since 2010 . 
All of that output and income has been permanently lost . 
Moreover , because fiscal austerity stifled economic growth , it made the task of reducing budget deficits and national debt as a share of GDP much more difficult . 
Cutting public spending , it turned out , was not the same as cutting the deficit , because it cut the economy at the same time . 
That should have ended the argument . 
But it did not . 
Some economists claim that governments faced a balance of risk in 2010 : Cutting the deficit might have slowed growth ; but not committing to cut it might have made things even worse . 
The Keynesian remedy , the argument went , ignored the effect of fiscal policy on expectations . 
If public opinion believed that cutting the deficit was the right thing to do , then allowing the deficit to grow would annul any of its hoped-for stimulatory effect . 
Expecting that taxes would have to rise to &quot; pay for &quot; the extra spending , households and companies would increase their saving . 
Fearing sovereign defaults , bond markets would charge governments punitive interest rates on their borrowing . 
And here was the clincher : By committing themselves to fiscal tightening , finance ministers gave themselves scope for some fiscal loosening . 
Proclaiming fiscal virtue enabled them to practice fiscal vice . 
They could create a fiscal illusion by cutting less than they promised . 
This is part of the mess into which macroeconomics has gotten itself . 
Once beliefs and expectations are introduced into economics , as is surely reasonable , the results of fiscal policy become indeterminate . 
Too much depends on what people think the results of the policy will be . 
In the economists &quot; lingo , policy results are &quot; model-dependent . &quot; 
The Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman has poured scorn on what he calls the &quot; confidence fairy , &quot; the claim that fiscal policy must command the support of the bond markets . 
But to show that actual policy made things worse does not mean that a better policy was actually available . 
The right policy &apos;s success may depend on the public &apos;s expectations of its effects . 
The unanswered question is why the public should have the wrong expectations . 
If fiscal policy is in a muddle , so is monetary policy . 
Central banks have tried to avoid the confidence fairy by printing money - technically , by buying government bonds on the secondary market . 
The extra money is expected to percolate through the economy , quickening activity . 
The European Central Bank has just started a â‚¬ 1.1 trillion ( $ 1.17 trillion ) bond-purchase program to bypass the German veto on fiscal expansion . 
But the effects of so-called quantitative easing also depend on expectations . 
If giving businesses extra cash makes them more confident , they will spend more . 
The results of quantitative easing in the United States and the United Kingdom have been equivocal . 
Governments , it is true , could get their money cheaper as yields fell . 
But banks were not lending the money made available to them , partly because they used it to pay down their own debts , and partly because of low demand for loans . 
The main positive effect of quantitative easing was on asset prices - chiefly financial assets . 
It does increase inequality and threaten asset bubbles , which could lead to a new financial crash . 
So we enter the post-crisis era without any settled view on the right macro policy for either recovery or prevention of future meltdowns . 
Great hopes are pinned on better financial regulation to stop excessive credit creation . 
But what is &quot; excessive &quot; ? 
Will central banks continue to target 2 % inflation ? 
Or should they rely on a &quot; nominal income &quot; target ? 
What should the new fiscal rules be , and how - in the eurozone - should they be enforced ? 
Economists debate whether market economies are naturally stable . 
As a Keynesian , I firmly believe that market economies need to be stabilized by policy . 
But Keynesians have to face the uncomfortable truth that the success of stabilization policies may depend on the business community having Keynesian expectations . 
They need the confidence fairy to be on their side .
