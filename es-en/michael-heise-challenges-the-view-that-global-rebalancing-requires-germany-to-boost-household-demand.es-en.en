The Irrelevant German Consumer 
MUNICH - With global rebalancing set to be high on the agenda at the next G-7 and G-20 meetings , Germany , with its persistent export surplus , will again come under pressure to boost domestic demand and household consumption . 
But the German consumer is a sideshow . 
Massive external-account imbalances were a major factor behind the global financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2008 , as well as in the eurozone instability that followed . 
Now the world economy is in the process of rebalancing - but not in a way that many people had expected . 
Asia &apos;s formerly huge external surpluses have declined astonishingly fast , and Japan &apos;s trade balance has even slipped into deficit . 
China &apos;s current-account surplus has fallen to 2 % of GDP , from 10 % in 2007 . 
Investment is still the Chinese economy &apos;s main driver , but it has led to soaring debt and a bloated shadow banking sector , which the authorities are trying to rein in . 
The European Union , however , has built up a large external surplus , owing mainly to positive trade balances in the eurozone . 
The EU &apos;s current-account surplus in 2014 , at around $ 250 billion , will be even higher than that of emerging Asia . 
With oil prices still above $ 100 a barrel , the combined surplus of oil-exporting countries is of a similar magnitude . 
The United States , meanwhile , continues to run a sizeable current-account deficit of around $ 350-400 billion . 
The surprise here is the continued growth in the EU &apos;s surplus . 
The collapse in imports suffered by bailed-out countries - Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and Spain - was entirely predictable , given how sharply their economies declined . 
While Germany &apos;s current-account surplus is roughly where it was in 2007 , the combined external balance of the bailout beneficiaries plus Italy ( which has been part of the trade turnaround ) has swung from a pre-crisis deficit of more than $ 300 billion to an expected surplus of around $ 60 billion this year . 
Looking ahead , the appreciating euro ( another surprise , especially to the many observers who doubted its survival less than two years ago ) will compress the eurozone &apos;s current-account surplus to some extent . 
An exchange rate of close to $ 1.40 poses a challenge for many European exporters , including German companies . 
Nonetheless , the European surplus is too large to ignore , and Germany in particular will be asked once more to rebalance its economy toward higher domestic demand , which for many people implies the need for a fiscal boost . 
And , while some observers are calling for Germany to &quot; end wage restraint &quot; and thereby encourage higher household spending , this has actually happened already . 
There is , however , a lot that the government could do about investment , which has fallen by almost four percentage points of GDP since 2000 , to just over 17 % in 2013 - low by international standards . 
The government could shift more government spending toward infrastructure investment . 
Germany &apos;s attractiveness to investors would rise with simpler and more investment-friendly taxation , improved incentives for business start-ups and R D , less bureaucracy and red tape , and no further energy-cost increases . 
Getting there will take time . 
Investment from retained earnings should be as attractive as debt financing . 
The need for more investment in transport , telecoms , energy , and education certainly is not only a German issue . 
Given most European governments &quot; debt problems , the challenge is to attract more private capital into these areas . 
Improved regulatory conditions for long-term investments and savings would help . 
Indeed , why not create &quot; European Infrastructure Bonds , &quot; backed by revenues generated by the investments or tax income from the countries that emit EIBs ? 
This would not only spur jobs and long-term growth ; it would also stem the rise in Europe &apos;s external surplus . 
But the challenge of rebalancing the global economy is also closely connected to central banks &quot; monetary policies . 
With credit and asset bubbles slowly but surely reappearing , the authorities &quot; goal should be to keep growth on a balanced and sustainable path - and thus to discouraging excessive risk taking . 
This justifies the US Federal Reserve &apos;s gradual exit from ultra-loose policies . 
Somewhat surprisingly , the Fed &apos;s reduction of its monthly asset purchases has been accompanied so far by dollar weakness against the euro , which is fostering external adjustment . 
Looking forward , however , this may change . 
If the Fed remains alone in scaling back its monetary stimulus and bond yields rise further , the dollar will almost certainly strengthen . 
Clearly , a coordinated effort to limit exchange-rate variations is advisable . 
If all countries try to keep their currencies weak , monetary expansion on a global scale will be over-extended . 
The fact that inflationary pressure is still low is not a reason to postpone planning an exit from ultra-loose policy ; on the contrary , the time for such discussions is when inflation is low and markets are calm . 
Twenty years ago , markets panicked and bond rates soared as central banks hiked interest rates in the face of rising inflation . 
They should not repeat that mistake by waiting for inflationary pressures - fueled by rising oil and commodity prices and economic recovery - to return .
