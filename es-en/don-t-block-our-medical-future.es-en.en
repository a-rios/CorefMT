Don \ u0027t Block Our Medical Future 
We are at the juncture between the old medicine and the new - still mired in the limitations of the old but able to see on the horizon something utterly different in conception . 
That way is so new , so revolutionary , so transforming , that it deserves the name it has received . 
We are entering the world of regenerative medicine . 
We will remake ourselves - rebuilding and replacing the parts of our bodies that let us down ; the parts that have sickened , degenerated or ceased to function . 
Medicine of the 21 st century will have a new paradigm as the focus turns inward , to understand and harness the ways our bodies function on the molecular and cellular levels . 
Unlike today &apos;s other profound biomedical revolution - a high tech affair involving decoding our genome - stem cell research is a much more low-tech enterprise . 
It &apos;s not lack of scientific tools that is the main impediment ; it is restrictive laws and public policies . 
The first fruits of these revolutions will not come next week or next year , so it is important not to raise public expectations unrealistically . 
How to precisely direct the transformation of embryonic stem cells down predictable and desirable pathways remains unknown . 
But we could see some applications entering clinics in five years or so . 
These could address such hitherto intractable diseases as Parkinson &apos;s disease and diabetes , or even such scourges such as end stage heart failure . 
A stem cell can come from an embryo , fetus or adult . 
It has two properties . 
Under the right conditions it can reproduce itself and it can also give rise to the specialized cells that make up the tissues and organs of the body . 
Human embryonic stem cells are &quot; pluripotent , &quot; which means that they have the potential to develop into all basic tissue types and hence to provide a virtually limitless source of cells for transplantation . 
Another kind of stem cell is also in the news - the adult stem cell . 
These are found in major organs and they both self-renew and give rise to specialized cells . 
There have been stunning advances in getting these cells to change their destiny - transforming blood cells into nerve cells , for example . 
Such evidence fuels the moral debates about embryo research . 
Those opposed to embryonic stem cell research believe in the absolute sanctity of the human embryo . 
As this is a minority view , they often couch their arguments in scientific rather than moral terms . 
In testimony before the UK &apos;s House of Lords Select Committee on Stem Cell Research , one &quot; expert &quot; actually stated that not only were adult stem cells just as promising as embryonic stem cells ( untrue , according to the prevailing scientific consensus ) but they were even better - more versatile , more malleable . 
Of course , embryo research involves legitimate moral concerns , and it is the British who subjected these concerns to the earliest and the most sustained examination . 
That is only fitting because it was in the UK that a new and problematical moral construct - the embryo in a dish - came into being in 1978 , with the birth of the first &quot; test tube &quot; baby , Louise Brown , the product of in vitro fertilization . 
There were no moral paradigms to deal with the extra corporeal embryo . 
Abortion ethics is of little help , although the opponents are often but not always the same . 
No , a new way of thinking was required and Britain provided that with the Warnock Report of 1984 . 
Its conclusions were enshrined in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990 . 
Under British analysis , the embryo outside the body did have moral status , but only after the appearance of the so-called primitive streak on or about the 14 th day of development . 
Before that , it could not be said to be a unique , identifiable future person ; it might still split and become twins . 
Embryo research was allowed for purposes such as improving the efficiency of IVF . 
It was only a small step for the British to allow stem cell research as a permissible purpose . 
Most people approve of in vitro fertilization , but it is the technology that gives the infertile the chance to be parents that also poses moral questions . 
IVF is inefficient so extra embryos are produced in case they are needed . 
These are frozen and many if not most are discarded . 
Improving IVF also requires embryo research . 
Does it make any moral sense to say that embryos destined to be destroyed should not be used for life saving stem cell research ? 
Embryonic stem cells are derived from an early embryo called blastocysts at about the 5 th day . 
At this point , the embryo is a hollow ball of about 100 cells , none of which can be identified as destined to become any particular part of any particular human being . 
Stem cell research requires a sensible , predictable policy environment in order to flourish . 
Paradoxically , given its enormous impact on basic research in biological sciences , the United States is not leading this effort and , perhaps , is not even a major player . 
For more than twenty years , anti-abortionists have so frightened America &apos;s Congress that it left the field of assisted reproduction unregulated at the national level . 
So there is no policy framework within which to situate stem cell research or reproductive or therapeutic cloning . 
Into this vacuum has stepped President Bush . 
But his belief in the absolute sanctity of the early embryo is not shared by a majority of Americans . 
The President &apos;s stem cell policy - developed without consulting Congress - impedes US science and cruelly prolongs the agony of millions of sick and suffering people . 
Scientists elsewhere must forge ahead without America . 
Their work - their dreams - will change all of our lives for the better .
