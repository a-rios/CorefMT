Is the World Bank Beginning to Understand Growth ? 
At first sight , the World Bank &apos;s newest report on globalization contains few surprises . 
It repeats the mantra that the countries that went farther down the path of globalization became the ones with the greatest success in economic growth and poverty reduction . 
Buried within the pages of the report , however , is a startling admission : countries that integrated into the world economy most rapidly were not necessarily those that adopted the most pro-trade policies . 
Think about what this means . 
For the first time , the World Bank acknowledges that trade liberalization may not be an effective instrument , not only for stimulating growth , but even for integration in world markets . 
It is admitting , in an underhanded manner , that its repeated assertions about the benefits of globalization do not carry direct implications for how trade policy should be conducted in developing countries . 
In other words , the World Bank is beginning to face up to a reality that is obvious to anyone who looks at the empirical record with an open mind . 
Rapid integration into global markets is a consequence , not of trade liberalization or adherence to World Trade Organization ( WTO ) strictures per se , but of successful growth strategies with often highly idiosyncratic characteristics . 
Consider China and India , the two growth miracles of the last twenty years as well as the leading exemplars of what the World Bank calls &quot; globalizers . &quot; 
In both countries , the main trade reforms took place about a decade after the onset of higher growth . 
Moreover , trade restrictions in China and India remain among the highest in the world . 
In China &apos;s case , high growth started in the late 1970s with the introduction of the household responsibility system in agriculture and of two-tier pricing . 
China &apos;s authorities did not embark on import liberalization in earnest until much later , during the second half of the 1980s and the 1990s . 
As for India , its trend growth rate increased substantially in the early 1980s by about 3 % . 
Meanwhile , serious trade reform did not start until 1991-93 . 
Governments in both countries focused their scarce political capital and administrative resources on areas other than trade liberalization . 
Because both India and China did increase trade substantially , they are both considered as globalizers by the World Bank &apos;s criterion . 
But as their experience reveals - along with the experiences of many others , such as South Korea , Taiwan , and Vietnam - deep trade liberalization is hardly ever a factor in fostering higher growth and expanded trade early on . 
It is good to see the World Bank catching on to this simple reality . 
Unfortunately , there is still a lot of subterfuge in the World Bank &apos;s report . 
You will not notice how much ground the Bank has given up unless you dig deep in the report and look at the way the evidence is presented . 
Even there , you will find a residue of the intellectual sloppiness that the World Bank has displayed on this issue in the past . 
For example , a chart in the report shows that the World Bank &apos;s sample of &quot; more globalized &quot; countries had deeper tariff cuts than the &quot; less globalized &quot; countries . 
The unstated implication - but the one the reader is expected to draw - is that tariff cuts were an important determinant of global integration and hence growth . 
Of course , if there was direct evidence that these tariff cuts were correlated with growth ( there isn &apos;t ) , you can be certain that the World Bank would have presented those results instead . 
In fact , only a few lines further down , the report denies that the question is even relevant . &quot; Whether there is a casual connection from opening up trade to faster growth is not the issue &quot; declares the report . 
One wonders why not . 
Why did the World Bank invest so much intellectual capital on establishing the linkage between trade openness and growth if that is not an important issue ? 
These oddities are perhaps to be expected for an institution that is being forced to backtrack from a position that has become analytically and empirically untenable . 
We should just be happy that some degree of realism is returning to the World Bank &apos;s discussion of globalization . 
The bottom line is this . 
What &apos;s at issue is the policy conclusion to be drawn from this empirical observation . 
Previously , the World Bank wanted you to think that a significant liberalization of the trade regime is a key element in unleashing all those good things . 
Now it is no longer so sure . 
Neither should we be .
