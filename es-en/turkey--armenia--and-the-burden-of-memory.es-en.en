Turkey , Armenia , and the Burden of Memory 
All wars end , eventually . 
The 90th anniversary of the Armenian massacres of 1915 , ordered by the ruling Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire and carried out with the help of the Kurds , is another wound that will not heal , but one that must be treated if Turkey &apos;s progress toward European Union membership is to proceed smoothly . 
It is believed that the Armenian genocide inspired the Nazis in their plans for the extermination of Jews . 
However , in comparison with the Holocaust , most people still know little about this dark episode . 
Indeed , it is hard for most of us to imagine the scale of suffering and devastation inflicted on the Armenian people and their ancestral homelands . 
It is particularly ironic that many Kurds from Turkey &apos;s southeastern provinces , having been promised Armenian property and a guaranteed place in heaven for killing infidels , were willingly complicit in the genocide . 
They later found themselves on the losing end of a long history of violence between their own separatist forces and the Turkish army , as well as being subjected to an ongoing policy of discrimination and forced assimilation . 
Historically , the ancient Christian Armenians were amongst the most progressive people in the East , but in the nineteenth century Armenia was divided between the Ottoman Empire and Russia . 
Sultan Abdulhamit II organized the massacres of 1895-97 but it was not until the spring of 1915 , under the cover of the First World War , that the Young Turks &quot; nationalistic government found the political will to execute a true genocide . 
Initially , Armenian intellectuals were arrested and executed in public hangings in groups of 50 to 100 . 
Ordinary Armenians were thus deprived of their leaders , and soon after were massacred , with many burned alive . 
Approximately 500,000 were killed in the last seven months of 1915 , with the majority of the survivors deported to desert areas in Syria , where they died from either starvation or disease . 
It is estimated that 1.5 million people perished . 
Recently , the Armenian Diaspora has been calling on Turkey to face-up to its past and recognize its historic crime . 
Turkey &apos;s official line remains that the allegation is based on unfounded or exaggerated claims , and that the deaths that occurred resulted from combat against Armenians collaborating with invading Russian forces during the First World War , or as a result of disease and hunger during the forced deportations . 
Moreover , the local Turkish population allegedly suffered similar casualties . 
Turkey thus argues that the charge of genocide is designed to besmirch Turkey &apos;s honor and impede its progress towards EU accession . There are also understandable fears that diverging from the official line would trigger a flood of compensation claims , as occurred against Germany . 
For many politicians , particularly in America , there is an unwillingness to upset Turkey without strong justification , given its record as a loyal NATO ally and putative EU candidate country . 
But , despite almost half a century of membership in the Council of Europe - ostensibly a guardian of human rights , including freedom of speech and conscience - Turkey still punishes a crime against national honor any suggestion that the Armenian genocide is an historic truth . 
Fortunately , this article of Turkey &apos;s penal code is now due for review and possible repeal . 
Indeed , broader changes are afoot in Turkey . 
The press and government , mindful of the requirements of EU membership , are finally opening the sensitive Armenian issue to debate . 
Even Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , under increasing EU pressure as accession negotiations are due to begin this October , has agreed to an impartial study by academic historians , although he has reiterated his belief that the genocide never occurred . 
In France , the historical occurrence of the Armenian genocide is enshrined in law , and denial of its occurrence is regarded in the same way as Holocaust denial . 
The European Parliament is pressing for Turkish recognition of the Armenian genocide . 
It is also calling for an end to the trade embargo by Turkey and its close ally Azerbaijan against the Republic of Armenia , a reopening of frontiers , and a land-for-peace deal to resolve the territorial dispute over Nagorno Karabakh in Azerbaijan and safeguard its Armenian identity . 
Armenia , an independent country since 1991 , remains dependent on continued Russian protection , as was the case in 1920 when it joined the Soviet Union rather than suffer further Turkish invasion . 
This is not healthy for the development of Armenia &apos;s democracy and weak economy . 
Nor does Armenia &apos;s continued dependence on Russia bode well for regional co-operation , given deep resentment of Russian meddling in neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan . 
There is only one way forward for Turkey , Armenia , and the region . 
The future will begin only when Turkey - like Germany in the past and Serbia and Croatia now - repudiates its policy of denial and faces up to its terrible crimes of 1915 . 
Only then can the past truly be past .
