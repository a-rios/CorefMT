Life after Darwin 
MARSEILLE - Many Greek philosophers perceived the world to be in perpetual motion - a process of constant evolution . 
In Charles Darwin &apos;s world , however , creationism set the rules for science . 
So , underpinning his theory of evolution is the literal interpretation of the Bible that dominated his era , combined with Aristotle &apos;s vision of nature as definitively fixed . 
Darwin , together with J. B. Lamarck , promoted a vision of a changing world , while upholding the idea that organisms evolved from a single root - a position held by Adam and Eve in the creationist worldview , and taken over in the modern era by the Last Universal Common Ancestor ( LUCA ) . 
And from that remnant of the Biblical story of creation sprung the notion of a tree of life , alongside major concepts such as gradualism ( the view that speciation does not occur abruptly ) and the idea that minor selection pressures can , over time , have a profound effect on improved fitness . 
Darwin &apos;s vision of the world deeply influenced biology in the twentieth century , despite persistent questions posed by factors such as lateral gene transfer , neutral evolution , and chaotic bottlenecks in natural selection . 
But recent genetic research unequivocally refutes this worldview . 
Life is primarily the expression of the information contained in genes . 
All living organisms appear as mosaics of genetic tissue , or chimeras , suggesting that no two genes have the same evolutionary history . 
This framework is incompatible with the &quot; tree of life &quot; representation . 
Rather , it resembles a rhizome - an underground stem that sends out roots and shoots that develop into new plants . 
Indeed , we now know that the proportion of genetic sequences on earth that belongs to visible organisms is negligible . 
Furthermore , only 15 % of the genetic sequences found in the samples from the environment and from feces analyzed in metagenomic studies belong to the three domains of microbes currently recognized in the tree-of-life framework - bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes . 
Viruses contain another 15-30 % of these genetic sequences . 
The unidentified genetic sequences pose a problem , because it is not known whether vehicles other than viruses , bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes exist . 
Conversely , we know that new genes , designated ORFans ( &quot; orphan genes &quot; ) , are commonly created by gene duplication , fusion , or other unknown mechanisms . 
Yet , according to Darwin &apos;s tree of life concept , this phenomenon would be impossible . 
Human cells comprise genes of eukaryotic , bacterial , archaean , and viral origin . 
As this chimerism increases , it occasionally integrates genes from microbes that live within the human body - as happens when a human is infected by herpesvirus 6 . 
Once integrated in a person &apos;s genome , these genes can be transmitted from parent to child - making microbial genes their &quot; grandfathers . &quot; 
This transfer of genetic sequences from parasites to hosts could involve hundreds of genes for a bacterium in different hosts . 
For example , if the bacterium Wolbachia &apos;s genes are integrated by different hosts , such as spiders , insects , or worms , the hosts &quot; offspring are also descendants of Wolbachia . 
Moreover , certain viruses &quot; size and genetic repertoire is comparable with that of bacteria , archaea , or small eukaryotes . 
Indeed , the life of giant viruses is as complex as that of like-sized microorganisms . 
But the current classification of the domains of life is based on the ribosome - the production apparatus of proteins - which does not exist in these viruses . 
Without ribosomes , traditionalists say , viruses cannot be considered biological entities comparable to other microbes . 
But that is pure dogma ; these viruses are akin to the other microbes . 
Darwin &apos;s theory is further used to support the belief that ancient humans - Neanderthal , Cro-Magnon , and Denisova - did not mix . 
In fact , based on Darwin &apos;s assumptions , most anthropologists claim that modern humans were simply descended from Cro-Magnons , who had exterminated their less-fit adversaries . 
Given this supposition , a single name ( Homo sapiens ) is used for both modern humans and the preferred ancestor , Cro-Magnon . 
But we now know that modern humans are chimeras of these three ancient humans . 
This understanding also refutes the legend of &quot; Mitochondrial Eve , &quot; the woman from whom all humans supposedly descend on their mother &apos;s side . 
Research on the human leukocyte antigen genes , which are involved in the human immune response , shows that such a common ancestor could not have existed ; this group of genes derives from those of all three known ancient humans . 
Genetic research , in particular , must be free to find new models to explain , and enhance , twenty-first-century scientific discovery . 
Today , Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution is more a hindrance than a help , because it has become a quasi-theological creed that is preventing the benefits of improved research from being fully realized .
