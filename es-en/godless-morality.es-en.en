Godless Morality 
Is religion necessary for morality ? 
Many people consider it outrageous , even blasphemous , to deny the divine origin of morality . 
Either some divine being crafted our moral sense , or we picked it up from the teachings of organized religion . 
Either way , we need religion to curb nature &apos;s vices . 
Paraphrasing Katherine Hepburn in the movie The African Queen , religion allows us to rise above wicked old Mother Nature , handing us a moral compass . 
Yet problems abound for the view that morality comes from God . 
One problem is that we cannot , without lapsing into tautology , simultaneously say that God is good , and that he gave us our sense of good and bad . 
A second problem is that there are no moral principles that are shared by all religious people , regardless of their specific beliefs , but by no agnostics and atheists . 
Indeed , atheists and agnostics do not behave less morally than religious believers , even if their virtuous acts rest on different principles . 
Non-believers often have as strong and sound a sense of right and wrong as anyone , and have worked to abolish slavery and contributed to other efforts to alleviate human suffering . 
The opposite is also true . 
Religion has led people to commit a long litany of horrendous crimes , from God &apos;s command to Moses to slaughter the Midianites - men , women , boys , and non-virginal girls - through the Crusades , the Inquisition , innumerable conflicts between Sunni and Shiite Muslims , and suicide bombers convinced that martyrdom will lead them to paradise . 
The third difficulty for the view that morality is rooted in religion is that some elements of morality seem to be universal , despite sharp doctrinal differences among the world &apos;s major religions . 
In fact , these elements extend even to cultures like China , where religion is less significant than philosophical outlooks like Confucianism . 
Perhaps a divine creator handed us these universal elements at the moment of creation . 
For the first time , research in the cognitive sciences , building on theoretical arguments emerging from moral philosophy , has made it possible to resolve the ancient dispute about the origin and nature of morality . 
Consider the following three scenarios . 
For each , fill in the blank space with &quot; obligatory , &quot; &quot; permissible , &quot; or &quot; forbidden . &quot; 
1 . 
A runaway boxcar is about to run over five people walking on the tracks . 
A railroad worker is standing next to a switch that can turn the boxcar onto a side track , killing one person , but allowing the five to survive . 
Flipping the switch is _ _ _ _ _ _ . 
2 . 
You pass by a small child drowning in a shallow pond , and you are the only one around . 
If you pick up the child , she will survive and your pants will be ruined . 
Picking up the child is _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . 
3 . 
Five people have just been rushed into a hospital in critical condition , each requiring an organ to survive . 
There is not enough time to request organs from outside the hospital , but there is a healthy person in the hospital &apos;s waiting room . 
If the surgeon takes this person &apos;s organs , he will die , but the five in critical care will survive . 
Taking the healthy person &apos;s organs is _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . 
If you judged case 1 as permissible , case 2 as obligatory , and case 3 as forbidden , then you are like the 1,500 subjects around the world who responded to these dilemmas on our web-based moral sense test ( http : / / moral.wjh.harvard.edu / ) . 
For example , because atheists supposedly lack a moral compass , they should be guided by pure self-interest and walk by the drowning child . 
But there were no statistically significant differences between subjects with or without religious backgrounds , with approximately 90 % of subjects saying that it is permissible to flip the switch on the boxcar , 97 % saying that it is obligatory to rescue the baby , and 97 % saying that is forbidden to remove the healthy man &apos;s organs . 
When asked to justify why some cases are permissible and others forbidden , subjects are either clueless or offer explanations that cannot account for the relevant differences . 
Importantly , those with a religious background are as clueless or incoherent as atheists . 
These studies provide empirical support for the idea that , like other psychological faculties of the mind , including language and mathematics , we are endowed with a moral faculty that guides our intuitive judgments of right and wrong . 
These intuitions reflect the outcome of millions of years in which our ancestors have lived as social mammals , and are part of our common inheritance . 
Our evolved intuitions do not necessarily give us the right or consistent answers to moral dilemmas . 
But insights into the changing moral landscape , in which issues like animal rights , abortion , euthanasia , and international aid have come to the fore , have not come from religion , but from careful reflection on humanity and what we consider a life well lived . 
In this respect , it is important for us to be aware of the universal set of moral intuitions so that we can reflect on them and , if we choose , act contrary to them . 
We can do this without blasphemy , because it is our own nature , not God , that is the source of our morality .
