Where Did Market Volatility Go ? 
Television and newspapers continue to trumpet every twist and turn of global financial markets . 
In truth , however , the big story is the uneerie calm that has engulfed virtually every major asset class , from stocks to bonds . 
Is the whole investment world on Prozac ? 
Conspiracy theories abound , particularly among the ranks of financial traders , for whom volatility is like wind to a sailor . 
These traders confidently figure that as long as markets gyrate , no matter what the direction , they can always make money . 
And , thanks to the rest of us who don &apos;t have the time , information , and skill to match wits with them , they are mostly right . 
But , with today &apos;s dormant markets , the pickings are slim . 
The favored bogeymen of the day are giant government investors , particularly Asian central banks , with their trillions of dollars in assets . 
These superfunds , whose managers do not necessarily share the same passion for profit as private investors , are said to be squeezing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates . 
&quot; The big Asian central banks are oppressing us , &quot; one young trader recently complained to me . 
What a difference a decade makes . 
During the 1990 &quot; s , private investors looked at big , lumbering central banks as cash cows , long on money and short on financial acumen . 
George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour . 
His basic strategy was a standard one : bet against any central bank that tries to defend an inconsistent macroeconomic policy . 
Traders did not win every battle , of course . 
It was the speculators whose blood flowed in the streets when they attacked Hong Kong &apos;s dollar peg in 1998 . 
But overall , betting against big government financial institutions proved to be a richly rewarding business . 
That was the 1990 &quot; s . 
Today , many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses , capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets . 
These behemoths &quot; innate conservatism , having calmed bond and currency markets , is now having a similar effect on stocks . 
Although few accuse Asian central banks of explicitly conspiring to calm global markets , some say that their common cautious approach to trading is a form of implicit collusion . 
As much as we may sympathize with young would-be millionaire traders , does their story of oppression make any sense ? 
Could it be true that huge government investors from Asia ( not to mention Russia , Latin America , and the Middle East ) have quietly taken control of world markets ? 
Perhaps , but the bogeyman theory seems a bit overblown . 
Yes , the big Asian central banks do sit on almost $ 3 trillion in assets ; 
This gives them a capital base similar to the combined assets of all the world &apos;s major hedge funds . 
But this metric is very deceptive . 
Hedge funds constitute only a small percentage of overall world financial markets , which , according to a recent study by the McKinnsey Global Institute , now exceed $ 120 trillion . 
And hedge funds , unlike banks , can leverage their bets , borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital base . 
Otherwise , George Soros and his wealthy fellow investors could not have dreamed of taking on the Bank of England . 
In fact , the explanation for market calm probably lies elsewhere . 
So , if a conspiracy of Asian central banks is not to blame for the volatility drought that is parching traders &quot; earnings , what is ? 
Surely , today &apos;s low volatility is partly cyclical . 
Stock market volatility was also very low during the early 1990 &quot; s , before reaching new peaks later in the decade . 
Moreover , financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before , placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it . 
Improved central bank policy is another huge factor . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , the average level of world inflation exceeded 30 % ; now it is less than 4 % . 
All of these changes have in turn contributed to lower economy-wide output and consumption volatility in both rich and developing countries . 
They have also contributed mightily to the high general level of asset prices , helping create the vast riches of which today &apos;s hungry young traders are so jealous . 
So will today &apos;s relative market calm continue ? 
Unfortunately , no . 
Today &apos;s brave new world of financial globalization will almost surely face severe new stress tests , reminding us that recessions still happen . 
Frankly , although I do not see the five-year-old global expansion coming to an end yet , there is no question that risks are on the rise , with output in the United States having slowed sharply in the third quarter , and central banks &quot; hands tied by inflation risks . 
Further ahead , it is not hard to imagine geopolitical instability - possibly emanating from Iran , Iraq , or North Korea - unsettling markets . 
Whatever the scenario that ends the calm , today &apos;s age of low volatility will seem like a distant dream to most of us - and a forgotten nightmare for ambitious financial traders .
