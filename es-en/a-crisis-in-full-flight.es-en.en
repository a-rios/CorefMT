A Crisis in Full Flight 
MUNICH - For a while , it looked as if the European Central Bank &apos;s € 1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe &apos;s banking system had calmed global financial markets . 
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again , closing in on about 6 % . 
Of course , this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable . 
After all , interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10 % in the decade before the euro was introduced . 
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6 % . 
Nevertheless , the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden . 
The main problem is Spain , where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Italy combined , and , as in Greece , is in the neighborhood of 100 % of GDP ( 93 % to be precise ) . 
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain &apos;s youth are unemployed , reflecting the country &apos;s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period . 
The current-account deficit remains at 3.5 % of GDP , despite the recession-induced decline in imports , while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again . 
Moreover , Spain &apos;s debt with the ECB &apos;s TARGET settlement system rose by € 55 billion ( $ 72 billion ) between February and March , because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated . 
Since July 2011 , Spain &apos;s TARGET debt has grown by € 199 billion . 
Capital is in full flight , more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010 . 
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year ( 2008 ) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press . 
The picture is little better in Italy , where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2 % of GDP to a 3 % -of-GDP deficit over the last ten years . 
The country &apos;s TARGET debt grew by € 76 billion from February to March , with the total since July 2011 reaching € 276 billion . 
Italy , too , is being drained of capital ; in fact , the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB &apos;s liquidity injection . 
It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy , because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital . 
The purpose of the ECB &apos;s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market . 
In this , too , it has not really been successful , despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table . 
Indeed , now the French are looking wobbly . 
As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012 , France &apos;s TARGET debt increased by € 95 billion . 
France , too , has become uncompetitive , owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years . 
According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs , the country &apos;s price level must drop by an estimated 20 % vis-à-vis the euro average - that is , depreciate in real terms - if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone . 
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15 % , and Spain by roughly 20 % . 
While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30 % and 35 % , respectively , the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone . 
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort , if at all , and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation . 
For Greece and Portugal , staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze . 
There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels - bailout funds , eurobonds , or the ECB - from the eurozone &apos;s healthy core to the troubled South . 
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree . 
Already German , Dutch , and Finish savings amounting to € 15,000 , € 17,000 , and € 21,000 , respectively , per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB . 
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup . 
Above all , however , the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity , if not to Europe &apos;s economic collapse , because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment . 
Such systems cannot work , because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system &apos;s main steering mechanism . 
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe &apos;s politicians have started down this slippery slope .
