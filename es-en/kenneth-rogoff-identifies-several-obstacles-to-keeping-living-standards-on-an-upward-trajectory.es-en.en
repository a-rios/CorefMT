Malthus , Marx , and Modern Growth 
CAMBRIDGE - The promise that each generation will be better off than the last is a fundamental tenet of modern society . 
By and large , most advanced economies have fulfilled this promise , with living standards rising over recent generations , despite setbacks from wars and financial crises . 
In the developing world , too , the vast majority of people have started to experience sustained improvement in living standards and are rapidly developing similar growth expectations . 
Though the likely answer is yes , the downside risks seem higher than they did a few decades ago . 
So far , every prediction in the modern era that mankind &apos;s lot will worsen , from Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx , has turned out to be spectacularly wrong . 
Technological progress has trumped obstacles to economic growth . 
Periodic political rebalancing , sometimes peaceful , sometimes not , has ensured that the vast majority of people have benefited , albeit some far more than others . 
As a result , Malthus &apos;s concerns about mass starvation have failed to materialize in any peaceful capitalist economy . 
Living standards around the world continue to rise . 
But past growth performance is no guarantee that a broadly similar trajectory can be maintained throughout this century . 
Leaving aside potential geopolitical disruptions , there are some formidable challenges to overcome , mostly stemming from political underperformance and dysfunction . 
The first set of issues includes slow-burn problems involving externalities , the leading example being environmental degradation . 
When property rights are ill-defined , as in the case of air and water , government must step in to provide appropriate regulation . 
I do not envy future generations for having to address the possible ramifications of global warming and fresh-water depletion . 
A second set of problems concerns the need to ensure that the economic system is perceived as fundamentally fair , which is the key to its political sustainability . 
This perception can no longer be taken for granted , as the interaction of technology and globalization has exacerbated income and wealth inequality within countries , even as cross-country gaps have narrowed . 
Until now , our societies have proved remarkably adept at adjusting to disruptive technologies ; but the pace of change in recent decades has caused tremendous strains , reflected in huge income disparities within countries , with near-record gaps between the wealthiest and the rest . 
Inequality can corrupt and paralyze a country &apos;s political system - and economic growth along with it . 
The third problem is that of aging populations , an issue that would pose tough challenges even for the best-designed political system . 
How will resources be allocated to care for the elderly , especially in slow-growing economies where existing public pension schemes and old-age health plans are patently unsustainable ? 
Soaring public debts surely exacerbate the problem , because future generations are being asked both to service our debt and to pay for our retirements . 
The final challenge concerns a wide array of issues that require regulation of rapidly evolving technologies by governments that do not necessarily have the competence or resources to do so effectively . 
We have already seen where poor regulation of rapidly evolving financial markets can lead . 
There are parallel shortcomings in many other markets . 
A leading example is food supply - an area where technology has continually produced ever-more highly processed and genetically refined food that scientists are only beginning to assess . 
What is known so far is that childhood obesity has become an epidemic in many countries , with an alarming rise in rates of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease implying a significant negative impact on life expectancy in future generations . 
Many leading health researchers , including Kelly Brownell , David Ludwig , and Walter Willett , have documented these problems . 
Government interventions to date , mainly in the form of enhanced education , have proved largely ineffective . 
Self-destructive addiction to processed foods , which economists would describe as an &quot; internality , &quot; can lower quality of life for those afflicted , and can eventually lead to externalities for society , such as higher health-care costs . 
Again , despite a rising chorus of concern from researchers , political markets have seemed frozen . 
All of these problems have solutions , at least in the short to medium run . 
A global carbon tax would mitigate climate risks while alleviating government debt burdens . 
Addressing inequality requires greater redistribution through national tax systems , together with enhanced programs for adult education , presumably making heavy use of new technologies . 
The negative effects of falling population growth can be mitigated by easing restrictions on international migration , and by encouraging more women and retirees to enter or stay in the workforce . 
Capitalist economies have been spectacularly efficient at enabling growing consumption of private goods , at least over the long run . 
When it comes to public goods - such as education , the environment , health care , and equal opportunity - the record is not quite as impressive , and the political obstacles to improvement have seemed to grow as capitalist economies have matured . 
Will each future generation continue to enjoy a better quality of life than its immediate predecessor ? 
In developing countries that have not yet reached the technological frontier , the answer is almost certainly yes . 
In advanced economies , though the answer should still be yes , the challenges are becoming formidable .
