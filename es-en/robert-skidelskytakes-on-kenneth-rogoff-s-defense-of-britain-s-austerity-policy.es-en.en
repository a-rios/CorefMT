Misconceiving British Austerity 
LONDON - Was the British government &apos;s decision to embrace austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis the right policy , after all ? 
Yes , claims the economist Kenneth Rogoff in a much-discussed recent commentary . 
Rogoff argues that while , in hindsight , the government should have borrowed more , at the time there was a real danger that Britain would go the way of Greece . 
So Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne turns out , on this view , to be a hero of global finance . 
To show that there was a real threat of capital flight , Rogoff uses historical cases to demonstrate that the United Kingdom &apos;s credit performance has been far from credible . 
He mentions the 1932 default on its World War I debt owed to the United States , the debts accumulated after World War II , and the UK &apos;s &quot; serial dependence on International Monetary Fund bailouts from the mid-1950 &quot; s until the mid-1970 &quot; s . &quot; 
What Rogoff &apos;s analysis lacks is the context in which these supposed offenses were committed . 
The 1932 default on Britain &apos;s WWI loans from America remains the largest blemish on the UK &apos;s debt history , but the background is crucial . 
The world emerged from the Great War in the shadow of a mountain of debt that the victorious Allies owed to one another ( the US being the only net creditor ) , and by the losers to the victors . 
John Maynard Keynes predicted accurately that all of these debts would end up in default . 
The UK was the only country that made an effort to pay . 
Having failed to collect what other countries owed it , Britain continued to pay the US for ten years , suspending debt service only in the depth of the Great Depression . 
Rogoff &apos;s discussion about the debts accumulated after WWII is beside the point . 
It is neither here nor there to claim that &quot; had the UK not used a labyrinth of rules and regulations to hold nominal interest rates on debt below inflation , its debt-to-GDP ratio might have risen over the period 1945-1955 instead of falling dramatically . &quot; 
The fact is that the UK did manage to reduce its debt using a series of policies , including encouragement of economic growth . 
As for the UK &apos;s &quot; serial dependence &quot; on the IMF from the mid-1950 &quot; s to the mid-1970 &quot; s , there were actually only two episodes : the 1956 bailout during the Suez crisis and the 1976 bailout that preceded the winter of discontent when strikes in many essential industries - even the dead went unburied - practically brought the country to its knees . 
( It hardly needs stating that borrowing money from the IMF is not a default . ) 
In 1956 , the UK was facing a speculative attack in the midst of the Suez crisis . 
The country was running a current-account surplus , but the pound was slipping against the dollar , causing the Bank of England to sell its dollar reserves to defend the fixed exchange rate . 
As its reserves drained away , Prime Minister Anthony Eden was forced to appeal for help , first to the US and then to the IMF . 
The IMF &apos;s involvement was necessitated only by America &apos;s unwillingness to provide support . 
Furthermore , US President Dwight Eisenhower went so far as to use America &apos;s clout within the IMF to force Eden to withdraw British troops from Egypt in exchange for the loan . 
The reality of the 1976 bailout is even more complicated . 
In the aftermath of the crisis , Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey revealed that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement had been grossly overestimated in the 1970 &quot; s , and that , had he had the right figures , the UK would never have needed a loan . 
According to him , the Treasury even failed to recognize that the UK would have a tax surplus . 
Of course , all of this had drastic implications for the economy . 
Tony Benn , a Labour cabinet minister in the 1970 &quot; s , later revealed that the &quot; winter of discontent , &quot; which ushered in a Tory government at the end of the decade , had been caused by the severe cuts in public expenditure demanded by the IMF : &quot; Why did we have the winter of discontent ? 
Because in 1976 , the IMF said to the cabinet , &quot; You cut four billion pounds off your public expenditure or we will destroy the value of the pound sterling . &quot; &quot; 
There is little evidence for Rogoff &apos;s implicit assumption that investors &quot; decisions today are driven by the government &apos;s handling of its debt in the past . 
The number of defaults is largely irrelevant when it comes to a country like the UK , which is politically stable , carries significant economic weight , and has an independent central bank . 
Consider Germany , the &quot; biggest debt transgressor of the twentieth century , &quot; according to the economic historian Albrecht Ritschl . 
In the table on page 99 of their book This Time is Different , Rogoff and his co-author , Carmen Reinhart , show that Germany experienced eight debt defaults and / or restructurings from 1800 to 2008 . 
There were also the two defaults through inflation in 1920 and 1923 . 
And yet today Germany is Europe &apos;s economic hegemon , laying down the law to miscreants like Greece . 
The truth is that a country &apos;s past failures do not influence investors if its current institutions and economic policies are sound . 
That was clearly the case when Osborne and his colleagues opted for austerity .
