The Scaremongers of the Roundtable 
CHICAGO - How often do you see capitalists screaming and even going to court to defend the principle that legitimate owners cannot exercise any control over their property ? 
It is not happening in Latin America or in socialist Sweden , but in the United States of America . 
The capitalists in question are nothing short of the upper echelon of corporate America : the Business Roundtable , a powerful group composed of the CEOs of major US corporations , which promotes pro-business public policies . 
The object of their contention is the much-debated &quot; shareholders &quot; access to proxy &quot; rule , adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) in August to address the fundamental lack of accountability of corporate boards . 
In the current system , corporate boards are self-perpetuating entities . 
To be elected , a board member needs to be nominated by the current board , where executives have considerable influence . 
As a result , board members owe their loyalty to the managers who directly or indirectly appoint them - and thus have little incentive to dissent , lest they be punished with exclusion . 
Even independent directors , often acclaimed as the solution to all problems , are subject to the same pressure . 
To change this state of affairs , institutional investors must be allowed to propose their own slate of directors . 
The possibility of being rejected in a real election would naturally make board members accountable to shareholders , indirectly making the executives accountable as well . 
The SEC rule was an attempt to grant institutional investors this right . 
It did it in a very mild format . 
Companies with a public share worth less than $ 75 million were exempted , and shareholders who want to propose a slate must hold at least 3 % of voting power of the company &apos;s securities and have held it continuously for at least three years . 
This is a very high hurdle . 
In June 2009 , the largest US pension fund ( Calpers ) owned less than 0.3 % of large companies such as Coca Cola and Microsoft . 
Thus , one had to coordinate ten such funds to reach the quorum . 
And even that would not suffice . 
The average pension fund has an annual turnover of 70 % , which means that the probability that a stake is retained continuously for three years is less than 3 % . 
Thus , to achieve that 3 % of voting power and maintain it for three years continuously , one would have to assemble hundreds of institutions . 
But even this cautious attempt to strengthen accountability generated an irate reaction from the Business Roundtable . 
&quot; As our country works to emerge from this recession , &quot; its executive director wrote , &quot; American companies need to be focused on creating jobs and encouraging innovation to put us back on a path to sustained economic growth . 
This unprecedented intrusion into areas historically reserved for the states would handcuff directors and boards , shut out the vast majority of retail shareholders , and exacerbate the short-term focus that is now seen as one of the root causes of the financial crisis . &quot; 
Ironically , in 2007 , in response to an earlier SEC proposal to grant shareholders &quot; access to proxy , Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen ampamp ; 
Katz , a law firm famous for its anti-shareholders &quot; -rights positions , used the opposite argument : &quot; No real-world crisis has shown that the current system needs radical revision . 
Five years after Enron and WorldCom , the capital markets are well into a cycle of unprecedented vigor . &quot; 
In other words , if the stock market is doing well , we should not change the rules of the game that are credited for this success . 
But if the stock market is doing poorly , the rules of the games are not responsible and we cannot afford to change them . 
That is a peculiar notion of accountability . 
To block the rule , the Business Roundtable filed a petition with the US Court of Appeals to invalidate it . 
The rule had been out for review for years , but the Business Roundtable accused the SEC of having &quot; failed to engage in evidence-based rulemaking , &quot; because it did not assess the rule &apos;s effects on &quot; efficiency , competition , and capital formation , &quot; as required by law . 
This is just a pretense . 
A similar rule has been in place in Italy since 2005 , and there is no sign that efficiency , competition , or capital formation has been affected . 
There is some early sign , though , that board members nominated by institutional investors have the courage to stand up to management when it comes to excessive executive compensation . 
Is this the revolution that the Business Roundtable is afraid of ? 
Unfortunately , the scare tactics employed by the Business Roundtable worked . 
Following the suit , the SEC suspended not only the application of its rule mandating companies to grant access to qualified shareholders , but also a rule that was making it easier for shareholders to introduce a bylaw granting them access , even though the Business Roundtable had not challenged that rule . 
It is a great victory for business executives , but a huge defeat for the principles that should guide capitalism .
