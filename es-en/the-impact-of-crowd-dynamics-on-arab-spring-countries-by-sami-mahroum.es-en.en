The Arab Spring &apos;s Crowd Psychology 
ABU DHABI - In 1896 , the social psychologist Gustave Le Bon warned his contemporaries of the dangers of crowds , writing that , &quot; It is necessary to arrive at a solution to the problems offered by &#91; crowds &quot; &#93; psychology , or to resign ourselves to being devoured by them . &quot; 
As spontaneous protest overtakes organized political movements across the Arab world , the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt , and Libya &apos;s nascent democracies should heed Le Bon &apos;s warning . 
Since crowds took to the streets of Tunis , Cairo , Benghazi , and other Arab cities , toppling decades-old regimes , spectators and analysts have wondered where the Arab world is headed . 
But they have focused almost exclusively on the events &quot; political dimension : Who are the leaders , and what are their demands ? 
In fact , the persistence , intensity , and frequency of protests - exemplified in September , when local militia in Benghazi killed US Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens - demonstrate the role that the culture and psychology of crowds are playing in determining the Arab world &apos;s trajectory . 
After decades of authoritarian rule , citizens , frustrated with discredited institutions and paralyzed political parties , have begun to employ social media to organize civil resistance . 
As a result , countries affected by the Arab Spring now face political spheres that are shaped by crowd dynamics , rather than by genuine political or ideological movements . 
Indeed , much of what is happening in the Arab world today can be best understood through the study of crowds . 
Crowds are the opposite of organizations ; rather than being dominated by rigid hierarchies , they are often led by individuals with no formal rank . 
And , unlike political movements , crowds tend to form quickly and organically , like dark clouds gathering to form a storm , and their objectives are immediate : surround this police station , seize that ministry , etc . 
In &quot; crowd politics , &quot; emotions often supersede goals . 
Lebanon was perhaps the first Arab country to experience crowd politics . 
After Prime Minister Rafic Hariri was assassinated in February 2005 , crowds led by various political parties filled Martyrs &quot; Square in downtown Beirut . 
But non-organized crowds eventually eclipsed structured groups , becoming a dominant force in Lebanese politics . 
In fact , Lebanon &apos;s two competing political coalitions , the March 8 alliance and the March 14 alliance , take their names from major crowd gatherings that occurred on those dates in 2005 . 
Lebanon &apos;s experience reveals the discord between the psychology of crowds and the goals of the political elites who rally behind them - a conflict that can also be seen in Egypt &apos;s Tahrir Square , Tunisia &apos;s Sidi Bouzid , and Tripoli , Libya , where crowds have stormed the parliament building several times in the last few months . 
This discord is threatening to derail these countries &quot; burgeoning democratic processes , owing to growing competition between what Le Bon called the &quot; sovereignty of the crowds &quot; and the sovereignty of political elites . 
Under these conditions , the real challenge facing the Arab Spring countries , at least in the short term , is not ideological , but institutional . 
Governments must find a way to prevent small groups from using the crowd effect as political capital , thereby causing crowd sizes to become more decisive than the number of ballots cast . 
But traditional democratic institutions , such as political parties , parliaments , and consultation committees , are not experienced in coping with such challenges . 
Social media are both part of the problem and part of the solution . 
Unlike Eastern Europe in the late 1980 &quot; s and early 1990 &quot; s , the crowds of the Arab Spring formed on the Internet before hitting the streets - the first movement of its kind . 
The Arab Spring , following the lead of Iran &apos;s Green Movement in 2009 , ushered in the era of &quot; iCrowds &quot; - attracted , mobilized , and organized through social media . 
But social media can also be used effectively to demobilize people , by reducing the chasm between the psychology and power of political leadership and that of the masses . 
The emerging political class must improve its understanding of iCrowd politics , and learn to harness the power of tools like Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , blogs , apps , and text messages . 
In the United States , President Barack Obama &apos;s election campaigns recognized this opportunity , using social media extensively to communicate political messages , and to energize and mobilize supporters . 
Once in office , Obama launched the White House app , designed to give citizens a new way to connect with their leaders in Washington , including updates on the latest events , insight into administration initiatives , and access to high-resolution photos and live streams of White House events . 
Private enterprises , too , benefit from an understanding of iCrowd politics . 
In their research , Quy Huy and Andrew Shipilov of INSEAD have shown that business leaders who use social media build so-called &quot; emotional capital &quot; within their employees . 
This helps leaders to develop and maintain human bonds with a large group of people , despite the power gap , while making it easier for employees to identify with the organization . 
For the Arab world &apos;s new political elites , the lesson is clear : crowd dynamics cannot be ignored . 
When observed carefully , social media can be interpreted like clouds portending storms . 
If detected early enough , solutions can be found to diffuse tempestuous crowds before they inundate fragile new institutions .
