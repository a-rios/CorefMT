Light in Congo &apos;s Darkness ? 
NEW YORK - Perhaps no country on earth - not even Iraq , Afghanistan , or Sudan - has suffered more gravely from armed conflict in the past decade and a half than the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
Several million people have died either directly in armed struggle or from forced displacement and the resulting health consequences . 
The main causes of the fighting that has afflicted the DRC for so long have been competition for control of that impoverished country &apos;s vast natural resources and neighboring Rwanda &apos;s effort to wipe out what it sees as a potential threat posed by perpetrators of the 1994 genocide who took refuge in the DRC . 
Several other African states - Angola , Namibia , Uganda , and Zimbabwe - have also at times participated in armed combat within the DRC , either directly or through proxy militias . 
Suffering continues even in parts of the country where peace has been restored , manifested in the epidemic of sexual violence , much of it committed by former combatants , that has swept the country . 
In these dismal circumstances , a recent development has provided a rare ray of hope : the extraordinary mobilization of Congolese civil society in defense of the DRC &apos;s nascent democratic institutions . 
No fewer than 210 Congolese nongovernmental organizations , including those enjoying the widest recognition and respect across the country , recently joined in challenging President Joseph Kabila &apos;s attempt to take control of the National Assembly ( the lower house of Parliament ) that came into office after historic elections in 2006 . 
The episode that brought together Congolese civil society was Kabila &apos;s insistence in March on forcing the resignation of Vital Kamerhe , the Speaker of the National Assembly . 
Kamerhe had antagonized Kabila by criticizing his secret deal with President Paul Kagame of Rwanda that resulted in joint military operations earlier in the year against a Rwandan rebel force operating in the DRC . 
Kamerhe &apos;s supposed offense was diverging from the official party line , thereby weakening Kabila &apos;s standing with the Congolese public . 
What is most important about this episode is that it demonstrates the determination by groups representing a substantial share of Congolese society to pursue democratic development . 
The National Assembly plays a key role in attempting to improve governance in the country . 
It has had a crucial role in the effort to regularize the mining industry so that the DRC &apos;s mineral wealth may be used to improve living standards , rather than only to enrich local warlords and the foreign governments and corporate interests allied with them . 
The international community has a lot at stake in the Congo . 
Its rain forest , threatened by timber companies that have made deals with some of the militias , plays an important part in slowing global warming . 
Its copper , cobalt , tin , and coltan ( columbite-tantalite ) are essential for many industries . 
The United Nation peacekeeping force in the Congo , MONUC , is the UN &apos;s largest and most expensive intervention anywhere in the world . 
International humanitarian assistance groups are deeply engaged in the DRC , and it is a substantial recipient of international assistance . 
Above all , the Congo matters because of the continuing violence , wretched poverty , and misery of most of its nearly 70 million people . 
The attempt by Congolese civil society to foster democratic development may be the best thing that has happened in the country in a long time . 
It deserves the attention and support of all those who seek a better future for a vast country that has long endured plunder and misrule .
