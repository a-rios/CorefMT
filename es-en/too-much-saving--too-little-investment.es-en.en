Too Much Saving , Too Little Investment 
Talk abounds of a global savings glut . 
In fact , the world economy suffers not from too much saving , but from too little investment . 
To remedy this , we need two kinds of transitions . 
How well the world makes them will determine whether the strong global growth of the last few years will be sustainable . 
This is the central message of the IMF &apos;s World Economic Outlook , which will be released this week &#91; editors : on Wednesday , September 21st 2005 &#93; on the eve of the Fund &apos;s 2005 Annual Meeting . 
First , consumption has to give way smoothly to investment , as past excess capacity is worked off and as expansionary policies in industrial countries normalize . 
Second , to reduce the current account imbalances that have built up , demand has to shift from countries running deficits to countries running surpluses . 
Within this second transition , higher oil prices mean consumption by oil producers has to increase while that of oil consumers has to fall . 
The current situation has its roots in a series of crises over the last decade that were caused by excessive investment , particularly the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble , crises in emerging Asia and Latin America , and the collapse of the IT bubble in industrial countries . 
Investment has fallen off sharply since , and has since staged only a very cautious recovery . 
The policy response to the slowdown in investment differs across countries . 
In the industrial countries , expansionary budgets , coupled with low interest rates and elevated asset prices , has led to consumption- or credit-fueled growth , particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries . 
Government savings have fallen , especially in the United States and Japan , and household savings have virtually disappeared in some countries with housing booms . 
By contrast , the crises were a wake-up call in many emerging-market countries . 
Historically lax policies have become far less accommodative . 
Some countries have primary fiscal surpluses for the first time , and most emerging markets have brought down inflation through tight monetary policy . 
With corporations cautious about investing and governments prudent about expenditure - especially given the grandiose investments of the past - exports have led growth . 
Many emerging markets have run current-account surpluses for the first time . 
We should celebrate the implicit global policy coordination that enabled the world to weather the crises of recent years . 
However , the fact that rich countries are consuming more , and are being supplied and financed by emerging markets , is not a new world order ; it is a temporary and effective response to crises . 
Now it needs to be reversed . 
Indeed , it is misleading to term this situation a &quot; savings glut , &quot; for that would imply that countries running current-account surpluses should reduce domestic incentives to save . 
But if the problem is weak investment , then a reduction in such incentives will lead to excessively high real interest rates when the factors holding back investment dissipate . 
Policy , instead , should be targeted at withdrawing excessive stimulus to consumption and loosening the constraints that are holding back investment . 
There are reasons to worry whether the needed transitions will , in fact , occur smoothly . 
First , with asset prices like housing fueled by global liquidity , goods prices kept quiescent by excess capacity and global trade , and interest rates held down by muted investment , domestic and external imbalances have been easily financed . 
The traditional signals provided by inflation expectations , long-term interest rates , and exchange rates have not started flashing . 
Instead , bottlenecks are developing elsewhere , as in oil . 
It may well be that easy financing has given economies a longer leash . 
The worry , then , is that when the signals change - as they must - they will change abruptly , with attendant harsh consequences for growth . 
Alternatively , prices such as that of oil will have to move more in order to effect the most pressing transitions , creating new imbalances . 
Policymakers should not see higher oil prices as an aberration to be suppressed , but should focus on underlying causes . 
Second , more investment is needed , particularly in low-income countries , emerging markets , and oil producers ( though less in China , the exception that proves the rule ) . 
But the answer is not a low-quality investment binge led by government or fuelled by easy credit ; we know the consequences of that . 
Instead , product , labor , and financial markets must be reformed so that high-quality private-sector investment emerges . 
It is here that the good may have been the enemy of the perfect . 
Strong exports and decent government policies have enabled some countries to generate growth without the reforms that can create the right incentives for investment . 
These countries are overly dependent on demand elsewhere , which in turn is unsustainable . 
With the right reforms , adopted in concert , the world can make the needed transitions . 
But one of the risks associated with the large current-account imbalances we now face is that politicians may decide to blame one or another country and espouse protectionist policies . 
That could precipitate the very global economic downturn that we all want to avoid . 
If , instead , countries see the transitions as a shared responsibility , each country &apos;s policymakers may be able to guide the domestic debate away from the protectionism that might otherwise come naturally . 
Each country should focus on what it needs to do to achieve sustained long-term growth . 
In that possibility lies the well-being of us all .
