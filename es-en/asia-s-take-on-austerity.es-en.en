Asia &apos;s Take on Austerity 
NEW HAVEN - The austerity debate was the topic du jour at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum in Davos . 
With good reason . 
Europe is slipping back into recession just when recovery in the United States is finally getting some traction . 
That has undermined the case for fiscal consolidation , which is so heavily favored in Europe . 
Yet I took away a different conclusion from Davos . 
I moderated a session on &quot; The New Context in East Asia , &quot; addressed by a panel of senior representatives from Thailand , South Korea , Malaysia , Singapore , and Japan . 
With the exception of the Japanese participant , all had first-hand experience with the devastating Asian financial crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
I couldn &apos;t resist the temptation to draw Asia into the debate between Europe and the US . 
Rather than ask the Asian panelists to theorize about the impact of austerity in the overly indebted developed West , I asked them to assess their own experiences during and after the crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Frankly , I was surprised by what I heard . 
The panelists agreed on two points : first , they initially detested the wrenching adjustment programs dictated by the terms of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s so-called conditional bailouts ( the South Koreans still refer scornfully to the &quot; IMF crisis &quot; of the late 1990 &quot; s ) . 
Second - and here &apos;s where the surprise came - they all agreed that , with the benefit of hindsight , these excruciating adjustments were worth it , because their crisis-torn economies were forced to embrace structural reforms that paved the way for their spectacular economic performance today . 
On the surface , the numbers speak for themselves . 
In 1998 , during the depths of the Asian crisis , aggregate output in the so-called ASEAN-5 - Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Thailand , and Vietnam - plunged by 8.3 % . 
Real GDP in South Korea - long considered the darling of Asia &apos;s newly industrialized economies - contracted by 5.7 % that year . 
But then the tough conditionality of IMF bailouts and adjustment programs - Asia &apos;s own dose of austerity - kicked in . 
In response , current-account balances - the Achilles &quot; heel of the so-called East Asian growth miracle - went from deficit to surplus . 
For the ASEAN-5 , current-account deficits averaging 4 % of GDP in 1996-97 swung dramatically into average surpluses of 6.8 % of GDP in 1998-99 . 
A similar transformation occurred in South Korea , where a 2.8 % current-account deficit in 1996-1997 became an 8.6 % surplus in 1998-1999 . 
Since then , the region has never looked back . 
Within two years , most of Asia &apos;s crisis-ridden economies had regained their pre-crisis peaks . 
Nor was this a temporary rebound . 
Beginning in 1999 , the ASEAN-5 began a ten-year spurt of 5 % average annual GDP growth ( 5.5 % in South Korea over the same period ) . 
In short , there were no lasting negative effects from the short-term dose of austerity , and , to the extent that austerity was essential to post-crisis healing , the long-term benefits have proven to be both enduring and astounding . 
Three lessons for the rest of us come to mind . 
First , there is no gain without pain . 
Few of us in the developed world can fathom aggregate-output contractions on the scale that crisis-torn Asia suffered in 1998 , let alone muster the political will to impose them on our economies . 
The economic dislocations and the humiliation of proud nations were , indeed , devastating ( as Greeks today can attest ) . 
But , once the excesses were purged , Asia &apos;s post-crisis rebounds were both strong and sustainable . 
Second , currencies played an important role as an escape valve in the early days of Asia &apos;s post-crisis adjustment process . 
As the region moved from hard exchange-rate pegs to floating rates , Asian currencies plunged - with drops against the dollar ranging from 28 % in South Korea and roughly 37 % in Thailand , Malaysia , and the Philippines to almost 80 % in Indonesia . 
Finally , there is no substitute for restructuring . 
In Asia in the late 1990 &quot; s , measures aimed at the financial sector dominated IMF-imposed structural adjustment programs , but there were also programs that focused on tax and expenditure reforms , corporate governance , privatization , and business-debt restructuring . 
While not all of these programs were implemented in strict compliance with IMF conditionality , they played a key role in promoting significant improvements in Asian competiveness . 
None of these lessons should be lost on either Europe or the US . 
While individual countries obviously lack currency flexibility in a monetary union - one of Europe &apos;s most obvious and important differences from Asia in the late 1990 &quot; s - there is nothing to prevent a depreciation of the euro from boosting pan-regional competitiveness . 
The same , of course , is true of the US dollar . 
But no country - or group of countries , in Europe &apos;s case - has ever devalued its way back to prosperity . 
So Asia &apos;s structural lessons are equally important to the developed world . 
Indeed , Germany &apos;s economy is out-competing and out-growing the rest of Europe , largely owing to labor-market reforms and deregulation . 
The same medicine might prove equally beneficial to the rest of Europe - to say nothing of the US , which faces a major competitiveness challenge of its own . 
In the end , Asia &apos;s developing economies had no choice but to accept draconian measures as the price of bailouts in the late 1990 &quot; s . 
It remains to be seen if rich developed countries are willing to take the same route . 
Two decades ago , in their book Changing Fortunes , Paul Volcker and Toyo Gyohten underscored the glaring double standard of crisis resolution : &quot; When the &#91; International Monetary &#93; Fund consults with a poor and weak country , the country gets in line . 
When it consults with a strong country , the Fund gets in line . &quot; 
Perhaps that is the key lesson from the Asian crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s : austerity can work . 
But its success or failure ultimately boils down to power politics - namely , a resolution of the tension between short-term palliatives and the commitment to a long-term strategy . 
That &apos;s where the battle still rages in the West .
