Where are the Islamists ? 
NEW YORK - Sometime in the 1980 &quot; s , when the communist regime in Poland was facing serious challenges from disaffected masses , the regime &apos;s official spokesman , Jerzy Urban , remarked to a foreign journalist that there were only two choices in Poland : communism or domination by the Catholic Church . 
&quot; It &apos;s either us , &quot; he said , &quot; or the Black Madonna of Czestochowa . &quot; 
Similar warnings have been repeated over and over by oppressive rulers in the Middle East , not least by Egypt &apos;s Hosni Mubarak : either the secular police state or the Islamists ; either Mubarak or the Muslim Brotherhood . 
This message was persuasive enough for Western governments , especially the United States , to continue to lavish money and arms on Mubarak and other Arab &quot; allies . &quot; 
For those who advocate the spread of democracy in the world , this has posed an awkward dilemma . 
Islam , many say , is a threat to democracy . 
The West is said to be &quot; at war with Islam , &quot; to quote the Somali-born activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali . 
This was French policy after the Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) won the first round of elections in Algeria in December 1991 . 
France supported a military coup the following year . 
It was also the policy of the US after Hamas won the Palestinian elections in 2006 . 
Hamas was not recognized . 
The US has supported police states in Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Central Asia , because the alternative is thought to be worse . 
From this hard choice arises another dilemma . 
Violent crackdowns rarely result in moderation . 
The greater the repression that religious parties face in secular police states , the more extreme their politics are likely to become . 
Whatever drives the extremism of Osama bin Laden , he would not have found so many willing recruits for his acts of mass murder if the regimes in Egypt , Saudi Arabia , or Algeria had been less oppressive and corrupt . 
Religious politics , or politics based on religious faith , are not invariably violent , even in the Islamic world . 
Urban &apos;s dictum contained a kernel of truth : the Catholic Church played a major role in the rebellion against communism . 
The same is true of Buddhists in Burma , who oppose the military junta . 
Religious organizations can mobilize people in opposition to corrupt , oppressive rulers . 
Most rebellions , after all , are moral as well as political . 
True , once religious institutions take over political power , they are never democratic . 
They cannot be , because religious authority demands obedience to divine power , which by definition is not open to rational challenge . 
When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his followers hijacked the Iranian revolution in 1979 , democracy became impossible ; the cleric had become a dictator . 
But this does not mean that political parties whose programs are based on religious faith cannot be democratic . 
Christian Democrats pose no danger to democracies in Europe . 
Turkey &apos;s Justice and Development Party , founded by Islamist reformers , is not undemocratic , either ( the question is whether it is liberal ) . 
Indeed , one of the most interesting features of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt - and possibly the most consequential as well - is the very minor role played by Islamists . 
In Tunisia , the banned Islamist party Ennahdha ( Renaissance ) was absent . 
In Egypt , the Muslim Brotherhood , also banned but still a major force in terms of public support , has stayed very much in the background . 
There is no figure in either country comparable to Khomeini . 
There has been no violent jihadist rhetoric . 
What appears to have driven so many people into the streets is a common sense of economic frustration , disgust with official corruption , and humiliation at being oppressed . 
These feelings can inspire religious faith , or even horrific violence perpetrated in the name of faith . 
Such an outcome remains possible , especially if the rebellions fail and more oppression follows . 
The Islamic Brotherhood in Egypt , despite being banned , is a formidable organization . 
There are good reasons to be worried about this , less because the Islamists are undemocratic than because of their illiberal tendencies . 
Some forms of authoritarian government can leave a certain amount of room for economic and other freedoms , and thus might be easier to live with than illiberal democratic populism . 
Egypt is not Iran or Algeria , so one should be careful about drawing parallels . 
The Algerian military coup in 1992 crushed the Islamists , many of whom , admittedly , were neither liberal , nor necessarily committed to democracy . 
So far , the crowds in Cairo , Alexandria , and Suez have been neither violent , nor inflamed by religious fervor . 
Serious fighting only broke out after supporters of Mubarak began to attack the crowds . 
What will happen is still impossible to predict . 
Perhaps the Muslim Brotherhood would win a general election . 
Egyptians should be allowed to make that choice . 
Denying them that freedom would almost certainly make things worse , possibly leading to precisely the kind of religious extremism that many people rightly fear .
