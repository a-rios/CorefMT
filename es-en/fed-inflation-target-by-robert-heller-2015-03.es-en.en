The Fed Versus Price Stability 
SAN FRANCISCO - There is a big difference between the Federal Reserve &apos;s mandate to maintain &quot; stable prices &quot; - as enunciated in the Federal Reserve Act - and the Fed &apos;s self-selected target of 2 % annual inflation . 
So how is it that policymakers have managed to substitute the latter for the former ? 
The term &quot; stable prices &quot; is self-explanatory : a bundle of goods will cost the same ten , 50 , or even 100 years from now . 
By contrast , if a country experiences 2 % inflation over a ten-year period , the same items that $ 100 can buy today will cost $ 122 at the end of the decade . 
After 100 years , the price tag will be a whopping $ 724 . 
In her recent Congressional testimony , Fed Chair Janet Yellen referred several times to the mandate of maintaining &quot; stable prices &quot; ; but she mentioned the Fed &apos;s 2 % inflation objective twice as often . 
&quot; US inflation continues to run below the Committee &apos;s 2 % objective , &quot; she said , and the current &quot; high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2 % over the medium term . &quot; 
Does the Fed really want to increase annual inflation to 2 % , such that the price level of the country will increase by more than 700 % over the next century ? 
Is that what Congress had in mind when it tasked the Fed with achieving &quot; stable prices &quot; ? 
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan knew that it did not . 
On July 2 , 1996 , at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , which was devoted to extensive discussion of the appropriate inflation target for the Fed , Greenspan posed a simple question : &quot; Are we talking about price stability or are we talking about zero inflation ? &quot; he asked . 
The discussion quickly turned to the difficulty of measuring inflation accurately and the need to build in a &quot; safety cushion &quot; to avoid deflation . 
According to Greenspan , &quot; Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business and household decisions . &quot; 
Yellen , then a Fed governor , was not satisfied : &quot; Could you please put a number on that ? &quot; she asked . 
Greenspan did : &quot; I would say that number is zero , if inflation is properly measured , &quot; he replied . 
At the time of that FOMC meeting , the consumer price index was increasing at about 3 % per year . 
Most of the discussion focused on whether the Fed should slow annual price growth to 2 % or even lower , thereby consolidating the gains made in the difficult fight against inflation that policymakers had waged for the previous 15 years . 
Greenspan summarized the consensus : ... &quot; we have now all agreed on 2 % ... &quot; 
Thus , the Fed &apos;s 2 % inflation objective was born . 
During the ensuing discussion , several FOMC members argued that the inflation rate might be reduced to less than 2 % , but nobody argued that inflation should be pushed higher if a lower , but still positive , rate was achieved . 
Following the discussion , Greenspan exhorted the FOMC members to keep the discussion of the inflation target secret . 
&quot; I will tell you that if the 2 % inflation figure gets out of this room , &quot; he warned , &quot; it is going to create more problems for us than I think any of you might anticipate . &quot; 
The official minutes of the meeting make no reference to the entire discussion of the inflation target , which took up several hours , and the FOMC never formally announced its 2 % target for annual inflation until Chairman Ben Bernanke , Yellen &apos;s predecessor , finally did so in 2012 . 
The 2 % inflation target now is at the forefront of FOMC decision-making . 
For example , while annual inflation stood at 0.8 % in December 2014 , the minutes of the January 2015 FOMC meeting refer several times to the Committee &apos;s need to make &quot; progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 % inflation &quot; by maintaining a highly accommodative policy stance . 
Increasing the rate of inflation is now the stated objective of Fed policy . 
Congress did not give the Fed a mandate to pursue that goal . 
The Federal Reserve Act is explicit : the Fed should achieve &quot; price stability &quot; for the US currency , along with moderate interest rates and maximum employment . 
As long as inflation is somewhere between zero and 2 % , the Fed should declare victory and leave it at that .
