What Can Save the Euro ? 
NEW YORK - Just when it seemed that things couldn &apos;t get worse , it appears that they have . 
Even some of the ostensibly &quot; responsible &quot; members of the eurozone are facing higher interest rates . 
Economists on both sides of the Atlantic are now discussing not just whether the euro will survive , but how to ensure that its demise causes the least turmoil possible . 
It is increasingly evident that Europe &apos;s political leaders , for all their commitment to the euro &apos;s survival , do not have a good grasp of what is required to make the single currency work . 
The prevailing view when the euro was established was that all that was required was fiscal discipline - no country &apos;s fiscal deficit or public debt , relative to GDP , should be too large . 
But Ireland and Spain had budget surpluses and low debt before the crisis , which quickly turned into large deficits and high debt . 
So now European leaders say that it is the current-account deficits of the eurozone &apos;s member countries that must be kept in check . 
In that case , it seems curious that , as the crisis continues , the safe haven for global investors is the United States , which has had an enormous current-account deficit for years . 
So , how will the European Union distinguish between &quot; good &quot; current-account deficits - a government creates a favorable business climate , generating inflows of foreign direct investment - and &quot; bad &quot; current-account deficits ? 
Preventing bad current-account deficits would require far greater intervention in the private sector than the neoliberal and single-market doctrines that were fashionable at the euro &apos;s founding would imply . 
In Spain , for example , money flowed into the private sector from private banks . 
Should such irrational exuberance force the government , willy-nilly , to curtail public investment ? 
Does this mean that government must decide which capital flows - say into real-estate investment , for example - are bad , and so must be taxed or otherwise curbed ? 
To me , this makes sense , but such policies should be anathema to the EU &apos;s free-market advocates . 
The quest for a clear , simple answer recalls the discussions that have followed financial crises around the world . 
After each crisis , an explanation emerges , which the next crisis shows to be wrong , or at least inadequate . 
The 1980 &quot; s Latin American crisis was caused by excessive borrowing ; but that could not explain Mexico &apos;s 1994 crisis , so it was attributed to under-saving . 
Then came East Asia , which had high savings rates , so the new explanation was &quot; governance . &quot; 
But this , too , made little sense , given that the Scandinavian countries - which have the most transparent governance in the world - had suffered a crisis a few years earlier . 
There is , interestingly , a common thread running through all of these cases , as well as the 2008 crisis : financial sectors behaved badly and failed to assess creditworthiness and manage risk as they were supposed to do . 
These problems will occur with or without the euro . 
But the euro has made it more difficult for governments to respond . 
And the problem is not just that the euro took away two key tools for adjustment - the interest rate and the exchange rate - and put nothing in their place , or that the European Central Bank &apos;s mandate is to focus on inflation , whereas today &apos;s challenges are unemployment , growth , and financial stability . 
Without a common fiscal authority , the single market opened the way to tax competition - a race to the bottom to attract investment and boost output that could be freely sold throughout the EU . 
Moreover , free labor mobility means that individuals can choose whether to pay their parents &quot; debts : young Irish can simply escape repaying the foolish bank-bailout obligations assumed by their government by leaving the country . 
Of course , migration is supposed to be good , as it reallocates labor to where its return is highest . 
But this kind of migration actually undermines productivity . 
Migration is , of course , part of the adjustment mechanism that makes America work as a single market with a single currency . 
Even more important is the federal government &apos;s role in helping states that face , say , high unemployment , by allocating additional tax revenue to them - the so-called &quot; transfer union &quot; so loathed by many Germans . 
But the US is also willing to accept the depopulation of entire states that cannot compete . 
( Some point out that this means that America &apos;s corporations can buy senators from such states at a lower price . ) 
But are European countries with lagging productivity willing to accept depopulation ? 
Alternatively , are they willing to face the pain of &quot; internal &quot; devaluation , a process that failed under the gold standard and is failing under the euro ? 
Even if those from Europe &apos;s northern countries are right in claiming that the euro would work if effective discipline could be imposed on others ( I think they are wrong ) , they are deluding themselves with a morality play . 
It is fine to blame their southern compatriots for fiscal profligacy , or , in the case of Spain and Ireland , for letting free markets have free reign , without seeing where that would lead . 
But that doesn &apos;t address today &apos;s problem : huge debts , whether a result of private or public miscalculations , must be managed within the euro framework . 
Public-sector cutbacks today do not solve the problem of yesterday &apos;s profligacy ; they simply push economies into deeper recessions . 
Europe &apos;s leaders know this . 
They know that growth is needed . 
But , rather than deal with today &apos;s problems and find a formula for growth , they prefer to deliver homilies about what some previous government should have done.This may be satisfying for the sermonizer , but it won &apos;t solve Europe &apos;s problems - and it won &apos;t save the euro .
