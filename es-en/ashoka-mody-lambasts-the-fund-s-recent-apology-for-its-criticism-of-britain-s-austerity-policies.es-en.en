The IMF &apos;s False Confession 
PRINCETON - &quot; Do I have to go on my knees ? &quot; the International Monetary Fund &apos;s managing director , Christine Lagarde , asked the BBC &apos;s Andrew Marr . 
Lagarde was apologizing for the IMF &apos;s poor forecasting of the United Kingdom &apos;s recent economic performance , and , more seriously , for the Fund &apos;s longer-standing criticism of the fiscal austerity pursued by Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government . 
Now endorsing British austerity , Lagarde said that it had increased confidence in the UK &apos;s economic prospects , thereby spurring the recent recovery . 
Lagarde &apos;s apology was unprecedented , courageous , and wrong . 
By issuing it , the IMF compromised on an economic principle that enjoys overwhelming academic support : The confidence &quot; fairy &quot; does not exist . 
And , by bowing to the UK &apos;s pressure , the Fund undermined its only real asset - its independence . 
The IMF has dodged responsibility for far more serious forecasting errors , including its failure to anticipate every major crisis of the last generation , from Mexico in 1994-1995 to the near-collapse of the global financial system in 2008 . 
Indeed , in the 6-12 months prior to every crisis , the IMF &apos;s forecasts implied business as usual . 
Some claim that the Fund counsels countries in private , lest public warnings trigger the very crisis that is to be avoided . 
But , with the possible exception of Thailand in 1997 , the IMF &apos;s long-time resident historian , James Boughton , finds little evidence for that view in internal documents . 
The IMF &apos;s Internal Evaluation Office is more directly scathing in its assessment of the Fund &apos;s obliviousness to the US subprime crisis as it emerged . 
Given that the IMF is the world &apos;s anointed guardian of financial stability , its failure to warn and preempt constitutes a far more grievous lapse than its position on British austerity , with huge costs borne by many , especially the most vulnerable . 
For these failures , the Fund has never offered any apology , certainly not in the abject manner of Lagarde &apos;s recent statement . 
The Fund does well to reflect on its errors . 
In a September 2003 speech in Kuala Lumpur , then-Managing Director Horst Köhler conceded that temporary capital controls can provide relief against volatile inflows from the rest of the world . 
Among the countries hurt by that crisis , Malaysia chose not to ask for the Fund &apos;s help and emerged at least as well as others that did seek IMF assistance . 
Malaysia &apos;s imposition of capital controls was a controversial policy decision . 
And even as the Fund opposed them , prominent economists - among them Paul Krugman - endorsed their use . 
In his speech , Köhler reported that the Fund had taken the evidence on board and would incorporate it in its future advice . 
But in the current crisis , the academic evidence has overwhelmingly shown that fiscal austerity does what textbook economics says it will do : the more severe the austerity , the greater the drag on growth . 
A variety of studies confirming this proposition , including one by the IMF &apos;s chief economist , Olivier Blanchard , have withstood considerable scrutiny and leave little room for ambiguity . 
The two public voices arguing for the magical properties of austerity are official agencies based in Europe : the OECD and the European Commission . 
The Commission &apos;s stance , in particular , is animated by an institutional commitment to a fiscal viewpoint that leaves no room for evidence . 
Among the G-7 economies , only Italy has done worse than the UK since the Great Recession began . 
Indeed , the UK &apos;s GDP has only just regained its 2008 level , lagging behind even France . 
This is all the more remarkable given that the crisis in the UK was comparatively mild . 
The fall in property prices was modest relative to Ireland and Spain , and , because there was no construction boom , there was no construction bust . 
Having missed the warning signs about the bank Northern Rock , which needed to be bailed out by the UK government after a run on its deposits in September 2007 , the British authorities , unlike their eurozone counterparts , quickly dealt with the economy &apos;s distressed banks . 
For these reasons , the UK should have had a quick recovery ; instead , the Cameron government &apos;s gratuitous austerity stifled it . 
The IMF &apos;s apology was a mistake for two reasons . 
Thumbing one &apos;s nose at scholarly evidence is always a bad idea , but it is especially damaging to an institution that relies so heavily on the credibility of its technical competence and neutrality . 
If the Fund embraces muddled economics , on what basis will it defend its policy advice ? 
Moreover , in choosing to flatter the UK &apos;s misguided policy , the Fund has confirmed its deference to its major shareholders . 
For years , the view has been that the IMF is a foreign-policy instrument of the United States . 
But in taking this latest step , the Fund has undermined - perhaps fatally - its ability to speak &quot; truth to power . &quot; 
If so , a fundamental question may well become unavoidable : Why does the IMF exist , and for whom ?
