How Far Will the Euro Fall ? 
LONDON - The US dollar is hitting new 12-year highs almost daily , while the euro seems to be plunging inexorably to below dollar parity . 
Currency movements are often described as the most unpredictable of all financial variables ; but recent events in foreign-exchange markets seem , for once , to have a fairly obvious explanation - one that almost all economists and policymakers accept and endorse . 
French President Fran√ßois Hollande , for one , has ecstatically welcomed the plunging euro : &quot; It makes things nice and clear : one euro equals a dollar , &quot; he told an audience of industrialists . 
But it is when things seem &quot; nice and clear &quot; that investors should question conventional wisdom . 
A strong dollar and a weak euro is certainly the most popular bet of 2015 . 
So is there a chance that the exchange-rate trend may already be overshooting ? 
In one sense , the conventional explanation of the recent euro-dollar movement is surely right . 
The main driving force clearly has been monetary divergence , with the Federal Reserve tightening policy and the European Central Bank maintaining rock-bottom interest rates and launching quantitative easing . 
But how much of this divergence is already priced in ? 
The answer depends on how many people either are unaware of the interest-rate spread or do not believe that it will widen very far . 
Last year , many investors questioned the ECB &apos;s ability to launch a bond-buying program in the face of German opposition , and many others doubted the Fed &apos;s willingness to tighten monetary policy , because doing so could choke off the US economic recovery . 
That is why the euro was still worth almost $ 1.40 a year ago - and why I and others expected the euro to fall a long way against the dollar . 
But the scope for dollar-bullish or euro-bearish surprises is much narrower today . 
Does anyone still believe that the US economy is on the brink of recession ? 
Or that the Bundesbank has the power to overrule ECB President Mario Draghi &apos;s policy decisions ? 
With so much of the monetary divergence now discounted , perhaps we should focus more attention on the other factors that could influence currency movements in the months ahead . 
On the side of a stronger dollar and weaker euro , there seem to be three possibilities . 
One is that the Fed could raise interest rates substantially faster than expected . 
Another is that investors and corporate treasurers could become increasingly confident and aggressive in borrowing euros to convert into dollars and take advantage of higher US rates . 
These are all plausible scenarios . 
First , there is the effect of the strong dollar itself on the US economy and its monetary policy . 
If the dollar continues to rise , US economic activity and inflation will weaken . 
In that case , the Fed , instead of raising interest rates faster than expected , will probably become more dovish . 
Second , there must be serious doubts about whether Asian and Middle Eastern governments will in fact want to shift more reserves into dollars , especially if this means converting the euros they have acquired since 2003 at a loss and far below their purchasing power parity . 
Many countries have spent decades diversifying their wealth away from dollars , for both financial and geopolitical reasons . 
With the US increasingly prone to using its currency as an instrument of diplomacy , even of warfare - a process known in Washington as &quot; weaponizing the dollar &quot; - China , Russia , and Saudi Arabia , for example , may well be reluctant to shift even more of their wealth into US Treasury bonds . 
A third factor suggesting that the euro &apos;s downward trend against the dollar may not last much longer is the trade imbalance between the US and Europe . 
The gap is already wide - the International Monetary Fund forecasts a $ 484 billion deficit this year for the US , versus a $ 262 billion surplus for the eurozone - and is almost certain to widen much further , owing to the euro &apos;s 20 % depreciation since the IMF released its estimate last autumn . 
The implication is that hundreds of billions of dollars of capital will have to flow annually to the US from Europe just to maintain the present euro-dollar exchange rate . 
And as the transatlantic trade imbalance widens further , ever larger capital flows will be needed to keep pushing the euro down . 
Such huge capital flows are entirely possible , but what will drive them ? 
That question leads to the final and most important reason for expecting the euro &apos;s decline to reverse or at least stabilize . 
While higher US interest rates will attract some investors , others will move away from the dollar if the combination of a more competitive euro , the ECB &apos;s enormous monetary stimulus , and an easing of fiscal pressures in France , Italy , and Spain generates a genuine economic recovery in Europe . 
The resulting flows of global capital into European shares , property , and direct investment - all of which are now substantially cheaper than corresponding US assets - could easily outweigh the cash and bond investments attracted by rising US interest rates . 
What , then , can strike a balance between the opposing forces operating on the euro-dollar exchange rate ? 
No one can say for sure , but one thing is certain : Whereas the profits from playing transatlantic interest-rate differentials may run to 1 % or 2 % per year , investors can easily lose that amount in a single day - or even an hour - by buying the wrong currency when the trend turns . 
As we know from decades of Japanese and Swiss experience , selling a low-interest-rate currency simply to chase higher US yields is often a costly mistake .
