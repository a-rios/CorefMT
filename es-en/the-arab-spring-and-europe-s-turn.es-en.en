The Arab Spring and Europe &apos;s Turn 
NEW HAVEN - Until now , and with few exceptions , the West has nurtured two distinct communities of foreign-policy specialists : the development community and the democratic community . 
More often than not , they have had little or no connection with one another : development specialists dealt comfortably with dictatorships and democracies alike , believing that prosperity can best be created by concentrating exclusively on economic issues and institutions . 
The consequences of this approach have a special resonance in the Arab world today . 
Brazil has barely uttered a word in reaction to the region &apos;s tumult , while Russia and China have little taste for sanctions against Libya in light of their own autocratic governments . 
All of this adds up to a unique opportunity for the European Union to support its neighbors &quot; transition from revolutionary upheaval to democratic government . 
At the same time , we need to promote the progress of other regimes in the region toward inclusive democracy . 
Indeed , the EU is their natural partner in this endeavor . 
Since the launch of the Barcelona Process in 1995 , EU Mediterranean policy has been criticized for not linking financial aid to democratic reform , and for giving priority to European concerns like immigration , security , and cooperation on counter-terrorism . 
At the same time , EU policy has sidelined clear southern priorities , like opening up Europe &apos;s agriculture and textile markets . 
The result is that the vision of the official Euro-Mediterranean Policy ( EMP ) has lagged far behind its original goals . 
Europe should shift its focus on immigration and security back to policies that reflect the original objectives of the Barcelona Declaration . 
The EMP &apos;s central goals were to advance a &quot; comprehensive partnership &quot; and political reform , and to create &quot; a common area of peace and stability , &quot; together with a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area . 
Moreover , the associated MEDA funding mechanism crucially and specifically included the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights . 
This link between security , democracy , and human development has since been broken and needs to be restored through investment in good governance , regional development , and education . 
The EMP evolved in 2004 into the European Neighborhood Policy framework , and in 2007 , the European Neighborhood Policy Instrument ( ENPI ) replaced MEDA as the EU &apos;s main financing mechanism for Euro-Mediterranean policy . 
Although good governance and human rights remained among the ENP &apos;s proclaimed goals , official communications of the European Commission show that it emphasized security and border control . 
When the EMP was &quot; re-launched &quot; in 2008 under the newly established Union for the Mediterranean ( UfM ) to give it greater political emphasis , the result was an exercise in &quot; realism &quot; that further weakened the original EMP . 
And , for all its high-flown language , the UfM is an empty shell . 
But the initiative also failed to gain momentum among political leaders . 
Education remains a key area where the EU should contribute to the development of the southern neighborhood , if only because young people are a growing majority of the Arab population . 
Although many Arab states have been opening new schools and universities , and are allowing more private educational institutions to flourish , the quality of education in the region still leaves much to be desired . 
Religion remains a compulsory subject throughout university programs , while inquisitiveness , critical thinking , and objective analysis are all widely discouraged . 
As the Jordanian intellectual and former foreign minister Marwan al-Muasher has argued , state and religious interpretations of history , science , and political values are hammered into Arab students . 
Wilfried Martens , President of the European People &apos;s Party ( EPP ) in the European Parliament and former Prime Minister of Belgium , recently made a similar point : &quot; The West is not at war with Islam . 
Christianity is not at war with Islam . 
All three , however , are incompatible with a certain interpretation which claims that the scripture is the basis upon which to build a state . &quot; 
Of the Arab countries receiving ENP funds , only Egypt has channeled a high proportion - nearly 50 % - toward education . 
In any case , Europe &apos;s spending on education in the region is scattered among inter-regional , national , and thematic programs , which makes it difficult to see how these funds &quot; effectiveness might be measured . 
Europe now faces key decisions that concern both its values and its interests in the Arab world , and the reconciliation of its short- and long-term objectives . 
Infrastructural investment and economic reform are crucial for the Mediterranean region &apos;s future development , but they cannot transform the region without a parallel emphasis on democracy , the rule of law , human rights , and education . 
To advance both objectives , the EU must link its investment and aid programs to concrete progress on democratization , and press for much greater accountability and improvement in reforming educational systems throughout the region .
