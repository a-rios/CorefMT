It &apos;s Time to Ban the Bomb 
STOCKHOLM - The nuclear agreement between Iran , the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany , and the EU , comes at a historically propitious moment . 
Seventy years ago next month , the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki opened the darkest chapter in the long history of humanity &apos;s wartime horrors . 
Fire , bullets , and bayonets were now joined by nuclear radiation - a silent , invisible killer like gas and biological agents . 
After World War I , the international community adopted the so-called Gas Protocol , to prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons . 
Likewise , the demand to ban any use of nuclear weapons has been strong and persistent since the end of World War II . 
But the states possessing nuclear weapons have always opposed such a ban , arguing that it would not be credible . 
Instead , they have recommended a step-by-step approach , eventually leading to a ban on the possession and production of nuclear weapons . 
After all , the same approach brought about today &apos;s strict limits on biological and chemical weapons . 
Yet 70 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the gradualist approach has clearly failed . 
During the Cold War , the total number of nuclear weapons worldwide climbed to more than 50,000 . 
Many , including hydrogen bombs , had explosive yields that were orders of magnitude higher than the bombs dropped on Japan . 
Some measures were agreed to reduce the nuclear danger : bilateral arms-control agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union , restrictions on the testing of new weapons , and - above all - the Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
The aim of the NPT , signed in 1968 , is the universal elimination of nuclear weapons : non-nuclear-weapon states commit not to acquire them , and the five states that officially possess them ( the US , the United Kingdom , France , China , and Russia ) commit to disarmament negotiations . 
But the overall threat has never diminished much . 
To be sure , the first part of the NPT has had some success : Since the treaty entered into force , only four states - India , Israel , North Korea , and Pakistan - have developed nuclear weapons . 
South Africa eliminated its nuclear weapons and became a party to the NPT , while Ukraine , Belarus , and Kazakhstan transferred their nuclear arsenals to Russia . 
Two states - Iraq and Libya - were stopped from developing nuclear weapons , and now Iran , a party to the treaty , has committed to abide by important restrictions on its nuclear program . 
And yet the commitment of the five nuclear-weapon states to disarm has had very limited results . 
Nuclear stockpiles were reduced - mainly for economic reasons - following the Cold War , to less than 20,000 nuclear weapons worldwide ( still enough to destroy humanity several times over ) . 
And the 2010 New START agreement brought welcome upper limits to the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the US and Russia . 
But no serious disarmament negotiations have been pursued since . 
Moreover , it was once hoped that NATO &apos;s small number of non-strategic nuclear weapons sited in Europe could be withdrawn to the US , as they were widely considered militarily useless . 
Doing so , it was suggested , could lead Russia to remove its own tactical nuclear weapons . 
Neither action has been taken . 
Likewise , the hope that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , adopted in 1996 , would become binding has not been realized . 
A moratorium on such tests exists , and an impressive monitoring machinery has been created , able to register not only weapons tests , but also earthquakes and tsunamis . 
Yet , because eight countries , including the US and China , have failed to ratify it , the CTBT occupies a legal netherworld : it may be said to be in operation , but not in force . 
Rather than nuclear disarmament , the world is witnessing an upgrading - and , in some cases , expansion - of nuclear arsenals . 
There is little hope of any change for the better unless the Security Council &apos;s permanent members conclude that their own security requires resuming d√©tente among themselves and launching serious disarmament negotiations , as promised . 
They have shown their willingness to act to restrain other states from acquiring weapons of mass destruction ; now it is time for them to restrain themselves . 
Of course , just as some states refuse to join the conventions that ban cluster bombs and landmines , the nuclear-weapon states will not join a convention banning their arsenals . 
Yet the existence of such a treaty could serve as a constant reminder of what is expected of them . 
For that reason alone , it should become an international priority . 
During the Cold War , many people feared that mankind might commit suicide abruptly , by waging a nuclear war . 
Today , more people may worry that humanity will suffer a more prolonged death through global warming . 
But the nuclear peril is still there , and groups like Global Zero deserve our support in their efforts to raise public awareness . 
It has been said that Hiroshima and Nagasaki created a taboo against any further use of nuclear weapons . 
Let us hope so , but let us also demand that the taboo be made legally binding .
