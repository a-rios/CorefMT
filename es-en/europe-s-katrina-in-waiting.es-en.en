Europe &apos;s Katrina-in-Waiting 
As Europeans watched President Bush stumble over the death , destruction , and chaos wrought by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , some could not help patting themselves on the back and saying , &quot; Thank God for our social solidarity . &quot; 
True , no European country worth its salt would ever allow its citizens to fall into such dire poverty that they literally could not escape from their homes in the face of a natural disaster . 
But this concern and sensibility is a little too self-congratulatory , for it allows Europeans to gloss over the very real problems they now have with their own vaunted social solidarity . 
For one thing , while Europe &apos;s doctrine of social solidarity preaches fairness and equality , it masks an &quot; insiders &quot; society &quot; that is spectacularly unjust at the upper end of the income spectrum . 
Welfare-state elites typically get the best doctors , the best concert seats , the best flats in the best neighborhoods , and so on , because of Europe &apos;s stubborn refusal to use prices and the market mechanism to allocate key goods and services . 
Outsiders find it difficult to compete when &quot; who gets what &quot; depends on knowing the right people . 
Surprisingly , the treatment of elites in Europe may not be all that different from America . 
America favors its elites by giving them tax cuts . 
Europe favors them by bumping them to the head of waiting lists and giving tax breaks to capital . 
Second , while the shame of New Orleans could never happen in Europe , European social solidarity nonetheless is failing lower-income groups by not sufficiently delivering to them the benefits of economic growth . 
This is perhaps the welfare state &apos;s most glaring weakness . 
Though social solidarity and economic growth are by no means incompatible , Europeans - quite unwisely - have opted for an inefficient variety of the welfare state . 
&quot; The labor market is the key , &quot; says Bundesbank President Axel Weber , a Social Democrat recently appointed to his post by Gerhard Schroeder . 
&quot; In Europe we need to have more flexible labor markets and more structural reforms . &quot; 
But European social solidarity too often has pursued its objectives through economically costly direct interventions in labor markets rather than in more market-neutral ways . 
For example , in order to protect workers &quot; jobs , Europe &apos;s welfare state has made it difficult for firms to fire them . 
This means that the unemployed can &apos;t find jobs ( even though there is useful work for them to do ) , and that workers who have jobs will not move to potentially better ones . 
The inevitable result is persistent high unemployment and labor immobility . 
It doesn &apos;t have to be this way . 
Social redistribution can be effected through fiscal measures rather than by direct intervention in the labor market . 
That &apos;s how it was done in the early days of the welfare state . 
This version of the welfare state has proved devastating for Europe &apos;s employment and economic growth . 
Finally , while Europe &apos;s left may be boastfully proclaiming in Katrina &apos;s wake , &quot; Thank God for our social solidarity , &quot; there is considerable doubt even about what &quot; our &quot; actually means . 
The homogeneity of Europe &apos;s nation states is decreasing , with immigrants posing a growing challenge for social solidarity , while the European Union as a whole faces a similar dilemma : is a Dutchman in Amsterdam supposed to feel as much solidarity with a Greek in Athens as with a fellow Dutchman in Rotterdam ? 
Which brings us back to Katrina . 
A lot has been said and written in the wake of the disaster about how little Americans seem to care for one another . 
But is it really so different in Europe ? 
Will the Dutch enthusiastically finance public infrastructure in Greece ? 
Will Greeks fund water control projects in the Netherlands ? 
If one takes the EU as one &apos;s term of reference , social solidarity between member states would appear to be not that different from social solidarity between American states . 
No doubt , the United States has very real - and growing - problems with the fairness of its income distribution .
