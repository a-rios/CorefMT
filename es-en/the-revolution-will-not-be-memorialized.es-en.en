The Revolution Will Not Be Memorialized 
Forty years ago Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution . 
The Propaganda Department of China &apos;s ruling Communists have now issued an order banning any kind of reviews or commemoration of this disaster as part of the Party &apos;s bid to make the Chinese forget about that lost decade . 
But in condemning the Japanese for neglect of the Nanjing massacre during the Second World War , Chinese officials proclaim that forgetting the past betrays the people . 
But. for the Chinese , the Cultural Revolution was itself a betrayal , one that continues to this day . 
All the terrible events since then - the Tiananmen Square massacre , persecution of Falun Gong , and repression of civic activists - are the evil fruit of that un-cleansed original sin . 
The Cultural Revolution marked the climax of class extermination practiced by the Party during the 1960 &quot; s . 
The survivors of all the previous political movements , now enthralled by Mao &apos;s personality cult , were free of all constraint , able to kill and seek revenge with impunity . 
As Mao summed up this psychological state : &quot; Now is a time of upheaval , and I &apos;m just happy about the chaos . &quot; 
In his instruction called &quot; Regarding Biting Incidents , &quot; Mao asserted : &quot; So what ? 
Good people get to know each other by biting each other and it serves bad people right if they are bitten by good ones ... &quot; 
Friends of my generation invariably comment when I mention that I was born on August 18 : &quot; Hey , that was the anniversary of Chairman Mao first receiving the Red Guards . &quot; 
But the following months and years have been selectively forgotten , particularly by the Red Guards themselves . 
These are people who , like the Hitler Youth , turned over their bloody page of history and never looked back . 
According to Wang Youqin , author of Victims of the Cultural Revolution , after Mao received the Red Guards and instructed them in the &quot; militant fight , &quot; more than 1,700 people were beaten , drowned , or scalded to death . 
Another 100,000 were driven from their homes . 
Within months , an all-out movement , under the banner of &quot; revolutionize Chinese culture &quot; and dedicated to the aim of &quot; breaking away from old culture , old traditions , old thoughts , and old customs , &quot; was raging throughout the country . 
Those who had been born &quot; landlords , rich farmers , reactionaries , bad elements , and rightists &quot; were among the first to be victimized . 
Desperate to save their lives , families voluntarily smashed their properties and pulped their ancient paintings and calligraphy . 
Episodes of &quot; burning books and burying intellectuals alive &quot; had occurred before , but none was more radical than the destructive force unleashed by Mao . 
Soon , ancient sites would be ruined . 
Corpses of historic figures , such as Zhang Zhidong , a high-ranking official in the Qing Dynasty , were exhumed , with the decaying bodies left hanging in trees . 
Eventually , anybody - from the President to average citizens - could be criticized , labeled an &quot; ox-demon and snake-spirit , &quot; persecuted , and listed for death . 
People killed others to safeguard Mao , and those who were executed shouted &quot; Long Live Chairman Mao &quot; on their way to death . 
In Guangxi province , where some of the worst violence occurred , nearly 100,000 people were killed during July and August 1968 . 
In the official &quot; Memorabilia of the Cultural Revolution in Guangxi , &quot; many infants appear on the death list . 
The author Zheng Yi reported that in Wuxuan County alone , more than 100 people were eaten , because devouring enemies was the only way to prove one &apos;s love for Mao . 
Livers , eyes , or brains were removed while victims were still alive . 
Mao set off yet another wave of persecutions in 1968 . 
In countless &quot; suicides , &quot; many people were simply bitten to death , or took their own lives when the suffering became too much to bear . 
In Beijing , deaths occurred mostly in areas wuth trees and lakes . 
Wang Youqin reports that on November 4 , four bodies were found floating in the lake of the Summer Palace . 
A total of 63 people were killed at the prestigious Beijing University . 
Mao died aspiring to exterminate Chinese culture . 
His Cultural Revolution alone killed as many as two million people , shattered traditions , uprooted spiritual and ethical values , and tore apart family ties and communal loyalties . 
People who experienced it seal off the memory , for the pain , worse than a bullet to the heart , overwhelms souls . 
Worst of all , Mao &apos;s crimes against civilization , unlike those of , say , Hitler , are ongoing . 
The Communist Party still uses his brainwashing methods , and his legacy continues to be officially revered . 
His portrait and body remain on display in Beijing &apos;s Tiananmen Square , and his face appears on banknotes in the wallet of every Chinese , many of whom saw parents , children , and other loved ones die under his knife . 
The Chinese people , unsurprisingly , regard politics with a mixture of caution and dread . 
Public figures spend a lot of time and effort to avoid offending the Party , openly endorsing indifference as the foremost tool of survival . 
Last month , I watched a TV show featuring Han Meilin , a famous painter . 
In his closing remarks , he announced his words of wisdom to viewers : &quot; Long live those who don &apos;t care ! &quot; 
Han Meilin was badly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution . 
His declaration was greeted by a roar of applause from the studio audience .
