Why Talk to Iran ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - June 12 marks the first anniversary of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s disputed re-election as Iran &apos;s president . 
Despite the Iranian opposition &apos;s continuing efforts to contest the outcome and advance political liberalization , Ahmadinejad and his allies have largely succeeded in consolidating their hold on power by using brute force to repress the reform movement . 
Hopes that a popular uprising might topple the regime have fizzled . 
Meanwhile , the crisis over Iran &apos;s nuclear program is escalating . 
The Iranian regime continues to defy the international community &apos;s efforts to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons . 
In response , US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has been working through the United Nations Security Council to impose tougher economic sanctions . Nonetheless , Iran edges toward mastering the process of enriching uranium to weapons-grade purity . 
The closer Iran gets to developing a nuclear weapon , the greater the likelihood that Israel , with or without US help , might attack Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities . 
The Iranian government &apos;s intransigence , its blatant efforts to mislead nuclear inspectors , its odious calls for the destruction of Israel , its brutal repression of political opponents - all provide good reason for Obama to slam the door shut on dialogue . 
With diplomacy having failed to curb Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , critics of engagement charge , it is time to resort to coercion before Iran crosses the nuclear Rubicon . 
A rising chorus of voices now forswears engagement with Iran &apos;s rulers , insisting that it is time for the regime to go . 
But closing off dialogue with Iran would be a precipitous and dangerous mistake . 
As my new book , How Enemies Become Friends , confirms , even fierce adversaries can settle their differences through negotiation . 
For four compelling reasons , the US and its allies should keep the door open to dialogue until the eleventh hour . 
First , tighter sanctions make sense only as a diplomatic tool , not as a blunt instrument of coercion . 
The new sanctions simply are not severe enough to intimidate Iran into submission , and more restrictive ones would not pass muster within the Security Council . 
Accordingly , if tougher sanctions prove to be useful , they will do so by confronting Iran with a united diplomatic front , thereby encouraging its government to make a deal in order to end the country &apos;s isolation . 
New sanctions are warranted , but as a complement , not an alternative , to diplomacy . 
Second , the costs of abandoning diplomacy are so high that continued engagement makes sense even as Iran refuses to budge . 
To give up on diplomacy is to leave the international community with two ugly options : living with a nuclear Iran or carrying out a preventive military strike against Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
Should Iran possess the ultimate weapon , it might embrace a new restraint in its foreign policy ; nuclear-weapons states , precisely because they confront the prospect of nuclear retaliation , have historically tread with caution . 
But the Iranian regime is no ordinary government ; it may not adhere to the normal practices of nuclear restraint . 
Even if it does , a nuclear Iran may trigger an arms race in the region and embolden an Iranian government that already supports extremist movements throughout the Middle East . 
An American security umbrella over the Persian Gulf and Israel might calm nerves , but it would do little to counter increased Iranian support of Islamic radicals . 
A military strike would likely have worse consequences . 
Even if a strike was an operational success , it would only set back Iran &apos;s nuclear program by several years - while giving the regime a new incentive to acquire a nuclear deterrent and build better hidden and defended nuclear facilities . 
In response to an attack , Iran might well seek to obstruct shipping in the Persian Gulf , potentially triggering oil shortages and soaring prices . 
Iran could also intensify efforts to fund and arm insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan , imperiling both countries . 
And it could launch attacks on US , European , and Israeli targets on a global basis . 
Such prospects make continued diplomacy , however elusive the prospects of success , nothing short of mandatory . 
The third reason for pursuing dialogue is that factional infighting and political intrigue within the Iranian regime make for considerable political fluidity . 
Admittedly , turmoil in Tehran brings inconstancy to Iran &apos;s foreign policy , warranting caution about the prospects for a meaningful diplomatic breakthrough . 
But internal jockeying for power also means that a coalitional alignment favoring a negotiated settlement just might fall into place . 
Ahmadinejad himself , after all , late last year voiced enthusiasm for a Western proposal to break the logjam by exporting Iran &apos;s uranium for processing abroad , only to reverse course soon thereafter . Then last month , he reversed course again , working with Brazil and Turkey to craft a watered-down version of the original proposal . 
Ahmadinejad may be bobbing and weaving . But his mercurial ways make it plausible that he may find it politically advantageous to strike a serious bargain on the nuclear issue . Just in case , the diplomatic door should remain ajar . 
Finally , even as stalemate continues on Iran &apos;s uranium enrichment , continued engagement may offer a roundabout means of arriving at a bargain on the nuclear issue . 
Dialogue with the US could focus on areas , such as Iraq and Afghanistan , where the two parties share a measure of common ground . 
Joint efforts to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan , for example , could help dilute the mutual antagonism and distrust that contribute to blockage on the nuclear front . 
Iran remains several years away from mastering the technology needed to build nuclear weapons , which provides time to search for such diplomatic openings . 
With Iran having spurned Obama &apos;s offers of compromise , it is tempting for the US administration to turn its back on dialogue . 
But the stakes are too high to abandon engagement . 
Even with new sanctions in the offing , dialogue still offers the best prospect for peacefully resolving what may be the world &apos;s most dangerous dispute .
