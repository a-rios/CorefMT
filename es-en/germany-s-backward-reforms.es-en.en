Germany \ u0027s Backward Reforms 
CAMBRIDGE : A successful economy needs quite a bit of competition and flexibility . 
Yet attractive as they sound , competition and flexibility have their enemies . 
Competition means that a society has economic winners and losers , and everyone feels pressure to perform ; flexibility means that the status quo is not written in stone . 
Indeed , the status quo can be thrown out the window at any time . 
The US has embraced flexibility and competition with a vengeance . 
The payoffs are seen in soaring employment , a decade-long stock market boom , and rapid rates of innovation and productivity improvements . 
For some observers , however , today &apos;s slowdown in America puts those payoffs in doubt . 
But this eagerness to declare the American model bankrupt is dead wrong . 
Look at the European model : cling to the status quo , don &apos;t make waves , workers councils , Mitbestimmung , unions , and masses of well-paid unemployed people . 
Clever leftish governments parley with an oh-so-comfortable public , one far from demanding revolution . 
Europe &apos;s poor showing on the supply side is not a lack of performance , indeed , it is a political choice . 
Make no mistake : Europe is rich and content ; 
Europe would not have it any other way . 
Consider the extraordinary example of the German labor market . 
The French 35 hour work week , introduced a few years ago , was a political success . 
The Dutch , who pioneered initiatives on the part-time work front , also gained political praise for their efforts . 
So why not try something of this sort in Germany , Social Democrat politicians asked ? 
In a recent report , the Berlin DIW ( German Institute for Economic Research ) drew on a socio-economic survey to ask German employees what were their preferred working hours . 
They found that of the 31 million German workers questioned , 30 % want fewer ( but pay-adjusted ) working hours , but that 26 % want to work longer hours . 
Important differences exist between men and women , East and West Germans , and full-time and part-time workers . 
So why not , they asked , create a legal bridge to allow this to happen ? 
( See a table at the bottom of the text . ) 
( Remember , firing workers comes at an exorbitant cost and with extensive room for legal challenges . ) 
Workers who hold part-time positions in a firm but want a full-time job , have a legal right to fill such a position when a job opens up . 
The only apparent limitation is for cases in which serious operational considerations , or the working preferences of other part-time workers , stand in the way . 
As economics , this is lunacy . 
Rather than focusing on how to make firms better able to compete internationally , and so generate jobs , growth and prosperity , this supposed reform institutionalizes even more complications , moves matters one more step away from what an economy should look like . 
In the US , unions are largely irrelevant and decentralized deal making between firms and workers is the rule . 
Anyone who wants to work can work . 
Businesses can fire or hire workers largely at will and there are no significant costs to massively trimming the payroll ( as we are now seeing with German-owned Chrysler ) . 
The only important restraints on this managerial freedom are concerns about worker morale and its impact on productivity , profits and stock valuation . 
The European scene could not be more different . 
It is almost as if business is the last thing you have to take into consideration where workers are concerned . 
Rich countries like Germany can afford to pile more and more indirect taxes on business , and erect more and more obstacles to the efficient operation of business for a long time . 
But even Germany can &apos;t afford to expand the socialist stranglehold of labor on what is supposed to be a capitalist economy , for one day worker use and abuse of the political system will cannibalize economic substance . 
What follows then ? 
A German children &apos;s fairy tale - a Schlaraffenland ? 
A land where nobody works , and where your desires fall like manna from heaven ? 
A fairy tale indeed . 
Many Europeans still seem to believe that economics is a fairy tale , that you can legislate your wishes . 
But in the future , aging Europe , who will pay for the unemployed when so many people are on pensions ? 
Who will finance the workers &apos; paradise then ? 
Japan found to its dismay that two decades of dreadful economic policies resulted in a cumulative bankruptcy of government and the nation &apos;s finances . 
Germany is working hard to accomplish that same destruction via the labor market . 
Moreover , Germany is not alone . 
France is not much different and Italy is even worse . 
Europe &apos;s governments have wasted the last decade of boom , a time when serious reforms could have been embraced with relatively little pain . 
Now , either painful reform or slow decline will need to be embraced , because in the real economy , happy endings are earned by sound policies .
