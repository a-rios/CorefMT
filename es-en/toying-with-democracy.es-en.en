Toying with Democracy Democracy is supposedly on the march in the Middle East . 
But Arab dictators are afraid of true democracy , with its civil liberties and competitive elections , so they conjure up potions that protect the status quo by selecting bits of Western political models and adding some religious interpretation to ensure a patina of Islamic legitimacy . 
Saudi Arabia fits this description to a tee . 
Its rulers - some of the most autocratic in the world - say that democracy is incompatible with Islam . 
But a majority of Muslim scholars , including such eminent men as the Sheikh of Al Azhar in Cairo and the influential Qatar-based Sheikh Qaradawi , believe that Islam is compatible with democracy , at least as they define it : respect for the rule of law , equality between citizens , a fair distribution of wealth , justice , and freedom of expression and assembly . 
What remains debatable and contentious is the right of citizens to choose their leaders . 
Yet pressure to democratize is mounting , in part due to the smaller Gulf States , which compete with each other in democratic reforms . 
Qatar and Oman have elected consultative councils and enfranchised women . 
Parliamentary elections occur in Kuwait and Bahrain , and at the end of last year , Sheikh Mohammad al Maktoom , Crown Prince of Dubai , in the U.A.E. , suggested that Arab leaders must reform or sink . 
Iraq &apos;s elections have turned up the pressure even more . 
So , threatened as the regional hegemon , Saudi Arabia has joined the reform race by announcing partial municipal elections to consultative bodies in which the royal family already appoints half the members . 
The first election will be held in the capital of Riyadh on February 10 , followed by the oil rich Eastern region and the southern Asir region on March 2 and Mecca and Medina in the western Hijaz region and al Jouf , in the Northern Region , on April 21 . 
The government describes this as a &quot; new political era . &quot; 
Moreover , in accordance with Saudi tradition , the ruling family appoints a Prince as chairman of the General Committee overseeing the elections - a sign not of wider political participation , but of business as usual . 
Despite efforts led by Crown Prince Abdullah to urge participation , voter registration is low , which suits the government well , as high turnout could lead to the development of an electoral culture . 
Low turnout , by contrast , could convince western audiences that , despite the Saudi state &apos;s best efforts to jump-start democracy , its people are satisfied with the status quo . 
Saudi intellectuals attribute the lack of voter interest to the absence of free expression and assembly , which frustrates genuine political participation . 
Moreover , leading reformers have been jailed since last March for signing a petition asking for a constitutional monarchy , which has reinforced the general lack of trust in the government &apos;s agenda . 
The most crucial questions concern reform of the al Shura ( consultative council ) . 
Can it become a real parliament ? 
Would it be elected ? 
Currently , the King appoints its members . 
They do not issue legislation and they rarely even propose any . 
The King proposes , they discuss . 
They cannot debate the budget or military deals , nor can they question financial allocations to the regime &apos;s countless princes . 
In addition , there is the National Dialogue , started by Crown Prince Abdullah in 2004 as an acknowledgement of pluralism and diversity that brings together different religious sects - Salafis ( Wahhabis ) , Sufis , Shi &apos;a . 
But the religious authorities have not legitimized its discussions , so nothing has changed : the Shi &apos;a , for example , still cannot practice their religious rituals , be witnesses in court , or even work as butchers . 
Indeed , the &quot; King Abdul-Aziz Center for National Dialogue &quot; is utterly divorced from domestic realities and serves as a mere propaganda center whose participants believe that they form part of the state &apos;s message to the outside world . 
The last meeting was entitled &quot; Encounter with Youth : Reality and Aspirations , &quot; which amounted to a display of grand speeches by the authorities informing the country &apos;s youth that conditions are ideal . 
Such gatherings are unprecedented to the extent that they bring together groups that never talked before . 
Demonstrations are illegal , and there are no venues for political expression outside the Internet , which has created a community of alienated and embittered Saudis . 
Hundreds of angry Web sites have cropped up , the most extreme preaching the ideology of al-Qaeda and its ilk . 
Spurred by unemployment , political uncertainty , and falling living standards , young Saudi men are easily recruited by extremist groups . 
If Saudi Arabia &apos;s rulers were serious about &quot; participatory government , &quot; they would encourage liberals , moderates , and pragmatists . 
Instead , they repress , censor , silence and even imprison the moderates and appease the religious radicals . 
The authorities have killed some of the more violent jihadis in their &quot; war against terrorism , &quot; but they fear that a wider crackdown , however necessary , would alienate important tribes and clans . 
Despite cynicism , apathy , frustration , despair , and violence , some Saudis still hope for the emergence of a prince on a white horse who will place the kingdom onto the path of reform .
