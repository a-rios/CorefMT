Where Will All the Workers Go ? 
NEW YORK - Technology innovators and CEOs seem positively giddy nowadays about what the future will bring . 
In the years ahead , technological improvements in robotics and automation will boost productivity and efficiency , implying significant economic gains for companies . 
But , unless the proper policies to nurture job growth are put in place , it remains uncertain whether demand for labor will continue to grow as technology marches forward . 
Recent technological advances have three biases : They tend to be capital-intensive ( thus favoring those who already have financial resources ) ; skill-intensive ( thus favoring those who already have a high level of technical proficiency ) ; and labor-saving ( thus reducing the total number of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in the economy ) . 
The risk is that robotics and automation will displace workers in blue-collar manufacturing jobs before the dust of the Third Industrial Revolution settles . 
The rapid development of smart software over the last few decades has been perhaps the most important force shaping the coming manufacturing revolution . 
Software innovation , together with 3D printing technologies , will open the door to those workers who are educated enough to participate ; for everyone else , however , it may feel as though the revolution is happening elsewhere . 
Indeed , the factory of the future may be 1,000 robots and one worker manning them . 
Even the shop floor can be swept better and cheaper by a Roomba robot than by any worker . 
For the developed countries , this may seem like old news . 
For starters , technology is making even many service jobs tradable , enabling them to be offshored to Asia and other emerging markets . 
And , eventually , technology will replace manufacturing and service jobs in emerging markets as well . 
Today , for example , a patient in New York may have his MRI sent digitally to , say , Bangalore , where a highly skilled radiologist reads it for one-quarter of what a New York-based radiologist would cost . 
But how long will it be before a computer software can read those images faster , better , and cheaper than the radiologist in Bangalore can ? 
Likewise , in the next decade , Foxconn , which produces iPhones and other consumer electronics , plans to replace much of its Chinese workforce of more than 1.2 million with robots . 
And soon enough voice recognition software will replace the call centers of Bangalore and Manila . 
Job-reducing technological innovations will affect education , health care , government , and even transportation . 
For example , will we still need so many teachers in the decades to come if the cream of the profession can produce increasingly sophisticated online courses that millions of students can take ? 
If not , how will all of those former teachers earn a living ? 
Governments , too , are shedding labor - particularly governments burdened by high deficits and debts . 
And , by transforming how services are provided to the public , the e-government trend can offset the employment losses with productivity gains . 
Even transportation is being revolutionized by technology . 
In a matter of years , driverless cars - courtesy of Google and others - may render millions of jobs obsolete . 
And , of course technological innovation that is capital-intensive and labor-saving is one of the factors - together with the related winner-take-all effects - driving the rise in income and wealth inequality . 
Obviously , this is not the first time the world has faced such problems , and the past can help to serve as a model for resolving them . 
Late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century leaders sought to minimize the worst features of industrialization . 
Child labor was abolished throughout the developed world , working hours and conditions became more humane , and a social safety net was put in place to protect vulnerable workers and stabilize the ( often fragile ) macroeconomy . 
As we begin to seek enlightened solutions to the challenges that the Third Industrial Revolution presents , one overall theme looms large : The gains from technology must be channeled to a broader base of the population than has benefited so far . 
That requires a major educational component . 
In order to create broad-based prosperity , workers need the skills to participate in the brave new world implied by a digital economy . 
Even that may not be sufficient , in which case it will become necessary to provide permanent income support to those whose jobs are displaced by software and machines . 
Here , too , we should attend carefully to the lessons of the past .
