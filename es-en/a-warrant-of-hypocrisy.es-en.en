A Warrant of Hypocrisy 
LONDON - Earlier this month , the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) upheld the request of the court &apos;s chief prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Omar el-Bashir , the President of Sudan , charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
Bashir responded by expelling foreign aid agencies looking after the refugee camps in Darfur . 
This is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes , with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism . 
Both positions are hopelessly buried in intellectual and moral fog . 
The warrant was no leap forward . 
From the legal point of view , it makes no difference whether the accused is a sitting or former head of state . 
As a result of Bashir &apos;s policies , 300,000 people are estimated to have died and 2.7 million displaced in Darfur . 
The expulsion of the aid agencies has put over a million Darfuris at risk of epidemics and starvation . 
According to the statute that established the ICC , the prosecutor is required to ensure that any prosecution is in the interests of the victims as well as of justice . 
In this case , justice comes with poisoned arrows . 
Emboldened by the warrant and its elusive suggestion of international support , the Darfuri rebels , the Justice and Equality Movement , have walked out of peace talks with Sudan &apos;s government . 
Meanwhile , Bashir , with little to lose , will no doubt take the opportunity to attack his enemies . 
The counter-argument is that the threat of indictment will deter rulers from wicked behavior . 
But the law will deter only if its sanctions are credible . 
A law that cannot be enforced deters no one . 
In fact , it weakens respect for law . 
Moreover , while the fear of being hauled off to The Hague may have 
Whatever the attractions of giving criminals &quot; nowhere to hide , whatever the consequences , &quot; the consequences cannot be ignored when the criminals are heads of state . 
The policy of never negotiating with terrorists cannot be scaled up to state level when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake . 
The charge of colonialism , meanwhile , is simply reflex : colonialism no longer exists . 
The charge that international law is 
In the Nuremberg trial of 1946 , which laid the basis of current international law , the main charge against the Nazi leaders was that of &quot; planning and waging aggressive war . &quot; 
Prohibition of war except for self-defense is embedded in the United Nations Charter . 
This guaranteed legal immunity for the leaders who carried out the invasion of Iraq . 
The charge of selective application also applies to the Bashir warrant . 
Bashir stands accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
The latter were first defined in the Nuremberg principles of 1950 to include murder , extermination , enslavement , deportation and &quot; other inhumane acts . &quot; 
In 1998 , these other acts were clarified to mean false imprisonment , torture , rape , persecution of a group , enforced disappearance of persons , and apartheid . 
It comes as no surprise , then , to read in the 
The answer is simple : where the interests of a UN Security Council member or one of their clients are at stake , the court &apos;s jurisdiction ends . 
The ICC is like a cobweb : small flies get stuck , but wasps and hornets get through . 
Until the United States ratifies the ICC treaty , the Court is bound to seem to many to be little more than a politicized kangaroo court . 
Without American support , it has little hope of earning legitimacy , let alone doing its job effectively . 
The Security Council has the power to defer the warrant for Bashir &apos;s arrest for renewable periods of one year . 
It can do this indefinitely , and it seems likely that it will . 
The idea is that deferring the warrant will give the Security Council leverage over Sudan . 
Gareth Evans , a former Australian Foreign Minister , has called it &quot; a powerful diplomatic tool , &quot; while the 
If this proves true , the ICC and its sponsors have muddled justice with diplomacy . 
If the world can dispense justice only at the expense of the weak and to the advantage of the strong , it should stick to the older tools of crime prevention : force and negotiation , and leave justice out of it .
