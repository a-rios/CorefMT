Doing Poorly by Doing Good 
KIEL - The new catchphrase in business seems to be &quot; do well by doing good . &quot; In other words , undertaking socially responsible activities boosts profits . 
For example , Pepsi bolsters its bottom line by shifting to more nutritious , healthier food . 
Yet , in much of the world , doing well still implies that you must be up to no good , especially if you are dealing with the poor . 
A recent case in point is the imbroglio in Andhra Pradesh in India , where the administration has moved to curb microfinance . 
Microfinance has become the darling of development enthusiasts . 
After all , who could be against an activity that produces uplifting stories like the cell phone ladies of Bangladesh , who lift themselves out of poverty by obtaining loans to buy phones and then selling minutes to others in the village . 
The benefits of microfinance are in danger of being over-hyped - there are not that many successful micro-businesses that the poor can start solely with the help of loans , because skills and management abilities are also often necessary . 
Nevertheless , the benefits are real : while there is little evidence that microfinance sets substantial numbers of poor people on the path to riches , it does help the poor save , smooth consumption , deal with emergencies , and expand existing businesses . 
These are not trivial benefits . 
One problem the poor often have in accumulating savings is lack of easy access to savings accounts where they can deposit money . 
The money is kept in a tin at home , and is easily spent when a neighbor is in difficulty , or the ne &apos;er-do-well cousin comes calling . 
By taking a loan from a micro-financier to buy a needed asset , and then making regular mandatory weekly payments out of her income , the housewife borrows to save - she no longer has spare cash lying around for others to fritter away . 
The &quot; asset &quot; that is purchased need not be a physical asset . 
In India , a big portion of college dues is paid at the beginning of the year . 
Households whose members have steady jobs borrow from micro-financiers to pay the fees , and then spend the rest of the year repaying the loan . 
That way , they do not have to cut spending substantially in the months before the fee is due , but can instead smooth spending over the year . 
This is helpful when people live at the margin - where cutting spending means foregoing food or medicines . 
Emergency loans are equally important . 
When children fall sick , parents do not have the time to apply for a loan from a state-owned bank ( perhaps the only alternative source of loans for the poor other than the moneylender ) . 
Usually , the bank takes months to process the application , and may demand a bribe even in the unlikely event it is willing to take on the credit risk . 
The micro-financier , confident of being repaid , is willing to extend the emergency loan quickly and with little bureaucracy . 
Finally , while I am skeptical that microfinance alone can promote a lot of successful entrepreneurship , it certainly can be helpful in allowing a farmer to buy more cattle or a tractor , or allowing a village shopkeeper to expand inventory . 
Thus , it also helps expand incomes . 
But , despite all these benefits , politicians are generally unwilling to accept that money can be earned honestly from those at the bottom of the income pyramid . 
If micro-financiers are making profits off the poor , it must be because they are bilking them . 
Suspicions are further reinforced by politicians &quot; underlying paternalism - the poor do not know what is good for them and are easily fooled . 
Of course , the fact that micro-financiers charge the very poor relatively high interest rates exacerbates the perception that they are gouging society &apos;s most vulnerable members . 
But micro-financiers may have no choice : given the small size of the loans , the costs of processing them and collecting payments are relatively large , driving up the break-even interest rate . 
Matters came to a head in August this year , when an initial public offering in India of SKS , a microfinance institution started by Vikram Akula , a graduate of the University of Chicago &apos;s Booth School of Business , raised roughly $ 350 million . 
The IPO valued the company at $ 1.6 billion . 
Such a high valuation can be justified if SKS provides a better service than the competition , but darker interpretations are possible . 
If SKS is doing so well , the official thinking went , it must be up to no good . 
So the authorities acted . 
The Andhra Pradesh administration accused the industry of charging usurious interest rates , urging the gullible poor to over-borrow , and then driving some delinquent borrowers to commit suicide . 
It imposed severe curbs on the industry in October . 
The widespread belief among micro-financiers is that the curbs were imposed not because the industry was exploitative , but because it offered an alternative to political patronage . 
Politicians gained influence and popular support by directing state-owned banks to make loans to favored constituencies . 
By threatening this source of power , the microfinance industry created a powerful opponent , who found an opportune moment to strike . 
The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle - the microfinance sector has made some mistakes , which politicians have exaggerated in an effort to destroy an industry that undermines them by making the poor more independent . 
There is a lesson to draw from all this . 
There is money to be made at the bottom of the income pyramid , and businesses can do immense good while making that money by giving the poor choices that they have never had . 
But skepticism that money can be made off the poor extends well beyond the politician . 
It is incumbent on industries that deal with the poor to be transparent about how they earn their money - and to make the case for their activities strongly and publicly . 
Like Caesar &apos;s wife , microfinance has to be above suspicion .
