A Chinese Champion of Peace and Freedom 
PRAGUE - On Christmas Day last year , one of China &apos;s best-known human rights activists , the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo , was condemned to 11 years in prison . 
Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08 , a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia &apos;s Charter 77 , calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution , and demanding the open election of public officials , freedom of religion and expression , and the abolition of &quot; subversion &quot; laws . 
For his bravery and clarity of thought about China &apos;s future , Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize . 
There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award . 
First and foremost , he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights . 
We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless . 
These ideals - respect for human rights and human dignity , and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights - represent humanity &apos;s highest aspirations . 
Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu &apos;s courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals , it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu &apos;s 11-year sentence . 
It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting . 
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel &apos;s original intent for the award . 
In working to promote human rights , political reform , and democratization in China , Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago . 
Of course , democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage . 
This active and searching conversation , the hallmark of a democratic polity , is the best hope for better decisions by governments , both at home and abroad . 
Liu &apos;s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is , above all , intended for the benefit of the Chinese people . 
It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize . 
In conferring on Liu one of the world &apos;s highest honors , the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand , and world peace and international solidarity on the other . 
Liu &apos;s harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure , a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path . 
We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement , such as Liu &apos;s , requires an exemplary response . 
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves .
