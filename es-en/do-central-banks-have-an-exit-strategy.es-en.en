Do Central Banks Have an Exit Strategy ? 
SINGAPORE - A year into the global financial crisis , several key central banks remain extraordinarily exposed to their countries &quot; shaky private financial sectors . 
So far , the strategy of maintaining banking systems on feeding tubes of taxpayer-guaranteed short-term credit has made sense . 
But eventually central banks must pull the plug . Otherwise they will end up in intensive care themselves as credit losses overwhelm their balance sheets . 
The idea that the world &apos;s largest economies are merely facing a short-term panic looks increasingly strained . 
Instead , it is becoming apparent that , after a period of epic profits and growth , the financial industry now needs to undergo a period of consolidation and pruning . 
Weak banks must be allowed to fail or merge ( with ordinary depositors being paid off by government insurance funds ) , so that strong banks can emerge with renewed vigor . 
If this is the right diagnosis of the &quot; financial crisis , &quot; then efforts to block a healthy and normal dynamic will ultimately only prolong and exacerbate the problem . 
Not allowing the necessary consolidation is weakening credit markets , not strengthening them . 
The United States Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Bank of England are particularly exposed . 
Collectively , they have extended hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans to both traditional banks and complex , unregulated &quot; investment banks . &quot; 
Many other central banks are nervously watching the situation , well aware that they may soon find themselves in the same position as the global economy continues to soften and default rates on all manner of debt continue to rise . 
If central banks are faced with a massive hit to their balance sheets , it will not necessarily be the end of the world . 
It has happened before - for example , during the 1990 &quot; s financial crises . 
But history suggests that fixing a central bank &apos;s balance sheet is never pleasant . 
Both solutions are extremely traumatic . 
Raging inflation causes all kinds of distortions and inefficiencies . 
( And don &apos;t think central banks have ruled out the inflation tax . 
In fact , inflation has spiked during the past year , conveniently facilitating a necessary correction in the real price of houses . ) 
Taxpayer bailouts , on the other hand , are seldom smooth and inevitably compromise central bank independence . 
The financial sector has produced extraordinary profits , particularly in the Anglophone countries . 
And , while calculating the size of the financial sector is extremely difficult due to its opaqueness and complexity , official US statistics indicate that financial firms accounted for roughly one-third of American corporate profits in 2006 . 
Multi-million dollar bonuses on Wall Street and in the City of London have become routine , and financial firms have dominated donor lists for all the major political candidates in the 2008 US presidential election . 
Why , then , should ordinary taxpayers foot the bill to bail out the financial industry ? 
Why not the auto and steel industries , or any of the other industries that have suffered downturns in recent years ? 
This argument is all the more forceful if central banks turn to the &quot; inflation tax , &quot; which falls disproportionately on the poor , who have less means to protect themselves from price increases that undermine the value of their savings . 
British economist Willem Buiter has bluntly accused central banks and treasury officials of &quot; regulatory capture &quot; by the financial sector , particularly in the US . 
This is a strong charge , especially given the huge uncertainties that central banks and treasury officials have been facing . 
So how do central banks dig their way out of this deep hole ? 
The key is to sharpen the distinction between financial firms whose distress is truly panic driven ( and therefore temporary ) , and problems that are more fundamental . 
After a period of massive expansion during which the financial services sector nearly doubled in size , some retrenchment is natural and normal . 
The sub-prime mortgage loan problem triggered a drop in some financial institutions &quot; key lines of business , particularly their opaque but extremely profitable derivatives businesses . Some shrinkage of the industry is inevitable . 
Central banks have to start fostering consolidation , rather than indiscriminately extending credit . 
In principle , the financial industry can become smaller by having each institution contract proportionately , say , by 15 % . 
But this is not the typical pattern in any industry . 
But they should realize that large foreign shareholders in financial firms may be far less effective than locals in coaxing central banks to extend massive , no-strings-attached credit lines . 
It is time to take stock of the crisis and recognize that the financial industry is undergoing fundamental shifts , and is not simply the victim of speculative panic against housing loans . Certainly better regulation is part of the answer over the longer run , but it is no panacea . 
Today &apos;s financial firm equity and bond holders must bear the main cost , or there is little hope they will behave more responsibly in the future .
