Erdoğan and the Paradox of Populism 
VIENNA - The triumph of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey &apos;s first direct presidential election is no surprise . 
Erdoğan is popular , and , as Prime Minister since 2003 , he has been riding a wave of economic success . 
As with other populist leaders , such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or the late Hugo Chávez in Venezuela , reconciling Erdoğan &apos;s electoral promises and his performance in office is a puzzle . 
Such figures start out attacking their opponents &quot; corruption and accuse them of hijacking the state for a self-serving political establishment that excludes the interests of ordinary people . 
Yet , when in power , they end up behaving exactly the same , treating the state as their or their party &apos;s property and engaging in , or at least condoning , corruption . 
Usually , this apparent hypocrisy does not hurt populists &quot; electoral prospects , as Erdoğan &apos;s success has just dramatically demonstrated . 
Why ? 
Contrary to much conventional wisdom , populism is not defined by a particular electoral constituency - such as the lower middle class - or by simplistic policies pandering to the masses , as liberal observers often argue . 
Behind this claim stands the further assumption that the people have one common will that genuinely aims at the common good , and that the people &apos;s authentic leader - such as Erdoğan , who campaigned under the slogan &quot; National Will , National Power &quot; - can identify and implement it . 
Populists , then , are not only anti-elitist ; they are necessarily anti-pluralist and hence anti-liberal . 
Their politics is always polarizing , splitting the actual citizenry into a pure , moral people and the immoral others - whom Erdoğan has often simply called &quot; traitors . &quot; 
In the eyes of the populist , there cannot be anything like a legitimate opposition . 
Whoever is against the leader is automatically against the people . 
This explains Erdoğan &apos;s accusation that the protesters in Gezi Park last summer , who demonstrated against his government &apos;s plans to erect a shopping center , were not proper Turks at all . 
Who are you ? &quot; 
It is often said that populists cannot govern , or will be exposed as incompetent , when elected to office . 
According to this view , populist parties are essentially protest parties , and protest cannot govern , because it is impossible to protest against oneself . 
But things are not that simple . 
Populists typically adopt a governing style that mirrors the very accusations that they leveled against the previous political establishment . 
They grab whatever power they can , disable checks and balances , fill all state offices with cronies , and reward their supporters ( and only their supporters ) with benefits in exchange for their loyalty - what political scientists call &quot; mass clientelism . &quot; 
Austrian arch-populist Jörg Haider , for example , would literally hand out € 100 ( $ 134 ) bills to &quot; his people &quot; on the street . 
Of course , all parties seek to take care of their constituencies first . 
What is peculiar about populist politicians is that they can do so openly and with a clean conscience . 
After all , if only their supporters are really &quot; the people , &quot; everyone else is undeserving . 
In the same vein , populist parties tend to colonize the state with alacrity . 
If only one party truly represents the people , why should the state not become the instrument of the people ? 
And when populists have an opportunity to write a new constitution , why should they not ride roughshod over any opposition , which , by definition , must comprise the enemies of the people ( who often are accused of being foreign agents ) ? 
This explains why populist governments &quot; clientelism and corruption do not erode their leaders &quot; core support among the electorate . 
Such practices are perceived as serving a moral &quot; us &quot; at the expense of the immoral or foreign &quot; them . &quot; 
Thus , liberals &quot; belief that they have only to expose the populists &quot; corruption to discredit them is a vain hope . 
They also have to show that for the vast majority of citizens , clientilism yields no benefits , and that a lack of democratic accountability , a dysfunctional bureaucracy , and erosion of the rule of law will in the long run hurt the people - all of them .
