Getting to Yes With Iran 
WASHINGTON , DC - With the release of America &apos;s National Intelligence Estimate , according to which Iran has suspended its nuclear weapons program , the prospect of military confrontation with the Bush administration dimmed . 
But months later , it is clear that the danger is not past , because Iran has not renounced the production of nuclear weapons , which its enriched uranium could eventually be used to fuel . 
All parties need to find a formula to resolve the issue before it again threatens to erupt into conflict . 
Let us recall the fate of Ahmedinejad &apos;s two immediate predecessors . 
Muhammad Khatami ( 1997-2005 ) tried to implement dramatic political reform , while Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ( 1989-97 ) tried to open the Iranian economy to the West . 
Both failed , because Iran &apos;s presidents do not run the country . 
A solution to the nuclear dilemma - or any other problem in Iran &apos;s foreign relations - is in the hands of the Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
Among his responsibilities , Khamenei serves as commander-in-chief of the military , controls the intelligence services , and appoints directors of the national media . 
His appointees effectively control most ministries and Iran &apos;s major cities . 
In diplomacy , Khamenei tends to operate in a clever but recognizable fashion . 
He sends different diplomats into negotiations with contradictory instructions . 
Each claims to be acting with the Supreme Leader &apos;s full authority , but ultimately are unable to make commitments because they have little idea of what Khamenei wants to do . 
After a time , they are removed , and a new set of representatives is dispatched . 
In order to dominate decision-making , Khamenei prefers weak presidents . 
Ahmedinejad is no different . 
His political base has faded , owing to Iran &apos;s deepening economic crisis , which has been intensified by the conflict with the West over the nuclear issue . 
His support in the parliamentary election next March seems particularly weak , which will no doubt please Western observers . 
Some Western diplomats recognize the Supreme Leader &apos;s role . 
In practice , however , Western diplomacy tends to ignore Khamenei , who sabotages any effort to get around him as the final arbiter of Iranian policy . 
Westerners don &apos;t seem to understand who is in charge . 
Indeed , some analysts argue that former President Bill Clinton &apos;s efforts to achieve a breakthrough with Iran failed because they were addressed to Iran &apos;s presidents . 
The West should learn from the example of Russian President Vladimir Putin , who did not travel to Iran until he was allowed a direct meeting with Khamenei , during which Putin is reported to have made a proposal to end the nuclear stand-off . 
There has been no answer yet , though there does seem to be some recent movement between Russia and Iran on the provision of nuclear fuel for Iran &apos;s controversial reactors . 
To be sure , Khamenei is reluctant to meet with non-Muslim foreign leaders . 
One American politician who understands how to work with the Iranian power structure is former Congressman Lee Hamilton , now head of the Woodrow Wilson Center . 
When Wilson Center researcher Haleh Esfandiari was arrested in Iran , Hamilton wrote to Khamenei , pleading for her release on humanitarian grounds . 
Khamenei responded - reportedly the first time he answered an American - and Esfandiari was released in a matter of days . 
Khamenei would be hard-pressed to ignore a direct invitation from the US to negotiate on Iran &apos;s most vital concerns . 
His clear priority is the Islamic Republic &apos;s survival , not the fate of particular Iranian politicians . 
While Ahmedinejad &apos;s apocalyptic vision makes it difficult for westerners to deal with him , Khamenei does not want to stumble into a military confrontation with the West , which would destabilize Iran and possibly lead to the regime &apos;s downfall . 
To resolve outstanding issues with Iran , the West should be dealing with the only person powerful enough to make deals and deliver concessions . 
That person is Khamenei , not Ahmedinejad .
