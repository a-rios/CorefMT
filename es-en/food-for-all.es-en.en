Food for All 
BRUSSELS - What should the G-20 do to prepare us to confront food crises , now and in the future ? 
World Bank President Robert Zoellick recently listed nine measures that the G-20 should adopt under its current French presidency . 
These range from improving information about grain stocks and developing better weather-forecasting methods to strengthening social safety nets for the poor and helping small farmers benefit from tenders from humanitarian purchasers such as the World Food Program . 
Although welcome , these measures tackle only the symptoms of the global food system &apos;s weaknesses , leaving the root causes of crises untouched . 
They may mitigate the consequences of peak prices , but they are inadequate to avoiding the recurrence of shocks , which can be accomplished if the G-20 acts on eight priorities . 
First , the G-20 should support countries &quot; ability to feed themselves . 
Since the early 1990 &quot; s , many poor countries &quot; food bills have soared five- or six-fold , owing not only to population growth , but also to their focus on export-led agriculture . 
A lack of investment in agriculture that feeds local communities makes these countries vulnerable to international price shocks , as well as to exchange-rate volatility . 
Mozambique , for example , imports 60 % of its wheat consumption , and Egypt imports 50 % of its food supplies . 
Rising prices directly affect these countries &quot; ability to feed themselves at an acceptable cost . 
This trend must be reversed by allowing developing countries to support their farmers and , where domestic supply is sufficient , protect them from dumping by foreign producers . 
Second , food reserves should be established , not only for humanitarian supplies in disaster-prone , infrastructure-poor areas , as Zoellick proposes , but also as a means to support stable revenues for agricultural producers and ensure affordable food for the poor . 
If managed in ways that are transparent and participatory , and if countries combine their efforts regionally , food reserves can be an effective way to boost sellers &quot; market power and counteract speculation by traders , thereby limiting price volatility . 
Third , financial speculation should be limited as well . 
While not a cause of price volatility , speculation on derivatives of essential food commodities significantly worsens it . 
Such speculation was enabled by massive deregulation of commodities-derivative markets that began in 2000 - and that now must be reversed . 
The major economies should ensure that such derivatives are restricted as far as possible to qualified and knowledgeable investors who trade on the basis of expectations regarding market fundamentals , rather than mainly or only for short-term speculative gain . 
Fourth , many cash-strapped developing countries fear that social safety nets , once put in place , may become fiscally unsustainable , owing to a sudden loss of export revenue , poor harvests , or sharp increases in prices for food imports . 
The international community can help overcome this reticence by establishing a global reinsurance mechanism . 
If premiums were paid in part by the country seeking insurance and matched by donor contributions , countries would have a powerful incentive to implement robust social-protection programs . 
Fifth , farmers &quot; organizations need support . 
One major reason why the majority of the hungry are among those who depend on small-scale farming is that they are insufficiently organized . 
By forming cooperatives , they can move up the value chain into the processing , packaging , and marketing of their produce . 
They can improve their bargaining position , both for input purchases and for the sale of their crops . 
Sixth , we must protect access to land . 
Each year , an area greater than France &apos;s farmland is ceded to foreign investors or governments . 
This land grab , which is occurring mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa , constitutes a major threat to the future food security of the populations concerned . 
Whatever gains in agricultural production result from these investments will benefit foreign markets , not local communities . 
The G-20 could call for a moratorium on these large-scale investments until an agreement on appropriate ground rules is reached . 
Weather-related events are a major cause of price volatility on agricultural markets . 
In the future , climate change can be expected to cause more supply shocks . 
And agriculture is also a major culprit in climate change , responsible for 33 % of all greenhouse-gas emissions if deforestation for cultivation and pastures is included in the tally . 
We need agricultural systems that are more resilient to climate change , and that can contribute to mitigating it . 
Agro-ecology points to solutions , but strong support from governments is needed to scale up existing best practices . 
Finally , we need to defend the human right to food . 
People are hungry not because too little food is being produced , but because their rights are violated with impunity . 
Victims of hunger must be allowed to access remedies when their authorities fail to take effective measures against food insecurity . 
Governments must guarantee a living wage , adequate health care , and safe conditions for the world &apos;s 450 million agricultural workers by enforcing the conventions on labor rights in rural areas , subject to independent monitoring . 
Hunger is a political question , not just a technical problem . 
We need markets , of course , but we also need a vision for the future that goes beyond short-term fixes . 
The global food system will always need firefighters .
