Buy Back or Pay Forward ? 
LONDON - When British Prime Minister David Cameron asked me to lead a review into the problem of antimicrobial resistance , the last thing I expected was that accepting the position would lead me to question one of the most popular tools for corporate financial management : share buybacks . 
The problem of antimicrobial resistance is a serious one . 
Left unaddressed , it could be responsible by 2050 for the deaths of some ten million people a year , more than currently die of cancer , along with an astonishing $ 100 trillion in economic damage . 
Fortunately , however , there is much we can do to mitigate the threat - provided that adequate resources are made available . 
One important avenue to pursue is the development of new drugs . 
In a forthcoming paper , the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that bringing new antimicrobials to market and improving their administration will cost about $ 25 billion - a significant sum , but one that pales in comparison to the costs to society if the problem is not checked . 
It is also roughly what two of the world &apos;s largest pharmaceutical companies will spend this year buying back their own shares . 
While the review has yet to come up with recommendations for financing the development of new drugs , it seems clear to me that it is well within the capacity of the pharmaceutical industry to contribute . 
A common argument made by drug companies is that they need to be guaranteed a reward if they are to invest in developing medicines that are unlikely to deliver the kind of returns that other investments may provide . 
The only sure way to guarantee drug development , the argument goes , is to allow prices to rise until demand matches supply . 
And yet there is a good reason why the pharmaceutical industry can and should play a major role in financing something like a common &quot; Innovation Fund &quot; to provide financing for early-stage research into solving the problem of antimicrobial resistance . 
And that reason is one that I became familiar with during my years at Goldman Sachs : enlightened self-interest . 
Six years after the eruption of the global financial crisis , the banking industry is still widely blamed for the catastrophe . 
And , as a result , banks are being hit with regulatory constraints that limit some aspects of their business . 
I suspect that if the industry had shown greater leadership on issues - for example , excessive executive pay - they would have found themselves in a much more favorable environment today . 
The same is true of the pharmaceutical industry . 
Share buybacks can sometimes be legitimate , but on other occasions they do not seem justified - especially when considered from the standpoint of enlightened self-interest . 
In December , the pharmaceutical giant Merck spent $ 8.4 billion to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals , a Massachusetts-based drug-maker that specializes in combating Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , a bacteria that has become resistant to many types of antibiotics . 
In early March - less than three months after the acquisition - Merck announced it would close down Cubist &apos;s early-stage research unit , laying off some 120 staff and perhaps crippling its efforts to introduce new drugs into the pipeline . 
Three weeks later , Merck announced that it would spend an additional $ 10 billion to buy back some of its shares . 
It is difficult for an outside observer not to draw a connection between the two decisions . 
Of course , dubious buybacks are not confined to the pharmaceutical industry . 
Apple is another good example . 
The company &apos;s latest quarterly sales results show how the company has become something more than a technology firm ; it is now a major middle-class Chinese consumer brand . 
Within a year , China will likely be a bigger market for its products than the United States . 
And yet , even more striking than this confirmation of the still-rising importance of the BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) economies is the sheer size of Apple &apos;s ongoing buyback program . 
In April , the company announced it had authorized an additional $ 50 billion to be used for repurchasing shares , bringing the total to $ 140 billion . 
Coming at a time when the technology industry is under increasing scrutiny in the developed world as governments struggle with budget shortfalls and rising debt , this seems to me to be a questionable decision . 
Companies &quot; ability to minimize their global tax burden , while boosting their earnings per share through buybacks - in some cases financed with debt - does not strike me as a stable trend . 
When companies are genuinely unable to identify areas of research and investment that would help their business ( and employees and clients ) , they are better off returning the savings to shareholders in the form of higher dividends than authorizing buybacks . 
Or , better yet , in a world confronted with a host of problems - from climate change to antimicrobial resistance - industry leaders should begin asking themselves how they can contribute to averting the crises of the future .
