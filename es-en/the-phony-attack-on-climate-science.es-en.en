The Phony Attack on Climate Science 
NEW YORK - In the weeks before and after the Copenhagen climate change conference last December , the science of climate change came under harsh attack by critics who contend that climate scientists have deliberately suppressed evidence - and that the science itself is severely flawed . 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the global group of experts charged with assessing the state of climate science , has been accused of bias . 
The global public is disconcerted by these attacks . 
If experts cannot agree that there is a climate crisis , why should governments spend billions of dollars to address it ? 
The fact is that the critics - who are few in number but aggressive in their attacks - are deploying tactics that they have honed for more than 25 years . 
During their long campaign , they have greatly exaggerated scientific disagreements in order to stop action on climate change , with special interests like Exxon Mobil footing the bill . 
Many books have recently documented the games played by the climate-change deniers . Merchants of Doubt , a new book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway set for release in mid-2010 , will be an authoritative account of their misbehavior . 
The authors show that the same group of mischief-makers , given a platform by the free-market ideologues of The Wall Street Journal &apos;s editorial page , has consistently tried to confuse the public and discredit the scientists whose insights are helping to save the world from unintended environmental harm . 
Today &apos;s campaigners against action on climate change are in many cases backed by the same lobbies , individuals , and organizations that sided with the tobacco industry to discredit the science linking smoking and lung cancer . 
Later , they fought the scientific evidence that sulfur oxides from coal-fired power plants were causing &quot; acid rain . &quot; 
Then , when it was discovered that certain chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) were causing the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere , the same groups launched a nasty campaign to discredit that science , too . 
Later still , the group defended the tobacco giants against charges that second-hand smoke causes cancer and other diseases . 
What is amazing is that , although these attacks on science have been wrong for 30 years , they still sow doubts about established facts . 
The truth is that there is big money backing the climate-change deniers , whether it is companies that don &apos;t want to pay the extra costs of regulation , or free-market ideologues opposed to any government controls . 
The latest round of attacks involves two episodes . 
The first was the hacking of a climate-change research center in England . 
The e-mails that were stolen suggested a lack of forthrightness in the presentation of some climate data . 
Whatever the details of this specific case , the studies in question represent a tiny fraction of the overwhelming scientific evidence that points to the reality and urgency of man-made climate change . 
The second issue was a blatant error concerning glaciers that appeared in a major IPCC report . 
Here it should be understood that the IPCC issues thousands of pages of text . 
There are , no doubt , errors in those pages . 
When the e-mails and the IPCC error were brought to light , editorial writers at The Wall Street Journal launched a vicious campaign describing climate science as a hoax and a conspiracy . 
They claimed that scientists were fabricating evidence in order to obtain government research grants - a ludicrous accusation , I thought at the time , given that the scientists under attack have devoted their lives to finding the truth , and have certainly not become rich relative to their peers in finance and business . 
But then I recalled that this line of attack - charging a scientific conspiracy to drum up &quot; business &quot; for science - was almost identical to that used by The Wall Street Journal and others in the past , when they fought controls on tobacco , acid rain , ozone depletion , second-hand smoke , and other dangerous pollutants . 
In other words , their arguments were systematic and contrived , not at all original to the circumstances . 
We are witnessing a predictable process by ideologues and right-wing think tanks and publications to discredit the scientific process . 
Their arguments have been repeatedly disproved for 30 years - time after time - but their aggressive methods of public propaganda succeed in causing delay and confusion . 
Climate change science is a wondrous intellectual activity . 
Great scientific minds have learned over the course of many decades to &quot; read &quot; the Earth &apos;s history , in order to understand how the climate system works . 
They have deployed brilliant physics , biology , and instrumentation ( such as satellites reading detailed features of the Earth &apos;s systems ) in order to advance our understanding . 
And the message is clear : large-scale use of oil , coal , and gas is threatening the biology and chemistry of the planet . 
We are fueling dangerous changes in Earth &apos;s climate and ocean chemistry , giving rise to extreme storms , droughts , and other hazards that will damage the food supply and the quality of life of the planet . 
The IPCC and the climate scientists are telling us a crucial message . 
We need urgently to transform our energy , transport , food , industrial , and construction systems to reduce the dangerous human impact on the climate . 
It is our responsibility to listen , to understand the message , and then to act .
