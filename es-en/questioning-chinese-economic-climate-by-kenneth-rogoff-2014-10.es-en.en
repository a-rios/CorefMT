China &apos;s Inscrutable Contraction 
CAMBRIDGE - While virtually every country in the world is trying to boost growth , China &apos;s government is trying to slow it down to a sustainable level . 
As China shifts to a more domestic-demand driven , services-oriented economy , a transition to slower trend growth is both inevitable and desirable . 
But the challenges are immense , and no one should take a soft landing for granted . 
As China &apos;s economy grows relative to the economies of its trading partners , the efficacy of its export-led growth model must inevitably fade . 
As a corollary , the returns on massive infrastructure investment , much of which is directed toward supporting export growth , must also fade . 
Consumption and quality of life need to rise , even as China &apos;s air pollution and water shortages become more acute in many areas . 
But , in an economy where debt has exploded to more than 200 % of GDP , it is not easy to rein in growth gradually without triggering widespread failure of ambitious investment projects . 
Even in China , where the government has deep pockets to cushion the fall , one Lehman Brothers-size bankruptcy could lead to a major panic . 
Think of how hard it is to engineer a soft landing in market-based economies . 
Many a recession has been catalyzed or amplified by monetary-tightening cycles ; former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was christened the &quot; maestro &quot; in the 1990s , because he managed to slow inflation and maintain strong growth simultaneously . 
The idea that controlled tightening is easier in a more centrally planned economy , where policymakers must rely on far noisier market signals , is highly questionable . 
If one were to judge by official and market growth forecasts , one would think that the risks were modest . 
China &apos;s official target growth rate is 7.5 % . 
Anyone forecasting 7 % is considered a &quot; China bear , &quot; and predicting a downshift to 6.5 % makes one a downright fanatic . 
For most countries , such small differences would be splitting hairs . 
Of course , Chinese growth almost surely fluctuates far more than the official numbers reveal , in part because local officials have incentives to smooth the data that they report to the central authorities . 
So where is China &apos;s economy now ? 
Most evidence suggests that the economy has slowed significantly . 
One striking fact is that annual growth in electricity demand has fallen sharply , to below 4 % for the first eight months of 2014 , a level recorded previously only in the depths of the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008 . 
For most of China &apos;s modernization drive , electricity consumption has grown faster than output , not slower . 
Weakening electricity demand has tipped China &apos;s coal industry into severe distress , with many mines effectively bankrupt . 
Falling house prices are another classic indicator of a vulnerable economy , though the exact pace of decline is difficult to assess . 
The main house-price indices measure only asking prices and not actual sales prices . 
( Data in many other countries - for example , Spain - suffer from the same deficiency . ) 
Of course , exports have also slowed , given sluggish growth in the rest of the world . 
Commodity exporters such as Australia , Indonesia , and Brazil have already felt the effects of slowing Chinese growth , as have countries , such as Germany and Switzerland , that depend on satisfying China &apos;s voracious demand for capital-intensive goods . 
Unfortunately , China &apos;s data are not nearly as reliable as those measuring a developed economy , which makes it difficult for anyone to be sure of what is happening . 
Electricity usage is typically one of the most reliable measures of growth ; but , with the economy shifting toward services , and with many energy-intensive industries such as cement and steel production slowing down , it is perfectly possible that slow electricity growth is simply a symptom of rebalancing . 
Likewise , the softening of housing prices follows a short period in which prices more than doubled , which makes it difficult to tell whether China is facing a modest and healthy correction or outright collapse . 
And if continental Europe eventually recovers , as the US and the United Kingdom are , export growth could pick up again . 
What seems clear is that China &apos;s leadership is intent on pursuing many of the market-oriented reforms approved by the Third Plenary in 2013 . 
President Xi Jinping &apos;s aggressive anti-corruption campaign might be seen as preparation for political resistance to further economic liberalization . 
On the other hand , one can argue that , until now , Chinese corruption was more of a tax than a paralyzing force , and that dramatically changing the rules of the game could by itself catalyze a sharp drop in output . 
Can China &apos;s government engineer a soft landing while weeding out corruption , reducing pollution , and liberalizing markets to ensure long-term growth ? 
The stakes are high . 
If Chinese growth collapses , the global fallout could be far worse than that caused by a normal US recession . 
China &apos;s growth rate remains perched at a very high level , so there is a great deal of room to fall . 
The potential vulnerability of Western exports and equity prices is massive . 
Of the two major instances of policy tightening occurring in the world today , the US Fed &apos;s may be the easier one to understand , but it is not necessarily more consequential for the world than what is happening in China .
