Gambling with the Planet 
DUBAI - The consequences of the Japanese earthquake - especially the ongoing crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant - resonate grimly for observers of the American financial crash that precipitated the Great Recession . 
Both events provide stark lessons about risks , and about how badly markets and societies can manage them . 
Of course , in one sense , there is no comparison between the tragedy of the earthquake - which has left more than 25,000 people dead or missing - and the financial crisis , to which no such acute physical suffering can be attributed . 
But when it comes to the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima , there is a common theme in the two events . 
Experts in both the nuclear and finance industries assured us that new technology had all but eliminated the risk of catastrophe . 
Events proved them wrong : not only did the risks exist , but their consequences were so enormous that they easily erased all the supposed benefits of the systems that industry leaders promoted . 
Before the Great Recession , America &apos;s economic gurus - from the head of the Federal Reserve to the titans of finance - boasted that we had learned to master risk . 
&quot; Innovative &quot; financial instruments such as derivatives and credit-default swaps enabled the distribution of risk throughout the economy . 
We now know that they deluded not only the rest of society , but even themselves . 
These wizards of finance , it turned out , didn &apos;t understand the intricacies of risk , let alone the dangers posed by &quot; fat-tail distributions &quot; - a statistical term for rare events with huge consequences , sometimes called &quot; black swans . &quot; 
Events that were supposed to happen once in a century - or even once in the lifetime of the universe - seemed to happen every ten years . 
Worse , not only was the frequency of these events vastly underestimated ; so was the astronomical damage they would cause - something like the meltdowns that keep dogging the nuclear industry . 
Research in economics and psychology helps us understand why we do such a bad job in managing these risks . 
We have little empirical basis for judging rare events , so it is difficult to arrive at good estimates . 
In such circumstances , more than wishful thinking can come into play : we might have few incentives to think hard at all . 
On the contrary , when others bear the costs of mistakes , the incentives favor self-delusion . 
A system that socializes losses and privatizes gains is doomed to mismanage risk . 
Indeed , the entire financial sector was rife with agency problems and externalities . 
Ratings agencies had incentives to give good ratings to the high-risk securities produced by the investment banks that were paying them . 
Mortgage originators bore no consequences for their irresponsibility , and even those who engaged in predatory lending or created and marketed securities that were designed to lose did so in ways that insulated them from civil and criminal prosecution . 
This brings us to the next question : are there other &quot; black swan &quot; events waiting to happen ? 
Unfortunately , some of the really big risks that we face today are most likely not even rare events . 
The good news is that such risks can be controlled at little or no cost . 
The bad news is that doing so faces strong political opposition - for there are people who profit from the status quo . 
We have seen two of the big risks in recent years , but have done little to bring them under control . 
By some accounts , how the last crisis was managed may have increased the risk of a future financial meltdown . 
Too-big-to fail banks , and the markets in which they participate , now know that they can expect to be bailed out if they get into trouble . 
As a result of this &quot; moral hazard , &quot; these banks can borrow on favorable terms , giving them a competitive advantage based not on superior performance but on political strength . 
While some of the excesses in risk-taking have been curbed , predatory lending and unregulated trading in obscure over-the-counter derivatives continue . 
Incentive structures that encourage excess risk-taking remain virtually unchanged . 
So , too , while Germany has shut down its older nuclear reactors , in the US and elsewhere , even plants that have the same flawed design as Fukushima continue to operate . 
The nuclear industry &apos;s very existence is dependent on hidden public subsidies - costs borne by society in the event of nuclear disaster , as well as the costs of the still-unmanaged disposal of nuclear waste . 
So much for unfettered capitalism ! 
For the planet , there is one more risk , which , like the other two , is almost a certainty : global warming and climate change . 
If there were other planets to which we could move at low cost in the event of the almost certain outcome predicted by scientists , one could argue that this is a risk worth taking . 
But there aren &apos;t , so it isn &apos;t . 
The costs of reducing emissions pale in comparison to the possible risks the world faces . 
And that is true even if we rule out the nuclear option ( the costs of which were always underestimated ) . 
To be sure , coal and oil companies would suffer , and big polluting countries - like the US - would obviously pay a higher price than those with a less profligate lifestyle . 
In the end , those gambling in Las Vegas lose more than they gain . 
As a society , we are gambling - with our big banks , with our nuclear power facilities , with our planet . 
As in Las Vegas , the lucky few - the bankers that put our economy at risk and the owners of energy companies that put our planet at risk - may walk off with a mint . 
But on average and almost certainly , we as a society , like all gamblers , will lose . 
That , unfortunately , is a lesson of Japan &apos;s disaster that we continue to ignore at our peril .
