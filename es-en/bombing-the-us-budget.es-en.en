Bombing the US Budget 
PARIS - As the United States and the world mark the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq , debates are raging about the consequences - for Iraq , the Middle East , and America &apos;s standing in the world . 
But the Iraq war &apos;s domestic impact - the Pentagon &apos;s ever mushrooming budget and its long-term influence on the US economy - may turn out to be its most lasting consequence . 
The US Defense Department &apos;s request for $ 515.4 billion in the 2009 fiscal year dwarfs every other military budget in the world . 
And this huge sum - a 5 % increase over the 2008 military budget - is to be spent only on the US military &apos;s normal operations , thus excluding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Since he took office in 2001 , President George W. Bush has increased America &apos;s regular military budget by 30 % , again not taking into account the cost of the wars he launched . 
Last year , America &apos;s entire military and counterterrorism expenditures topped $ 600 billion . 
One can assume that next year &apos;s total spending on military affairs will be even bigger . 
Adjusted for inflation , US military spending has reached its highest level since World War II . 
Is there any limit to this spending boom ? 
The US is allocating more money for defense today than it did during the war against Hitler or the Cold War . 
The Bush administration seems to think that today &apos;s military threats are graver . 
Talk about the so-called &quot; peace dividend &quot; that was supposed to come with the fall of the Berlin Wall has been silenced . 
Of course , because the US economy has grown faster than military spending , the share of GDP dedicated to military expenditures has fallen over the years . 
The US spent 14 % of its GDP on the military during the Korean War ( 1950-1953 , the Cold War &apos;s peak ) , 9 % during the Vietnam War and only 4 % nowadays . 
Yet , given the sheer scale of military spending today , one can wonder if it is rational . 
The US economy is probably in recession , clouds are gathering over its pension and health-care systems , and its military budget may not make sense even in strategic terms . 
America alone accounts for around 50 % of the world &apos;s military expenditures , which is historically unprecedented for a single country . 
Most other countries don &apos;t come anywhere close . 
Indeed , the second-ranked country in terms of total annual military spending , the United Kingdom , lags far behind , at $ 55 billion , followed by France ( $ 45 billion ) , Japan ( $ 41 billion ) , and Germany ( $ 35 billion ) . 
China and Russia , which can be considered strategic rivals of the US , spend $ 35 billion and $ 24 billion , respectively ( though these figures probably underestimate expenditure , the true amount is certainly still far below the US -level ) . 
Iran , depicted by the Bush administration as a major threat , is a military dwarf , spending $ 6.6 billion on its military . 
Some voices in America are calling for even bigger increases . 
Indeed , the Pentagon wants to enlarge the Marine Corps and Special Operations forces . 
Since it is increasingly difficult to recruit and retain soldiers , to do so will probably require raising their wages and improving their quality of life . 
Disabled soldiers also will cost a lot of money , even if the Pentagon won &apos;t automatically pay everything for them . 
But fulfilling the ostensible rationale for this seemingly interminable spending orgy - success in the so-called &quot; war on terror &quot; - does not seem anywhere within reach . 
Mike McConnell , America &apos;s Director of National Intelligence , recently admitted to a US Senate panel that al-Qaeda is gaining strength and steadily improving its ability to recruit , train , and even attack the US . 
That assessment is stunning , yet few American leaders - Democrats and Republicans alike - appear to be wondering if military power is the best answer to security issues . 
Indeed , by relying mainly on military solutions to political problems , the US seems to be increasing rather than reducing the threats it faces . 
After all , the dangers that America faces today do not come from nation states , but from non-states actors against whom nuclear weapons and aircraft carriers are useless . 
It would be less expensive and more fruitful for America to tackle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , return to a multilateral approach , and respect the moral principles that it recommends to others . 
Likewise , only by adopting such a strategy can the US start to compress the Pentagon &apos;s inflated budget and begin to address its many domestic woes .
