Universities : Renaissance or Decay ? 
&quot; Europe &apos;s universities , taken as a group , are failing to provide the intellectual and creative energy that is required to improve the continent &apos;s poor economic performance . &quot; 
This dramatic statement introduces a new pamphlet whose subtitle , &quot; Renaissance or Decay , &quot; I have borrowed for this reflection . 
The pamphlet &apos;s two authors , Richard Lambert , a former editor of the Financial Times and future Director General of the Confederation of British Industry , and Nick Butler , the Group Vice President for Strategy and Policy Development at British Petroleum do not represent vested academic interests . 
What they say about Europe probably applies to most other parts of the world as well , though not to the United States . 
Lambert and Butler identify four main weaknesses of European universities that must be addressed . 
They call for : 
greater diversity in place of today &apos;s conformity ; incentives for universities to succeed , which implies the need to set their ambitions higher ; less bureaucracy and more freedom and accountability ; above all , more adequate funding to bring European universities close to the US level of 2.6 % of GDP , from less than half on average . 
Not everyone will consider the underlying assumption of this analysis compelling . 
Why is this attention to universities necessary ? 
Because , it is said , we now live in a &quot; knowledge society . &quot; 
Perhaps . 
It is also a fact that a university education is the best guarantee for young people to find jobs in a globalized environment in which information is a key to success . 
Yet it is by no means certain that education systems in which 50 % or more of each generation strive to attain a university degree are best suited to cope with the exigencies of the twenty-first century . 
Many jobs are , in fact , not &quot; high tech , &quot; but , in the words of Britain &apos;s Adair Turner , &quot; high touch &quot; - service-sector jobs that do not require a university education . 
Even more jobs are somewhere between the two . 
Thus , a flexible system of varied educational institutions may be preferable to a system that leads one out of two students to an academic degree . 
Were we to settle for , say , 25 % of each generation on the academic track , universities in Europe , and indeed in many other parts of the world , would still have to overcome their unfortunate tendency to define their purposes against the business world . 
This tendency has been detrimental both for the business world , which is deprived of the cultural wealth provided by higher education , and for universities , because it removes them from their proper setting in the real world . 
There is a strong case for more adequate funding of higher education , including student fees , which are still unpopular in many countries outside the US . 
But money is not all that is needed . 
One of the greatest comparative strengths of American universities lies in the nature of human relations . 
Teachers take their job seriously . 
They engage with students rather than eagerly awaiting breaks and holidays to pursue their own projects . 
They are true university teachers rather than people who invoke the &quot; unity of teaching and research &quot; in order to concentrate on research subjects and hope that teaching will take care of itself . 
Moreover , the research atmosphere of American universities is characterized by a great deal of informal cooperation . 
People meet in laboratories and seminars , but also in common rooms and cafeterias . 
They are not obsessed with hierarchical status or surrounded by assistants . 
Nor are they tied to narrow projects and the project groups formed around them . 
Despite fierce competition for academic tenure , for space in journals and in other media , and for advancement in general , people talk to each other as colleagues . 
This is what doctoral and postdoctoral students like when they go to American - and , to a lesser extent , British - universities . 
This is also what they miss even as they relapse into the bad old habits at home . 
As in so many other respects , universities not only in Europe , but also in Japan , South Korea , and developing parts of the world , including China and India , need to loosen rigid structures and habits to avoid decay and nurture a renaissance .
