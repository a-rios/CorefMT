Don &apos;t Follow The Fed 
The US Federal Reserve faces a dilemma , for it needs to continue raising interest rates in the face of a hurricane-devastated economy . 
The Fed &apos;s failure to raise rates earlier thus holds a powerful lesson for the European Central Bank : after a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates , waiting too long to raise rates to more normal and appropriate levels holds dangerous consequences . 
The Fed was late in beginning the interest-rate normalization process , and it is now paying a price . 
The ECB must not make the same mistake , even bearing in mind that the two central banks operate in different milieus and under different constraints . 
Warning signs of impending inflation abound across the euro zone . 
Money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now , indicating excess liquidity . 
September headline inflation , at 2.6 % , is above the ECB &apos;s 2 % target Â­ - as is the latest forecast for 2006 inflation ( updated forecasts will be released at the beginning of December ) . 
&quot; The period of wage moderation may be coming to an end , &quot; warns Otmar Issing , the ECB &apos;s chief economist , implying that soaring energy prices may now be feeding through into the overall price level ( so-called &quot; second-round effects &quot; ) . 
In these circumstances , there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates . 
The longer energy prices remain at their current lofty levels , the greater the probability that inflationary expectations will increase and that second-round effects will materialize . 
Further procrastination on interest-rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation . 
This would be disastrous for Europe &apos;s economic recovery , as the ECB would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes . 
No one wants this . 
Better a 50-basis-point increase now - thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check - than triple or quadruple that figure down the road . 
The old adage that &quot; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure &quot; applies with particular force to monetary policy . 
Judging from the outcome of last month &apos;s meeting of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council , that &quot; ounce of prevention &quot; appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy . 
Indeed , the pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation has quickened in recent months - the earlier &quot; We are vigilant &quot; became &quot; We are particularly vigilant &quot; in September , which became &quot; Strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted &quot; in October . 
The Governing Council is in danger of running out of adjectives - as well as credibility - if it does not act soon . 
The tone of ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet &apos;s comments in the Q &amp; A section of the press conference following the October meeting was unusually hawkish . 
Trichet appeared to be calling for a pre-emptive approach when he said , &quot; We must not allow second-round effects to materialize . &quot; 
For the first time , the ECB president was willing to admit publicly that the Governing Council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike at the meeting . 
Nonetheless , current interest rates were described as &quot; still appropriate &quot; in October , signaling that the ECB has not yet reached a decision to bite the bullet . 
To be sure , an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong rise in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate hike . 
But what seems clear is that the ECB used the October press conference to warn politicians , trade unions , and the markets that its long period of monetary-policy inactivity is coming to an end . 
The exit process has begun . 
Not everyone is happy with this news . 
Politicians - like Jacques Chirac in France , Silvio Berlusconi in Italy , and ECOFIN ( the finance ministers of the European Union &apos;s member states ) - continue to press for fixed , even lower , interest rates . 
But it &apos;s easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy . 
They are not the ones who will be blamed for soaring prices , nor are they the ones who will have to force the inflation genie back into the bottle . 
By constantly pushing for lower interest rates than the ECB can deliver , politicians set the central bank up as a scapegoat for Europe &apos;s poor economic performance . 
Europe is doing badly , they argue , not because of their own failure to lead the structural reform process , but because interest rates are too high . 
At the same time , the ECB does not need to go nearly as far as the Fed , which has raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points at 12 consecutive meetings , with still more to come . 
For the ECB , an increase of 50 basis points could do the job at this point - after which rates could probably be put on hold for some time . 
The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process , and , because it was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the interest-rate cycle , it has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase . 
This is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or needs .
