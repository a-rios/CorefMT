Reconsidering Man &apos;s Dominion 
PRINCETON - In May , Pope Francis released his historic encyclical , Laudatio Si , or &quot; Praise Be . &quot; 
He chose his papal name , he explains in the text , because he considers St. Francis of Assisi to be &quot; the example par excellence of care for the vulnerable and of an integral ecology lived out joyfully and authentically . &quot; 
His namesake showed that concern for nature is inseparable from justice for the poor , social commitment , and peace within oneself . 
The encyclical &apos;s title refers to the Canticle of the Sun , St. Francis &apos;s song of praise to God for all creation - the foremost expression of environmental holism within the Roman Catholic tradition . 
Yet the Canticle &apos;s praise for &quot; Brother Sun &quot; and &quot; Sister Moon &quot; has seemed so close to nature-worship that some have doubted whether it could ever be included in mainstream Catholic thinking . 
Those doubts have now been laid to rest . 
Francis &quot; predecessor , Pope Benedict XVI , began to turn the Church &apos;s attention toward the need for environmental sustainability . 
Francis has taken this process much further . 
Laudatio Si has received considerable media attention , most of it focused on its uncompromising call for action on climate change . 
That is appropriate , for it is of the utmost importance that the leader of the world &apos;s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics has unequivocally stated that scientific studies attribute &quot; most global warming &quot; in recent decades to greenhouse gases , &quot; released mainly as a result of human activity . &quot; 
There is , however , another aspect of the encyclical that has received much less attention . 
St. Francis is among the most popular Catholic saints because of his reputation as a friend of animals . 
In keeping with that tradition , Laudatio Si amounts to the strongest statement against harming animals ever made by a pope in a document as authoritative as an encyclical . 
Mainstream Christian thinking about animals is rooted in the Book of Genesis , where God is said to have granted man dominion over all the animals . 
St. Thomas Aquinas interpreted that verse as implying that it simply does not matter how man behaves toward animals ; the only reason why we should not inflict whatever cruelties we like on animals is that doing so may lead to cruelty to humans . 
But it remained a minority view , favored by environmentalists and animal protectionists , and Aquinas &apos;s interpretation remained the prevailing Catholic doctrine until the late twentieth century . 
Francis has now come down decisively against the mainstream view , saying that Christians &quot; have at times incorrectly interpreted the Scriptures , &quot; and insisting that &quot; we must forcefully reject the notion that our being created in God &apos;s image and given dominion over the earth justifies absolute domination over other creatures . &quot; 
Our &quot; dominion &quot; over the universe , he declares , should be understood &quot; in the sense of responsible stewardship . &quot; 
Against the background of nearly 2,000 years of Catholic thinking about &quot; man &apos;s dominion , &quot; this is a revolutionary change . 
That statement , which originally appeared in the Catechism of the Catholic Church issued by Pope John Paul II in 1992 , calls it &quot; contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly . &quot; 
To ensure that the sentiment would be noticed , Francis tweeted it . 
( Yes , Francis tweets , using the Twitter handle @ Pontifex . ) 
When is suffering and death &quot; needless &quot; ? 
If you can nourish yourself adequately without eating meat , isn &apos;t buying meat needlessly causing , or at least being complicit in causing , the death of an animal ? 
Isn &apos;t buying eggs from hens who have led a miserable life , jammed into small wire cages , needlessly causing , or being complicit in causing , the suffering of animals ? 
Before Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI , he gave an interview in which he deplored the &quot; industrial use of creatures &quot; such as hens living &quot; so packed together that they become just caricatures of birds . &quot; 
Unfortunately , right now , tens of billions of chickens are being forced to live this way ; indeed , mankind &apos;s realm is full of unnecessarily suffering animals . 
Although animal advocates implored Ratzinger to reiterate his views on animal welfare after he became Pope , he never did so . 
Francis , by contrast , appears to have been referring to factory-farmed animals when he spoke , in The Joy of the Gospel , of &quot; weak and defenseless beings who are frequently at the mercy of economic interests or indiscriminate exploitation . &quot; 
Now , in Laudatio Si , Francis quotes the passage in the Gospel of Luke , in which Jesus says of the birds that &quot; not one of them is forgotten before God . &quot; 
Francis then asks : &quot; How then can we possibly mistreat them or cause them harm ? &quot; 
It is a good question , because we do mistreat them , and on a massive scale . 
Most Roman Catholics participate in this mistreatment , a few by raising chickens , ducks , and turkeys in ways that maximize profit by reducing animal welfare , and the majority by buying the products of factory farms . 
If Pope Francis can change that , he will , in my view , have done more good than any other pope in recent history .
