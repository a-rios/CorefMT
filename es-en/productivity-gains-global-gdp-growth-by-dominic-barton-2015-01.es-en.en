The Coming Productivity Revolution 
NEW YORK - &quot; Red warnings lights are once again flashing on the dashboard of the global economy , &quot; British Prime Minister David Cameron declared after the G-20 &quot; s summit in November . 
But the real worry is not the risk associated with near-term challenges , like Japan &apos;s return to recession in 2014 or the eurozone &apos;s enduring sluggishness ; it is the gale-force headwinds that the entire world will face over the next half-century . 
Despite nerve-wracking ups and downs , the last 50 years delivered an unprecedented global growth dividend . 
Measured according to GDP ( admittedly a flawed metric ) , the world economy expanded sixfold . 
Income per capita almost tripled . 
Inequality among countries has decreased , with more than one billion people lifted out of extreme poverty in the last two decades alone . 
But if we pursue business as usual , the odds of making similarly impressive progress over the next 50 years are not very promising . 
Since 1964 , two key forces have fueled exceptionally fast GDP growth : the expansion of the labor supply , driven by rapid increases in population , and steady productivity gains . 
According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) , the average annual GDP growth rate of 3.5 % in the 19 member countries of the G-20 ( not including the European Union ) and Nigeria owes about 1.8 percentage points to labor and 1.7 points to productivity . 
But , as fertility declines and populations age , the labor engine &apos;s contribution to growth will fall sharply , to little more than 0.3 percentage points of annual growth . 
Even if productivity continues to rise at the same rate , global GDP growth could slow to just over 2 % annually , on average - a 40 % drop from the last 50 years . 
The good news is that this trajectory can be raised . 
The historian Ben Friedman has observed that the &quot; central question &quot; in US history is not &quot; the poverty of the most disadvantaged &quot; or &quot; the success of the most privileged &quot; ; it is &quot; the economic well-being of the broad majority &quot; of the population . 
The same is true on a global level , as billions of aspiring consumers rise up to join the middle class . 
On the labor-market side , the most powerful lever to bolster the majority &apos;s wellbeing would be to increase the employment of women , whose workforce-participation rate still lags behind that of men by as much as 40 % globally . 
Including more women presupposes better childcare and other social support in many countries , as well as further progress on pay equality , including the more equal taxation of second earners . 
Moreover , MGI estimates that addressing barriers like mandatory retirement ages and perverse tax incentives could add about 200 million workers over the age of 65 to the world &apos;s labor pool . 
Efforts to reduce youth unemployment would also help . 
These changes , while important , would have a limited impact , lifting labor &apos;s contribution to future growth from one-fifth to only one-third of post-war levels . 
What the world really needs to do is accelerate productivity - not at a modest pace , but at the economic equivalent of warp speed . 
Fortunately , today &apos;s private-sector labs are bursting with innovations that could spark major productivity-enhancing technological and operational improvements . 
Advanced materials like nanolaminates ( edible lipids ) can , when sprayed on food , provide protection from air or moisture and reduce spoilage . 
Carbon-fiber composites are making cars and airplanes both more resistant and lighter , reducing their fuel consumption . 
And the &quot; Internet of things &quot; will rationalize production processes by detecting potential failures early , boost crop yields by measuring the moisture of fields , and dramatically reduce the cost of remotely monitoring patients &quot; health . 
Just a little further out on the productivity frontier are commercially viable self-driving cars and trucks . 
Likewise , synthetic biology will be possible before too long , with scientists using the huge amount of increasingly available and inexpensive genetic data to design DNA from scratch - a practice that has applications in medicine , agriculture , and even biofuel production . 
But the private sector cannot realize this potential alone . 
Most countries need increased public-sector investment to support essential long-term research and development , and smarter , more innovation-friendly regulation to facilitate future gains . 
Because the biggest opportunities lie in spurring faster productivity catch-up by adopting and diffusing today &apos;s best practices , politicians must keep pushing to reduce trade and regulatory barriers to market integration and competition . 
Perhaps most important , labor markets must be made as flexible as possible , with well-trained workers secured by strong social-safety nets . 
This would enable workers to weather the transition to the jobs of the future and allow the economy to benefit from new waves of wealth and value-generating creative destruction . 
It is worth recalling that more than one-third of employment growth in the US since 1990 has come from jobs that did not exist , or barely existed , 25 years ago . 
Some countries may even want to consider appointing a &quot; growth czar &quot; to connect all of these policy dots . 
In the end , however , the actual growth figures are not the point . 
What matters is ensuring that the wellbeing of as many citizens as possible is improving - and that requires concerted action by business leaders , governments , and civil society .
