The Fallen Pharaoh 
Egypt &apos;s Kifaya Movement has raised the ante in its opposition to President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime by issuing a massive report that dares to name names and detail corruption among the country &apos;s leaders . 
Nothing in Egypt &apos;s long history has ever equaled this airing of the country &apos;s dirtiest laundry . 
Kifaya &apos;s action is especially bold in the midst of a government crackdown to prepare the way for the succession of Mubarak &apos;s son , Gamal . 
For example , a recent law mandates punishment for anyone who spreads rumors that Gamal is to be the next president . 
Corruption in Egypt , as in other Arab states , is so extensive as to undermine the possibility of economic advancement , higher living standards , a free media , independent courts , and democracy . 
Egypt &apos;s political elite , fearful of critical media coverage , defeat in fair elections , and even imprisonment , prefer the existing regime and oppose any significant reform . 
This is a key theme of the report , entitled Corruption in Egypt : A Black Cloud That Never Passes . 
As long as the system is corrupted from above , and as long as the only way common people can deal with the government is through bribery , says the report , inefficiency will reign and people will cheat each other . 
The only way to break this vicious circle is to replace the regime . 
At the same time , as was seen in Yasir Arafat &apos;s Palestine Authority , a corrupt regime encourages people to turn to radical Islamists , who work hard to present themselves as honest . 
If the Muslim Brotherhood comes to power in Egypt one day , Kifaya &apos;s report will explain a lot about how it happened . 
The report begins by joking that Egypt &apos;s name should be changed to &quot; Fasadistan , &quot; the land of corruption . 
It documents cases relating to housing , business , health , transportation , trade , banks , drugs , agriculture , politics , culture , and the media . 
One chapter covers how the security forces control appointments to all key jobs , including in schools and universities . 
But the most dramatic part of the book concerns Mubarak himself . 
An anecdote in the report , which rings true , has Mubarak meeting with officers of the Third Army two years ago . 
Some of the younger officers complained about corruption . 
Mubarak apparently surprised them by saying that he knew that many leading people in the country were thieves , but that he believed they had stolen enough to keep them happy . 
He was afraid , he explained , that if he appointed new people they would start over in their depredations , putting a much heavier burden on Egypt . 
According to the report , however , Mubarak ; his wife , Susan ; and his two sons , Gamal and Alaa , are far from being mere bystanders . 
When Mubarak became president in 1981 , parliament granted him the right to control all military contracts without legislative oversight . 
In effect , the report states , he has a monopoly on military spending and imports , apparently a rich source of kickbacks each time he approves a deal . 
Similarly , Susan Mubarak is the head of as many as 100 charities that often exist only on paper . 
The report charges that as much as $ 5 million might go to one of these institutions in a year , but that a large portion is then siphoned off to her secret foreign bank accounts . 
Ironically , Susan Mubarak , says the report , urged the passage of a 1992 law that permitted Egyptian non-governmental organizations to receive foreign funds - a provision used by some opposition groups - in order to provide channels for the NGO &apos;s she runs . 
The president &apos;s son Gamal also has his own charities that provide him with money , claims Kifaya , including the famous al-Mustaqbal organization . 
Mubarak &apos;s two sons are said by the report to receive profit-making partnerships - without making any investment - in a large number of companies , including Phillip Morris , Skoda Auto , Movenpick , Vodafone , McDonalds , and many others . 
They can also , it adds , obtain unsecured bank loans for themselves and their friends . 
The report maintains that these funds are often used to participate in illegal financial transactions , arms &quot; dealing , and money laundering . 
The sons &quot; interests allegedly also include forays into drug smuggling and illegal exports of archaeological treasures - Egypt &apos;s cultural heritage - in partnership with Culture Minister Faruq Husni , who is supposed to safeguard them . 
Anyone who stands in their way , according to the report , can be thrown into prison on false charges of drug dealing . 
Other cabinet ministers are no better , Kifaya claims . 
Boutros Ghali , nephew of the former UN Secretary-General , Interior Minister Habib Aladli , and such powerful figures as Ibrahim Suleiman and Safwat Sharif are engaged in similar deals , sometimes in partnership with Mubarak &apos;s sons . 
In short , the report says , officials can do what they like , unbound by law or transparency . 
By using the &quot; emergency law , &quot; which has restricted freedom since 1981 , together with censorship and rigged elections , Egypt &apos;s government treats its citizens like serfs . 
Meanwhile , massive corruption is devastating Egypt &apos;s economy , with growth falling by half in the last two years , accompanied by rising unemployment , higher inflation , and currency depreciation . 
Foreign investment is also declining , and local production is paralyzed , necessitating expensive imports . 
The discontent fueled by these failures is a major potential cause of unrest . 
By issuing such a detailed report and daring to name Mubarak and his family as the prime culprits , Kifaya is challenging the regime head-on . 
The need for reform , it argues , is not based merely on a desire for better government or abstract rights , but is necessary to save a country that is being strangled . 
The regime may respond by trying to tighten the noose .
