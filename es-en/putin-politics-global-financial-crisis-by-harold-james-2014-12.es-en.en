Why Did Putin Turn ? 
PRINCETON - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s policy toward his country &apos;s &quot; near abroad &quot; and the West has been badly misunderstood . 
Instead of focusing on broader geopolitical patterns - in particular , the effect of the 2007-2008 financial crisis on global politics - commentators have been turning Kremlin policy into a psychodrama that can be understood only through a deep exploration of the Russian soul . 
The result has been rampant misconceptions about what drove Putin &apos;s shift from what seemed to be a modernizing , conciliatory , and even pro-Western stance to aggressive revisionism . 
Two such flawed explanations for Russia &apos;s current foreign policy have been offered . 
The first , proposed by Germany &apos;s self-described Putin-Versteher ( &quot; Putin sympathizers &quot; ) , is that Russian policy is a logical response to the West &apos;s strategy of encirclement . 
The eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union , they contend , was an unnecessary provocation . 
In fact , none other than George Kennan , the originator of America &apos;s Cold War containment strategy , opposed NATO enlargement in the 1990s on precisely these grounds . 
There are obvious limits to this theory . 
For starters , it is based on the claim that , at the time of the Berlin Wall &apos;s collapse and the Soviet Union &apos;s disintegration , the West promised that there would be no NATO expansion . 
Even Mikhail Gorbachev , on the 25th anniversary of the Wall &apos;s demise , accused the West of not keeping the promises it made in 1989 , instead taking &quot; advantage of Russia &apos;s weakening &quot; in the 1990s to claim &quot; monopoly leadership and domination of the world , &quot; including through NATO enlargement . 
But , in reality , the West never promised not to expand NATO . 
In fact , in the spring of 1990 , the United States presented a powerful case that a reunifying Germany could not be part of two different security systems . 
A more fundamental point is that Russia in the 1990s evinced little concern about the expansion of European economic and security structures into the Soviet Union &apos;s former satellites in Central and Eastern Europe , or even into newly independent former Soviet republics . 
If it had , it probably would not have taken the Kremlin nearly two decades to strike back . 
The second popular explanation of Putin &apos;s shift is that he is irrational , and that Russia &apos;s foreign policy is merely an extension of the fantasies of a man who stages stunts like leading Siberian white cranes along their migration route in a motorized hang glider . 
A better explanation can be found by tracing the chronology of Russia &apos;s foreign-policy shift , which began with the 2008 Georgia crisis . 
When Georgia , which had been flirting with NATO membership , mounted a military response to attacks by secessionists in South Ossetia , an ethnic enclave whose government had been backed by the Kremlin for more than a decade , Russia launched a full-scale invasion to protect the region . 
Russia also bolstered its presence in Abkhazia , another breakaway province . 
The crisis , which was preceded by the large-scale issuance of Russian passports to Georgians , foreshadowed the deployment of Russian forces in Crimea under the pretense of protecting Russian citizens . 
Rhetorically , the shift was apparent even earlier . 
At the 2007 Munich Security Conference , Putin presented a new face , emphasizing the potential of the major emerging economies - Brazil , India , China , and Russia - to provide an alternative to what he viewed as an arbitrary unipolar world order . 
Many observers were shocked by his statements , and took the speech as evidence of his insecurity or irrationality . 
The next year , the financial crisis struck , convincing Putin that his assessment had been prophetic . 
The crisis , in his view , was proof that the days of American global dominance were over . 
In fact , before the crisis , Russia had acquiesced to the logic of global capitalism , recognizing the need to cooperate with multinational corporations to modernize and diversify an economy based on raw materials and energy production . 
After the crisis , however , there was no longer as much to be gained from global markets - at least not in terms of power . 
Instead , Russia &apos;s best option was to cooperate with other countries that had adopted a similar model of state-centered capitalism , especially China . 
Putin &apos;s interpretation of the crisis was underpinned by political developments in America and Europe . 
The US elected a president who appeared intent on scaling back America &apos;s global commitments . 
When the Arab Spring revolutions erupted , the US response was weak and muddled , oscillating between pro-democracy rhetoric and support for anti-Islamist autocrats . 
Europe &apos;s debt crisis - and its leaders &quot; apparent inability to take coordinated action - gave the Kremlin additional ammunition . 
Given that Europe &apos;s overall debts and deficits are much lower than those of the US or Japan , the logic went , it should have been able to avoid polarization and paralysis . 
More broadly , Putin &apos;s belief that the economic crisis was causing the West to disintegrate aligns with traditional Soviet geopolitical thinking . 
As Stephen Kotkin shows in his new biography of Stalin , Soviet policy was strictly rational . 
The Great Depression convinced Stalin that the different factions of capitalism would go to war ; in 1938-1939 , Nazi aggression seemed to vindicate his analysis . 
While Western politicians and economic policymakers were trying to avert Great Depression II , Putin was already working on the assumption that it had arrived . 
For the West , managing the resulting geopolitical imbroglio will be even more challenging than repairing its damaged economies .
