No Country for Young Oligarchs 
CAMBRIDGE - Mikhail Prokhorov , the owner of gold mines in Siberia and a professional basketball team in the United States , is one of Russia &apos;s richest men , with a net worth of $ 18 billion . 
This past June , he agreed to lead a center-right political party to contest December &apos;s parliamentary elections . 
Prokhorov , who is 46 , seemed to believe that his business experience would boost his political prospects . 
Prokhorov was wrong , and resigned in September from the party he had led . 
But , whatever embarrassment he may now be feeling is certainly a better fate than that meted out to Mikhail Khodorkovsky , another Russian oligarch with political ambitions , who is now languishing in his eighth year of imprisonment since boldly challenging Vladimir Putin &apos;s ideas about how Russia should be run . 
Prokhorov &apos;s withdrawal preceded by just a few days the announcement by United Russia , the country &apos;s ruling party , that Putin will seek a third presidential term in 2012 , swapping jobs with the incumbent , President Dmitri Medvedev , who will become Prime Minister . 
That may have been too much for Alexei Kudrin , the finance minister since 2000 , whose disagreement with Medvedev &apos;s increased spending led to his resignation . 
In the absence of new faces or ideas , the only prospect for the coming election year will be to pump more petrodollars into a struggling and grossly inefficient economy . 
That spending binge will feed corruption , inflation , and natural-resource dependency - the three evils with which Kudrin has fought throughout his tenure . 
While Prokhorov is one of several respected Russian oligarchs , Kudrin was the most respected member of the government . 
Their departure from political life is becoming widely viewed as a symptom of deepening divisions among the Putin-era governing elite , even a harbinger of political crisis . 
To be sure , there are many subtle signs of panic at the top about the state of the country &apos;s economy ; but there is no hint that United Russia has a new program to meet these challenges in Putin &apos;s next administration , apart from more censorship of the Internet . 
But all signs of conflict within Russia &apos;s supreme leadership of two - Putin and Medvedev - have disappeared . 
Until September , Medvedev made great efforts to encourage hopes for change . 
But Putin never lost control over the governmental apparatus , and the prospect of his regaining the presidency never dimmed . 
So those hopes were always false . 
Indeed , most of Russia &apos;s rulers have been in office for the better part of a decade . 
Some , like Kudrin , had become visibly impatient for change ; but most remained very content with the status quo . 
As happened during the Cold War , a bureaucratic crisis suddenly exposed the mechanisms by which this elite has wielded power . 
When resigning from his party , Prokhorov publicly accused a Kremlin insider , Vladislav Surkov , of foul play , calling him &quot; the puppet-master &quot; who had &quot; privatized politics in Russia . &quot; 
Surkov , the deputy chief of the presidential administration since 1999 , co-chairs the &quot; Working Group on Civil Society &quot; - one of several bodies created in 2009 to &quot; reset &quot; Russian-American relations - with Michael McFaul , US President Barack Obama &apos;s adviser on Russia . 
The working group may have contributed to ending the war of words , at least on the American side , and McFaul has now been nominated to become US Ambassador to Russia . 
But members of the US Senate , which must confirm McFaul &apos;s nomination , would do well to ask him about Surkov , a man who has overseen the destruction of Russian democratic politics . 
In taking on Surkov , Prokhorov demonstrated his refusal to be a puppet . 
In fact , Prokhorov has much to offer his country . 
His articulate speech and self-made success are unusual among Russian politicians . 
And , with housing , healthcare , and education less accessible now than at the end of the 1980 &quot; s , his political program focuses on what should be done to improve Russia &apos;s human capital - the key problem holding back Russia &apos;s economy . 
According to Prokhorov , productivity in Russia is just 6-10 % of that in the US , which is why the economy struggles even when the price of oil , its main export , is peaking . 
Two million educated professionals have recently emigrated from Russia . 
During the last 20 years , social inequality has grown threefold . 
Russia , Prokhorov concludes , is a feudal society , with Putin &apos;s political monopoly and economic mismanagement exacerbating the so-called &quot; natural-resource curse &quot; that afflicts many oil-exporting countries . 
Such a bleak diagnosis of Russia &apos;s ills could never be the basis for a Kremlin-sponsored political party . 
Nevertheless , for a while Prokhorov tried to play politics according to the Byzantine rules that govern Russian elections - and that benefit United Russia , the Putin-built replica of the Soviet-era Communist Party . 
But playing politics by Putin &apos;s rules requires scores of hired professionals , the so-called &quot; political technologists . &quot; 
Despite his acumen , Prokhorov surrounded himself with such people , pretentious wizards who have turned Russian politics into the revolting spectacle that it is . 
He hoped to break up Putin &apos;s monopoly by using its own tools . 
Today , Prokhorov &apos;s program remains the only tangible result of the $ 26 million that he and his friends invested in his campaign . 
He is probably sorrier for the loss of three months of his time . 
Although he claims that he will not leave politics completely , he now looks like just another oligarch who must choose between capitulation , emigration , and imprisonment . 
Kudrin &apos;s future is no less obscure .
