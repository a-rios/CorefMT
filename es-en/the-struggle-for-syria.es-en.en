The Struggle for Syria 
CAIRO - As the violence in Syria mounts , the international community &apos;s paralysis has become increasingly jarring . 
But the role of external regional forces is almost as important in fueling the domestic bloodshed as what is happening internally . 
If Syria could break free of the negative influences of regional politics , genuine change without continued violence might become possible . 
Syria needs to manage its diverse ethnic and religious composition , and to decide its own position on the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
But that is more difficult when neighboring countries are exploiting the country &apos;s heterogeneous makeup to pursue their own hegemonic agendas . 
Syria , after all , sits at the center of mighty and antagonistic geopolitical forces . 
To the east looms Iran , with its anti-American , anti-Western rhetoric and vast regional ambitions . 
To the south sits Saudi Arabia , with its long friendship with the United States and its inherent hostility toward Iran &apos;s Islamic Republic . 
And to the north is Turkey , a pro-European , largely secular and democratic country that seeks to wield influence across the Arab world . 
The region in and around Syria is also populated by extremist Islamist groups that are attempting to expand their spheres of influence - and that are quick to capitalize on instability in any country . 
Syria is particularly vulnerable in this regard , as extremists incite violence against minority religious groups by using , for example , television stations in Saudi Arabia and Egypt . 
The current regime in Syria , in its ruthless quest to remain in power , refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters &apos; demands for freedom and dignity . 
If it did - and if it met those demands - Islamists would not be able to hijack the demonstrations . 
Peaceful change in Syria can nonetheless be achieved , and the international community can influence that process by recognizing that its continued focus on the country &apos;s &quot; complexity &quot; does nothing for its people . 
In fact , the obsession with Syria &apos;s sectarian rivalries provides destabilizing external forces with the oxygen that their inflammatory rhetoric requires . 
The incitement against Syrian religious minorities promulgated by extremist TV stations , and by people like the Chief Justice of Saudi Arabia &apos;s Supreme Judicial Council , coupled with equally damaging behavior by Iran , if left unchecked , could result in an even worse bloodbath , with Syria &apos;s people drawn into a war of all against all . 
The international community allowed change in Tunisia and Egypt to proceed at those countries &apos; own pace . 
In Syria , a Libyan-style military intervention is not warranted , but diplomatic intervention is needed to allow the country &apos;s people to determine its future . 
The international community &apos;s goal must be to persuade neighboring countries to halt their brazen , unwarranted attacks on parts of Syrian society . 
In particular , the US , which has significant influence in Saudi Arabia , must act to stop attacks by that country &apos;s extremists on Syria &apos;s religious minorities - attacks motivated merely by a desire to provoke sectarian conflict . 
Likewise , efforts to weaken Iran &apos;s disruptive influence in the region must be maintained , while Turkey &apos;s regional ambitions must be kept in mind . 
Optimism about the Syrian people &apos;s future must be tempered by realism about the challenges facing Syria &apos;s opposition movement and the international community alike . 
Dramatic , rapid change could result in prolonged failure . 
Fortunately , Syrians have no predilection for violence . 
For them , peaceful , gradual change is the best option . 
And that requires a national dialogue , overseen by the international community , aimed at bolstering internal unity - and thus at protecting the country from regional interference . 
The situation in Syria is usually - and rightly - described as an intricate , multi-dimensional playing field with a wide variety of political actors and competing interests . 
But there has been an inadequate focus on the Syrian people &apos;s simple desire for genuine reform , greater personal freedom , and more economic opportunity . 
Syrians have experienced uninterrupted dictatorship for 40 years , and , with it , extreme economic hardship , including high unemployment , rising food prices , and endemic corruption . 
They are also now suffering from water shortages and a budget deficit that has been exacerbated by declining oil revenues . 
But Syrians are a remarkably resilient , resourceful people , as well as being young and well educated 
With international assistance in developing Syria &apos;s democratic institutions and political infrastructure , we can build a robust civil society that can assert its own identity and sovereignty , independent of undue outside influence . 
A new Syria , based on democratic principles , would not only benefit Syrians , but would be a force for stability throughout the region .
