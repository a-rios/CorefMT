Europe &apos;s Subprime Quagmire 
BRUSSELS - Back in 2007-2008 , when the financial crisis was still called the &quot; subprime &quot; crisis , Europeans felt superior to the United States . 
European bankers surely knew better than to hand out so-called &quot; NINJA &quot; ( no income , no job , no assets ) loans . 
These days , however , Europeans have little reason to feel smug . 
Their leaders seem unable to come to grips with the eurozone &apos;s debt crisis . 
Banks in Ireland and Spain are discovering that their customers are losing their jobs and income as the construction bust hits the national economies . 
And one could argue that a loan to the government of Greece or Portugal affords little more security than a NINJA loan . 
Indeed , lending to governments and banks in the European periphery represents the European equivalent of subprime lending in the US ( which was also concentrated in a few sunshine states ) . 
Given the many similarities between the two crises &quot; basic features , European leaders could learn a lot from the US experience . 
The first lesson is that , despite the limited overall volume of subprime loans , the subprime crisis could blow up into the biggest financial crisis in living memory , because an overstretched financial system was unable to cope with even limited losses . 
Similarly , the combined debt of Greece , Ireland , and Portugal is small relative to the eurozone economy , but the European banking system is still so weak that these countries &quot; debt problems can create a systemic crisis . 
A second lesson is that dealing successfully with a financial crisis requires , most immediately , a strong dose of liquidity . 
Then , once the financial system has been stabilized , a combination of debt restructuring and recapitalization is required . 
Has the European Union followed this recipe ? 
After some hesitation , Europe showed that it could manage the first phase - a liquidity injection to prevent systemic collapse . 
Greece and Ireland received funding when they were shut out of the capital market . 
And the last EU summit announced the creation of a permanent European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) - a sort of European Monetary Fund with an effective lending capacity of € 500 billion . 
This is equivalent to $ 700 billion , the same magnitude as the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) instituted in late 2008 to keep US financial markets from collapsing . 
The ESM should be sufficient to deal with the refinancing needs of Greece , Ireland , and Portugal . 
It might even be sufficient to address Spanish government debt , though this would be a stretch . 
But , just as the $ 700 billion TARP did not assuage nervousness financial markets in 2008 , so the ESM &apos;s € 500 billion seems to have left investors unimpressed . 
The risk premia on the sovereign debt of Greece , Ireland , and others have not diminished . 
The premia paid by Portugal have actually soared since major ratings agencies , explicitly citing the agreement reached at the EU summit in late March , lowered the country &apos;s sovereign-debt rating . 
In the US , the turning point came with the authorities &quot; stress tests of banks in early 2009 . 
The tests were seen as credible ; indeed , their results prompted US officials to force several major banks to increase their capital . 
This did not happen in last year &apos;s European version of the US stress tests , and this year &apos;s stress tests in Europe are unlikely to be tougher . 
The reason is simple : the US authorities checked whether their banks could survive the sort of downturn that the market feared most at the time . 
By contrast , European authorities refuse to test the scenario that the market currently fears most : losses on loans to banks and governments on Europe &apos;s periphery . 
A third lesson derives from a little-noticed but vital aspect of the US experience : debt reduction is comparatively easy in the US , because the no-recourse feature of most mortgages there limits repayment obligations to the value of the house . 
Moreover , the US bankruptcy code can free consumers of their debt within months . 
Of course , the millions of personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures in the US are not popular , but they provide debt relief each time , thereby enabling households to make a fresh start . 
This steady flow of debt relief is allowing US consumer spending to recover slowly . 
By contrast , debt restructuring for either banks or governments is politically unacceptable in Europe . 
This implies that the crisis is likely to persist much longer than in the US , because households in Spain and Ireland will labor for decades to service mortgages on houses that they can no longer afford . 
And the Greek government faces an endless succession of budget cuts , with each step being more difficult than the last as the economy spirals down a black hole . 
Debt relief created fewer problems for banks in the US because a significant proportion of the subprime loans packaged into AAA-rated securities had been sold to gullible foreigners . 
A good proportion of the losses on subprime lending was thus borne by banks from Northern Europe , leaving these banks in no position to sustain further losses on their European peripheral lending . 
But this should compel a strong recapitalization program - not weak stress tests . 
Europe is making a fundamental mistake by allowing the two key elements of any resolution of the crisis - namely , debt restructuring and real stress tests for banks - to remain taboo . 
As long as successive EU summits persist in this mistake , the crisis will fester and spread , eventually threatening the stability of the eurozone &apos;s entire financial system .
