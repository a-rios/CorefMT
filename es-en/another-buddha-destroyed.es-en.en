Another Buddha Destroyed 
NEW YORK  -  
Political and cultural leaders from around the globe condemned the attacks . 
Offers of help poured in . 
Everyone asked : will the world be ready next time ? 
Alas , the answer is a resounding &quot; no . &quot; 
In northwest Pakistan &apos;s Swat valley armed Islamist militants recently attacked one of the oldest and most important sculptures of Buddhist art . 
Dating from around the beginning of the Christian era , and carved into a 130-foot-high rock , the seated image of the Buddha was second in importance in South Asia only to the Bamiyan Buddhas . 
This , moreover , was the second attack in less than a month . 
Murtaza Razvi of Pakistan &apos;s Dawn newspaper has pointed out that the image that was attacked was not in a remote area . 
In fact , it was next to the central road that runs through the valley . 
Despite repeated requests by Pakistani archeologists to the local authorities to protect the seated Buddha and other sites , especially after the first attack , no action was taken . 
In fact , militants were able to carry out their work - drilling holes in the rock , filling them with explosives , and detonating them - in broad daylight . 
They did this not once , but twice . 
The first time , the image escaped heavy damage because of the militants &quot; incompetence . 
The second time , they were more successful , destroying not only the sculpture &apos;s face , but also its shoulders and feet . 
As if that were not enough , there are now reports of a third attack . 
In 1995 , I traveled through the Swat valley to study the area &apos;s Buddhist treasures . 
Carved in the cliff side or protected in small beautiful museums , these remarkable objects were the pride and joy of local Muslims , followers of the faith for more than a millennium . 
As a non-Muslim , Indian woman , I was able to travel through the region without any fear and received warm support from local residents . 
People of all stripes welcomed me , and were often willing to take me to important Buddhist sites . 
Today , little over a decade later , the atmosphere is so poisoned that neither local community leaders nor the local police came forward to protect these monuments or claim them as their own . 
Even sadder is that while Pakistani newspapers widely condemned these attacks and criticized local officials &quot; indifference , there has been almost no coverage in the international press . 
Can it be that after the Iraq war , and the dismaying images of looting at the National Museum in Baghdad , we have lost our capacity to be outraged ? 
Or is it that we have become so inured to bad news surrounding the war on terror that we have no desire to know more ? 
There is a vast number of important Buddhist sites in Swat and other areas of northwest Pakistan . 
At this point , all of them are under threat of destruction , thanks to the influential voice of the Islamist leader Mullah Fazlullah , whose father-in-law , Sufi Mohammad , founded one of the extremist orders . 
This order was responsible for bringing more than 10,000
