China &apos;s Risky Finances 
BEIJING - In the coming years , China &apos;s government will have to confront significant challenges to achieve stable , inclusive , and sustainable economic growth . 
But , with mounting fiscal and financial risks threatening to derail its efforts , policymakers must act quickly to design and implement prudent , forward-looking policies . 
The most significant medium- and long-term threat to China &apos;s fiscal position lies in the system of implicit guarantees that the central government has established for local-government debt . 
In the wake of the global financial crisis , local governments borrowed heavily from banks to support China &apos;s massive stimulus program , amassing ¥ 10.7 trillion ( $ 1.7 trillion ) worth of debt by 2011 . 
China &apos;s leaders hope to control potential risks stemming from local-government investment vehicles ( LGIVs ) by limiting bank lending . 
The balance of bank loans to LGIVs increased only slightly in 2012 , to ¥ 9.3 trillion , from ¥ 9.1 trillion in 2011 . 
And the China Banking Regulatory Commission has called on banks to retain last year &apos;s LGIV loan quotas for 2013 , and to ensure that the overall balance of loans to LGIVs does not exceed the 2011 year-end total . 
But LGIVs obtained a massive amount of financing in 2012 by issuing bonds and trust loans . 
This includes ¥ 250 billion in local-government bonds , ¥ 636.8 billion in urban-investment bonds , and technical cooperation trust-fund projects totaling ¥ 501.6 billion , representing year-on-year increases of ¥ 50 billion , ¥ 380.6 billion , and ¥ 247.9 billion , respectively . 
Even with these funds , however , local governments have struggled to make ends meet . 
Tax reforms implemented in 1994 caused local governments &quot; share of national fiscal revenue to decline steadily , from 78 % in 1993 to 52 % in 2011 . 
Over the same period , however , their share of total government expenditure increased from 72 % to 85 % . 
The need to fill the resulting gap has forced local governments to depend on land sales . 
But land-related income has plummeted over the last two years , from 32 % of total revenue in 2010 to 20 % last year . 
Measures mandated by the central government to control surging real-estate prices will continue to reinforce this trend , increasing pressure on local-government revenues . 
The risk stemming from local-government debt is exacerbated further by massive amounts of non-explicit debt acquired through arrears , credits , and guarantees . 
When a local government is no longer able to service its debt , the central government will have to place its own fiscal capacity at risk by assuming the responsibility . 
China &apos;s financial stability is also under threat , as lenders turn to unofficial channels to circumvent tighter government regulations on the formal banking system . 
Perhaps the biggest risks stem from China &apos;s rapidly growing shadow banking system . 
Shadow banking can be conducted through trust loans ( extended by trust companies ) , entrusted loans ( company-to-company credits brokered by financial institutions ) , bank acceptances ( company-issued drafts or bills that are endorsed by banks ) , and corporate bonds ( debt securities issued by companies directly to investors ) . 
These instruments &quot; combined worth reached ¥ 5.9 trillion last year , led by corporate bonds ( ¥ 2.3 trillion ) . 
New lending by trust companies - which rose by more than 400 % last year - is generating significant solvency risk in China , given that it is frequently extended to higher-risk entities , including real-estate developers and LGIVs . 
A spike in defaults could destabilize the entire financial system and trigger an economic downturn . 
And trust loans tied to LGIVs ultimately enjoy the same implicit guarantee from the central government as official bank loans . 
Regular banks , too , are trying to evade new regulations by ramping up off-balance-sheet lending . 
Indeed , it is increasingly common for banks &quot; off-balance-sheet lending to exceed newly issued balance-sheet credit . 
In 2011-2012 , such lending grew by ¥ 1.1 trillion , reaching ¥ 3.6 trillion ( 23 % of total bank financing ) , while balance-sheet lending increased by only ¥ 732 billion . 
But the former is usually implicit and uncertain , making it vulnerable to default . 
If faced with such losses , banks might choose to protect their reputations by using official funds for repayment , transferring the risk onto their balance sheets . 
More generally , the rapid expansion of credit risks increasing inflationary pressure and fueling the formation of asset bubbles . 
Conversely , when the monetary authority tightens credit too quickly , asset prices become more volatile , resulting in more non-performing loans and triggering economic shocks . 
China &apos;s government must implement prudent macroeconomic policies now to minimize escalation of these risks later . 
Medium- and long-term fiscal stability will require policies that account for the growing disparity between fiscal revenues , which are suffering from slowing GDP growth , and expenditures , which will be driven up by structural tax cuts and increased social-welfare spending . 
In order to manage growing pressure on public finances , China must establish highly efficient public-budget and fiscal-restraint systems . 
To this end , the government must tighten financial supervision , improve budgetary management , and enhance the operational efficiency of fiscal policies . 
China also needs a new financing model for infrastructure projects . 
The current system relies heavily on LGIV loans and fiscal expenditures . 
But local governments cannot continue to rely on revenue from land sales to repay their debts or support current spending . 
More stable financing channels and stronger enforcement of operating standards are essential to support rapid urbanization . 
As prudent fiscal and financial policies gradually stabilize China &apos;s economy , monetary policy must remain neutral . 
Loosening monetary policy would increase significantly the risks stemming from local-government debt and shadow banking , while tightening monetary policy would fully expose those risks , posing a serious systemic threat . 
With the right balance of vision and caution , China &apos;s leaders can tackle the buildup of fiscal and financial risk . 
If they fail to act decisively , China &apos;s leadership of the future global economy will hang in the balance .
