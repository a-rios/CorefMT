The Changing Face of France in Africa 
This week , many African heads of state will attend the 24th France-Africa summit in Cannes . 
Behind the glitz , the summit may mark a watershed in France &apos;s relationship with Africa . 
France is preparing for its presidential elections this May , and as that battle for the presidency heats up , so , too , does the contest to forge new ties with Africa . 
In the post-Cold War era , &quot; multilateralism &quot; has become the latest political buzzword . 
Moreover , mistakes in Africa during the 1990 &quot; s , particularly in Rwanda , together with corruption scandals , have put pressure on French leaders to bring dramatic changes in foreign policy . 
In their wake , a notable shift has emerged , with a new generation of politicians claiming to herald a fresh approach and profound changes in French policy towards Africa . 
However , much work remains to be done to consolidate that shift . 
President Jacques Chirac launched important reforms such as redeploying French military forces in Africa , and restructuring how France distributes aid . 
Moreover , African affairs , and international politics more generally , do not seem to be a priority for the 2007 presidential candidates . 
Ségolène Royal , despite having been raised in Senegal when it was a French colony , appears disinterested in Africa , and her opponent , Nicolas Sarkozy , has evinced an interest in Africa only in the context of illegal immigration . 
The stark truth is that without strong political will and clear arguments , any future French president is unlikely to curb the strength of lobby groups and old networks that have dominated France &apos;s relationship with Africa . 
It is against this backdrop that African leaders will arrive in Cannes for the France-Africa summit , an event that in many respects will be a stage for Chirac to bid them farewell . 
The EU has imposed targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe , including a visa ban on senior officials , and there were protests when Mugabe appeared in Paris in February 2003 for the last France-Africa summit on European territory . 
Whatever is decided about Zimbabwe &apos;s participation at the Cannes summit will also have an impact on plans for a major EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon this fall , during Portugal &apos;s presidency of the EU . 
During the last Portuguese Presidency ( January-June 2000 ) , the EU-Africa Summit had to be cancelled because of a visa ban on Zimbabwean officials and the reluctance of Africans to attend if Mugabe was excluded . 
That issue is likely to continue to cause division , both within Europe and between Europe and Africa . 
A coalition of European civil-society organizations opposes Zimbabwean government participation on human rights grounds . 
France would prefer to invite Mugabe and his officials to its summit in Cannes , but the British government has lobbied against this . 
By contrast , a number of African states , in particular South Africa , have lobbied for Mugabe &apos;s participation . 
Indeed , South African President Thabo Mbeki has threatened not to participate unless Mugabe is invited . 
For France , there is no easy resolution . 
It needs British support on issues such as Côte d &apos;Ivoire in the UN Security Council , but it also wants to improve its bilateral relationship with South Africa for political and economic reasons . 
Whatever happens regarding Zimbabwe in Cannes will directly influence the EU-Africa summit later this year . 
Unfortunately , that controversy may also overshadow the incipient changes in French policy .
