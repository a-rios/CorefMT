The Future of the Japan-US Alliance 
Cambridge - Many analysts currently detect malaise in Japan about its alliance with the United States . 
Some of this relates to North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons and a concern that the US will not adequately represent Japan &apos;s interests ( such as accounting for Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea years ago . ) 
Other issues concern the basing of US marines in Okinawa and sharing the costs of moving some to Guam . 
The list is long , but they might best be thought of as &quot; housekeeping &quot; issues : many a couple can quarrel over them without contemplating divorce . 
There is a deeper level of concern , however , which relates to Japan &apos;s fear of being marginalized as the US turns toward a rising China . 
For example , some Japanese complain that China receives far more attention than Japan in the American election campaign . 
Such anxiety is not surprising : US and Japanese defense capabilities are not symmetrical , and that is bound to agitate the more dependent party . 
Over the years , various suggestions have been made with a view to making the alliance more symmetrical , including that Japan become a &quot; normal &quot; country with a full panoply of military capabilities , even nuclear weapons . 
Even if Japan implemented them , they would still not equal the capacity of the US or eliminate the asymmetry . 
It is worth noting that during the Cold War , America &apos;s European allies had similar anxieties about dependency and abandonment , despite their own military capabilities . 
The real guarantee of American resolve to defend Japan is the presence of US troops and bases , and cooperation on issues - such as ballistic missile defense - aimed at protecting both Americans and Japanese . 
Moreover , there are two good answers to the question of whether the US would abandon Japan in favor of China : values and threat . 
Japan and the US , unlike China , are both democracies , and they share many values . 
In addition , both Japan and the US face a common challenge from China &apos;s rise and have a strong interest in ensuring that it does not become a threat . 
The US regards a triangular Japan-China-US relationship as the basis of stability in East Asia , and wants good relations between all three of its legs . 
But the triangle is not equilateral , because the US is allied with Japan , and China need not become a threat to either country if they maintain that alliance . 
On the other hand , China &apos;s power should not be exaggerated . 
A recent poll indicates that one-third of Americans believe that China will &quot; soon dominate the world , &quot; while 54 % see its emergence as a &quot; threat to world peace . &quot; 
To be sure , measured by official exchange rates , China is the world &apos;s fourth largest economy , and it is growing at 10 % annually . 
Furthermore , China &apos;s lags far behind in military power , and lacks America &apos;s &quot; soft power &quot; resources , such as Hollywood and world-class universities . 
China &apos;s internal evolution also remains uncertain . 
It has lifted 400 million people out of poverty since 1990 , but another 400 million live on less that $ 2 per day . 
Along with enormous inequality , China has a migrant labor force of 140 million , severe pollution , and rampant corruption . 
Nor has its political evolution matched its economic progress . 
While more Chinese are free today than ever before in Chinese history , China is far from free . 
The danger is that Party leaders , trying to counter the erosion of communism , will turn to nationalism to provide ideological glue , which could lead to an unstable foreign policy - including , for example , conflict over Taiwan . 
Faced with such uncertainty , a wise policy combines realism with liberalism . 
By reinforcing their alliance , the US and Japan can hedge against uncertainty while at the same time offering China integration into global institutions as a &quot; responsible stakeholder . &quot; 
The greatest danger is that an escalating fear of enmity in the three countries becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
In that sense , the US-Japan alliance rests on deeply rooted joint interests . 
There is a new dimension to the alliance , however , and to the relationship with China . This year , China surpassed the US as the world &apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases . 
China argues , correctly , that it is still behind the US and Japan in per capita emissions , but this does not reduce the costs imposed on the world ( including Japan and the US ) . 
A cooperative program that helps China to burn its coal more cleanly is in the interests of all three countries . 
In general , transnational threats such as climate change or pandemics can cause damage on a scale equivalent to military conflict . 
( In 1918 , avian flu killed more people than died in World War I ) . 
Responding to such threats requires cooperation , soft power , and non-military instruments , and this is an area in which Japan is a much more equal and important ally . 
If anything , the new and growing dimension of transnational threats , when added to traditional security concerns , makes the future of the Japan-US alliance look more promising than ever .
