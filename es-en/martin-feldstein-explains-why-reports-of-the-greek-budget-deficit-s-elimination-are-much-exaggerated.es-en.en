The Greek Budget Myth 
CAMBRIDGE - Recently , newspaper headlines declared that Greece would have a balanced budget for 2013 as a whole . 
The news came as quite a shock : Recall that when Greek officials came clean about the true state of their country &apos;s public finances in 2010 , the budget deficit was more than 10 % of GDP - a moment of statistical honesty that triggered the eurozone debt crisis . 
It seemed too good to be true that the Greek deficit would be completely eliminated in just three years . 
In fact , it is too good to be true . 
Any reader who went beyond the headlines soon discovered that the prediction of a zero budget deficit was in fact misleading . 
The International Monetary Fund was predicting only that Greece would have a zero &quot; primary &quot; budget deficit in 2013 . 
A &quot; primary &quot; budget deficit ( or surplus ) is the difference between a government &apos;s outlays for everything excluding the interest payments that it must pay on its debt and its receipts from taxes and other charges . 
In the case of Greece , the interest payments apply to government debt held by Greek individuals and institutions , as well as to government debt held by the IMF , the European Central Bank , and other foreign lenders . 
The overall budget deficit is still predicted to be 4.1 % of Greece &apos;s GDP in 2013 - a substantial improvement compared to 2010 but still far from fiscal balance . 
The difference between the overall deficit and the primary deficit implies that the interest on the Greek national debt this year will be 4.1 % of GDP . 
Moreover , the Greek government &apos;s interest payments are exceptionally low . 
Given that its debt will still be about 170 % of GDP this year , the 4.1 % -of-GDP interest bill implies that the Greek government pays an average interest rate of just 2.4 % - far less than the nearly 9 % rate that the market is now charging on ten-year Greek government bonds . 
The difference reflects a combination of the lower rate on short-term debt and the highly favorable terms on which Greece is now able to borrow from official lenders at the IMF and the ECB . 
If Greece had to borrow at the market interest rate on ten-year bonds , its deficit would rise by 6.5 % of the Greek government debt or 11 % of GDP . 
In this case , the overall Greek deficit would be about 15 % of GDP , putting its debt on a rapidly exploding path . 
Greece &apos;s economic weakness increases the current level of the deficit . 
Five years of declining GDP have depressed tax receipts and increased transfer payments . 
The IMF estimates that these cyclical effects on revenue and outlays have raised the overall deficit by nearly 5 % of Greek GDP . 
On a cyclically adjusted basis , Greece &apos;s overall budget would show a surplus of 0.6 % of GDP this year . 
This also implies that if Greece could escape from its current recession , its national debt would decline , both absolutely and as a share of GDP . 
More generally , the national debt of any country grows by the size of its budget deficit or declines by the size of its budget surplus . 
Even an economy with an overall budget deficit will have a declining government debt / GDP ratio if the growth rate of its nominal GDP exceeds that of its debt . 
For Greece , with an overall deficit of 4.1 % of GDP and a debt / GDP ratio of 170 % , the debt ratio would fall if the combination of inflation and real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP growth exceeded 2.4 % . 
Stated differently , now that Greece has achieved a zero primary budget deficit , its debt burden will decline if its nominal growth rate exceeds the average interest that it pays on its government debt . 
Budget deficits and the resulting national debt are important not only in themselves ; they also contribute to a country &apos;s current-account deficit , which is the difference between its level of domestic investment by businesses and households in structures and equipment and the amount that it saves to finance those investments . 
That amount , which includes the saving of businesses and households , is reduced by the amount that the government borrows . 
In the case of Greece , the saving of businesses and households exceeds the level of investment in businesses and housing by just enough to outweigh the dissaving by the government , resulting in a very small current-account surplus . 
Stated differently , Greece is now able to finance its current level of consumption and investment , including government and private spending , without relying on capital inflows from the rest of the world . 
Looking ahead , the IMF predicts that Greece will have a gradually rising primary surplus and a gradually declining overall deficit over the next several years . 
But , unless Greece is able to increase its rate of economic growth , the budget will remain in deficit and the debt will remain at nearly its current share of GDP .
