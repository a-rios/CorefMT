Civil Society Unbound 
MOSCOW - The challenges facing civil-society organizations are greater in Russia than in many parts of the world , but the challenges facing civil society itself are similar everywhere . 
Indeed , around the world there is a gap between civil-society organizations and the societies they profess to serve . 
Civil-society organizations do not gain power through elections ( legitimate or otherwise ) , but through reaching the broader world . 
In short , their goal is to build civil society itself . 
They are most successful when people behave as part of civil society without necessarily being &quot; civil-society &quot; professionals . 
That is , they will do such things as take care of their own health , engage in public discussions or blog about safety conditions in their community , rate school performance , organize weekly runs for dog owners , care for their local forests or rivers- as part of their lives , not as part of their jobs . 
One area of concern for civil society nowadays is the press and new media . 
In many places today information is flowing more than ever , but mass media are under both political and financial pressure . 
Most people think of a free press as a way to keep track of what governments are doing - and so it is . 
That is why the press as a whole , and journalists in particular , are so frequently targeted by the authorities . 
When media outlets aren &apos;t owned - and tamed - by the authorities or people close to them , they still face censorship , intimidation , tax audits , and occasionally assassination of their journalists and editors . 
In Russia in particular , the situation is mixed . 
The government owns or controls most of the mass media - the major newspapers and television stations - but there is an abundance of mostly marginalized publications and radio stations ( to say nothing of the Internet ) that retain a remarkable degree of independence . 
They are not directly censored , but they operate under the chilling knowledge that they can be shut down on vague charges at any moment . 
And , of course , most of them are struggling to survive financially . 
Yet there &apos;s more to journalism than keeping an eye on the government . 
Journalism &apos;s other task is to reflect a society back to itself - to spread an accurate picture of its current situation , to share information about the activities of private citizens and businesses as they build civil society , and to encourage citizens to become active in improving their own lives and developing their communities . 
Consider health care . 
As far as I &apos;m concerned , the ultimate goal should be not so much a better health care system , but a population so healthy that it hardly needs health care . 
Health problems may take you to a clinic , but many of them start with how you behave at home - what you eat and drink , whether you smoke or exercise or sleep enough , etc . 
This is the kind of thinking that was driving us at a recent health care working group gathered as part of the recent Civil Society Summit organized in Moscow by the Eurasia Foundation , the New Eurasia Foundation and the CSIS . ( I was there as a Eurasia Foundation board member . ) 
To tackle these problems , we came up with an &quot; open data / information liquidity &quot; project , which will advocate and organize the publication , exchange , aggregation , and analysis of health data - not just general statistics , but specific data about health outcomes in terms of drugs and treatments , hospital performance , and the like . 
Of course , many of those statistics are not even collected , yet alone published . 
But we can start with what exists , and by so doing create demand for the rest . 
In the United States , people are already rating their own doctors at sites such as RateMDs.com and vitals.com ; third-party doctor and hospital ratings are available at HealthGrades.com. 
Civil-society groups don &apos;t often run hospitals directly , but they can make their performance more transparent . 
So there are plans afoot to develop and distribute tools to analyze information , discover correlations ( data-mining ) , and display the results as graphs and charts . 
But , again , health really begins at home , so the real victory - and one where such civil-society cooperation may have a more immediate impact - is to give people better data about themselves and what they should be doing for their own health . 
That includes everything from nutritional information and baby care , to ( ultimately ) records of each person &apos;s own health and treatments , and it starts with using new media to reach people where they live , with content that &apos;s relevant . In the Soviet Union , they used to call this &quot; sanitary propaganda , &quot; but it was widely disregarded . 
One Russian friend told me , &quot; Whenever we would read an article about the health dangers of butter , we would immediately run out and buy as much butter as we could find , because we knew it meant there would be a butter shortage . &quot; 
Today , that type of information is called &quot; healthy lifestyle promotion . &quot; 
We are also working on a project along these lines , reaching out to target populations with two-way new media such as the Internet and mobile phones , rather than harangues in newspapers and TV . 
Imagine a program where pregnant women could sign up by cell phone for weekly reminders and updates , and to answer questions such as , &quot; Is the baby kicking ? &quot; 
If not , she could be referred to a local clinic . 
When I made those same points in a wrap-up to the Civil Society Summit as a whole , I was interrupted by none other than US president Barack Obama , who was in Moscow for his summit with President Dmitry Medvedev but also took the time to listen our gathering of civil-society organizations . 
Obama apologized for arriving late , and added : &quot; That &apos;s why we have civil society . 
You just can &apos;t rely on politicians ! &quot;
