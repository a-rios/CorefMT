Two Models for Europe 
MUNICH - Interest rates for public debt within the eurozone have spread once again , just as they did before the introduction of the euro . 
Balance-of-payment disparities are steadily increasing . 
The sovereign-debt crisis is eating its way from the periphery to the core , and the exodus of capital is accelerating . 
Since the summer , € 300 billion , in net terms , may well have fled from Italy and France . 
The printing presses at the Banque de France and the Banca d &apos;Italia are working overtime to make up for the outflow of money . 
But this only furthers the exodus , because creating more money prevents interest rates from rising to a point at which capital would find it attractive to stay . 
If Europe had the same rules as the United States , where the Federal Reserve &apos;s regional banks have to pay the Fed for any special money creation with securities collateralized in gold , they would not create this much supplementary money , and capital flight would be limited . 
Instead , local printing of money is essentially aiding and abetting the exodus . 
If the eurozone does not want to embrace capital controls , it has only two alternatives : make the local printing of money more difficult , or offer investment guarantees in countries that markets view as insecure . 
The first option is the American way , which also demands that the buyers bear the risks inherent in public or private securities . 
The taxpayer is not called upon , even in extreme cases , and states can go bankrupt . 
The second option is the socialist way . 
Investment guarantees will lead , via issuance of Eurobonds , to socialization of the risks inherent in public debt . 
Because all the member states provide one another with free credit guarantees , interest rates for government securities can no longer differ in accordance with creditworthiness or likelihood of repayment . 
The less sound a country is , the lower its effective expected interest rate . 
The socialist way follows necessarily from the free access to the printing press that has so far characterized the eurozone . 
As long as banks - and thus governments , which sell their debt to the banks - can draw cheap credit up to any amount from the European System of Central Banks , Europe will remain volatile . 
The exodus of capital will continue , and enormous compensation claims of the European core &apos;s central banks , particularly the German Bundesbank and the Dutch central bank , will pile up . 
In Germany , these compensation claims amount to half of the country &apos;s entire net foreign wealth , or € 500 billion ( $ 653 billion ) . 
Since these claims would probably be lost should the euro collapse , the political pressure to give way finally to Eurobonds is becoming overwhelming . 
But German acquiescence would be a disastrous result for Europe . 
The European Financial Stability Facility in Luxemburg would become a socialist planning agency , organizing flows of public capital in Europe and thwarting markets &quot; allocative function . 
The consequence would be reduced growth , owing to a misallocation of scarce capital , and economic stagnation in the core areas . 
Matters are made no better by controlling credit flows via a fiscal government , which is what the eurozone countries have now decided they want . 
As long as the debtors co-determine the rules , more capital will flow under such an arrangement than markets would permit . 
That distortion will become apparent even within the countries that benefit from the additional credit , because Eurobonds will , for the time being , provide security only for government debt . 
Private debtors will continue to have difficulties finding capital , so the state will expand relative to the private sector . 
The ECB &apos;s founding chief economist , Otmar Issing , has referred to this as a road to serfdom . 
But it is not a smooth road , because it threatens resistance by the capital-exporting countries &quot; taxpayers and trade unions against the outflow of capital . 
In Germany , in particular , enormous resistance will build up if the country - via the introduction of Eurobonds - is driven back into the crisis that it underwent as a result of the interest-rate convergence that followed the introduction of the euro . 
Only the American alternative is viable . 
Short- and long-term interest-rate spreads are determined by the economy &apos;s creditworthiness , and whoever wants low interest rates has to provide real collateral . 
The American route does not necessarily imply a heavy-handed approach vis-à-vis the crisis countries . 
It can be combined with a system of measured , limited help in the sense of partial coverage of investors against a country &apos;s insolvency . 
This model , contemplated by the European Economic Advisory Group at CESifo , would retain the disciplinary effects of interest-rate spreads while capping them in order to limit panicked extremes in the capital markets . 
It offers the last chance to avoid debt socialism .
