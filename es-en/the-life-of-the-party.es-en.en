The Life of the Party 
Nothing illustrates the dichotomy between hopes and reality in China than the hype around the upcoming 17th Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) Congress . 
The CCP calls a &quot; congress &quot; every five years to pick a new Central Committee , choose the nine members who comprise the Standing Committee of the Politburo , China &apos;s supreme ruling council , and thrash out new initiatives and policies . 
Because it is almost certain that CCP General Secretary , President , and commander-in-chief Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao will receive second five-year terms , all eyes are on whether Hu will succeed in elevating one or more of his younger allies to the Standing Committee . 
The backroom struggle is intense , but it now looks like the Party Secretary of Liaoning Province , Li Keqiang , and of Shanghai , Xi Jinping , will be promoted . 
Li , 52 , deemed a &quot; Hu clone , &quot; has long been groomed by Hu for the top leadership . 
Both men are former first secretaries of the Communist Youth League , one of Hu &apos;s major power bases . 
But the sudden emergence of the 54-year-old Xi , a former Zhejiang Province party boss who became Shanghai &apos;s top cadre seven months ago , says much about the CCP &apos;s delicate factional balance and the behind-the-scenes jockeying . 
Despite his apparent grip on most levers of power , Hu lacks the authority of a Deng Xiaoping , and thus must strike a balance among the CCP &apos;s major factions regarding the division of spoils at the top . 
Xi enjoys the backing of incumbent PSC members associated with the Shanghai faction once led by ex-president Jiang Zemin , as well as the majority of party elders . 
As the only son of liberal party elder Xi Zhongxun , Xi is also a ranking CCP &quot; Princeling . &quot; 
The low-key Shanghai party boss is acceptable to Hu partly because the elder Xi was a comrade-in-arms of late liberal party chief Hu Yaobang , Hu &apos;s former mentor . 
But there is little question that Hu would prefer Li Keqiang to become the only member of what is called the &quot; Fifth Generation &quot; represented on the PSC . 
Xi , it is said , is now in line to become vice-president and executive head of the party Secretariat , while Li will most likely get the post of executive vice-premier . 
Under CCP tradition , Xi would then take over from Hu as party General Secretary and President while Li would assume Wen Jiabao &apos;s job as premier at the 18th Congress in 2012 . 
The likelihood that factional dynamics will wreak havoc on policymaking has , however , diminished due to significant change in the nature of CCP factions during the past decade . 
Beginning with the era of ex-president Jiang , most factions no longer divide along ideological lines . 
Such power blocs are now more concerned with obtaining more senior posts and political resources for their supporters and more economic benefits for the regions they represent and the businesses run by factional affiliates . 
Thus , Hu &apos;s Communist Youth League faction is preoccupied with advancing the careers of professional party functionaries who are specialists in areas including ideology , organization , and propaganda . 
The Shanghai faction , now led by incumbent Standing Committee member and Vice-President Zeng Qinghong , is more interested in preserving the Greater Shanghai Region &apos;s status as the &quot; dragonhead &quot; of China &apos;s economy . 
This is one reason why Zeng , the principal adviser of Jiang Zemin , has apparently thrown his support behind Xi . 
While he was party boss of nearby Zhejiang Province , Xi won fame for effectively promoting high-tech private enterprises and advocating the integration of the economies of the Greater Shanghai Region . 
The majority of Chinese are more interested in bread-and-butter issues than they are in this game of musical chairs at the top , particularly whether Hu and Wen can fulfil their promise of narrowing the yawning gap between rich and poor , city and countryside , and coast and hinterland . 
And evidence of worsening antagonisms among disparate social groupings and classes is mounting . 
Despite their vaunted credo of &quot; scientific development , &quot; the Hu-Wen leadership has failed to do much to help peasants and migrant workers , who have been hit hard by staggeringly high property prices , unaffordable health care , and rising education costs . 
Wen &apos;s cabinet , moreover , has failed to tame inflation , particularly for foodstuffs ranging from eggs to pork . 
The official consumer price index rose by 6.5 % in August , but some Western economists calculate that the inflation rate is closer to 10 % . 
This has prompted many urban residents to go on a buying spree , pushing prices higher . 
Moreover , many of Hu &apos;s protégés who are provincial party secretaries have compromised records in areas ranging from public health to environmental protection . 
While serving as governor and party boss of Henan Province in the 1990 &quot; s , Li Keqiang failed to do much for the estimated one million peasants who contracted AIDS by selling blood to supplement their meager earnings . 
Li Yuanchao , another rising star in Hu &apos;s faction , neglected environmental issues in Jiangsu , the rich province he has run since 2000 . 
Earlier this year , huge , foul-smelling blooms of blue algae contaminated drinking water from &quot; Jiangsu &apos;s Jewel , &quot; Lake Tai . 
Hu has already rejected petitions by Party veterans calling on the CCP to liberalize more rapidly . 
Indeed , it is likely that Hu will steer clear of political reform in his message to the Congress , instead promising more &quot; trickle-down &quot; funds for social welfare and the poor . 
But , as at the 16th Congress five years ago , bona fide farmers and workers will be absent , while an increasingly tribalized Party will focus on reconciling its intense factional competition .
