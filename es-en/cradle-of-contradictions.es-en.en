Cradle of Contradictions 
The American-led invasion of Iraq was supposed to begin a process of transformation across the Middle East . 
Syrian poet and political analyst Ammar Abdulhamid suggests that a thaw - if not quite change , then perhaps its precursor - is now occurring in Syria . 
Life in Syria has never been simple . 
The realities , meticulously hidden under a veneer of homogeneity , have always been too complex for even the most discerning of scholars . 
The peaceful coexistence between the country &apos;s myriad ethnic , religious , and tribal groups is the result of a complex layer of concessions , compromises , tacit agreements , and other pragmatic arrangements perfected over the centuries . 
Over the last few months , life has become even more complex , as both the country &apos;s ruling elite and civil society advocates seem more bewildered than ever about the country &apos;s future . 
Each group is focused on determining its particular privileges while preserving the territorial integrity and national unity of a country growing increasingly fractious and fragile . 
These developments , of course , follow from the US-led invasion of Iraq , which turned a vague and distant threat into an imposing neighbor whose intentions towards Syria &apos;s Baathist regime are anything but friendly . 
Consequently , the need for drastic change in the structure and style of a previously reality-impaired regime has finally begun to sink in . 
As a result , Syria &apos;s various political power centers have embarked on a desperate search for a vision to promote change yet allow the existing order to survive . 
Because Syria &apos;s rulers have neither the ability nor the know-how to produce such a vision , civil society has been granted some leeway for action . 
Clearly , this expansion of civil society &apos;s operating arena may even turn into open opposition to Syria &apos;s rulers . 
The point is to allow for some debate to take place in the hope of producing the sorely needed vision of change . 
This will give the outside world the impression that serious change is taking place and that the regime should be given the time to see it through . 
Crackdowns , detentions , and illegal trials thus exist hand in hand with a growing tolerance for creative initiatives . 
Over twenty NGOs have been formed in the last few months . 
Many are charities and often include on their advisory boards one or two members with clear government connections ( the daughter of a minister or an army general , or , in a couple of notable instances , the President &apos;s wife ) . 
Even so , this development is still significant by Syrian standards , as independent initiatives are traditionally frowned upon . 
Of real significance here is the press service , All4Syria ( www.all4syria.org ) , created by the Syrian engineer Ayman Abdul Nour . 
The service contains an electronic newsletter that includes Syria-related reports and articles gathered from a variety of sources , often including comments by opposition figures at home and abroad . 
In its way , All4Syria has provided an indirect conduit for dialogue between government and opposition , which may not have taken place otherwise . 
Although All4Syria &apos;s Internet site was recently blocked for unspecified reasons , the newsletter continues to be circulated and Mr. Abdul Nour moves in his usual circles unmolested . 
I have been involved with the launch of another initiative , the Tharwa Project ( www.tharwaproject.com ) , which I have long envisioned as one way for the Arab region to address its problems with religious and ethnic minorities . 
Although regional in scope and with a colorful international board of advisors , the Tharwa Project ( Tharwa means wealth in Arabic ) is based in Damascus and will be run from there . 
The launch of the Tharwa Project one month ago inadvertently coincided with Kurdish riots that rocked northern Syria . 
So far , Syria &apos;s authorities have not reacted to the Tharwa Project . 
It &apos;s probably still too early in the game for that . 
Some in the Syrian government could be aware of this . 
Nevertheless , fourteen civil society activists who attempted to organize a special meeting to address the realities of the Kurdish issue in Syria recently received various sentences on charges of working to undermine national unity . 
The authorities clearly wish to control the extent of the thaw in Syria &apos;s political culture . 
For my colleagues and me , this is the time for hard and continuous work to expand the space of popular participation in the country and region . 
We can deliver no judgment at this stage as to where things might be heading . 
Everything and anything seems possible . 
Still , it is tempting to think that Syria is witnessing a new beginning , and the end of an era whose sins we all bear .
