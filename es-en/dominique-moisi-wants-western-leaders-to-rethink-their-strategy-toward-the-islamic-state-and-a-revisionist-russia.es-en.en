The Containment Debate , Round Two 
PARIS - At the Cold War &apos;s outset , there was an intense debate in the United States between those who wanted to contain communism and those who wanted to roll it back . 
Was it sufficient to fix limits on the Soviet Union &apos;s ambitions , or was a more aggressive stance , sometimes described as &quot; containment plus , &quot; necessary ? 
The recent spat between US President Barack Obama and his former secretary of state ( and possible successor ) , Hillary Clinton , seems to have revived that debate . 
But are its terms of reference useful today , as the West faces the simultaneous challenges of the Islamic State in the Middle East and a revisionist Russia ? 
Are Western leaders right to assume that the two challenges are distinct , and that containment will suffice in the case of Russia , while rollback is absolutely necessary in the case of the Islamic State ? 
The West needs Russia as much as Russia needs the West , the thinking goes , whereas no one ( to say the least ) needs a sanctuary for Islamist fanatics in the heart of the Middle East . 
That is why Russia must be persuaded to change course through a combination of economic sanctions , strategic unity , and diplomatic engagement ; by contrast , the Islamic State &apos;s ambitions cannot be contained , so they must be suppressed . 
But the West needs to rethink its strategy , because the two challenges are not entirely distinct . 
Had Obama not failed to enforce his chemical-weapons &quot; red line &quot; in Syria a year ago , following an attack on a suburb of Damascus , Russian President Vladimir Putin probably would not have been as daring as he was in Ukraine . 
Likewise , helping the Kurds to confront the Islamic State could send the right message to the Kremlin . 
Confronting this dual challenge presupposes a combination of long-term , coordinated strategic thinking and pedagogical skill . 
Leaders must explain and clarify . 
To say , &quot; I don &apos;t do stupid things , &quot; as Obama did recently in an interview with the New York Times , is not enough , given the complexity , urgency , and scale of the threats America and the West are facing . 
The simplicity of the Cold War left little need for explanation . 
The West had only one opponent , and both sides understood the rules of the game ( that is , the logic of the balance of terror ) . 
Above all , the &quot; Soviet mind &quot; was relatively easy to decipher . 
The complexity of today &apos;s challenges consists not only in there being more than one , but also in the difficulty of understanding the &quot; jihadi mind . &quot; 
Of course , one can say that the Islamic State &apos;s dream of restoring a Sunni caliphate is as anachronistic as Putin &apos;s neo-imperial ambition . 
One can also say that both Putin and the Islamic State have drawn much of their strength from the West &apos;s weakness , particularly its failure to have enforced clear and credible limits to their actions . 
But , if Putin and the Islamic State have benefited from the West &apos;s confusion , hesitation , and division in dealing with them , they are not paper tigers . 
If they were , the West would need only to wait for its adversaries to collapse under the weight of their own contradictions : Russia &apos;s overestimation of its means , and , in the case of the Islamic State , the consequences of its appallingly cruel behavior . 
That scenario seems optimistic at best . 
Though the Islamic State is resistible , it represents a much bigger challenge than Al Qaeda ever did . 
It has set for itself a concrete territorial goal , and has ample financing , sophisticated weapons , and a highly competent military command . 
At the same time , it would be as dangerous to overestimate the Islamic State &apos;s capabilities today as it was to underestimate them yesterday . 
The same logic applies to Putin &apos;s Russia . 
The seizure of Crimea was a swift , well-executed move , but the same tactics have not worked in the more complex and divided context of eastern Ukraine . 
By winning Crimea the way that it did , Russia may well have lost Ukraine . 
In his classic treatise Strategy : The Indirect Approach , B.H. Liddell Hart , reflecting on his World War I experiences , insisted on the foolhardiness of direct attacks on an entrenched enemy . 
&quot; In strategy , &quot; he argued , &quot; the longest way round is often the shortest way there . &quot; 
Today , Liddell Hart would probably encourage the West to concentrate its efforts on helping the Kurdish fighters in the Middle East and aiding Ukraine &apos;s government in Eastern Europe . 
That dual effort should be pursued without idealizing these partners . 
They are not &quot; good &quot; simply because the West is backing them ; but they are , in any case , infinitely better than the forces they are resisting . 
Be it containment or rollback , the rules of the game should be clear .
