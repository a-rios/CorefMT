Getting it Right in North Africa 
TUNIS - Like a long dormant volcano that suddenly erupts , the revolutions that have swept across North Africa - against a backdrop of strong economic performance - took all by surprise . 
Prior to the explosion , average annual GDP growth in the region had been humming along at 4.6 % for a decade , with strong improvement in human development indicators . 
But this growth was in some ways deceptive , for it masked problems that had long simmered beneath the surface : burgeoning unemployment , especially among the region &apos;s youth , and political repression - the issues that eventually brought things to a boil . 
In Tunisia , whose revolution ignited the wildfire of change that quickly spread across the region , young people account for 70 % of total unemployment . 
The statistics are similar in Egypt and Libya . 
The common denominator across the region is that , while its economies were growing , they were unable to generate enough jobs . 
This has created a generation of disaffected , under- and unemployed young people , including large numbers of recent university graduates . 
Ultimately , all levels of society , catalyzed by the actions of restive and disenfranchised youth , came together to demand change and reform . 
Throughout North Africa , populations have spoken resoundingly with their feet - and continue to do so . 
There is a lot of goodwill to ensure a democratic dividend for these countries , while of course managing expectations . 
What the North African situation has taught us is that we must humbly accept that we may not always have had the right responses in the past . 
We must acknowledge the complexity of the economic issues before us and listen more in designing the necessary and appropriate responses . 
The lesson from the North African uprisings is clear : this was a revolution not about ideology , but about freedom , social inclusion , political voice , and government accountability . 
To some extent , what North African countries are experiencing , it could be argued , is the classic middle-income-country trap , with economic performance constrained and undermined by limited economic transformation towards higher value-added production and insufficient political , social , and economic inclusion . 
The events of recent months have exacted a heavy short-term economic toll , but they have potentially far-reaching long-term implications . 
The region &apos;s economies have contracted , owing to a sharp drop in tourism revenues and disruptions of production and trade . 
Foreign and domestic investments could decline further as a result of uncertainty , and the region &apos;s financial sectors and stock markets could come under even more stress . 
All of this could have a significant impact on poor and vulnerable segments of the population , compounded by possible hikes in food prices and a further rise in unemployment . 
On the other hand , we can be confident that the longer-term gains of social and political change will be positive , as the drag of predatory corruption and limitations on individual and economic liberties are eliminated . 
As Africa &apos;s leading development-finance institution , the African Development Bank will support our North African members , enhancing governance and institutions , strengthening social safety nets , and laying the basis for a strong economic recovery . 
As we finance infrastructure and other projects in the region , we will seek to integrate disenfranchised regions and rural areas . 
We are broadening our consultations with governments and other actors , and we are collaborating more closely with national and regional civil-society groups and the media , as well as with academic institutions , think tanks , labor unions , and industrial and sectoral associations . 
With the emerging democratic dispensation , we have partners with whom we can engage on governance issues . 
No country or region can truly aspire to full , broad-based economic growth without pulling along all segments of its population and without giving a voice to all . 
More and more countries are doing so through private sector development . 
In 2008 for instance , the Maghreb Private Equity Fund received investments of nearly â‚¬ 20 million from the African Development Bank , which strengthened selected small and medium enterprises in Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya , transforming them into stronger regional players . 
In 2010 , the AfDB also approved an equity investment of roughly $ 20 million in an infrastructure fund operating primarily in North Africa . 
If the nations of North Africa are to succeed in meeting the needs and expectations of their peoples , policymakers must draw the appropriate lessons from the past - and aim to get it right this time around . 
Economic creativity must be the next step in North Africa &apos;s spring .
