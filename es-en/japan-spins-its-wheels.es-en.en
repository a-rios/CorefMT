Japan Spins Its Wheels 
OSAKA - To lose one prime minister may be regarded as a misfortune ; to lose two in one year looks like carelessness . 
That paraphrase of Oscar Wilde aptly sums up the current state of Japanese politics , given the serial resignations of Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda . 
Japan is once again saddled with a caretaker government as the ruling Liberal Democrat Party ( LDP ) scrambles for a new leader with an election to the lower house of the Diet looming . 
The question is : who or what has been careless ? 
The LDP ? 
The constitution ? 
The voters ? 
For the last three years , the ruling LDP-Komei Party coalition has dominated the powerful Lower House with a two-thirds majority . 
And , for a year , the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) and other mini-parties control Upper House , which can veto legislation . 
Political instability and gridlock have been the inevitable result . 
The problem is that another election won &apos;t fix this political mess , but will likely only ensure continuing paralysis . 
Japan &apos;s political system requires the same sort of structural reform that its economy has long needed . 
The LDP and the DPJ are now debating how to manage rising inflation at a time of falling living standards and deepening economic polarization within society - the latter a legacy of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi &apos;s market-oriented reforms of 2001-2006 . 
The debate is centered on whether to increase the consumption tax in order to sustain the country &apos;s severely strained social security system . 
Only occasionally does the issue of administrative and governmental reform sneak into the center of the debates . 
The LDP has tried to placate public wrath about a series of political scandals and policy mistakes over the last two years , while the DPJ has attempted to capitalize on these . 
The LDP is now staging a party leadership election in the hope of gaining a temporary boost in popular support before the Lower House election . 
The five contenders , all of whom served in Koizumi &apos;s cabinet , are actively debating major policy issues , but appear to be offering only more of the similar , because they are not equipped with Koizumi &apos;s charisma and boldness . 
The frontrunner is Taro Aso , the LDP secretary general , who wants economic pump-priming . 
One of his challengers is Yuriko Koike , Japan &apos;s first female defense minister , who is committed to restarting Koizumi &apos;s market-oriented reforms and has his backing . 
The other three have some charm and ability , but have offered nothing like a remedy to Japan &apos;s deep structural problems , mostly because they all have not adamantly tackled the problems . 
Given Japan &apos;s huge accumulated national debts , the LDP can no longer appease the electorate through pork-barrel spending . 
In essence , Koizumi &apos;s reforms effectively dismantled the LDP &apos;s vote-getting machine , which relied on buying off vested interests . 
One consequence of this is that most Japanese voters nowadays are swing voters with no party loyalty . 
The maverick Koizumi had the personal attractiveness and ideological appeal needed to galvanize a majority behind his plans for a &quot; fair &quot; distribution of the pain of reform . 
His charisma dissipated public resistance , as his battle cry - &quot; Demolish the LDP &quot; - seemed to promise that politicians would also pay a price for change . 
Koizumi did , of course , revive Japan &apos;s economy after a decade of stagnation . 
Yet even he did not touch the economy &apos;s gargantuan quasi-governmental sector - the source of the most horrendous waste and misspending . 
The public blames the LDP &apos;s inability to control the bureaucracy , if not its complicity with it . 
Yet the LDP &apos;s position is not hopeless , because the public remains highly skeptical that the amateurish DPJ can control the bureaucracy , either . 
So Japan &apos;s choice comes down to one between a distrusted LDP and an incompetent DPJ . 
Given voters &quot; vacillation , neither the LDP nor the DPJ is likely to gain an absolute majority . 
Should the LDP win a simple majority , the new administration would still face a hung Diet , owing to the DPJ &apos;s control of the Upper House . 
So any new LDP-led coalition government will be just as precarious as the last two pathetic administrations . 
Conversely , should the DPJ gain a simple majority , its inexperienced government will immediately have to cope with the same intractable policy issues that the LDP failed to confront . 
Should the DPJ gain a plurality and forge a coalition with the country &apos;s far-left parties , the outcome would be ceaseless instability . 
The core of Japan &apos;s political inertia consists in the current pseudo-two-party system comprising the LDP and the DPJ , because the parties &quot; divisions are actually devoid of any consistent ideological and policy differences . 
Both parties include conservatives and liberals , defense hawks and doves . 
The DPJ &apos;s president , Ichiro Ozawa , who once served as an LDP secretary general , is an exemplar of this confused legacy . 
Sadly , the chances that the LDP will reform , or that the DPJ will evolve into a responsible party of government in the foreseeable future , are slim . 
Japan seems condemned to endure chronic and pointless political trench warfare until some crisis forces a realignment of political parties along ideological and policy lines . 
Only when that happens will Japan be ready to play the responsible international leadership role that the world &apos;s second largest economy should play .
