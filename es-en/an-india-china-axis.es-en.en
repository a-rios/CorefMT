An India-China Axis ? 
Is a new alignment between India and China rising to balance America &apos;s global power ? 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao just completed a four-day visit to India during which 11 agreements were signed , including a comprehensive five-year strategic cooperation pact . 
In addition , Wen announced that China would support India &apos;s bid for a permanent seat on an expanded UN Security Council , and opposed the inclusion of Japan , which the United States supports for a Council seat . 
With over a third of the world &apos;s population and two of the globe &apos;s highest economic growth rates , an alliance between China and India could be a serious factor in world politics . 
While both are developing countries - many of whose people remain impoverished - they also boast impressive capabilities in information age technologies both for civilian and military purposes . 
As Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put it during Wen &apos;s visit , &quot; India and China can together reshape the world order . &quot; 
The two countries &quot; recent rapprochement marks a huge change from the hostility that bedeviled their relations following their 1962 war over a disputed border in the Himalayas . 
When I first visited India as an American government official in the late 1970 &quot; s , I was struck by my Indian hosts &quot; fixation on gaining equal status with China . 
In 1998 , when India tested its nuclear weapons , the defense minister referred to China , and then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee spoke of China as India &apos;s number one enemy . 
By contrast , on more recent visits to India , I have found my hosts referring to the need to learn from China . 
Trade between the two giants has grown from $ 100 million in 1994 to nearly $ 14 billion last year , and India &apos;s minister of commerce and industry has predicted that it will double by this decade &apos;s end . 
One agreement signed during Wen &apos;s visit was a new set of guiding principles on how to settle boundary disputes between the two countries . 
While improved relations and diminished prospects for conflict are welcome , relations between India and China are more complex than they appear at first . 
Not long before the visit of the Chinese premier , India hosted US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . 
Ever since President Bill Clinton &apos;s visit to India , but especially under President George W. Bush , the US has moved from relative indifference to India to the development of a strong strategic relationship . 
This new approach might have seemed threatened by Al Qaeda &apos;s attacks on America , which led to a strengthening of US relations with Pakistan &apos;s General Parvez Musharaff . 
Secretary Rice made this plain during her March visit , stressing the importance of a strategic relationship , including a willingness to consider trade in high technology , nuclear energy , and co-production of fighter aircraft such as F-16 &quot; s and F-18 &quot; s . 
Shortly after Rice &apos;s visit , the US announced that it would honor a long-standing promise to sell F-16 &quot; s to Pakistan . 
While the announcement incited Indian protests , they were relatively muted compared to the past . 
One reason is that the State Department also issued a statement that America would help India to become a major world power in the twenty-first century , involving both a strategic and economic dialogue . 
Several factors underpin this new American attitude toward India . 
Rhetoric about &quot; the world &apos;s two largest democracies &quot; is not new , but it fits with the Bush administration &apos;s new emphasis on promoting democracy . 
The increasing role of the Indian diaspora in the US , particularly in the information industries , also had an influence , as has the rise in bilateral trade accompanying India &apos;s surging economic growth . 
Equally important are strategic concerns about transnational terrorism and the rise of Chinese power . 
The rise of China is a major factor in the politics of the twenty-first century . 
China has tripled the size of its economy in the past two decades , and has been increasing its military strength . 
While both India and the US seek trade and good relations with China , both are aware - and wary - of China &apos;s growing strength . 
Thus , both seek to hedge their bets , and what better way to do so than by improving their strategic relationship ? 
Neither country aims to restrain China in the way the &quot; containment &quot; strategy aimed at an aggressive Soviet Union during the Cold War , but both want to create an international structure that does not tempt China to throw its weight around . 
India has a 3,000-kilometer border with China , a 2,000-kilometer border with Pakistan ( which has been the beneficiary of Chinese military and nuclear assistance ) , and growing concerns about the security of sea routes in the Indian Ocean over which oil and other trade move . 
As one Indian strategist put it to me during a recent visit , &quot; By 2030 , we envisage the US , China , and India as the three largest powers in world politics . 
We don &apos;t want a China- or a US-dominated world , but if we had to choose , it would be easier for us to live with the latter . &quot; So , while improvement in India-China relations is welcome , it is unlikely to herald the beginning of an India-China alliance against the US . 
Rather , it more likely represents another move in India &apos;s age-old tradition of managing regional balances of power .
