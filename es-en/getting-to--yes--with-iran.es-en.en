Getting to \ 
There is a wise American saying : &quot; If you are in a hole , stop digging . &quot; 
The six governments that are currently considering the next steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany - should heed that advice . 
Otherwise , they could end up without any handle on the Iranian nuclear program , and only one - useless - option left , a military strike . 
Yet the six governments seem determined to continue with what has been their strategy so far . 
Their condition for negotiating with Iran is a prior halt of its nuclear enrichment activities . 
Only in exchange for Iran &apos;s permanent renunciation of enrichment will they provide major rewards - from lifting all sanctions and trade restrictions to security guarantees . 
This strategy has not worked and will not work . 
Under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) of which Iran is still a member , countries are entitled to engage in enriching uranium for civilian purposes , and Iran claims that this is all it wants . 
True , Iran &apos;s total halt of its enrichment program would be welcome , not least because its government has hidden these activities for almost two decades from Treaty inspectors , suggesting other than purely civilian motives . 
But the issue of enrichment has been blown up into such a symbol of national sovereignty in Iran that no government there , not only the current Achmadinejad administration , will climb down . 
Indeed , when the UN Security Council formally demanded a stop to the enrichment program and imposed mild sanctions last December , Iran &apos;s defiant answer was to increase enrichment activity . 
So what to do now ? 
The Bush administration , predictably , is pushing for new and tougher sanctions , based on an implied warning in the earlier UN Resolution , and arguing , as it did in the run-up to the invasion in Iraq , that the UN &apos;s credibility is at stake . 
But the only real test of UN credibility in this conflict is whether it can succeed in restricting Iran as much as possible to a purely civilian nuclear program . 
If the Security Council fails to agree on new sanctions - which is likely , given Chinese and Russian objections - it would be exposed as a paper tiger . 
If , on the other hand , it works out a consensus on more economic and possibly even military punishment , the UN &apos;s credibility would depend on whether these moves produce Iranian compliance . 
That , however , is unlikely . 
Tougher economic sanctions will not force Iran to comply ; instead , sanctions will merely hit this oil- and gas-rich country &apos;s trading partners . 
More threats will only push the international community further along the spiral of escalation and , possibly , into military action . 
There are those in Bush &apos;s entourage who would like nothing better . 
While even a major air attack would fall short of destroying all of Iran &apos;s nuclear installations and , moreover , leave the technical know-how intact , it might at least slow down the program for a while and serve as a warning to other potential proliferators . 
But it is a foolhardy gamble . 
Today , Iran declares that it wants to observe the NPT , and that has no intention of building a nuclear bomb . 
After a military attack by the United States , both promises would be history . 
If the six governments want to avoid the escalation spiral and curb the proliferation dynamic , they need to change strategy and objective . 
Instead of making a halt to uranium enrichment the be-all and end-all of their effort , their central objective should be to subject the Iranian activities to as much verification as possible : if Iran wants to enrich , so be it , but it must accept intrusive international inspections . 
This is a bargain that the Iranians themselves have repeatedly hinted at . 
The Six have refused because verification cannot provide an absolute guarantee against the diversion of some enriched uranium to military use . 
But as the superpowers learned in the Cold War , the absence of airtight verification does not render inspections useless . 
They would still submit the Iranian program to greater restrictions than is the case today . 
And such an agreement would open the way to a wider agreement between Iran and the West for cooperation and regional stability . 
That is why the Six should stop digging a deeper hole . 
Instead of formulating new sanctions for the UN Security Council , they should use the next few months to explore confidentially what level of restrictions combined with verification Iran would consider in exchange for undisputed enrichment . 
By all means , the Six should keep the option of more biting resolutions as an inducement to Iranian compromise . 
But those who now call on the Security Council to issue rapid condemnations of Iran &apos;s behavior should keep two things in mind : they are unlikely to have any effect , and the US has already used such resolutions as a pretext for launching military action on its own .
