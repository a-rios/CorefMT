Politics and Corporate Money 
CAMBRIDGE - A recent decision issued by the United States Supreme Court expanded the freedom of corporations to spend money on political campaigns and candidates - a freedom enjoyed by corporations in other countries around the world . 
This raises well-known questions about democracy and private power , but another important question is often overlooked : who should decide for a publicly traded corporation whether to spend funds on politics , how much , and to what ends ? 
Under traditional corporate-law rules , the political-speech decisions of public companies are subject to the same rules as ordinary business decisions . 
Consequently , such decisions can be made without input from ordinary shareholders or independent directors , and without detailed disclosure - all safeguards that corporate law establishes for other managerial decisions , such as those concerning executive compensation or related-party transactions . 
In a recent article , however , Robert Jackson and I argue that political-speech decisions are fundamentally different from ordinary business decisions . 
The interests of directors , executives , and dominant shareholders with respect to such decisions may often diverge significantly from those of public investors . 
Consider a public corporation whose CEO or controlling shareholder supports a political movement to the country &apos;s right or left and wishes to support it with corporate funds . 
There is little reason to expect the political preferences of corporate insiders to mirror those of the public investors funding the company . 
Furthermore , when such divergence of interest exists , using the corporation &apos;s funds to support political causes that the corporation &apos;s public investors do not favor - or even oppose - may well impose on them costs that exceed the monetary amounts spent . 
To prevent this , lawmakers should adopt safeguards for political spending decisions that would limit the divergence of such decisions from shareholder interests . 
For starters , it is important to require traded companies to provide detailed disclosure to public investors about the amounts and beneficiaries of any funds that the company spends , either directly or indirectly . 
In expanding corporations &quot; rights to spend money on politics , the US Supreme Court relied on &quot; the processes of corporate democracy &quot; to ensure that such spending does not deviate from shareholder interests . 
Clearly , however , such processes can have little effect if political spending is not transparent to public investors . 
For such disclosure to be effective , it must include robust rules with respect to political spending via intermediaries . 
In the US , for example , organizations that seek to speak for the business sector , or for specific industries , raise funds from corporations and spend more than $ 1 billion annually on efforts to influence politics and policymaking . 
While the targets of these organizations &quot; spending are disclosed , there is no public disclosure that enables investors in any public corporation to know whether their corporation contributes to such organizations and how much . 
Investors deserve to know . 
Moreover , a public company &apos;s political spending decisions should not be solely the province of management , as they often are . 
Independent directors should have an important oversight role , as they do on other sensitive issues that may involve a divergence of interest between insiders and public investors . 
Lawmakers also should consider providing public investors with a say over political spending decisions . 
In the United Kingdom , for example , public companies have been subject to such a requirement for more than a decade . 
Shareholders of British companies must approve , by majority vote on a shareholder resolution , any political spending that exceeds Â£ 5,000 . 
Following the adoption of this legislation , political spending remained significant but fell somewhat below previous levels . 
Shareholders may have different views from those of corporate insiders not only with respect to the amount of political spending , but also with respect to how that spending is targeted . 
This problem can be addressed by permitting shareholders to adopt at the annual meeting binding resolutions concerning corporate political spending . 
For example , shareholders could direct that the corporation may not spend funds for certain types of political purposes , or that it must follow certain principles in allocating whatever budget is authorized . 
The mere existence of shareholder power to adopt such resolutions could well increase insiders &quot; incentives to target the corporation &apos;s political spending in ways that are consistent with shareholder interests . 
Legal rules allowing corporations to spend on politics are premised on the view that expression of corporations &quot; positions has a legitimate role in the political marketplace . 
That is why we need new legislation to ensure that the use of corporate funds in politics does not stray from the interests of shareholders .
