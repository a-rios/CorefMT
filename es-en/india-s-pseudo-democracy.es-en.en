India \ u0027s Pseudo-Democracy 
Recently , India &apos;s Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said that despite the outward appearance of health , Indian democracy appears to have become hollow , with elections reduced to a farce and the &quot; party system eroded due to unethical practices . &quot; 
According to Vajpayee , &quot; The outer shell of democracy is , no doubt , intact , but appears to be moth-eaten from inside . &quot; 
Indeed , in the preface to a recent collection of his speeches , Vajpayee wondered whether democracy had truly taken root in India . 
&quot; How can democratic institutions work properly , &quot; he asked , &quot; when politics is becoming increasingly criminalized ? &quot; 
This is a strange turn , for parliamentary democracy has long been a source of pride for most Indians . 
The country may not match up to its Asian neighbors in prosperity , but Indians have always been able to boast of the vitality of their parliamentary system . 
Nowadays , such boasts are heard far less frequently . 
Not only are India &apos;s economic failures more obvious , in comparison to Asia &apos;s revived economic juggernauts ; so , too , are the failures of its political system . 
Unprincipled politics , cults of violence , communal rage , and macabre killings of religious minorities have all combined to shake people &apos;s faith in the political system &apos;s viability . 
Small wonder , then , that people are starting to ask whether India needs an alternative system of government . 
Part of the problem lies in India &apos;s deracinated party politics . 
For decades , the Congress Party of Nehru and his daughter , Indira Gandhi , basically ruled the country unchallenged . 
But with the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and her son , former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , Congress disintegrated and has not recovered . 
Rather than ushering in an era of recognizable multi-party politics , Indian democracy still lacks a party system worthy of the name . 
One reason for this is that there are barely any national parties . 
Instead , India is saddled with highly volatile leader-based groups . 
When the leadership is charismatic and strong , the party is a servile instrument . 
Lacking coherent principles or an overriding ideology , these groups fragment when their leadership changes or splits , as Congress did . 
Where parties are weak , there can be no party discipline . 
India &apos;s parliament is riddled with defections by MPs , who move freely from one party grouping to another . 
So endemic is the buying and selling of legislators that parliament looks a lot like a cattle market . 
The prizes conferred on opportunistic defectors not only undermine the party system , but weaken the foundations of parliament by making organized opposition impossible . 
Public apathy bordering on fatalism is the inevitable result . 
This is dangerous because apathy does not take the form of withdrawal from public life , but increasingly finds expression in sectarian and religious conflict . 
Of course , politicians incite many of these conflicts , using caste , sect , and religion - not political ideas - to build voter loyalty . 
But apathy about democracy is what makes so many ordinary Indians prey to poisonous appeals . 
This susceptibility is the clearest sign that India &apos;s experiment with the Westminster model of parliamentary democracy has failed to justify the hopes that prevailed fifty years ago when the Constitution was proclaimed . 
Back then , parliament was seen as a means to bridge the divides of caste , religion , and region . 
Parliament &apos;s increasing irrelevance in sorting out these problems - indeed , its role in exacerbating them - is fueling a growing preference among Indians for a presidential system of government that removes executive functions from the oversight of an institution that has been addled and rendered impotent by undisciplined factions . 
Of course , politicians are not the only people at fault here . 
Sadly , Indian society never really embraced the consensual values that India &apos;s Constitution proclaims : a participatory , decentralized democracy ; an egalitarian society with minimal social and economic disparities ; a secularized polity ; the supremacy of the rule of law ; a federal structure ensuring partial autonomy to provinces ; cultural and religious pluralism ; harmony between rural and urban areas ; and an efficient , honest state administration at both the national and local level . 
Instead , race and caste remain as potent as ever . 
Wealth is as grossly distributed as ever . 
Corruption rules many state governments and national ministries . 
Urban and rural areas subvert each other . 
But parliaments demand a minimal national consensus if they are to function , for they are creatures of compromise in decision-making . 
Executive governments , on the other hand , are creatures of decision : a popularly elected president is ultimately responsible to his voters , not to his party colleagues . 
The very election by national suffrage of an executive provides the type of minimal consensus that India &apos;s faction-riven parliaments have , sadly , never been able to cultivate . 
Of course , a president will undoubtedly need to compromise with his legislature , but the general consent that is gained by popular election implies at least some broader agreement behind the platform that he or she campaigned on . 
Of course , no magic bullet will do away with the forces that divide India . 
But at least some of the maladies of the current parliamentary system , such as defection , party factionalism , inherent political instability , and crippling coalition politics can be minimized , if not eliminated , by adopting an executive-dominant model of presidential democracy . 
In adopting such a system , Indians would have nothing to lose but the corruption and chaos of today &apos;s discredited parliament .
