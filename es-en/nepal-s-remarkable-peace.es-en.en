Nepal \ u0027s Remarkable Peace 
KATMANDU - Nepal &apos;s Maoist leader , Pushpa Kamal Dahal , known as &quot; Prachanda , &quot; has now been sworn in as the first prime minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal , having won an overwhelming vote in the Constituent Assembly elected in April . 
The Assembly &apos;s opening action had been to vote almost unanimously to abolish the 239-year-old monarchy , and in June former King Gyanendra Shah departed from the palace , remaining in the country as an ordinary citizen . 
Nepal fleetingly made headlines after the 2001 palace massacre of the previous monarch and his family . 
Its bloody ten-year civil war , however , was seldom in the international limelight . 
So , too , the country &apos;s unique peace process has rarely gained outside attention since the guns fell silent two years ago . 
Yet , amid too many continuing conflicts and failing peace processes around the world , a success story deserves to be recognized and supported . 
I came to Nepal in mid-2005 , when human rights violations committed by both sides in the armed conflict , together with Gyanendra &apos;s crackdown on democratic rights as he seized absolute power , led the international community to support a monitoring presence from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights . 
With no end in sight to a war with thousands of civilian victims , and democracy far from the horizon , nobody could have foreseen how Nepal &apos;s people would express their demand for peace and change . 
The turning point was the April 2006 people &apos;s movement , when hundreds of thousands took to the streets for nineteen successive days . 
The king was compelled to hand power back to the political parties , while a peace agreement emerged that ended the conflict , bringing the Maoists into an interim parliament and government and promising elections to a Constituent Assembly . 
The people &apos;s movement also took the lid off social pressures often disregarded by Nepal &apos;s elites . 
Although established as a unitary Hindu kingdom , with politics directed from the Himalayan foothills , today around half the population live in the fertile southern plains and more than one-third are from over 50 indigenous , largely non-Hindu communities . 
Others are also historically marginalized from the social and political life of the nation , notably the Dalits , sometimes known as &quot; untouchables , &quot; who are at the bottom of the Hindu caste system . 
For these groups , the restoration of democracy was a step toward social transformation , enabling them to participate more equally in the life of the country . 
Given that the elections to the Constituent Assembly needed to ensure their representation , a complex system of quotas was devised . 
Along with the success of socially diverse candidates fielded by the Maoists , the Constituent Assembly that was elected in April represents an unprecedented array of marginalized groups . 
Women , too , had been almost invisible in political life - and , indeed , in the peace process . 
Now nearly one-third of the Constituent Assembly &apos;s members are women - the highest proportion in South Asia and fourteenth place in the world for nationally elected bodies . 
The challenges that face Prime Minister Prachanda , the incoming coalition government , and the Constituent Assembly , are immense , and trust is fragile . 
The Nepali Congress Party , for example , has chosen to remain in opposition , dubious of the Maoists &quot; commitment to democratic politics . 
Nowhere in the world is the transformation of an armed insurgent group into a peaceful political movement quick or easy . 
The Maoists enter the government still with their own army - confined to cantonments , with their weapons stored under UN monitoring - and a Young Communist League that has persistently acted outside the law . 
Commitments to resolve the future of the Maoist combatants , along with what the peace agreements call the &quot; democratization &quot; of the state army , must now be implemented . 
But the biggest challenges go to the roots of the insurgency : poverty , injustice , and discrimination . 
One cost of the conflict has been the retreat of local governance and arrested development in a desperately poor country where over 80 % of the population lives in rural districts . 
Moreover , as Nepal aspires to become a federal democratic republic , expectations are high among diverse groups for greater control of their lives and resources . 
But what federalism will mean in practice , taking account of the geographic and ethnic peculiarities of Nepal , remains elusive and potentially divisive . 
Reaching a national consensus will be a formidable task for the Constituent Assembly , and meanwhile the Nepali people cannot be expected to wait patiently until a new constitution is drafted to see real improvement in their daily lives . 
But there is reason to be hopeful . 
Nepal &apos;s peace process has been truly indigenous : it has not been mediated or managed by any external party . 
The UN has encouraged and facilitated the process - through quiet good offices during the last years of the conflict , human rights monitoring , assistance to the Constituent Assembly election , and monitoring arms and armies during the transition . 
The Maoist and non-Maoist parties have asked the UN to maintain a political presence while the issue of the former combatants is resolved , and we stand ready to support peace-building , recovery , and long-term development . 
But the world , too , must be generous and steady in assisting Nepal to sustain the still fragile success of a remarkable peace process .
