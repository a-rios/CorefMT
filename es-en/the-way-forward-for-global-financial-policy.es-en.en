The Way Forward for Global Financial Policy 
Financial globalization is exploding . 
Yet , as the world &apos;s leading finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington this month for the semi-annual International Monetary Fund board meetings , policy paralysis continues . 
There is simply no agreement on how to address glaring problems such as America &apos;s increasingly fragile trade deficit , or financial dysfunction in a number of emerging markets . 
This paralysis has three layers . 
First , rich countries are deeply reluctant to embrace any collective plan that might impinge on their own domestic policy maneuvers . 
The United States is the worst offender . 
US Treasury secretaries have always loved to lecture their foreign colleagues on America &apos;s economic perfection , and why every country should seek to emulate it . 
Never mind that this logic is now in danger of unraveling along with the US housing market ; 
But the fact that the US looks set to borrow almost $ 900 billion this year from the rest of the world is hardly a sign of US strength and foreign weakness . 
It is difficult to summarize the cacophony of European voices so succinctly . 
The French are deeply ambivalent about globalization , as if it were yet another invading force . 
The British have nearly the opposite perspective . 
Nevertheless , Europeans generally agree that their societies produce the best lifestyles , even if their economies are less efficient than America &apos;s in a Darwinian sense . 
Thus , European finance ministers , too , will not be keen to admit any need for major policy changes to deal with risks from financial globalization . 
The Japanese typically try to keep quiet . 
As huge winners from globalization , they want to avoid criticism of their trade and financial policies , which arguably remain considerably more protectionist than those of their rich-country counterparts . 
And they certainly don &apos;t want to be pressed to apologize for holding hostage over $ 800 billion in foreign currency reserves , acquired to resist yen appreciation . 
Developing countries are also at fault . 
Too many policymakers still believe that externally imposed opening to international capital flows was the main culprit behind the financial crises of the 1990 &quot; s - a view that unfortunately is lent some intellectual respectability by a small number of left-leaning academics . 
Never mind that most of the crises could have been avoided , or late least substantially mitigated , if governments had let their currencies float against the dollar , rather than adopting rigid exchange-rate pegs . 
Instead , the bogeyman of financial globalization is used as an excuse for continuing to coddle inefficient and monopolistic domestic financial systems . 
The inability of backward domestic financial systems to allocate investment efficiently is a big factor pushing funds out of poor countries and into the US . 
Last but not least , the IMF , as the multilateral agency charged with maintaining global financial stability , ought to be providing more leadership . 
Indeed , it is probably the only player with the universal political and intellectual legitimacy to find a way forward on collective action to address financial globalization . 
Unfortunately , the IMF is paralyzed by the need to confront some internal governance problems , the biggest of which is the lack of a sensible way to recalculate the voting shares of countries as their relative influence in the global economy evolves . 
In particular , a radical increase in the weight of Asia &apos;s vote is urgently needed . 
What , then , should ministers do when they gather in Washington ? 
First , there is the long-standing litany of policy responses needed to deal with the global trade imbalances . 
These include greater fiscal discipline in the US , greater reliance on domestic demand in both Europe and Asia , and more flexible exchange rates in Asia . 
But it is time to go further and begin to lobby aggressively for faster financial liberalization in the developing world . 
True , most studies suggest that developing countries ought to precede any sharp opening to international financial markets by liberalizing trade . 
Stable macroeconomic policies also need to be in place , while fixed exchange rates are to be avoided . 
Many developing countries , however , are well on their way to achieving these preconditions . 
Ironically , bad memories of the IMF &apos;s first , premature attempt to promote long-term capital market liberalization remain an obstacle today . 
The IMF &apos;s attempt to enshrine capital market liberalization in its charter , coming as it did in the middle of the 1990 &quot; s Asian financial crisis , was a public relations disaster . 
But it is now time to revisit the idea , at least in a modified and more nuanced form . 
Weak financial systems in emerging markets are a major obstacle to balanced development . 
They are also a big factor behind the global trade imbalances . 
Pushing for greater capital market liberalization after the debacle of the 1990 &quot; s will be controversial . 
But the core of the idea was right then , and it is right now . 
In the absence of better mechanisms for capital allocation , global growth in this century will slow down a lot sooner than it should . 
Policymakers cannot hide from that reality forever .
