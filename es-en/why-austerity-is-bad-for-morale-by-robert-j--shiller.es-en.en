Austerity and Demoralization 
NEW HAVEN - The high unemployment that we have today in Europe , the United States , and elsewhere is a tragedy , not just because of the aggregate output loss that it entails , but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society . 
Austerity , according to some of its promoters , is supposed to improve morale . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron , an austerity advocate , says he believes that his program reduces &quot; welfare dependency , &quot; restores &quot; rigor , &quot; and encourages the &quot; the doers , the creators , the life-affirmers . &quot; 
Likewise , US Congressman Paul Ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote &quot; creativity and entrepreneurial spirit . &quot; 
Some kinds of austerity programs may indeed boost morale . 
Monks find their life &apos;s meaning in a most austere environment , and military boot camps are thought to build character . 
But the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion . 
One could imagine that a spell of unemployment might be a time of reflection , reestablishment of personal connections , and getting back to fundamental values . 
Some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point . 
John Maynard Keynes , in his 1930 essay &quot; Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren , &quot; speculated that , within a hundred years , that is , by 2030 , higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours , for a total workweek of only 15 hours . 
While there are still 17 years to go , it appears that Keynes was way off the mark . 
So was Robert Theobald , who , in his 1963 book Free Men and Free Markets questioned the public &apos;s repugnance toward high unemployment . 
He asserted that &quot; we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment , &quot; and that we do not need &quot; a whirling-dervish economy dependent on compulsive consumption . &quot; 
But finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to entail doing some sort of work : &quot; meaningful leisure &quot; wears thin after a while . 
People seem to want to work more than three hours a day , even if it is assembly-line work . 
And the opportunity to work should be a basic freedom . 
Unemployment is a product of capitalism : people who are no longer needed are simply made redundant . 
On the traditional family farm , there was no unemployment . 
Austerity exposes the modern economy &apos;s lack of interpersonal connectedness and the morale costs that this implies . 
Work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump , thereby preserving their self-esteem . 
Instead of laying off 25 % of its workforce in a recession , a company could temporarily reduce workers &quot; hours from , say , eight per day to six . 
Everyone would remain employed , and all would come a little closer to Keynes &apos;s ideal . 
Some countries , notably Germany , have encouraged this approach . 
But work-sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing . 
These problems preclude the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like Keynes and Theobald proclaimed . 
One problem is that workers have fixed costs , such as transportation to work or a health plan , that do not decline when hours ( and thus pay ) are cut . 
Their debts and obligations are similarly fixed . 
They could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced , but now it is difficult to downsize the one that they did buy . 
Another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone &apos;s job by the same amount , because some jobs scale up and down with production , while others do not . 
In his book Why Wages Don &apos;t Fall During a Recession , Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs . 
He found that they believed that a serious morale problem would result from reducing everyone &apos;s hours and pay during a recession . 
Then all employees would begin to feel as if they did not have a real job . 
In his interviews with managers , he was told that it is best ( at least from a manager &apos;s point of view ) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people , whose grumbling is not heard by the remaining employees . 
Employers worry about workplace morale , not about the morale of the employees they lay off . 
Their damaged morale certainly affects others as a sort of externality , which matters very much ; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off . 
We could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress . 
But we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis . 
That is why sudden austerity cannot be a morale builder . 
For morale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone , a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort . 
And for that we need fiscal stimulus - ideally , the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally . 
The increased tax burden for all who are employed is analogous to the reduced hours in work-sharing . 
But , if tax increases are not politically expedient , policymakers should proceed with old-fashioned deficit spending . 
The important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boosts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work .
