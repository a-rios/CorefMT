Central Europe &apos;s Unsentimental Education 
BUDAPEST - This month marks the 20th anniversary of the reburial of Imre Nagy , the leader of Hungary &apos;s failed anti-Soviet revolution of 1956 . 
The reinternment , organized by Hungary &apos;s anti-communist opposition on the 31st anniversary of his execution , drew more than 100,000 attendees , heralding the beginning of the end of the country &apos;s sclerotic regime . 
We Hungarians , and Central Europe in general , have come far since those heady times , but the past 20 years have also given us much cause to question the path we took . 
Hungary played a special role in the collapse of Communism , accelerating the process by opening its borders for East German refugees . 
But democratic transformation in Hungary required an opposition strategy throughout the 1980 &quot; s : revolution wouldn &apos;t work , as the Soviet invasion in 1956 showed . 
Nor would internal reforms work , because the Soviets would intervene to save the system , as they did in 1968 in Czechoslovakia . 
Instead , the new strategy was to sideline the issue of political power . 
Rather than attacking Communist rule directly , we would create small islands of freedom , inter-connected social circles and associations , which , when the moment came , could all be connected in order to change the system . 
In Hungary , several youth organizations existed and were aware of each other , so the political community that took part in the political changes in Hungary in 1989 was organized on this basis . 
History also played a part in the success of the Hungarian transition . 
The 1956 revolution was a real one , with barricades . 
In no other Central European country did Communists experience the possibility of paying with their own lives for the suffering and oppression that they inflicted on others . 
This historical experience was good for reform capability . 
A new generation was also needed . 
It appeared symbolically on June 16 , 1989 , when I had the opportunity to speak on behalf of the young generation . 
A whole generation felt that the moment had come when Hungarians could at last determine their own future . 
So , what kind of future did they determine ? 
The past 20 years can be divided into three phases . 
First , a market economy was created , the rule of law established , and democratic institutions built . 
Next , we applied for admission to NATO and prepared for European Union membership , with all of the institutional reforms that these goals implied . 
The third phase was one of economic catch-up , which , unlike the first two phases , has not really been successful in Hungary , which today may even be falling back . 
But , for Central Europe as a whole , the past 20 years have been the best since the Peace of Westphalia , with Slovakia and Slovenia even joining the euro zone . 
Nevertheless , the 20th anniversary of the collapse of communism is overshadowed by the global financial and economic crisis . 
And it is now clear that the biggest winners of globalization are no longer the Europeans or the Americans , but the Asians . 
The world market is being re-divided - peacefully , because territories and markets are separated , so that no power occupies another power &apos;s territory . 
But Europe must nonetheless recognize the need to distinguish clearly between partners , competitors , and opponents , and to formulate a more sophisticated and articulated policy towards Russia , in particular . 
For example , we Central Europeans are opponents when we do not accept Russia &apos;s policy of renewing &quot; spheres of interest &quot; and &quot; security zones . &quot; 
Moreover , after all that has happened in the past six months , Central Europeans can no longer look up to old countries representing the moral values of Western civilization . 
This crisis was not caused by bad luck or some professional misunderstanding , but by character problems , especially in the United States and later Western Europe . 
Money was stolen , not merely &quot; mismanaged . &quot; 
Investments were not simply bad , but unacceptably risky . 
The moral state of business leaders caused this crisis , and you cannot find Central Europeans among those leaders . 
Central Europe has found itself in a completely new situation . 
Crisis management measures undertaken in the Western world are practically cutting our countries off from the EU market . 
In this situation , Central European countries must cooperate to defend their own interests , as well as their dream of a common Europe . 
The question for the European elite is whether we believe in the work of the past 20 years , whether we believe in an integrated European market and an ever-widening European Community . 
If not , then first the biggest and the strongest countries , and then the Central Europeans , will turn away from the European dream . 
Those of us who believe that the past 20 years made sense , and that we are on the right track , are still the majority in Hungary . 
Everyone in Europe and the world needs a unified , robust Europe . 
If our faith is strong enough , we can survive this crisis without destroying what we have built together by opening our borders , destroying the Wall , unifying Germany , and completing our democratic transitions .
