The World &apos;s Central Banker 
BERKELEY - The US Federal Reserve these days is broadly happy with its monetary policy . 
But , since mid-2007 , its policy has been insufficiently expansionary . 
The policy most likely to succeed right now would be analogous to that implemented by the Fed in 1979 and 1933 , Great Britain in 1931 , and Shinzo Abe today . 
Those of us who fear that the Fed &apos;s approach has greatly deepened the US economy &apos;s malaise and is turning America &apos;s cyclical unemployment into permanent long-term structural non-employment have lost the domestic monetary-policy argument . 
But there is another policy argument that needs to be joined . 
The Fed is not just the US central bank ; it is the world &apos;s central bank . 
America &apos;s current exchange-rate regime is one of floating rates - or at least of rates that can float . 
Back in the 1950s and 1960s , economists like Milton Friedman assumed that a global regime of floating exchange rates would be one in which currency values moved slowly and gradually alongside differences in the economy &apos;s inflation and productivity-growth rates . 
In the 1970s , the economist Rudi Dornbusch ( and reality ) taught us that that was wrong : a floating-rate regime capitalizes expected future differences in nominal interest rates minus inflation rates into today &apos;s exchange rate . 
A country that changes its monetary policy vis-Ã -vis the US changes its current exchange rate by a lot ; and , in today &apos;s highly globalized world , that means that it deranges its import and export sectors substantially . 
Because no government wants to do that , nearly all governments today follow the US in setting monetary policy , diverging from it only tentatively and cautiously . 
So the US is not just one economy in a world of economies following their own monetary policies under a flexible exchange-rate regime . 
The US is , rather , a global hegemon : the central bank for the world , with a responsibility not just to stabilize output , employment , and inflation and ensure financial stability in the US , but also to manage the world economy in its entirety . 
One area of concern is the health and stability of growth in emerging markets as they attempt to benefit from capital inflows ; satisfy North Atlantic demands for open financial markets ; and manage the resulting instability created by speculative &quot; hot money , &quot; the carry trade , irrational exuberance , and overshooting . 
Emerging-market central-bank governors fear a US that alternates between expansionary policy that fuels huge hot-money inflows and a domestic inflationary spiral , and rapid tightening that chokes off credit and causes a domestic recession . 
Then there is the main problem facing the global economy today : the crisis of Europe and the eurozone . 
The creation of the euro without an appropriate fiscal union meant that transfers from surplus to deficit regions would not eliminate or even cushion demand imbalances . 
The fact that the eurozone lacked the labor-market flexibility needed to make it an optimal currency area meant that adjustment via regional reallocation of economic activity would be glacial , while its members &quot; loss of control over monetary policy ruled out adjustment via nominal depreciation . 
Moreover , Europe lacks the governance institutions needed to choose the easiest path to manage economic rebalancing : moderate inflation in the north , rather than grinding deflation and universal bankruptcy in the south . 
The European Union &apos;s institutional design amplifies the voices of those interests pushing for policies that have now set Europe on the deflationary road , thus all but guaranteeing lost decades during which the EU will fail to deliver growth and prosperity . 
We have an example from the early twentieth century of the political consequences of such a period of economic depression and stagnation . 
The reaction to what Karl Marx called &quot; parliamentary cretinism &quot; is the rise of movements that seek , instead , a decisive leader - someone to tell people what to do . 
Such leaders soon learn that their solutions are no better than anybody else &apos;s and decide that the best way to remain in power is by blaming all problems on foreigners . 
Thus they exalt the &quot; nation &quot; and focus their policies on zero-sum quarrels with other countries and on scapegoating deviant &quot; aliens &quot; at home . 
This is not in Europe &apos;s interest , and it is not in America &apos;s interest to have to deal with such a Europe . 
A democratic , prosperous , and stable Europe implies a much better and safer world for the US . 
Here is where the Fed comes in . 
By shifting its monetary-policy regime to target 4 % annual inflation - or 6 % annual nominal GDP growth - the US would set in motion rapid rebalancing in the eurozone . 
Rather than see the 30 % euro appreciation that would follow from the ECB &apos;s current monetary policy , German exporters would scream for measures to prevent America &apos;s &quot; competitive devaluation , &quot; finally bringing about moderate inflation in the north rather than the current grinding depression in the south . 
A world in which the US has a proven record of honoring the trust that is required of it to play the role of global economic hegemon is a much better world for the US than one in which it is not trusted . 
Simply put , the US must manage the global economy for the collective common good , or else confront a world in which global macroeconomic management results from race-to-the-bottom national policy struggles . 
America &apos;s medium- and long-term political , security , and , yes , economic interests require the Fed to recognize that its policy mission is not to focus narrowly on attempting to achieve and maintain internal balance . 
Rather , it is to embrace and fulfill its role as the world &apos;s central bank , by balancing aggregate demand and potential supply for the global economy as a whole .
