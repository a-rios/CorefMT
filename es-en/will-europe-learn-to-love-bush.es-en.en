Will Europe Learn to Love Bush ? 
President George W. Bush will soon travel to Europe , and President Jacques Chirac will visit Washington . 
EU &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; Javier Solana has already been there , and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation . 
Atmospherically , at least , relations have , indeed , improved since the US presidential election , and both sides have expressed good will . 
Yet there is little ground for genuine optimism . 
Bush &apos;s declared intention to &quot; better explain the reasons for his decisions &quot; to America &apos;s Allies simply will not do . 
Europeans don &apos;t want explanations ; they want to be consulted - to have input into American decision-making and see their concerns reflected in US foreign policy . 
None of this is likely to happen . 
On the contrary , the US is continuing to thwart European efforts gradually to establish a rule-based international order . 
There are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on , for example , the UN , the Kyoto Protocol , the International Criminal Court , the ban on land mines , or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . 
In Iraq , Europeans fully share the American objectives of preserving the country &apos;s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy . 
At the same time , they believe that it is up to the US to remove the chaos it created , so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way . 
European attitudes may seem shortsighted to Americans , but it would need a lot of cajoling to change them . 
There is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict : the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states . 
However , Europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by Bush - that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occupation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem - to be ill conceived . 
The same is true with respect to the President &apos;s assertion that Israel &apos;s permanent presence in Palestinian territories and the non-return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Israel must be accepted as realities on the ground . 
It may well be that such painful deviations from agreed principles will be reflected in an eventual comprehensive settlement , but prejudging these issues before the beginning of negotiations denies the Palestinians some of their most important bargaining chips . 
On the question of Iran &apos;s nuclear weapons capability , Americans and Europeans also fundamentally agree : it should be prevented . 
While the US tries to achieve this through hard power , regime change , sanctions , and threats of pre-emptive military intervention , Europe uses soft power , diplomacy , inclusion , and partnership . 
Unfortunately , this &quot; good cop , bad cop &quot; game doesn &apos;t work in international politics . 
European efforts to induce Teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing Iran &apos;s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active US support . 
In other words , Europe &apos;s carrots are not enough ; a successful outcome requires American carrots , too . 
By standing aside and discounting the European approach from the outset , America is merely helping to bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
It would be more productive for the US to join in , at the same time agreeing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail . 
Relations with China have improved over the years on both sides of the Atlantic . 
China has become Europe &apos;s biggest trading partner , and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America &apos;s most important creditor . 
Despite this rosy picture , China could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if Europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 . 
The Bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo , pointing out that in the event of a military clash over Taiwan , US troops would face weapons provided to China by America &apos;s own allies . 
In fact , European assurances that arms sales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing . 
On the other hand , economic interdependence between Taiwan and mainland China has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely . 
Of course , this would change were Taiwan to push for independence , but it would hardly do so without a nod from Washington . 
In short , on many of the most important current international issues , Americans and Europeans share the same objectives and basic goals . 
Where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them . 
Political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their considerable resources and march together whenever possible . 
This , however , requires a change of attitudes both in America and in Europe . 
Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals . 
European leaders must overcome any latent Anti-Americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the US .
