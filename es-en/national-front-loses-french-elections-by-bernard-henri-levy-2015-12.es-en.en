The French Rally to the Republic 
PARIS - Before the second round of France &apos;s regional elections on Sunday , most predictions suggested that five , perhaps six , of the country &apos;s regional governments would fall into the hands of the National Front ( FN ) . 
But the French people pulled themselves together and turned out to vote in much greater numbers than anyone expected . 
The result is that a xenophobic , racist party , one hostile to everything essential to the spirit and greatness of France , was defeated in all of the contests that it was supposed to win . 
Some will express surprise at this strange country , which is never so great as when it is on the edge of a cliff . 
They will worry - and they are right to worry - that a situation of extreme peril , a veritable threat to the nation , was required before the French recovered their senses and took the path of reason . 
And they will regret that the French are not the prosaic sort of people who know how to be themselves at normal cruising speed , without having to hear a cannonball whistle past . 
But that is how it is . 
And I , like many others , will not try to hide my satisfaction at seeing the smug scoundrels of the FN break down and resume speaking in their historic register , with their authentic voice , which is one of hatred and mob rage . 
This , truly , was a victory for the republic - a triumph of popular resistance . 
The French turned out , en masse , to say that they did not want to see the Le Pen gang take possession of their regions . 
That is the most important lesson from Sunday &apos;s vote , and it is a reassuring one . 
But what caused the nation to right itself ? 
Obviously , nothing happened between the elections &quot; first and second rounds that addressed the &quot; malaise &quot; of the French people . 
Nor was any particular promise made in response to the &quot; hard questions &quot; raised by FN voters just a week earlier . 
No . 
What we saw , instead , was a moral surge among the French - an act of self-defense by the body politic . 
Between the two rounds , the following simple idea sank in among the electorate : The National Front can revamp its façade all it wants , but it has never been , is not , and can never be a normal party . 
For how long have France &apos;s moral and political authorities been telling us that &quot; stigmatization &quot; of the National Front doesn &apos;t work , that it strengthens the party instead of weakening it ? 
Well , that was wrong 20 years ago , and it is still wrong . 
It cannot be repeated often enough that when the moral left and right have been strong , when groups like SOS Racisme set boundaries that are bright and clear , the FN has been contained electorally . 
But when those boundary lines are blurred , when the dikes crumble and the antiracist watchdogs allow themselves to be intimidated or lower their guard , the FN tries to make itself at home . 
The same is true today . 
The happy surprise of the regional vote owes absolutely nothing to accommodations with the FN by major parties that supposedly &quot; heard the message &quot; of &quot; angry &quot; voters ( rhetoric that they relentlessly drummed into us ) . 
On the contrary , a sufficient number of voters came to understand that in that very anger - in its spokespeople and in the words used to express it - lurked a threat to the republic , to democracy , and to the nation &apos;s fundamental values . 
That is the second lesson . 
What awaits us tomorrow ? 
How can we be sure that the FN wave , having receded , will not regain strength and break with even greater destructive force in the upcoming presidential election ? 
Better &quot; unemployment figures &quot; will be required , no doubt . 
Faster &quot; growth , &quot; certainly . 
We will also need &quot; efforts &quot; and &quot; gestures &quot; directed toward the one-third of people under 30 and the nearly one-half of industrial and service workers who are said to have expressed their &quot; frustration &quot; and &quot; anxiety &quot; by voting for the FN . 
Fine . 
No strategy will work if it is implemented by mediocrities who , in a political comedy as dishonorable as it is vain , rush to the television studios to declare , hand over heart , that they have heard the voters &quot; loud and clear . &quot; 
The key will be for French leaders to say - as loudly as possible and as often as necessary - that there is no answer to the &quot; hard questions &quot; as the FN poses them . 
And , like it or not , it must be said not only to the FN &apos;s leaders , but also to its voters . 
There have been other times in France &apos;s history when entire segments of the electorate have ejected themselves from the game , without the rest of the players rushing over to beg them to get back on the field . 
Georges Clémenceau , Jean Jaurès , and Raymond Poincaré , at the outset of the twentieth century , did not pander to the nearly half of the electorate that , during the Dreyfus Affair , had exiled themselves from the republic . 
Nor did Charles de Gaulle have any qualms about telling the proponents of French Algeria that , in the end , he did not understand them . 
Nor did Pierre Mendès France in the 1950s hesitate to tell the Communists that he didn &apos;t want their votes to support his government . 
France must now recall these great moments in its republican tradition and hold them up as a model for today &apos;s leaders .
