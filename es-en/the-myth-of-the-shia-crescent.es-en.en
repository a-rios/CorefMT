The Myth of the Shia Crescent 
AMMAN - Recently , Israel &apos;s Vice Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz offered an unequivocal veto on a key issue in the Middle East peace process . 
Any return of the Golan Heights to Syria would result in an &quot; Iranian foothold &quot; on Israel &apos;s border and would thus not only be politically na√Øve but irrational . 
Mofaz &apos;s statement is symptomatic of a perception that is now deeply entrenched , not only in the Middle East , but in the United States as well . 
That notion is of a hegemonic Iran that is attempting to dominate the region through an array of Shiite proxies . 
This Iranian fifth column is believed to stretch from Beirut via Damascus , Gaza to Baghdad and finally from Iran to Saudi-Arabia to Yemen . Recent armed clashes between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government are , it is said , just another sign of Iran &apos;s hegemonic reach . 
Ironically , this perception brings Israel some rather unlikely partners . 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt claims that Shiites are &quot; always loyal to Iran , &quot; while King Abdullah of Jordan has coined the axiom about a rising &quot; Shiite crescent . &quot; 
This &quot; rise of the Shiites &quot; and the resulting &quot; Sunni / Shia divide &quot; is alleged to be creating an ever widening chasm in the region . 
Although this perception may convince at first glance , it is ultimately based on generalizations that reveal more about its advocates than the actual reality on the ground . 
Take Iraq , where the looming &quot; Shia crescent &quot; is often blamed for much of the chaos . 
Recent developments in Iraq allegedly point to a fundamental clash between Sunnis and Shiites in the region and bear witness to malevolent Iranian interferences . 
But is Iraq really symptomatic of a greater Shia scheme ? 
True , sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq have escalated since the fall of Saddam . 
But contrary to common perception , Iraqi Shiites do not form a homogenous block that opposes the supposedly unified Sunnis . 
Indeed , the contrary is true . 
In the light of Iraqi nationalism that crosses sectarian boundaries , it is farfetched to consider the Iraqi Shia merely proxies of Iran . 
Instead , what we are witnessing in Iraq today is not ever increasing friction between religious communities but escalating internal power struggles within the Sunni and Shiite communities . 
Ongoing violence in Basra and the fighting between Sunni &quot; Awakening Councils &quot; and Al Qaida in Iraq demonstrate this . 
In fact , the current escalation points to an increasing political struggle between the federalist position of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki and the centralist position of Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr . 
This struggle will ultimately define the political structure of Iraq . 
Here is where Sunni-Shiite cooperation comes in . 
Widely unnoticed , Iraqi Sunni and Shia centralists have managed in the last couple of months to form a united parliamentary platform that leaves sectarian tensions behind . 
More than a hundred followers of Ayad Allawi , Al Sadr , and others have joined their ranks . 
This supra-sectarian platform calls for a central government administration of Iraq &apos;s natural resources and the postponement of the looming referendum to settle the status of the city of Kirkuk . 
Change within the government is also noteworthy . 
Sunni ministers who had been boycotting the government since last year have returned to their posts . 
Thus , Iraq is seeing both escalating intra-sectarian violence and cautious steps towards inter-sectarian alliances . 
And what about Iran ? 
Contrary to the blame games being played out in the US , Iran cannot be accused of an unrestrained aggressive stance toward Iraq . 
Of course , no Iranian decision-maker is interested in a US-success in Iraq that might well put regime-change in Iran back on the agenda . 
But the rationale behind Iran &apos;s policy of economic , social and military engagement seems to be first and foremost , defensive . 
Memories of Iraq &apos;s eight year war of aggression against Iran in the 1980 &quot; s have not faded . 
From Iran &apos;s perspective , any future threat originating from Iraq needs to be averted by ensuring the participation in Iraq &apos;s government of Shiites and Kurds . 
These complexities are lost on many observers when matched up against the convenient and catchy rhetoric of the &quot; Shia Crescent . &quot; 
But they have not gone unnoticed among ordinary Arabs . 
A recent poll by the University of Maryland indicates that a large majority of Arabs in the region consider Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad one of the three most popular political leaders worldwide . 
Only 11 % identified Iran as the biggest threat to their security . 
So if a Shia threat organized by Iran really does exist , why is it being ignored by those that it purportedly targets - the Sunni Arab majorities ? 
Rather than objectively describing the actual political situation in the Middle East , the notion of a fundamental Iranian threat is being used to continue unconditional Western support for increasingly unstable regimes . 
Moreover , the overstatement of the threat posed by Iran is also being used as a convenient excuse for political inflexibility and stagnating reform processes throughout the region . 
But exaggerating the supposed Shia threat has a price . 
Continuous talk of a &quot; Sunni-Shia divide &quot; might ultimately develop into a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Alarmist rhetoric may , in the end , jeopardize rather than protect the status quo in the region .
