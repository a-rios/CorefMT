Currency Chaos 
BRUSSELS - Guido Mantega , Brazil &apos;s finance minister , aptly captured the current monetary Zeitgeist when he spoke of a looming &quot; currency war . &quot; 
What had seemed a bilateral dispute between the United States and China over the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate has mutated into a general controversy over capital flows and currencies . 
Today , every country seems to want to depreciate its currency . 
Japan has resumed foreign-exchange intervention , and the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are preparing another large-scale purchase of government bonds - a measure called &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; which lowers long-term interest rates and indirectly weakens the currency . 
China is fiercely resisting US and European pressure to accelerate the snail-paced appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar . 
Emerging-market countries are turning to an array of techniques to discourage capital inflows or sterilize their effect on the exchange rate . 
Only the eurozone seems to be bucking the trend , as the European Central Bank has allowed a rise in the short-term interest rate . 
But even the ECB cannot be indifferent to the risks of appreciation , because a strong euro may seriously complicate economic adjustment in countries like Spain , Portugal , Greece , and Ireland . 
A world in which every country wants a weaker exchange rate is not without precedent . 
It happened in the 1930 &quot; s , when one country after another abandoned the gold standard , trying to export its unemployment . 
But everyone cannot have a weak currency at the same time , so , in 1944 , responsibility for preventing beggar-thy-neighbor depreciation was assigned to the International Monetary Fund , whose Articles of Agreement mandate it to &quot; exercise firm surveillance over the exchange-rate policies &quot; of member countries . 
Given this mission , it would seem that the IMF should help extract concessions from China and the rest of the world should declare a truce . 
But this would ignore a fundamental asymmetry between advanced and emerging countries . 
Both have suffered from the crisis , but not in the same way . 
According to the IMF , real output in advanced countries this year will still be below 2007 levels , whereas it will be 16 % higher in emerging and developing countries . 
Looking ahead , advanced countries will continue to struggle with the fallout of the 2008 crisis , especially with the deleveraging of indebted households and dire public finances . 
The IMF also reckons that the advanced countries must cut spending or increase taxes by nine percentage points of GDP on average over the current decade , in order to bring the public-debt ratio to 60 % of GDP by 2030 . 
Emerging countries , however , do not need any consolidation to keep their debt ratio at 40 % of GDP . 
Asymmetry of this magnitude requires a significant adjustment of relative prices . 
The relative price of the goods produced in the advanced countries ( their real exchange rate ) needs to depreciate vis-à-vis the emerging countries in order to compensate for the expected shortfall in internal demand . 
In fact , this will happen whatever the exchange rate between currencies . 
The only difference is that , if exchange rates remain fixed , advanced countries will have to go through a protracted period of low inflation ( or even deflation ) , which will make their debt burden even harder to bear , and emerging countries will have to enter an inflationary period as capital flows in , driving up reserves , increasing the money supply , and ultimately boosting the price level . 
For both sides , it is more desirable to let the adjustment take place through changes in nominal exchange rates , which would help contain deflation in the north and inflation in the south . 
But , compared to July 2007 , at the onset of the crisis , exchange rates between advanced and emerging countries have barely changed . 
True , some currencies have risen and others have fallen , but on average almost nothing has happened . 
The adjustment that needs to take place is blocked . 
For each central bank , the question is not what happens to , say , emerging countries as a whole , but what happens to its own currency vis-à-vis competitors . 
So Brazil does not want to appreciate vis-à-vis other Latin American countries , Thailand does not want to appreciate vis-à-vis other Asian countries , and no one wants to appreciate vis-à-vis China , which fears that renminbi appreciation would lead labor-intensive industries to migrate to Vietnam or Bangladesh . 
Thus , a change that is in everyone &apos;s interest is hampered by lack of coordination . 
Quantitative easing in the advanced countries also raises a question of coordination . 
QE is a legitimate monetary-policy instrument , but the Fed and the Bank of England would probably not embrace it with such enthusiasm were it not for the anticipated exchange-rate depreciation . 
In fact , the ECB &apos;s perceived reluctance to follow suit is likely to add to the expected growth effects of US or British monetary-policy choices , at the expense of the eurozone . 
The controversy over China &apos;s exchange-rate policy thus is no mere bilateral US-China trade dispute , but rather a global macroeconomic clash between advanced and emerging countries . 
Moreover , the lack of coordination in both advanced and emerging countries suggests that the solution to currency wars is not to declare a truce , but to recognize the nature of the issue and overcome the problems that stand in the way of agreed common solutions . 
This is not to say that the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate is a secondary issue . 
On the contrary , its importance stems from the fact that China holds the key to global adjustment . 
The recent IMF / World Bank annual meetings indicate that this is gradually being recognized , with emerging countries increasingly critical of China &apos;s inflexibility . 
So now is the IMF &apos;s moment . 
The Fund should propose a conceptual framework for the discussions to be held on exchange-rate problems by providing an objective assessment of the adjustments that are needed , and by facilitating settlement within the multilateral framework . 
The IMF cannot substitute for governments &quot; choices .
