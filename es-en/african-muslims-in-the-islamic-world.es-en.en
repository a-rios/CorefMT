African Muslims In The Islamic World 
Nigeria has been convulsed by religious violence triggered by the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper months ago . 
The violence began in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri during a protest by Muslims against the cartoons , with the Christian Association of Nigeria reporting at least 50 Christians killed . 
Reprisals were swift , and at least 50 Muslims were killed in three days of violence in the southeastern ( predominantly Christian ) cities of Onitsha and Enugu . 
The Nigerian protests against the cartoons ( so far the most violent in Africa ) raise the question : what is the role and position of African Muslims ( or more accurately , sub-Saharan African Muslims ) in the &quot; Islamic World &quot; ? 
When people in the rest of the world use the term &quot; Islamic World &quot; do they include in it sub-Saharan African Muslims , or do they have in mind only the Muslims of the Middle East and Asia ? 
Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa do not share many characteristics with Muslims in other parts of the world , especially those of the Arab world . 
Sub-Saharan African Muslims are less assertive , and they face considerably more difficulties in their attempts to articulate their rights and establish their presence in their respective states and regions . 
Part of the difficulty arises from the perpetual African dilemma of identity . 
Africa has been described as a continent having a triple heritage , and the African Muslim , too , has a split personality . 
He must decide whether he is a Muslim first , then a member of his tribe , say , Hausa , and then of his nation , say , Nigeria . 
Even though Muslim practice is strong in Africa , there is widespread incorporation of traditional African rituals in ceremonies like weddings and funerals . 
For example , among the Luhya in Western Kenya , it is not uncommon for Muslims to slaughter animals during funerals , even though , strictly speaking , there is no such provision in Islam . 
Muslims in many sub-Saharan African states are also minorities . 
They do not form a formidable presence , as in Nigeria , where some Muslim-majority states in the north have even implemented Sharia Law , making them more or less Islamic states . 
Nevertheless , the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a secular state , as are almost all sub-Saharan African states . 
The colonial legacy also helps account for the relatively docile nature of Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa . 
The colonial powers &quot; arbitrary demarcation of borders lumped together in one state diverse ethnic groups which may have been historical antagonists . 
Colonial political economy also concentrated &quot; development &quot; in resource-rich areas , while neglecting resource-poor regions and their populations , which in many cases were Muslim . 
Thus we see a relatively poor Hausa-Muslim majority population in northern Nigeria and a relatively rich Ibo-Christian majority population in oil-rich southeastern Nigeria ; a relatively rich Christian majority population in central Kenya and a relatively poor Muslim majority population on the coast and in the northeastern provinces ; and so on . 
As political power tends to polarize around economic power , sub-Saharan African Muslims have been under-represented in these mostly centralized political systems . 
Moreover , Muslims in these mostly patron-client states have been forced to identify more with atomistic / parochial ethnic nationalism in order to enjoy the &quot; fruits of independence &quot; and thus acquire whatever political representation they have . 
It is no exaggeration to argue that the more Arabized African Muslims along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts ( including the island of Zanzibar ) consider themselves &quot; more Muslim &quot; than the less Arabized Muslims inland . 
Muslim political participation in sub-Saharan Africa has thus been extremely limited . 
Political Islam is an almost unknown phenomenon in this region ( the Islamic Party of Kenya was never registered , for example ) , and Muslim organizations have mostly focused on welfare and rights . 
However , Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa , like most Muslims around the world , exhibit an &quot; us versus them &quot; mentality . 
When Muslims form a minority , they have tended to co-exist peacefully with other religions , but where their populations are substantial ( as in Nigeria ) , they tend to assert themselves . 
Whatever ethnic and other divisions are at stake , the &quot; us versus them &quot; sentiment has played a large role in fomenting religious conflict in Nigeria . 
Nevertheless , Nigeria ( and perhaps Zanzibar ) remains an exception in Islamic assertiveness in sub-Saharan Africa , which is why the idea of an active &quot; Islamic World &quot; includes only a relatively limited segment of sub-Saharan African Muslims . 
Whether they like it or not , the majority of sub-Saharan African Muslims are represented by states that are mostly secular , Christian , or dominated by other religions .
