Saudi Arabia &apos;s Shia Stand Up 
BEIRUT - On February 24 , violent confrontations between Shia pilgrims and the Saudi religious police and security forces occurred at the entrance to the Prophet Mohamed &apos;s Mosque in Medina . 
The timing and location of the clashes may have serious repercussions for domestic security , if not for the regime itself . 
Some 2,000 Shia pilgrims gathered near the mosque that houses the Prophet &apos;s tomb for the commemoration of Mohamed &apos;s death , an act of worship that the ruling Saudi Wahhabi sect considers heretical and idolatrous . 
Thus , the Mutawa &apos;ah , the religious police of the Committee for the Preservation of Virtue and the Prohibition of Vice , armed with sticks and backed by police firing into the air , tried to disperse the pilgrims . 
The pilgrims resisted . 
Three pilgrims died and hundreds were injured in the ensuing stampede . 
A large number of pilgrims remain in detention , among them 15 teenage boys . 
Soon after , representatives of Saudi Arabia &apos;s Shia community sought a meeting with King Abdullah in an effort to free the detainees . 
Dialogue seemed like a promising strategy : just ten days earlier , Abdullah had announced a promising reform agenda for the country . 
But the King refused to meet the Shia delegation . 
The violence outside the Medina mosque has led to unprecedented demonstrations in front of Saudi embassies in London , Berlin , and The Hague , with protesters demanding independence from the Saudi state . 
Such demonstrations are , of course , illegal in Saudi Arabia . 
But domestic suppression has only served to export and expand the problem . 
And now , the regime &apos;s policies of repression , discrimination , and antagonism directed at the Shia and other politically marginalized groups increasingly threaten the Saudi state with disintegration . 
The Shia are a special case , constituting 75 % of the population in the Eastern Province , the Kingdom &apos;s main oil-producing region , and identifying far more strongly with Shia across the border in Iraq than with the Saudi state . 
Indeed , the empowerment of Iraq &apos;s long-suppressed Shia has raised expectations among Saudi Arabia &apos;s Shia that they , too , can gain first-class status . 
From the regime &apos;s point of view , however , Shia Iran is now the most serious security threat . 
The Saudi authorities perceived the Shia demonstrations as an assertion of Iranian policy , as they coincided precisely with Iran &apos;s celebration of the 30th anniversary of its Islamic Revolution . 
Suppression of the Shia is thus a part of the Kingdom &apos;s strategy to counter Iran &apos;s bid for regional hegemony . 
But this thinking is tremendously shortsighted . 
Only by transforming Saudi Arabia &apos;s currently monolithic Saudi / Wahhabi national identity into a more inclusive one will the Kingdom become a model that is attractive to its minorities . 
Today , the disempowered Shia are forced to seek political connections and backing from the region &apos;s wider Shia political movements to compensate for the discrimination they face at home . 
So the choice for the Saudi rulers is stark : empower the Shia within the system , or watch as they increase their power through external alliances . 
The threat that this would represent is not abstract : the Kingdom &apos;s borders are very porous . 
So far , King Abdullah has shown no sign of opting for a policy of inclusion - not even a token gesture , such as a Shia minister . 
Moreover , Abdullah is unable even to stop Wahhabi satellite TV stations from denouncing the Shia &quot; heretics , &quot; or the hundreds of Wahhabi Web sites that call for the outright elimination of the Shia . 
But non-Wahhabi Saudis , mainly the Shia , continue to resist state dogma . 
Until the beginning of this year , they have not formed significant or open opposition movements , owing to a historically well-entrenched fear of repression . 
Shia unrest dates back to the Kingdom &apos;s establishment in 1932 , and violent confrontations with the Saudi state began with the Shia revolution in neighbouring Iran . 
The Iranian revolution prompted a Shia uprising in the Eastern Province in November 1979 . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s Shia , an economically and politically marginalized community , staged an unprecedented intifada in the towns of Qatif , Saihat , Safwa , and Awamiyya . 
Tens of thousands of men and women demanded an end to the politics of discrimination against the Shia . 
Although , the Saudi security forces , the National Guard , and the marines crushed the rebellion , the domestic tensions that fueled it remain . 
And Ayatollah Khomeini challenged the Al Saud &apos;s ideological monopoly and control of Mecca and Medina . 
Khomeini challenged the very concept of monarchy in Islam by declaring that &quot; those with authority &quot; are not Kings but religious scholars . 
The Saudi religious establishment has long been on alert to this rival and threatening entity . 
Sefr al Hawali , a prominent Saudi Wahhabi cleric , warned of the dangers of the &quot; Shia arc &quot; following the Shia intifada in Iraq in 1991 . 
But , since the war in Iraq in 2003 and the empowerment of Shia across the region , the Saudi regime faces sizeable , restless , and politically ambitious Shia populations in neighboring Gulf countries , especially Kuwait and Bahrain , as well as in Lebanon . 
The demonstrations at Medina show that Saudi Shia are now themselves emboldened . Indeed , they have formed an opposition movement called Khalas ( Salvation ) , aimed at mobilizing the new generation of Shia in the Eastern Province . 
In light of widened regional and political cleavages , confrontations such as occurred in the holy mosque of the Prophet could increase in frequency , size , and violence .
