The Middle East &apos;s Moment of Truth 
JERUSALEM : Whatever the outcome of the summit convened by President Clinton at Camp David between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and PLO Chairman Yassar Arafat , one thing is clear : the moment of truth for Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations has arrived . 
Defections from Prime Minister Barak &apos;s government and coalition , including the resignation of his foreign minister , David Levy , who refused to accompany Barak to Washington , will make the negotiations even more dramatic . 
Israel and the Palestinians have been negotiating since 1995 , when they signed the Oslo Accords whose major achievement was mutual recognition and autonomy in areas of the West Bank and Gaza for the Palestinians . 
Further negotiations were to decide the final status of the Palestinian Authority ( ie , whether Palestine is to be an independent state ) , the border issue , the future of Jewish settlements , whether refugees could return to their homes , and the final status of Jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital but which Israel controls in its entirety . 
According to a series of agreements signed over the years within this framework , a Palestinian Authority , with Yassar Arafat as its head , was established . 
Arafat returned from exile in Tunis to Gaza , and Israel turned over to the Palestinian Authority most of Gaza and most of the towns in the West Bank . 
Today , although the Palestinian Authority controls less than 30 % of the West Bank and Gaza , over 80 % of Palestinians in these territories live under Palestinian rule , free from Israeli military occupation . 
A Palestinian legislature and cabinet have opened , as well as Palestinian police and security services . 
The economy in areas under Palestinian control is administered by the Palestinian Authority , as are education and other internal matters . 
While economic results are mixed , the most important change in the daily life of Palestinians is that most no longer live under Israeli rule . 
Yet Jewish settlements , built mainly under the right-wing governments of Menachem Begin , Yitzhak Shamir , and Benjamin Netanyahu , remain in place , and relations between settlers - some of them extremely radical nationalists - and Palestinians remain raw . 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin &apos;s assassination by a nationalist-religious extremist Jewish student slowed the peace process , especially after Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister in 1996 . 
But in 1999 Ehud Barak , Labour &apos;s leader , was elected Prime Minister in a sweeping personal victory that restored momentum to the peace negotiations . 
It is this new momentum that now may drive the process . 
Although most territorial issues have been negotiated , the most difficult ones , which were intentionally left to the latter stages of the negotiations , now must be addressed . 
Here is where the whole process will stand or fall . 
What will be the status of Jerusalem ? 
To go back to the 1967 dividing lines , which cut the city in two , is impossible , especially as over 120,000 Israelis now live across the old dividing line . 
What will be the future of Jewish settlements ? 
Should they stay , be partly evacuated , or be put partly under Palestinian rule ? 
These are the thorny problems , which combine political , strategic , religious and symbolic issues that transcend the human dimensions of what is to happen to the populations - Jewish and Arab - involved . 
The weakening political positions of the leaders complicates matters even more . 
Prime Minister Barak &apos;s position suffers from a very brittle coalition , and he has recently lost his parliamentary majority . 
Arafat is under pressure from his extremists . 
In the past he condoned acts of violence against Israelis in order to please fundamentalist radicals , which greatly diminished the trust of the Israeli public ( and not only of right-wing extremists ) in Arafat &apos;s credibility and reliability . 
It is under these circumstances that an outside push is required , and this is what President Clinton provided in launching this week &apos;s Camp David talks . 
If no agreement on the last remaining issues is achieved , escalation will ensue : the Palestinians may declare independence unilaterally ; 
Israel may retaliate ; the delicate balance of Oslo may unravel . 
Prime Minister Barak appears ready to accept an independent Palestinian state - something no Israeli leader has , until now , been willing to do . 
He has made clear that perhaps 30,000 settlers , may be evacuated to Israel proper or could remain in their homes under Palestinian rule . 
This is a courageous and novel Israeli step , with an enormous price paid by Barak . 
Mutually unacceptable positions are also voiced on both sides on the Jerusalem issue . 
This is why a compromise is needed - and will in all probability be reached at Camp David . 
It is difficult for Barak and Arafat , when in conclave with Clinton , to allow America &apos;s President to fail . 
The Camp David talks will likely witness a series of tough bargaining rounds with ups and downs , real and concocted crises , and a lot of tip-toeing to the edge by both sides . 
But the logic of the situation is that , sooner or later , perhaps after a crisis or two , compromise will be found . 
Reaching that point will be arduous for both sides , but as President Clinton said when announcing the summit , the alternative is far worse .
