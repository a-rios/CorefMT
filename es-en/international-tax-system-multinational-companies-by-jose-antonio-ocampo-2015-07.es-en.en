International Taxation and Global Development 
NEW YORK - When it comes to funding development , taxes are perhaps the most critical piece of the puzzle . 
If the world is to make progress toward its goals of eradicating poverty and stemming rising inequality , the system must be reformed . 
The biggest problem with the current system is that , by taxing the subsidiaries of multinational corporations as separate entities , it provides plenty of room for global companies to dodge their tax obligations . 
The reform efforts by the OECD , acting at the request of the G-20 , represent welcome attempts to address so-called &quot; base erosion and profit shifting &quot; ( BEPS ) , but they do not go far enough . 
The most significant deliverable of the OECD &apos;s BEPS initiative lies in its new country-by-country reporting requirements , which force multinationals to provide aggregate information annually , in each jurisdiction where they do business , relating to the global allocation of income and taxes paid . 
They must also provide information about which entities do business in each jurisdiction and the economic activities in which they engage . 
But such reporting will apply only to entities with revenues above â‚¬ 750 million ( $ 845 million ) and will not be made public . 
Furthermore , countries have to meet certain conditions to access the information - a structure that will not benefit most developing countries . 
Yet developing countries have the most at stake . 
Indeed , the International Monetary Fund recently reported that developing countries lose three times more of their corporate-tax revenue to BEPS activities than their developed counterparts . 
According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , such activities by multinationals - which represent one-third of the potential corporate-tax base in developing countries - result in annual losses of $ 100 billion . 
Given the major role that tax revenues play in funding development efforts - providing two-thirds of the financing for the UN Millennium Development Goals , with official aid and private flows covering the rest - the bleeding must be stanched . 
As world leaders gear up for this month &apos;s Third International Conference on Financing for Development ( FFD3 ) in Addis Ababa , where they will develop a strategy to fund the post-2015 global development agenda , a move toward a more efficient and equitable global tax system could not be more urgent . 
That is why a group of public intellectuals from around the world has created the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation ( ICRICT ) , which I chair . 
We believe that the world has an unprecedented opportunity to bring about significant reform of the international corporate-taxation system that serves the global public interest , rather than national advantage . 
To help induce world leaders to take advantage of this opportunity , the ICRICT has issued a set of recommendations for reform of the rules and institutions governing international corporate-taxation . 
The proposals include a minimum corporate tax agreed by developed countries , and mechanisms to prevent multinationals from shifting their profits to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions . 
Moreover , in contrast to the OECD reforms , the ICRICT recommends public reporting by multinationals on taxes paid in all jurisdictions . 
A first step toward achieving these objectives would be the establishment of an intergovernmental body with the mandate and resources to push through much-needed tax reform , while promoting stronger tax cooperation among governments . 
The decision about whether to establish such a body is an important feature of the FFD3 agenda . 
Such a globally representative forum on taxation should not only serve as a venue for inter-governmental cooperation ; it should also support a broader , more inclusive debate on tax reform . 
For too long , such discussions have been the preserve of closed-door negotiations among governments and large corporations , with the topic considered too technical for the general public to understand . 
Even now , many argue that including everyone in the discussion would result in politicization of the tax system , and that decisions should thus be left to the experts . 
But taxation is inherently political , as it involves issues of equity , justice , and the common good . 
Indeed , issues of taxation were at the heart of the creation of modern democratic parliaments . 
An issue with such far-reaching consequences should not be debated in secrecy . 
If world leaders are serious about reducing inequality and eradicating poverty , they must commit to creating a just and transparent tax system . 
One hopes that this month in Addis Ababa , they take credible steps in that direction .
