Europe &apos;s Paradoxical Parliament 
What do members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) actually do ? 
Most of the 375 million or so people eligible to vote in the European elections on June 4-7 probably have only a hazy idea , or none at all , which explains why voter turnout throughout the European Union is likely to be disastrously low . 
Thirty years ago , when the first elections to the parliament were held , almost two-thirds of the electorate voted , but over the years , participation has dropped steadily . 
This year it may be 30 % . 
Europe &apos;s politicians are by and large proud of the EU and the way it has both grown and deepened . 
The European elections are themselves curious and unsatisfactory ; there are no obvious EU-wide issues that people can vote for or against , and , with the average MEP &apos;s constituency numbering well over half a million people , the vote is not a test of personal popularity , either . 
In most parts of Europe , the elections will be an opportunity for protest votes on national issues . 
Paradoxically , though , great deal hangs on the elections &quot; outcome . 
The number of seats won by the socialists and centre-right parties is likely to influence the make-up of the next European Commission - and thus the EU &apos;s political agenda until 2014 . 
But you wouldn &apos;t know this from the low level of media interest . 
Most journalists , like national electorates , have little understanding of the significant shift in Europe &apos;s political decision-making over the last 20 years . 
They hang on to the outdated notion that their national parliaments make all key decisions , when in reality some four-fifths of the policies that determine Europe &apos;s future are taken in Brussels and then rubber-stamped by national parliamentarians . 
A glance at any EU member state &apos;s parliamentary calendar shows that lawmaking there is largely confined to domestic issues . 
The specialist MEPs , on the other hand , use their expertise and their steadily increasing powers to exert a good deal of influence on EU legislation . 
But this does not mean that the European Parliament is a &quot; real &quot; parliament . 
It can &apos;t raise taxes , declare war , or sack a government ( even though in theory it can dismiss all the members of the European Commission en masse , the so-called &quot; nuclear option &quot; that is unlikely ever to be used ) . 
More to the point , perhaps , the European Parliament doesn &apos;t really work on the same basis of left-right politics as national parliaments do ; it deals in practicalities more than ideologies . 
For all that , the European Parliament &apos;s importance goes far beyond its members &quot; technical expertise on complex issues , or its usefulness as a democratic fig leaf for an EU decision-making process that is dominated by inter-governmental horse-trading . 
The parliament has been able to claw greater power for itself because it is the only mechanism Europe has for questioning and challenging EU policy proposals , and ironing out the sometimes clumsy and high-handed diktats of Brussels &quot; officialdom . 
Unfortunately , however , the European Parliament is fairly inept at selling itself to public opinion . 
A recent Gallup poll showed that 36 % of people questioned in all 27 EU countries no longer trust the parliament , with the only consolation being that even more , 37 % , now mistrust the European Commission . 
Of those who said they wouldn &apos;t be voting in this year &apos;s European elections , 64 % cited &quot; lack of information &quot; as the reason , with 62 % complaining that their vote &quot; wouldn &apos;t change anything . &quot; 
This feeling of ignorance coupled with powerlessness is not entirely the European Parliament &apos;s fault . 
The combination of high politics and grinding technical detail makes EU policymaking a much less interesting spectacle than national politics , and of course there &apos;s the added problem that so many of the players are unknown foreigners . 
Last year , the parliament launched a lamentably amateurish Web-TV broadcasting service whose large budget was spent not on good programming but on doing everything in all the EU &apos;s official languages . 
So what is to be done ? 
Many of the 736 EU parliamentarians are unsung heroes who risk being seen more and more as a problem rather than a solution to the EU &apos;s ills . 
Rather than tinkering , perhaps the EU should boldly create an American-style bicameral system by turning the parliament into a House of Representatives and electing a Senate to replace the Council of Ministers , with two senators per member state .
