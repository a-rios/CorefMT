Multilateral Engagement for Energy Security 
Our global need for energy reliability binds us together as surely as the global network that delivers it ; a failure in one part of our network will inevitably affect everyone . 
Local interests and persistent conflicts that sit astride our networks , including the as yet unresolved issue of Russian gas supply to Ukraine and Europe , have again raised the specter of energy being used as a weapon to gain political leverage . 
Energy security is at the top of the agenda of the G-8 meeting hosted by President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg . 
The G-8 has correctly identified the key economic issue , energy interdependence , and now is the time for focused multilateral engagement on this issue . 
For some countries that are blessed with vast supplies of oil and gas , the use of energy exports to reward friends and punish foes seems a tempting option . 
Today , however , it is more likely to prove disruptive to friend and foe alike , as well as damaging to those countries that indulge this temptation . 
Energy embargoes have generally proven counterproductive . 
The price rises that followed OPEC &apos;s oil embargoes of the 1970 &quot; s were unsustainable and led to conservation efforts and expansion of non-OPEC production . 
As a result , OPEC &apos;s share of world oil exports dropped sharply in the twelve years following the embargo of 1973-1974 . 
Experience has taught us that transparency and price stability is in everyone &apos;s interest . 
Pursuit of these principals while encouraging the development of global markets is essential to greater overall growth prospects for the world economy . 
So when Russia sought earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine , it argued that it was simply demanding market rates . 
The message sounded fair and it did , for a short time , appeal to some policymakers and investors not fully apprised of the situation . 
To be clear , measured price changes implemented over time was never in dispute ; indeed , some internal price adjustments for Ukraine were in order . 
Unfortunately for Russia &apos;s neighbors , it is not the market that determines what price is paid for Russia &apos;s gas or transport ; it is Gazprom and its chairman , Dmitry Medvedev , who is also the Russian government &apos;s First Deputy Prime Minister . 
The price charged by Gazprom for each country bordering Russia is different and is largely determined by political relationships with the Kremlin . 
Economically speaking , gas supply and transport prices are more correlated to political relationships than to fundamental supply-demand or gas transport basis calculations . 
Ukraine was threatened with an immediate quadrupling of its prices - or interruption of its gas supply - as a result of it new-found independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution . 
Georgia , also feeling the wrath of Moscow following the Rose Revolution , faced potentially harmful price increases as well . 
Belarus , however , still in strong alignment with the Kremlin , continues to enjoy highly subsidized gas . 
Of course , Ukraine was not the only country put at risk by this brinksmanship ; suppliers such as Turkmenistan , geographically locked into transit requirements through Russia , also suffer . 
And for the consuming nations of Western and Central Europe , the price effects and supply disruption anxieties were of significant consequence . 
Immediate multilateral intervention by the European Union and the United States probably are what probably caused Gazprom to turn the gas back on . 
Natural gas may be the commodity most vulnerable to event-driven supply disruptions . 
The fixed interconnected pipelines lock producers and consumers in a near-exclusive embrace . 
Diversification in natural gas transportations is a long-term cross-border asset development proposition requiring enormous investment and political commitment on a multilateral level . 
Many solutions are already under consideration : new gas storage capacity , increased efficiency , expansion of domestic production of both oil and gas , and alternative energy supplies such as coal-bed methane . 
Additionally , a market in tradable liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) is rapidly emerging . 
It is more feasible to diversify the supply chain , albeit incrementally , by importing gas from distant producers rather than from monopolistic suppliers next door . 
All of these efforts together will soften shocks somewhat and create more energy self-sufficiency . 
Yet more is required . 
First , G-8 leaders should consider implementing standards in energy transactions requiring open and transparent contracts in line with best practices in business . 
It is important to dilute the global impact of local politicians pursuing non â€‘ energy agendas , or simply their own limited interests . 
We see these problems today in state-owned firms in Latin America , political unrest in Africa , tensions in the Middle East or through opaque business intermediaries , as in the questionable gas deal between Ukraine and Russia , known now as RUE ( RosUkrEnergo ) . 
In the end , energy security for all of us in Europe requires recognizing that the linked nature of our supply and transmission systems makes us interdependent . 
This is where an &quot; Energy Alliance &quot; of consumers and suppliers could be useful , starting with the nations of Europe helping to guarantee the energy supplies of others in a major disruption . 
The Energy Charter , which emphasizes market access and transparency , is a laudable effort but it is not sufficient for those moments of crisis ; our markets are not yet well enough equipped to deal with event-driven disruptions . 
The Energy Charter might be a vehicle for this collective energy security , if deepened and broadened . 
It is our duty as leaders to chart a course for a secure energy future . 
Tolerance of questionable dealing today for the sake of political expediency will cost more in the future for us all . 
When the inevitable conflict occurs , public confidence , political credibility and market reliability are needlessly sacrificed - this has clearly occurred for Russia and for Ukraine . 
Threats to energy security must be challenged and resolved on a multilateral basis , with all stakeholders present . 
The interdependent nature of our energy infrastructure requires a multilateral approach . 
We are all depending on it .
