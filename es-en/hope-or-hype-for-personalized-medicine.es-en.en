Hope or Hype for Personalized Medicine ? 
STANFORD - During the past several decades , treatment for a variety of conditions has begun to shift from a &quot; one size fits all &quot; approach to a more personalized strategy . 
As a result , patients can more often be matched to the best drug for their genetic makeup or the exact subcategory of their disease . 
This enables physicians to avoid prescribing a medication ( or a dosage ) that might cause serious side effects in certain populations . 
In other words , even among patients who apparently have the same disease and symptoms , the treatment for each one would be determined by various predictive or prognostic tests . 
Eventually , these tests could extend even to the sequencing of the DNA in an individual patient &apos;s cancer cells , for example . 
But , while this high-tech approach could be a boon to patients , it could prove detrimental to drug companies &quot; bottom lines . 
The reasons are subtle . 
Personalized drug therapy uses biological indicators , or &quot; biomarkers &quot; - such as DNA sequences or the presence or absence of drug receptors - as an indicator of how patients should be treated , as well as to estimate the likelihood that the intervention will be effective . 
This concept is not new : it has been known for decades , for example , that people who have a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD can experience severe and precipitous anemia if they are exposed to certain drugs . 
Similarly , ethnic groups and individuals vary widely in their ability to clear medications from the bloodstream , owing to differences in the activity of the enzymes that metabolize , or degrade , drugs . 
That is important because low metabolizers clear certain drugs slowly and have more medication in their systems for longer periods of time than high metabolizers . 
Thus , the former might be prone to overdose , and the latter to insufficient levels of the same drug . 
Prognostic biomarkers have begun to make a big difference in cancer therapy . 
Drugs such as Erbitux and Vectibix work only in tumors containing the normal version of a gene called KRAS . 
If mutations of KRAS are present , the drugs are ineffective . 
Such mutations explain about 30-40 % of cases in which patients fail to respond to these drugs , and mutations in another gene called BRAF could account for another 12 % . 
Knowing this crucial information about a cancer patient &apos;s genes will reduce sharply the number who are unnecessarily subjected to the side effects ( and expense ) of drugs that will not work . 
Improving the efficacy and reducing the side effects of drug therapy will be a boon to doctors , patients , and insurance companies , to be sure , but why should pharmaceutical companies embrace personalized medicine in the long term ? 
On the positive side , the presence of biomarkers will enable drug companies to perform smaller , better-targeted clinical studies in order to demonstrate efficacy . 
In any kind of experiment , a fundamental principle is that the greater the number of subjects or iterations , the greater the confidence in the study &apos;s results . 
Unless the effect of the intervention is profound , small studies generally have large uncertainties in results . 
That is where biomarkers make a difference . 
They can help drug makers to design clinical studies that will show a high &quot; relative treatment difference &quot; between the drug and whatever it is being compared to ( often a placebo , but sometimes another treatment ) . 
Thus , when drugs are ultimately approved based on the use of biomarkers , the description of the medication &apos;s approved uses , which is printed on the label , might be more restrictive - that is , it might reduce the size of the patient population for which the drug is intended . 
For example , a drug broadly approved for &quot; arthritis &quot; - inflammation of joints that may be due to dozens of different disease processes - can be more widely marketed than one approved to treat only the arthritis that accompanies psoriasis or gout . 
In reality , however , the situation is more complex . 
Assessments of safety and efficacy often do not move closely in tandem , so that even if smaller , better-targeted clinical trials offer clear evidence of a drug &apos;s efficacy , regulators might demand far larger studies to provide evidence of the drug &apos;s safety . 
Increasingly defensive about accusations that drugs and vaccines are inadequately tested for safety , in recent years safety-obsessed regulators have required massive , hugely expensive , and time-consuming clinical trials designed to detect even very rare side effects . 
Consider , for example , that before its US approval , a vaccine against rotavirus ( a common , sometimes fatal gastrointestinal infection in children ) was tested in more than 72,000 children - and another 40,000-plus in post-marketing studies . 
On a similar scale , a vaccine to prevent human papilloma virus infection and cervical cancer was tested in almost 30,000 young women . 
Such studies are very costly , and , by any reasonable standard , the number of patients included in them is grossly excessive . 
Thus , the impact of personalized medicine in the short term might be positive at the patient &apos;s bedside , but vast clinical trials to demonstrate the safety of new drugs will impose huge development costs that manufacturers might never recover . 
( Currently , only about one in five drugs approved by US regulators ever recoup their development costs . ) This situation would not be sustainable in the long term . 
If society is to derive the maximum benefit from personalized medicine - which will require companies to pursue it - regulators worldwide will need to adopt reasoned and reasonable policies .
