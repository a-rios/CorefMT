Winning the Transatlantic Trade Challenge 
MADRID - US President Barack Obama &apos;s announcement that negotiations will begin on a comprehensive &quot; Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership &quot; has generated excitement on both sides of the Atlantic . 
After a restless month in which it appeared that momentum for talks had dissipated , the announcement has renewed hope that a transformative agreement between the United States and the European Union can be reached . 
Though commentators and policymakers have noted the numerous challenges inherent in such a pact , the general mood is one of optimism , reflected in US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s comments in Berlin during his first overseas trip since taking office . 
But , in order to prevent negotiations from stalling over sensitive topics , such as subsidies and food safety , key political actors should first convene to resolve core differences . 
If combined with continued senior-level engagement , such an approach could make or break the deal . 
The economic benefits of a trade agreement between economies that , together , account for more than 50 % of global output and maintain nearly $ 4 trillion in cross-border investment are evident . 
Such an agreement could also transform transatlantic ties more broadly . 
An ambitious transatlantic trade pact that is fully compatible with World Trade Organization standards and accepting of third parties should aspire to more than laying the groundwork for an &quot; economic NATO . &quot; 
Indeed , it should seek to create the foundation for a free-trade area of the entire Atlantic basin , with membership extending to Africa and Latin America . 
The completion of a US-EU trade agreement would reenergize a transatlantic relationship that has been weighed down by the eurozone crisis and is at risk of becoming strategically irrelevant . 
Yet , sadly , we have been down this road before , only to run out of pavement . 
In the mid-1990 &quot; s , as policymakers sought to reframe post-Cold War US-European relations , there was movement toward the establishment of a transatlantic free-trade area ( TAFTA ) . 
But US fatigue following the conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) with Canada and Mexico , together with rising domestic protectionism , helped to keep TAFTA on the ground . 
The most recent push , in 2007 , was derailed by policy disagreements , particularly over health and safety standards . 
The current environment appears to be more favorable . 
The economic boost provided from such a partnership is badly needed on both sides of the Atlantic . 
In the US , free trade provides Obama with a potential major policy victory on an issue that should garner bipartisan support . 
Meanwhile , negotiations offer Europe the opportunity to shift its narrative from the monotonous drone of crisis management to a genuine recipe for growth . 
And , of course , there is now the impetus posed by the world &apos;s rising economic powers , which are challenging the ability of the US and Europe to dictate the standards of international trade . 
It has been suggested that a good way to start the talks would be to consider the free-trade and free-trade-related agreements that the US and EU already have in place . 
But the success of the upcoming talks will need more than positive atmospherics and a starting line for technical negotiations . 
Achieving an agreement also requires political will at the highest levels . 
In the US , the president and Congress must both be engaged to ensure that entrenched domestic interests , such as agriculture and civil aviation , do not impede a potential agreement . 
The truly contentious issues - genetically modified ( GM ) food , subsidies , and intellectual-property rights - should be raised with the key political actors now , not later . 
And , including US congressional leaders - particularly House and Senate Republicans who support such a deal - in the talks from the beginning would increase the chances of success , because an agreement would not be seen solely as a victory for the Obama administration . 
Moreover , a bipartisan approach might ease authorization for so-called Trade Promotion Authority , allowing the president to present an agreement for an up-or-down vote without possibility of amendment - which will be essential for the completion of negotiations . 
We have already seen qualified US congressional support from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and ranking Republican Orrin Hatch who , while calling the potential agreement &quot; an enticing opportunity , &quot; specifically noted the need to address &quot; unwarranted agricultural barriers &quot; in the EU , including policies on GM organisms and hormones . 
The EU , for its part , must go beyond the European Commission and directly involve the European Council and heads of member states . 
Though negotiation of an agreement is within the Commission &apos;s competence , movement on the key issues requires the clear support of member states . 
Compromise on agricultural issues or geographical indications , for example , will not occur without French and Italian support . 
Indeed , there have already been grumblings from France about agricultural reform and cultural subsidies . 
The final report of the High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth , released ahead of Obama &apos;s announcement , recommended that the &quot; EU and the United States meet periodically at senior levels after negotiations have started &quot; to review the progress of the talks . 
This is an excellent suggestion , but such senior-level engagement should also occur at the outset , before the start of formal trade negotiations , which are expected to begin this summer . 
What is needed is a focused high-level meeting that brings together a small number of essential political leaders . 
Besides the obvious negotiators - EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht , Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso , and the new US Trade Representative - this group should include European Council President Herman Van Rompuy , key European heads of state , and senior Obama administration officials . 
Key US congressional leaders should also be involved . 
A working summit would demonstrate a willingness at the highest echelons to resolve in principle the major obstacles standing in the way of an agreement . 
If successful , such a meeting would lay a foundation of genuine political support for efficient and effective technical negotiations . 
An agreement that rejuvenates the transatlantic relationship will require nothing less .
