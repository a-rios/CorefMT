The Bogey of Inflation 
LONDON - How real is the danger of inflation for the world economy ? 
Opinion on this matter is divided between conservative economists and official bodies like the IMF and OECD . 
The IMF and OECD project very low inflation rates over the next few years . 
But former US Federal Reserv e Chairman Alan Greenspan warns of inflationary dangers . 
Some bond markets , too , seem to expect sharply higher inflation . 
Which view is right has big implications for policy . 
If inflation has succeeded recession as today &apos;s main problem , governments should withdraw their stimulus policies ( money out of the economy ) as soon as possible . 
If recession remains the problem , the stimulus policies should stay in place , or even be strengthened . 
Everyone expects some inflation . 
During the low-inflation era , which dates from the early 1990 &quot; s , developed-country annual inflation rates averaged 2.4 % . 
Central bank inflation targets are now normally set at 2 % . 
Monetarists hail the low-inflation era as their great achievement . 
They take pride in the expert &quot; management of expectations &quot; by central banks . 
But monetary policy had little to do with it . 
Low inflation resulted from a combination of cheap supply and low demand . 
There was huge downward pressure on manufacturing prices from low-wage Asian economies , while unemployment in the developed world averaged 5-6 % - about twice as high as in the earlier post-war decades . 
Inflation was on the rise before the recession of 2008 struck , mainly because of spiking commodity prices . 
This is the background against which to judge the reality of today &apos;s inflation threat . 
The first thing to notice is that , as a result of the slump , capacity utilization is lower than it was 15 months ago : global output has declined by roughly 5 % since 2008 , and developed-country output by 4.1 % . 
One would expect inflation to fall with the decline in output , and this is exactly what happened . 
OECD inflation fell from an annual average of 3.7 % in 2008 to around 0.5 % in 2009 . 
It has now started to rise again , but from a low level , mainly as a result of a turnabout in commodity prices . 
Moreover , the IMF and OECD estimate that global inflation will remain below the pre-2008 average for years . 
In other words , the low-inflation era will become the lower-inflation era . 
But what about the vast quantitative easing ( printing of money ) that has been occurring ? 
Since the start of the crisis , the Bank of England has pumped $ 325 billion into the British economy , the Fed has expanded the US monetary base by close to $ 1 trillion , and the People &apos;s Bank of China originated a record amount of $ 1.4 trillion in loans . 
These measures alone correspond to 4 % of global GDP . 
Surely that means that inflation is just round the corner unless the money is withdrawn fast , right ? 
For those who have had a couple of lessons in the Quantity Theory of Money , this seems a plausible conclusion . 
The quantity theory states that the general price level will rise proportionately to the increase in the money supply . 
So if the money supply increased by 5 % globally in the last year , world prices will rise by 5 % after a short lag . 
But , as John Maynard Keynes never stopped pointing out , the Quantity Theory of Money is true only at full employment . 
If there is unused capacity in the economy , part of any increase in the quantity of money will be spent on increasing output rather than just buying existing output . 
This is only half the story , however . 
By &quot; quantity of money , &quot; experts normally mean M3 , a broad measure that includes bank deposits . 
Flooding banks with central-bank money is no guarantee that deposits , which arise from spending or borrowing money , will increase in the same proportion . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , the Japanese central bank injected huge amounts of money into banks in an attempt to boost the money supply . 
At one time , central-bank money was up by 35 % in one year , yet M3 was rose by only 7 % . 
Data from Europe and the US show that M3 has been falling for most of 2009 , despite exceptionally low interest rates and quantitative easing . 
What matters is not printing money , but spending it . 
It is when money is spent that it becomes more than an inert bundle of useless paper . 
A central bank can print money , but it cannot ensure that the money it prints is spent . 
It may pile up in bank reserves or savings accounts , or it may produce asset bubbles . 
But in such cases , little or no increase in the money supply occurs . 
The new money simply replaces the old money , which has been liquidated by economic collapse . 
That is why official data points to extremely low inflation rates over the next few years , despite the monetary and fiscal stimulus . 
But this should be a warning signal : to say that with unemployment now much higher , inflation is expected to remain low is really to say that there will be little recovery over the next five years . 
After all , when economies recover from recession , they usually grow above trend . 
This means that prices will rise above trend . 
The fact that there is no evidence of higher prices in the pipeline means that there is no real evidence of economic recovery . 
Our economies are still on life support . 
To withdraw the stimulus at this point would kill the patient . 
To talk about the dangers of inflation is scaremongering . 
Instead , we should be thinking of ways to restore the patient &apos;s health . 
To be sure , different economies are at different phases of convalescence , and faster growth in some regions - for example , China and India - will help feebler ones like Europe and America . 
But , unless firmer evidence of recovery comes in the next quarter , European and American officials should prepare to accelerate and expand their spending programs . 
Otherwise , their economies risk remaining stuck in recession .
