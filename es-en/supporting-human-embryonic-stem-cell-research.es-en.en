Supporting Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research 
Most of the cells in our bodies have a short life span and a specific job to do . 
Stem cells , found in many organs from skin to bone marrow , are different . 
The &quot; ancestors &quot; of ordinary cells , they can replenish themselves indefinitely . 
Given the right biochemical signals , these cells can divide and transform themselves into a range of different cell types as and when the need arises . 
Such versatility means that stem cells have the potential to regenerate damaged organ tissues and provide amazing new treatments for a range of now devastating diseases . 
Indeed , stem cells may perhaps make it possible for humans to &quot; grow new organs &quot; to replace diseased ones , thereby providing for the possibility of new forms of cell-based therapies . 
On the basis of research with comparable cells from mice , scientists envision that stem cells could be used to replace bone marrow in patients suffering from cancer , produce pancreatic cells for alleviating diabetes , or neuronal cells for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease , Alzheimer &apos;s disease , and various brain and spinal cord disorders . 
Stem cells used in this research are best derived from very early stage embryos created by in vitro fertilization , but this leads to ethical dilemmas . 
The idea that human embryos could be created with the express purpose of &quot; harvesting &quot; them for medical purposes incites fear of a &quot; brave new world &quot; revisited . 
Even if that extreme is unlikely , the possibility of abuse of any sort generates strong opposition . 
Most of those who oppose stem cell research do not question its scientific and medical value , but object to the use of human embryos . 
These critics , especially in Germany , where stem cell research evokes nightmares of Nazi era eugenics , argue that research with stem cells derived from embryos is unnecessary because multi-potential stem cells occur naturally in adult tissues as well . 
While guardedly encouraged by recent reports of the remarkable plasticity of stem cells obtained from adult tissues , scientists know little about their potential for prolonged maintenance outside the body , their capacity for differentiation , and whether they can be obtained in the quantities needed to explore their utility for clinical use . 
If embryonic stem cell research were to be halted based on that hope , it is possible that years may pass before scientists could determine if adult-derived stem cells are equivalent to embryonic stem cells in their potential to treat disease . 
We cannot afford the luxury of proceeding with these promising technologies sequentially . 
We owe it to those who are in need to explore all possible avenues that could lead to medical cures . 
While research on adult-derived stem cells should be pursued aggressively , it should not be at the expense of an aggressive program to explore the full potential of stem cells for use in human therapies . 
Another restriction has been recently adopted in the United States , where the issue was explored by the National Biomedical Ethics Advisory Commission in extensive hearings and discussions with ethicists , religious leaders , scientists and physicians . 
They concluded that it is ethically permissible to prepare stem cell lines from frozen embryos , but only from those obtained in the course of in vitro fertilization procedures and deemed by donors and their physician to be in excess of clinical requirements . 
Following these discussions , the US National Institute of Health ( NIH ) promulgated guidelines that allow the use of government funds for stem-cell research but , in their present form , prohibit federally-funded investigators from creating new stem cell lines . 
That restriction requires that stem cell lines must be obtained only from privately-funded or commercial sources that follow the protocols mandated by the guidelines . 
I believe that restricting the use of government funds for the creation of stem cells , although politically prudent , imposes substantial scientific handicaps . 
We know that a variety of poorly understood factors cause embryonic stem cells to lose their capacity to differentiate into all possible cell types . 
This loss of capacity to differentiate may be caused by the particular mode in which the stem cells are derived , the conditions surrounding their growth , and other variables of handling . 
Enabling individual government-funded investigators to derive stem cell lines using a variety of conditions in their own laboratories , as permitted recently in Britain and France , is the best route to determining what conditions are critical for generating cells for specific therapeutic purposes . 
Embryonic stem cells prepared in a scientist &apos;s own laboratory are most likely to have been derived , stored and maintained in ways that maximize their potency for particular uses . 
Cells obtained from commercial sources are likely to be of unknown genetic background and history and therefore be less useful for some important studies . 
While various remote contingencies are sometimes invoked , the fundamental ethical choice posed by stem cell research is more circumscribed : whether human embryos , which will ultimately be legally discarded , should be used to create potentially life-saving therapies for those in need . 
Those who oppose abortion irrespective of its purpose argue that sacrificing a human embryo to obtain stem cells is akin to abortion and therefore immoral . 
But harvesting stem cells from very early stage embryos that will in the end be discarded is , in my view , ethically distinct from abortion . 
For we must also consider the moral consequences of failing to pursue this line of research if it has the potential to save and improve human lives . 
What greater morality exists than doing all we can do to help individuals whose lives are blighted by disease and disability ?
