Europe \ u0027s Anchor of Stability 
FRANKFURT - At less than ten years old , the euro is by all measures a young currency . 
Yet it has become a reality of daily life for almost 320 million people in 15 European countries . 
In the wake of the euro &apos;s performance during this year &apos;s global financial crisis , even its strongest critics cannot deny that the euro is an astounding success . 
This past summer , millions of travelers avoided paying cumbersome and expensive charges to change their currency . 
But the advantage for trade and investment implied by the absence of foreign-exchange risks within the euro area is of greater economic importance . 
The common currency completes the single market for the euro area &apos;s member states . 
Since 1999 , members of the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) have experienced a number of severe exogenous shocks : the rise in the price of a barrel of oil from around $ 10 to $ 150 ; the collapse of equity markets after the dot-com bubble imploded ; the spreading risk of terrorism after the September 11 , 2001 , and two wars . 
Starting last summer , the breakdown of the market for US sub-prime mortgages triggered turbulence in financial markets , with no end in sight . 
From past experience with national currencies , Europeans could have expected that any of these shocks would trigger a severe crisis in foreign-exchange markets . 
It is not difficult to imagine what would have happened during the recent financial-market crisis if the euro-area countries still had all their national currencies : immense speculation against some currencies , heavy interventions by central banks , and finally a collapse of the parity system . 
The years 1992-1993 witnessed a dramatic crisis in the European Exchange Rate System . 
Since that period the amount of capital ready to exploit any opportunity in foreign exchange markets has multiplied , which would make any comparable situation today much more dangerous . 
Indeed , the crisis of the early 1990 &quot; s put the status quo within the EU common market at risk . 
It is hard to believe that , with today &apos;s vast capital flows , the single market would have survived a series of sharp and abrupt exchange-rate changes . 
Changes in exchange rates of the type seen in 1991-1992 have a strong impact on relative prices for goods traded between different countries . 
In countries that experienced strong currency appreciation , companies ( and unions , for that matter ) are exposed to a sudden and severe loss in competitiveness . 
Such firms undoubtedly start to clamor for protection against supposedly &quot; unfair &quot; conditions . 
True , the euro did not prevent risky investment decisions by European financial institutions or the consequences for financial markets of these decisions . 
But it was never intended to do that . 
Instead , the euro achieved what it was meant to achieve : the crisis was contained , because it could not inflict damage on foreign-exchange markets within the euro area . 
After the outbreak of turbulence in financial markets last year , the European Central Bank immediately provided ample liquidity to calm the situation , and has continued to do so ever since . 
At the same time , the ECB never lost sight of its main goal - maintaining price stability . 
Indeed , the ECB has successfully anchored inflation expectations right from the start at a level consistent with its definition of price stability . 
This achievement contrasts starkly with all the critical voices that warned against the experiment of European Monetary Union and even predicted its early failure . 
It was in the first weeks after the establishment of the ECB in June 1998 that I received a letter by the late Nobel Prize laureate Milton Friedman , who congratulated me on my appointment as member of the Executive Board - which he called &quot; an impossible job . &quot; 
He was convinced that monetary union in Europe was doomed to fail . 
Today , however , it is hard to find anybody who does not consider the euro a great success , and the ECB has been so sure-footed that people now take that success for granted . 
But this was not a matter of good luck . 
The fundamentals of the euro &apos;s success are hard work , dedicated commitment to the common currency &apos;s unique historical mission , and , not least , a well chosen monetary policy strategy . 
But this success is no reason for complacency . 
Major challenges lie ahead . 
In the context of weakening growth , the Stability and Growth Pact will face a severe new test . 
And , just as important , reforms aimed at ensuring greater flexibility of markets still lag behind what is needed to exploit fully the advantages of the single monetary policy .
