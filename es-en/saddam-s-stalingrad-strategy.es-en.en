Saddam \ u0027s Stalingrad Strategy 
Expert in internal repression but utterly incompetent in military strategy , Saddam Hussein thinks that he can fight and win . 
His strategy seems to be to defend Baghdad as another Stalingrad , street by street , house by house . 
A war strategy that deliberately begins the way that most wars end , with a street-fighting defense of the capital city , is certainly original . 
It is also realistic in not even trying to defend Iraq &apos;s borders against American air power . 
But it is fantasy to think that the people of Baghdad will defend Saddam &apos;s regime . 
A sullen passivity is the most that Saddam can expect from Iraqis . 
Street-fighting will need to be done by those targeted by air bombardment : Saddam &apos;s elite troops . 
Whether they will fight after heavy bombing depends on the success of the air campaign . 
It is unlikely that Saddam &apos;s elite forces will be caught in well-identified barracks . 
They might be caught in encampments , however , even if frequently moved . 
Of course , the troops may be made invulnerable to bombing by being billeted among the civilian population , but armored vehicles and artillery cannot be hidden in apartment houses . 
Saddam &apos;s security system for Baghdad includes the Special Republican Guard , whose 16,000 men are Iraq &apos;s most disciplined , best equipped troops . 
It is not clear how many street-fighters Saddam can obtain from his five competing security forces ( the 5,000-man Al Amn al-Khas Special Security Service , the 4,000-man , al-Mukhabarat al-Amma General Intelligence Directorate , the 5,000-man Al-Istikhbarat al-Askariyya Military Intelligence , the 5,000 man Al Amn al-Askariyya Military Security Service , and the 8,000-man Mudiriyat al-Amn al-Amma General Security Service ) whose 25,000-30,000 men are distributed throughout Iraq . 
If it is numbers Saddam wants , he can get them from the &quot; Fedayeen Saddam , &quot; which contains 15,000 men recruited from trusted tribes . 
For really big numbers , there is the Jaysh al-Sha &apos;abi Popular Army , a party militia with 150,000 men and women in Baghdad alone . 
But street-fighting requires even more training , cohesion and leadership than open-field combat . 
Even in &quot; heroic &quot; Stalingrad , the workers &apos; militia collapsed at the battle &apos;s beginning . 
Saddam &apos;s numerous secret police contain many clerks , executioners , and torturers , but not many trained soldiers . 
As for the Fedayeen Saddam , they are village ruffians unfamiliar with Baghdad &apos;s urban landscape . 
The men of the Special Republican Guard are supposed to be loyal because they are recruited largely from Saddam &apos;s own al-Bu Nasir tribe around Tikrit . 
But they are also a true praetorian guard , like their Roman predecessors . 
They have better uniforms and higher pay than ordinary soldiers - and officers too close to the intrigues of Iraq &apos;s palace politics to remain blindly devoted to Saddam . 
Quite a few have been executed over the years for plotting against Saddam . 
Not all of them were innocent . 
Recently , Saddam moved the &quot; non-special &quot; Republican Guard into Baghdad . 
Its ten divisions , with at least 100,000 men , are better trained and armed than the regular army , which is now weaker than in the first Gulf War of 1991 , when it scarcely resisted before surrendering . 
By contrast , the Guard &apos;s 1st Hammurabi , 2nd Al Medina , 3rd Tawakalna , and 6th Nebuchadnezzar divisions all fought back against US forces in 1991 . 
Despite their elite status , the Guard lacked the skill to hold their ground or inflict casualties . 
Of course , US forces had better equipment , but well-trained forces can sometimes offset technical disadvantages to score kills if not to win . 
Half of the Guard &apos;s divisions are lighter forces with more foot soldiers for street-fighting , but the rest are armored or mechanized and thus depend on tanks and combat carriers that can be easily targeted with precision weapons . 
Baghdad &apos;s long suffering population , with its majority of alienated Shi &apos;ites and a million disaffected Kurds , is unlikely to remain unmoved by the imminent arrival of US and British troops . 
An uprising that would give the allies the city without a fight , however , is too much to expect so long as they fear that Saddam might survive to punish them . 
But neighborhood manhunts for torturers and informers might create a hostile climate that discourages Saddam loyalists . 
Even so , ousting Saddam will not be easy . 
The main offensive from Kuwait must advance for 500 kilometers to reach Baghdad . 
It is for this reason that the lighter forces centered on the 101st Airborne division and the British 16th Air Assault brigade will fly directly into the Baghdad area , linking up with armored columns racing up from Kuwait . 
The offensive into and around Iraq &apos;s second city of Basra will be no easier . 
Its implicit mission is to discourage Iran from venturing across the Shatt river border , contested territory and scene of the most intense fighting of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war . 
For that , units will have to be thinly spread from the southern tip of Iraq at Faw up to Amara , some 150 miles from Kuwait . 
With US / UK ground forces outnumbered in most fights , and with many terrain obstacles to overcome , this dual offensives would be highly risky were it not for air power . 
Fighter bombers and attack helicopters would be employed to intercept any counter-attacks against the flanks of the advancing columns , and to break up blocking forces . 
It will take that and more to reach Baghdad quickly . 
Before that , the initial &quot; strategic &quot; bombing will be of unprecedented dimensions , but not because there will be more strike aircraft than in the Gulf War . 
On the contrary , there will be less than half as many , not more than 700 in total . 
But in 1991 , less than 150 aircraft were equipped to launch the precision weapons that did 90 % of the useful bombing . 
Now all US and British strike aircraft use precision weapons . 
The number of separate targets that can be attacked in the first 48 hours should be five times as great as in 1991 . 
More than 900 ship-launched cruise missiles - triple the number in 1991 - will double the impact of the initial air strikes . 
In addition to air defenses , command centers and communications , key targets will be the offices , barracks , depots , bunkers , and any known evacuation lodgings and tented camps of Saddam &apos;s Special and regular Republican Guards , and of his five different security organizations . 
Whatever else happens , the war will bring an all-out attack against the executioners and torturers of Iraq &apos;s peoples .
