Globalization Marches On 
LONDON - In a recent symposium in the Financial Times on globalization &apos;s prospects in 2011 , the columnist Gideon Rachman observed that , &quot; When Barack Obama visited India recently , the US President warned his hosts that the debate about globalization has reopened in the West , &quot; and that &quot; a backlash ... is forming ... and growing in advanced economies . &quot; 
But Rachman &apos;s alarmism is misplaced . 
The fear of globalization in the West is nothing new . 
Articulate intellectuals and groups such as labor unions and environmental organizations in the advanced economies have voiced anti-globalization fears and sentiments for at least a quarter-century . 
The fear of globalization , however , began historically in the East , not the West . 
After World War II , the West dismantled barriers to trade and investment flows , and worked to eliminate exchange controls and move to currency convertibility . 
What was sometimes called the liberal international economic order was the order of the day , and it was embraced by public opinion as well . 
By contrast , the East generally embraced the fearful view that , as the Chilean sociologist Oswaldo Sunkel put it , integration into the international economy would lead to disintegration of the national economy . 
Many intellectuals shared this dark anti-globalization vision , and policymakers in much of the East were not far behind . 
Indeed , the West accepted the view that globalization would result ( as with trade ) in mutual gain , embracing what I called in 1997 the notion of &quot; benign neglect . &quot; 
In the case of foreign investment and aid flows , the West went further , viewing them as being motivated by altruism , or &quot; benign intent , &quot; whereas the East regarded globalization in a world of poor and rich nations as implying &quot; malign impact . &quot; 
In some analyses , malign impact turned into a more sinister &quot; malign intent . &quot; 
Thus , foreign aid was regarded as a plot to trap poor nations in a neo-colonial embrace . 
What happened next was what I have called an &quot; ironic reversal . &quot; 
As the benefits of globalization became manifest , and the damage wrought by autarkic policies also became evident , policymakers in the East began to appreciate that their anti-globalization stance had been a mistake . 
But then fear of globalization moved to the West . 
The East had feared that it could not gain from trade with the West , which had superior infrastructure and human capital ; now , the West had come to fear that it would lose from trade with the East , which had abundant , cheap labor . 
The longstanding stagnation in wages for unskilled labor was attributed to low-cost , labor-intensive imports , ignoring the corollary that Western workers &quot; consumption of labor-intensive Asian goods offset the effect on real wages . 
To take another example , the East worried about a &quot; brain drain &quot; of professionals to the West , where opportunities seemed to be more plentiful . 
Today , the West is witnessing anti-globalization opposition from members of professional groups , who fear the loss of their jobs to foreign counterparts . 
Rudyard Kipling famously wrote in &quot; The Ballad of East and West &quot; : &quot; Oh , East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet . &quot; 
Given the ironic reversal of globalization fears , Kipling is still right : convergence has continued to elude East and West . 
The current crisis did not create the debate about globalization now heard in the West ; it only made it slightly more salient . 
Yet the crisis may be tilting Western policy outcomes in favor of globalization . 
For example , on trade , there has been a remarkable commitment to efforts - largely successful - to avoid significant backsliding into protectionism . 
Moreover , the G-20 leaders have continued to express the need to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade-liberalization negotiations . 
There are also initiatives such as the appointment by the governments of Britain , Germany , Indonesia , and Turkey of a High-Level Expert Trade Group , with Peter Sutherland , former Director General of GATT and the WTO , and myself as co-chairs . 
The four governments will report at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum in Davos on how to conclude Doha this year . 
In other words , Kipling could yet be proved wrong . 
A reversal in the West is possible , perhaps even likely . 
So the current crisis may thus , accidentally , establish a pro-globalization consensus that spans East and West .
