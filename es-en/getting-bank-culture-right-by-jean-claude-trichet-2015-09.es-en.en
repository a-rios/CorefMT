Getting Bank Culture Right 
WASHINGTON , DC - Banks and banking rely on trust . 
But while trust takes years to establish , it can be squandered abruptly if a particular bank &apos;s ethics are weak , its values poor , and its behavior simply wrong . 
The events that triggered the 2008 global financial crisis , together with the subsequent scandals that have emerged - from the rigging of the London Interbank Offered Rate ( Libor ) to sanctions-busting and money-laundering - amount to a catalog of cultural failures within our financial institutions . 
Yes , extensive measures have been taken since the crisis to strengthen the financial system . 
But a profound weakness remains : To be blunt , it concerns the risk-taking culture that still prevails within some departments of global banks and in the financial system itself . 
Too often , bank bosses &quot; promises to change the &quot; corporate culture &quot; and ensure their employees &quot; good conduct have not been matched by fully effective implementation . 
In too many cases , banks are still failing to fulfill their obligations in serving their communities and the public at large . 
It is true that the banking sector is paying a high price for its misdeeds : fines , litigation , and regulatory tightening have cost approximately $ 300 billion so far . 
But the tax-paying public - innocent of any wrongdoing - has also had to bear costs , both direct and indirect . 
And , while a handful of &quot; rogue traders &quot; ( and , most recently , one Libor manipulator ) have ended up in prison , it would be overly optimistic to conclude that the punishment has been sufficient to transform bank culture . 
If banks and other financial institutions are to perform their crucial role in providing support for growth and employment , it is imperative that they take steps to regain the public &apos;s trust . 
But how ? 
More regulation is not necessarily the best path forward : The rules and norms that define a &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong &quot; culture are beyond the wit of regulators and supervisory bodies . 
But the pressure to devise such rules is bound to mount if banks do not demonstrate that they are grappling effectively with the challenge of cultural change . 
Sadly , until now , many banks have adopted an unconvincing piecemeal approach . 
It is not enough to strengthen legal compliance . 
A new report published by the Group of Thirty argues that banks must do far more . 
Real change must go to the core of an institution &apos;s day-to-day operations . 
Banks must change compensation practices that reward excessive risk ; protect whistleblowers ; recruit and train staff to reflect proper ethics ; and ensure that their boards of directors play a more active oversight role . 
( I believe that if boards had been aware of the egregious behavior being perpetrated within some institutions , from product mis-selling to price-fixing , they would have acted to stop it . ) 
Let me be clear : Setting values and shaping an organizational culture take a long time and a great deal of work . 
Successful reform requires changing people &apos;s mindset and habituating them to self-regulation . 
A written code - emphasizing the commercial benefits of ethical business conduct , and the negative consequences of falling short - is part of that effort and may help preserve and strengthen a culture ; but a code alone is not enough . 
Constant reminders and repetition are essential . 
Employees must understand instinctively what may be done and what should never be done . 
They must internalize a culture that values strict adherence to high ethical standards of conduct . 
To that end , banks should make their values and culture integral to their hiring , firing , and promotion decisions . 
Indeed , the values and conduct of a bank &apos;s risk-takers should account for 50 % of their annual performance review . 
Failing to live up to a bank &apos;s desired cultural norms should have an impact on an employee &apos;s career - and , when necessary , end it . 
Banking regulators and supervisors also have a decisive role to play . 
They need to work with boards and senior management to ensure that major reforms are implemented and then consistently applied . 
Regular exchanges of views between oversight officials and the banks should be regarded as a crucial component of this process . 
Central bankers have been dismayed by many banks &quot; failure to move forward decisively to address the difficult internal issues of conduct and culture . 
And now the concerns have grown to the point that delay is no longer an option . 
Either the banks reform themselves , or public authorities will intervene still further .
