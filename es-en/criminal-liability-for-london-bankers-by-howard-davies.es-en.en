Libor Unplugged 
LONDON - Last year &apos;s Libor scandal was a shock to the body politic in London . 
Despite all that had gone before , the public and their representatives were stunned to learn that bankers had systematically undermined the foundations of a global market benchmark - one with London in its name to boot - for personal gain . 
Britain &apos;s Chancellor of the Exchequer , George Osborne , felt compelled to launch a parliamentary inquiry . 
On June 19 , after a year &apos;s work , the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards finally laid a large egg . 
Bankers will certainly regard the outcome as what in England we like to call a &quot; curate &apos;s egg &quot; ( served a rotten egg by his bishop , a young clergyman , when asked whether the egg was to his liking , replied that it was &quot; good in parts &quot; ) . 
They will choke on the commission &apos;s recommendation of a new criminal offense for reckless conduct that leads to taxpayer bailouts , reinforced by a new &quot; senior persons &quot; regime that would ascribe all bank functions to a specific individual , who would be held personally liable when things go wrong . 
The commission argues that &quot; top bankers dodged accountability for failings on their watch by claiming ignorance or hiding behind collective decision-making . &quot; 
Its members aim to make that impossible . 
If they have their way , behaving recklessly with banking assets will result in a prison sentence , with no Monopoly-style &quot; get out of jail free &quot; card for financial masters of the universe . 
I can already hear the sound of lawyers sharpening their pencils : the offense must be defined specifically enough to withstand a human-rights challenge . 
But , if implemented , the commission &apos;s proposed regime would certainly be tougher than what is now on offer in New York or other banking centers . 
And British MPs are noticeably impatient with what they consider the glacial pace of change in global regulation ; they want action now . 
If the United Kingdom does proceed in this unilateral way , what would the consequences be for London &apos;s banking industry ? 
Would New York , Frankfurt , or even Paris receive a competitive boost as international bankers , alarmed at the prospect of time behind bars if their derivative trades blow up again , flee the City ? 
The commission &apos;s members offer two , somewhat contradictory , answers to that question . 
The first is that , frankly , they don &apos;t care . 
&quot; The risk of an exodus should be disregarded , &quot; the commission says , noting that the advantages of being a global financial center have been accompanied by serious associated risks to the domestic economy . 
Unlike the United States , where the financial sector is smaller as a share of GDP , the UK economy has still not recovered the output lost in the post-2008 Great Recession , owing to continued retrenchment in the banking sector . 
The commission &apos;s members do recognize that London &apos;s loss of status as a global financial center would be costly in terms of jobs and output , so they developed a second line of argument . 
&quot; There is nothing inherently optimal , &quot; they say , about a level playing field in international finance . 
Attempts to develop a single European financial market have , in their view , forced countries to respond to the failings revealed by the 2008 crisis at the speed of the &quot; slowest ship in the convoy . &quot; 
By contrast , the commission argues , &quot; there may be big benefits to the UK as a financial center from demonstrating that it can establish and adhere to standards significantly above the international minimum . &quot; 
In addition to the tough new regime of personal accountability , the commission would supplement the Basel standards on bank capital with a tight leverage ratio . 
The British government , preoccupied with finding ways to stimulate growth as the next election approaches , will no doubt think hard before making any changes that might drive business offshore . 
But the government is caught between a rock and a hard place , hemmed in by a parliament that , strongly backed by a bank-hostile press and public opinion , is eager to enact reforms , and by EU directives to implement a tougher regime . 
So , is the Commission right that the government should move quickly on reform and disregard the consequences ? 
Such evidence as one can find from international surveys suggests that the regulatory changes implemented so far have not driven bankers away . 
London has already implemented an approach that is tougher than that of most other financial centers . 
Taxes levied on executive bonuses have cost international banks dearly . 
Bankers don &apos;t like it , but they have not yet left for more congenial locations . 
Nor do they indicate that they will . 
Indeed , the latest Z-Yen index of global financial centers showed London maintaining its first-place position - and with its margin over New York unchanged . 
The Asian centers are catching up , as one would expect , but they are hardly direct competitors for business that would otherwise be done in London . 
Frankfurt and Paris , the most plausible European competitors , languish in tenth and 26th place , respectively . 
Rating agencies and shareholders are nervous when they hear that a stricter regulatory environment is not necessarily a disadvantage . 
But a regime in which personal responsibility strongly affects individuals in one jurisdiction will give bankers pause for thought , especially in the case of global banks with complex matrix-management systems that enable product heads to be moved elsewhere . 
British legislators will need to be satisfied that any new regime captures the right people , in the right way . 
However politically appealing the idea of rogue bankers behind bars might be , putting them there is likely to remain very challenging in practice .
