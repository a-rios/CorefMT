The Real Singapore Model 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - The death of Lee Kuan Yew , Singapore &apos;s founding father , offers an occasion to reflect on his legacy - and , perhaps more importantly , on whether that legacy has been correctly understood . 
During his 31 years as prime minister , Lee crafted a unique system of government , intricately balancing authoritarianism with democracy and state capitalism with the free market . 
Known as &quot; the Singapore model , &quot; Lee &apos;s brand of governance is often mischaracterized as a one-party dictatorship superimposed on a free-market economy . 
His success in transforming Singapore into a prosperous city-state is frequently invoked by authoritarian rulers as justification for their tight control of society - and nowhere more so than in China . 
Indeed , Chinese President Xi Jinping is pursuing a transformative agenda heavily influenced by the Singapore model - a relentless war on corruption , a broad crackdown on dissent , and pro-market economic reforms . 
The Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) sees in Singapore a vision of its future : the perpetuation of its monopoly on political power in a prosperous capitalist society . 
But the Singapore model , as China &apos;s rulers understand it , never existed . 
To emulate Lee &apos;s model of government - rather than its cartoon caricature - would require allowing a far more democratic system than the CCP would ever tolerate . 
The true secret of Lee &apos;s political genius was not his skillful use of repressive practices , such as launching lawsuits against the media or his political opponents ; such tactics are common and unremarkable in semi-authoritarian regimes . 
What Lee did that was truly revolutionary was to use democratic institutions and the rule of law to curb the predatory appetite of his country &apos;s ruling elite . 
Unlike China , Singapore allows opposition parties to contest in competitive and free ( though not necessarily fair ) elections . 
In the last parliamentary election in 2011 , six opposition parties won a total of 40 % of the vote . 
Should the People &apos;s Action Party ( PAP ) , the party Lee founded , lose its legitimacy due to poor governance , Singapore &apos;s voters could throw it out of office . 
By holding regular competitive elections , Lee effectively established a mechanism of political self-enforcement and accountability - he gave Singaporean voters the power to decide whether the PAP should stay in power . 
This enforcement mechanism has maintained discipline within Singapore &apos;s ruling elite and makes its promises credible . 
Regrettably , most of the rest of the world has never given Lee proper credit for crafting a hybrid system of authoritarianism and democracy that vastly improved the wellbeing of his country &apos;s citizens , without subjecting them to the brutality and oppression to which many of Singapore &apos;s neighbors have resorted . 
China would be wise to embrace this model , by introducing a considerable degree of democracy and strengthening adherence to the rule of law . 
China &apos;s 1.4 billion citizens would benefit immensely if their rulers were to adopt Singapore-style political institutions and practices . 
This would mean , at a minimum , legalizing organized political opposition , introducing competitive elections at regular intervals , and creating an independent judiciary . 
Emulating Lee would allow China to achieve immense progress and become a more humane and open society with a brighter future . 
Sadly , there is almost no chance of this happening , at least any time soon . 
When China &apos;s leaders cite the Singapore model , what they have in mind is limited to the perpetuation of their power . 
They want the benefits of political dominance , without the checks imposed by a competitive institutional context . 
Lee may have been skeptical about the benefits of democracy , but he was not viscerally hostile to it ; he understood its usefulness . 
By contrast , China &apos;s leaders view democracy as an existential ideological threat that must be neutralized at any cost . 
For them , allowing even a modicum of democracy as a means to impose some discipline on the elite is considered suicidal . 
Unfortunately , Lee is no longer with us . 
One would like to imagine him explaining to China &apos;s leaders what has been truly innovative about the Singapore model . 
Obviously , that is not an option . 
But it would behoove the CCP - if for no other reason than simple respect for one of Asia &apos;s great statesmen - to stop appropriating the Singapore brand in the service of a completely different agenda .
