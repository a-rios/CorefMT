Our Energy Future 
Where energy is concerned , everything seemed simple before the Iraq War . 
The US would topple Saddam , Iraq &apos;s vast oil reserves would be unleashed after a short period of reconstruction , and world petroleum prices would drop to under $ 20 per barrel . 
Instead , world oil prices have soared to $ 35 per barrel . 
No surprise , then , that new attention is being focused on energy supplies . 
But the basic message is clear : current energy patterns are risky and must change . 
Two interconnected energy issues will shape our economic and geopolitical future for decades to come . 
The first is that dependence on Middle East oil is increasingly risky . 
Nobody knows how much oil is left and how much it will cost to extract , but the peak of global oil production will probably be reached sometime in the next quarter century , perhaps even in the next few years . 
Remaining oil supplies will be concentrated in the volatile Middle East . 
Meanwhile , global demand for energy will soar as the economies of China , India , Brazil , and other countries grow . 
If the Middle East is already at a breaking point , imagine what could happen if competition for Middle East oil intensifies among America , Europe , China , India , Japan , and others . 
The second great challenge is that our modern energy system is destabilizing the global climate . 
Petroleum and other fossil fuels ( coal and natural gas ) are causing long-term changes in the global climate , but few people appreciate the risks . 
There are three largely unrecognized problems : 
· climate change will shift every aspect , such as temperature , rainfall , and storm patterns , as well as bringing fundamental changes in the physical environment , such as rising sea levels and changes in ocean chemistry . 
The effects are unpredictable but likely to be huge , in terms of crop production , diseases , costs and availability of irrigation and drinking water , coastal erosion , and so forth ; 
· climate change may not be gradual . 
The long history of climate change shows the risks of dramatic and abrupt changes over the course of but a few decades ; 
· humans might react badly to such changes , because changes in monsoon patterns or sea levels and the ensuing economic distress could provoke massive political unrest , refugee movements , and violent conflict . 
These challenges - petroleum scarcity , growing instability in the Middle East , and climate change - require clear thinking . 
Some alarmists declare that we need to drastically reduce energy use on a global scale , undermining the global economy . 
Efficiencies in energy use are possible , but they cannot solve either the problem of long-run oil supplies or climate change . 
Others declare that we must kick the fossil fuel habit and make a mad dash for renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power . 
Yet these alternatives are expensive , and cannot realistically replace fossil fuels . 
Fortunately , if we plan for the long term on a global scale , we can find our way through these challenges . 
Our goals should be reliable supplies of energy that are environmentally safe at affordable prices . 
There are two key ideas here . 
First , we should recognize that even as oil becomes scarce , other fossil fuels such as coal , gas , and unconventional sources such as shale and tar sands , will remain plentiful for centuries . 
We should aim to develop technologies and infrastructure so that these other fossil fuels can be used efficiently and safely . 
Chemical processes already exist , for example , to convert coal into gasoline . 
Coal can also be converted into hydrogen if we choose to go down the road of a hydrogen-based economy , in which hydrogen-powered fuel cells replace the internal combustion engine in automobiles . 
The jury is still out on whether the hydrogen economy will be cost effective . 
Second , as these other fossil fuels take up the slack when oil production reaches a plateau or starts to decline , the effects of fossil fuels on the climate must be brought under control . 
The environmentally sound manner for using fossil fuels in the future will involve capturing the carbon dioxide at the power plant before it is emitted into the atmosphere , and then disposing of it by somehow burying it in the ground . 
This process , called &quot; carbon capture and disposal , &quot; is being pursued by some of the world &apos;s leading engineers . 
Our energy future will depend not on one solution , but on a variety of steps : exploration and development of new petroleum sources , especially outside the Middle East ; increased energy efficiency ; long-term development and adoption of affordable renewable sources ; and the environmentally safe use of alternative fossil fuels such as coal . 
Today &apos;s course of action - in which we neglect the coming squeeze in global oil supplies , rely too heavily on Middle East oil , and ignore the environmental consequences of fossil fuels - is reaching a dead end . 
Reality will catch up with us . 
How then to think ahead ? 
The world &apos;s largest energy users , starting with the US , Europe , China , Japan , and India , need to agree on collective actions to develop new technologies for carbon capture and storage , and for the affordable development and use of alternative energy supplies . 
We need to make certain that market prices for energy use reflect the true social costs of using energy , so that energy users and energy suppliers make better choices regarding energy efficiency , the development of alternative energy sources , and the adoption of environmentally safe technologies .
