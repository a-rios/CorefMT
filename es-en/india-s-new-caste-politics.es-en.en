India &apos;s New Caste Politics 
Caste , once again , is casting its shadow over India &apos;s politics . 
Caste-based &quot; reservations &quot; ( reserved places ) in education and government employment are supposed to benefit India &apos;s most deprived , but in reality they have hardened , rather than eroded , India &apos;s ancient system of discrimination . 
Every now and then , particularly before elections , caste groups demand to be placed on the list of &quot; other backwards classes &quot; ( OBC &apos;s ) , in order to benefit from these reservations . 
Indeed , nowadays political parties dangle the carrot of reservations to ever more castes , and even promise to extend the policy to admissions into elite educational institutions and the private sector . 
Many consider India &apos;s increasing mobilization along caste lines a welcome assertion of &quot; identity . &quot; 
Indeed , intellectuals and politicians of all varieties almost unanimously hail the politics of caste identity as a move towards true equality . 
Some go so far as to argue that the recent rise of the lower castes in northern Indian politics and the implementation of reservations by the central government amount to a silent revolution , and that the politics of caste is secular and a bulwark against religious sectarianism . 
Public policy , however , should be based on evidence and logic , not glib sociological babble . 
Whether caste is a good indicator of socioeconomic deprivation remains an unsettled issue . 
Indeed , the protagonists of caste politics and caste-based public policy simply cannot validate their assertions , offering only small-sample surveys that can be grossly misleading in the context of a huge country characterized by monumental diversity . 
Moreover , these studies typically pool castes into three large groups , which distorts the real picture . 
Since India gained its independence , the government has systematically refused to collect sufficient data on the socioeconomic aspects of caste . 
The huge mass of evidence available in the censuses and land revenue settlement reports of the period from 1901 to 1931 lies ignored . 
If caste is a good indicator of deprivation now , it should have been even clearer in the past . 
But statistical analysis of this evidence - the only accessible macro-level quantitative data for the whole country - does not confirm caste as a clear indicator of deprivation . 
For example , less than one-third of workers in this period followed their traditional caste occupations . 
Workers belonging to each caste pursued a wide variety of occupations , although agriculture provided the bulk of employment . 
Each caste contained a varying mixture of landless laborers , cultivators , and landlords . 
While some castes concentrated on one , others were equally involved in a number of occupations . 
Access to literacy and to jobs in the government sector and modern professions was limited to a small section of the population usually belonging to the high castes . 
Access to land was uneven . 
Farmers , the single largest occupational group in most castes , with ritual rank ranging from high to low , were highly differentiated in terms of size and economic status . 
The size of holdings was similar for most upper castes and some lower castes . 
Thus , the economic status of households varied a great deal within each caste . 
In any case , the majority of peasants belonging to any caste , upper or lower , were poor . 
In many castes of low ritual rank , landlords , prosperous cultivators and traders were found , some of whom actually paid income tax . 
Consider the average economic position of the members of each caste in this sample . 
Generally , most high-ranking castes occupied high economic positions , and the majority of the &quot; untouchable &quot; castes were confined to the lowest economic positions . 
In some regions , e.g. , Mysore ( Karnataka ) , Madras ( Tamil Nadu ) and Uttar Pradesh , some lower castes occupy higher economic positions than high castes . 
The most obvious fact in the data is the great disparity in the economic positions of castes sharing the same ritual rank . 
Such differences are particularly acute for middle-ranking castes , which are now called OBC &apos;s , and are observed in all parts of India . 
Even among the untouchables , some castes have higher economic status than others . 
Among the middle-ranking , agricultural castes , some had high economic status due to improved agriculture , brought about by canal irrigation and commercialization . 
Most other cultivating and artisan castes , enjoying similar ritual ranks as the financially more successful group , occupied much lower economic positions , which resulted in an amazing degree of heterogeneity among backward castes . 
In some regions - Uttar Pradesh , Bombay ( Maharashtra and Gujarat ) , and the Telugu speaking areas of Madras ( Andhra Pradesh ) - the lowest economic positions were occupied by some &quot; backward &quot; castes , not by untouchables . 
Hence , caste has not been an indicator of material deprivation , even during the early decades of the twentieth century . 
But boosters of caste politics claim that it is not economic deprivation but the social backwardness from which these castes have historically suffered that makes caste reservations necessary . 
In fact , the whole population of the lower castes did not suffer from an equal degree of ritual handicap . 
There was an elaborate gradation and hierarchy among the middle-ranking and even untouchable castes , which governed interaction between them and kept inter-caste socialization to a minimum . 
Historically , the rich in each low caste emulated the customs and rituals of the upper castes , such as child marriage , the payment of dowries , and prevention of widows remarrying . 
Sometimes , well-off sections of low castes broke away to form new castes and managed to achieve higher ritual status . 
Usually a prosperous caste succeeded in raising its rank in the ritual hierarchy . 
By using caste as a criterion in public policy , India &apos;s government is effectively treating the rich and the poor equally , thereby conveying benefits to the former . 
This helps co-opt the elite among the lower castes to the ruling coalition , and keeps the poor divided along caste lines . 
But it is hypocritical to argue that this does anything to eliminate poverty .
