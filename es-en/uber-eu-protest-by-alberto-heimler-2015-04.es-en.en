Last Taxi to Europe 
ROME - The contrast between Europe &apos;s resistance to Uber and America &apos;s warmer reception for the ride-sharing service highlights once again how European regulatory structures , in principle designed to protect consumers , end up protecting entrenched suppliers and stifling innovation . 
This contrast can also point us to the ways Europe &apos;s governments should amend their rules , encouraging entrepreneurs to develop cutting-edge business models at home rather than being forced to accept innovations only after they have become best practices abroad . 
Anti-Uber protests by cab drivers are part of a long tradition of established suppliers challenging new technologies that could cost them their jobs . 
But when , say , the Luddites of the early nineteenth century protested against newly developed textile machinery by smashing it , the authorities did not intervene to limit new technologies . 
As a result , the Industrial Revolution ultimately led to an unprecedented increase in living standards around the world . 
But , by the time supermarkets started to enter the retail sector in the second half of the twentieth century , European governments &quot; approach had changed . 
Many countries enacted regulations in the early 1970s to protect existing small shops against competition ; as a result , the development of more modern distribution systems was delayed . 
A generation later , these restrictions were lifted in response to consumer pressure . 
But , as the response to Uber shows , Europe &apos;s governments have not learned their lesson - and the European economy suffers as a result . 
The problem is that entry into any market depends on the perceived opportunities for profit from new initiatives at a particular point in time . 
Regulations can delay market entry , but technology cannot be stopped forever ; new entrants eventually will break through . 
However , their business models may no longer be profitable , or may be less profitable than they would have been . 
Indeed first-mover advantages are common in many industries , owing to economies of scale , or because they lock in a customer base , or simply as a result of sunk costs . 
Especially for &quot; platform &quot; markets , where companies exploit earlier investment to ensure entry elsewhere , this means that delays caused by unjustified regulatory restrictions can have a more profound negative effect , preventing potentially successful companies from entering the market . 
For example , Italy , which liberalized its retail sector only in 1998 , has far fewer grocery chains today than France , Germany , and the United Kingdom . 
Indeed , these countries chains , forged in the fires of competition at home , now dominate emerging markets in Europe and elsewhere . 
In Italy , the limitations on large stores created market power at home for those few that nonetheless managed to emerge and grow , but left them too weak to expand abroad . 
In the same way , Europe &apos;s restrictions in the car-service market are preventing the continent &apos;s entrepreneurs from developing services like Uber . 
Like a supermarket chain , Uber depends on economies of scale to allow its platform to work efficiently . 
And , like any platform , Uber started small , covering its fixed costs through step-by-step expansion . 
Now that it has achieved the minimum efficient scale , new entrants cannot easily use competitive pressure to squeeze Uber &apos;s margins . 
When Uber started in San Francisco in 2009 , its market entry was neither challenged nor subjected to a difficult authorization process . 
Thus , Uber could test its new business model - based at the time on providing luxury cars - and grow , first in San Francisco and then in other US cities , eventually expanding to other countries ( as well as using its platform to push into other services ) . 
In Italy , by contrast , even the provision of luxury car services via a smartphone application would have been prohibited . 
Under Italian law , for-hire car services are strictly defined as those that start from the garage where the car is parked , and they must be booked in advance . 
Because Uber &apos;s app mimics taxi services , it would have been outlawed ; 
Uber would never have been able even to start developing its platform . 
And this is true in many other European countries and industries , where the structure of regulations protects suppliers more than consumers , hampering innovation . 
In the US , innovative market entrants are seldom blocked , and only if overwhelmingly justified by the public interest . 
That is why Uber ( like many other platforms in many other sectors ) could grow there and achieve the optimal scale to expand further . 
If Europe is to prosper , it must ease market entry for innovators , so that platforms will begin to develop indigenously , rather than moving in after they have been perfected elsewhere . 
We should value the innovation brought by new market entrants more than we value the protection of existing market participants . 
This can be achieved by adopting an outcome-based regulation aimed at the protection of consumers , not producers . 
Though in some cases this may mean simply changing the way existing rules are interpreted and applied , very often the regulations themselves will have to be changed . 
New entrants could still change the competitive structure of mature platform markets - not just taxis , but tourism , consumer credit , and many other services . 
And if an outcome-based regulation is adopted , innovative entrants may well influence the competitive structure of other platform markets that remain underdeveloped , such as health care , real estate , and professional services . 
In all markets , when innovators can enter easily and are not blocked by unjustified regulations , everyone stands to benefit - eventually even those whose occupations are disrupted or displaced . 
Just ask any professional , university-educated descendant of a nineteenth-century textile artisan .
