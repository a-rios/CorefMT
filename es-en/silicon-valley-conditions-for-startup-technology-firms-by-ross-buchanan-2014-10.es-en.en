Make Your Own Silicon Valley 
SEATTLE - California may be the world &apos;s largest and best-known technology hub , but it is not alone in fostering innovative startups . 
In fact , such firms are emerging - almost unnoticed - everywhere , from Asian megalopolises like Singapore and Shanghai to small European cities like Espoo in Finland and Dwingeloo in the Netherlands . 
Many international startups - including Sweden &apos;s Spotify , Estonia &apos;s Skype , Israel &apos;s Waze - and , most recently , China &apos;s Alibaba - have gained billion-dollar valuations . 
Clearly , the key features of Silicon Valley that foster innovation and entrepreneurship - a dense concentration of human talent , a competitive spirit , easy access to capital , and a supportive regulatory environment - can be replicated in and adapted to a wide variety of contexts . 
Indeed , these pillars of creativity and progress have been erected even in countries whose economies , politics , and cultures diverge sharply from those of the United States . 
Of course , not every country approaches innovation in the same way . 
Finland , for example , owes its dynamic computer-games cluster largely to a student-driven movement in higher education . 
Though Rovio Entertainment &apos;s release in 2009 of the popular video game Angry Birds catalyzed an innovation boom in Espoo , it is Aalto University - Finland &apos;s equivalent of Stanford in California - that continues to fuel innovation in the area , by nurturing programmers , designers , and others with the necessary talents . 
Aalto students also have launched Europe &apos;s most dynamic startup conference , which will bring together more than 10,000 entrepreneurs and financiers this November . 
Moreover , the university &apos;s Startup Sauna seed-accelerator program helps promising early-stage startups take their first steps toward success . 
Located on campus , the program &apos;s facilities resemble colorful Google offices , but with a Finnish twist : video conference rooms have been built into sauna-like structures . 
Since its establishment in 2010 , 126 companies have graduated from Startup Sauna , having raised more than $ 37 million in funding . 
Today , Finland boasts more than 200 gaming startups , which export 90 % of their products . 
According to Aalto , Finland &apos;s gaming sector experienced 260 % revenue growth in 2012-2013 , adding 1,000 jobs and $ 1.5 billion in total value to the Finnish economy just last year . 
In the Netherlands , the government has taken the lead in promoting innovative activities . 
Two and a half years ago , the Dutch government teamed up with IBM and a group of small and medium-size local businesses to jumpstart a big-data hub in the far-northern village of Dwingeloo , home to the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy . 
Like Silicon Valley-based initiatives , the project unites academia , talent-rich local companies , and multinationals behind a common goal - in this case , to build the world &apos;s largest radio telescope . 
The device will process and analyze radioactive waves collected from two million individual antennae , enabling researchers to map the shape of the universe by ( they hope ) 2020 . 
IBM provides the processing power for the data , while local Dutch companies are building all of the components . 
Beyond its own specific objectives , the initiative can help to catalyze a broader transformation of the Dutch tech culture . 
Jan de Jeu , Vice President of the University of Groningen , anticipates experts in Dwingeloo and the northern Netherlands training more scientists and IT specialists in the fundamental challenges related to the storage , transfer , and analysis of enormous data sets , thereby creating what de Jeu calls &quot; The Data Industry Valley . &quot; 
In Southeast Asia , Hong Kong benefits , first and foremost , from a business culture that is unencumbered by either red tape or corruption . 
It takes about two days to set up a new business ; taxes are low ; and ample co-working spaces are available . 
Furthermore , the government-funded Cyberport Incubation Program supports the development of Hong Kong &apos;s information and communications technology industry by providing companies with start-up capital , access to advanced facilities , and training in entrepreneurship , technology , and business development . 
As a result , the number of entrepreneurs has grown by 300 % in the last three years . 
For its part , Singapore is increasingly seeing the effects of a decade of regulatory reforms , including government grants and tax incentives to encourage foreign investment in the technology sector . 
In 2002-2009 , more than 11,000 startups were established . 
Singapore &apos;s social-media startup Bubble Motion ( recently rebranded as Bubbly ) generated more than 20 million users in its first two years - nearly double the number that Facebook or Twitter accrued in the same period in their history . 
It counts influential Silicon Valley firms such as Sequoia Capital , Northgate Capital , and Comcast Ventures as investors . 
On mainland China , Alibaba recently made history by raising $ 25 billion in the world &apos;s largest initial public offering to date . 
Company founder Jack Ma said that his ambition is to create a thriving &quot; ecosystem &quot; around the corporate headquarters in Hangzhou . 
Alibaba employees , ex-employees , and stockholders already injected more than $ 6 billion in the local economy in 2013 , with Zhejiang University and the Fudi Startup Incubator Centers ( founded by a former Alibaba employee ) encouraging frenetic startup activity . 
California &apos;s enclave of tech companies remains the crown jewel of entrepreneurial ecosystems . 
But international innovators are increasingly recognizing that , as valuations in Silicon Valley soar , the real bargains for tech-savvy investors may be found outside of the US .
