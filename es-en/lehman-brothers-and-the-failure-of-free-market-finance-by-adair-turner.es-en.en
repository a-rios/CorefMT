The Failure of Free-Market Finance 
LONDON - Five years after the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers , the world has still not addressed the fundamental cause of the subsequent financial crisis - an excess of debt . 
And that is why economic recovery has progressed much more slowly than anyone expected ( in some countries , it has not come at all ) . 
Most economists , central bankers , and regulators not only failed to foresee the crisis , but also believed that financial stability was assured so long as inflation was low and stable . 
And , once the immediate crisis had been contained , we failed to foresee how painful its consequences would be . 
Official forecasts in the spring of 2009 anticipated neither a slow recovery nor that the initial crisis , which was essentially confined to the United States and the United Kingdom , would soon fuel a knock-on crisis in the eurozone . 
And market forces did not come close to predicting near-zero interest rates for five years ( and counting ) . 
One reason for this lack of foresight was uncritical admiration of financial innovation ; another was the inherently flawed structure of the eurozone . 
But the fundamental reason was the failure to understand that high debt burdens , relentlessly rising for several decades - in the private sector even more than in the public sector - were a major threat to economic stability . 
In 1960 , UK household debt amounted to less than 15 % of GDP ; by 2008 , the ratio was over 90 % . 
In the US , total private credit grew from around 70 % of GDP in 1945 to well over 200 % in 2008 . 
As long as the debt was in the private sector , most policymakers assumed that its impact was either neutral or benign . 
Indeed , as former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has noted , &quot; money , credit , and banks play no meaningful role &quot; in much of modern macroeconomics . 
That assumption was dangerous , because debt contracts have important implications for economic stability . 
They are often created in excess , because in the upswing of economic cycles , risky loans look risk-free . 
And , once created , they introduce the rigidities of default and bankruptcy processes , with their potential for fire sales and business disruptions . 
Moreover , debt can drive cycles of over-investment , as described by Friedrich von Hayek . 
The Irish and Spanish property booms are prime examples of this . 
And debt can drive booms and busts in the price of existing assets : the UK housing market over the past few decades is a case in point . 
When times are good , rising leverage can make underlying problems seem to disappear . 
Indeed , subprime mortgage lending delivered illusory wealth increases to Americans at a time when they were suffering from stagnant or falling real wages . 
But in the post-crisis downswing , accumulated debts have a powerful depressive effect , because over-leveraged businesses and consumers cut investment and consumption in an attempt to pay down their debts . 
Japan &apos;s lost decades after 1990 were the direct and inevitable consequence of the excessive leverage built up in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Faced with depressed private investment and consumption , rising fiscal deficits can play a useful role , offsetting the deflationary effects . 
But that simply shifts leverage to the public sector , with any reduction in the ratio of private debt to GDP more than matched by an increase in the public-debt ratio : witness the Irish and Spanish governments &quot; high and rising debt burdens . 
Private leverage levels , as much as the public-debt burden , must therefore be treated as crucial economic variables . 
Ignoring them before the crisis was a profound failure of economic science and policy , one for which many countries &quot; citizens have suffered dearly . 
Two questions follow . 
The first is how to navigate out of the current overhang of both private and public debt . 
There are no easy options . 
Paying down private and public debt simultaneously depresses growth . 
Rapid fiscal consolidation thus can be self-defeating . 
But offsetting fiscal austerity with ultra-easy monetary policies risks fueling a resurgence of private leverage in advanced economies and already has produced the dangerous spillover of rising leverage in emerging economies . 
Both realism and imaginative policy are required . 
It is obvious that Greece cannot pay back all of its debt . 
But it should also be obvious that Japan will never be able to generate a primary fiscal surplus large enough to repay its government debt in the normal sense of the word &quot; repay . &quot; 
Some combination of debt restructuring and permanent debt monetization ( quantitative easing that is never reversed ) will in some countries be unavoidable and appropriate . 
The second question is how to constrain leveraged growth in the future . 
Achieving this goal requires reforms with a different focus from those pursued so far . 
Fixing the &quot; too big to fail &quot; problem is certainly important , but the direct taxpayer costs of bank rescues were small change compared to the damage wreaked by the financial crisis . 
And a banking system that never received a taxpayer subsidy could still support excessive private-sector leverage . 
What is required is a wide-ranging policy response that combines more powerful countercyclical capital tools than currently planned under Basel 3 , the restoration of quantitative reserve requirements to advanced-country central banks &quot; policy toolkits , and direct borrower constraints , such as maximum loan-to-income or loan-to-value limits , in residential and commercial real-estate lending . 
These policies would amount to a rejection of the pre-crisis orthodoxy that free markets are as valuable in finance as they are in other economic sectors . 
That orthodoxy failed . 
If we do not address the fundamental fact that free financial markets can generate harmful levels of private-sector leverage , we will not have learned the most important lesson of the 2008 crisis .
