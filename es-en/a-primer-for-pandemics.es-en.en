A Primer for Pandemics 
A few times each year , the world is reminded that a pandemic threat is immanent . 
In 2003 , it was SARS . 
Today , it is a potential avian virus similar to the one that killed 30 million people after 1914 . 
&quot; Bird flu &quot; has already shown that it can jump from fowl to humans , and now even to cats , which indicates that it might be the next global killer . 
Bacteria , prions , parasites , and even environmental factors could suddenly change in a way that slays us . 
It is widely predicted that when this happens , the economic and human losses will exceed that of any previous war . 
Indeed , it is humbling to remember that some of history &apos;s most deadly invasions were carried out by single-cell organisms , such as cholera , bubonic plague , and tuberculosis . 
Countries with the resources to do so are making resistance plans against pandemics - limited strategies that would protect their own citizens . 
Most governments are hoping that early detection will make containment possible . 
Containment depends heavily on vaccines , but vaccines are only part of the answer . 
While they are a good defense against many viruses , each vaccine is highly specific to the threat . 
Viruses are parasites to cells , and each virus attacks a particular type of cell . 
The virus is shaped so that it can drill into a particular feature of that cell and inject parts of itself inside , confusing the cell into making more viruses and destroying itself in the process . 
With their very specific forms , the most effective anti-viral vaccines must be designed for a narrow range of factors . 
Sometimes the tailored nature of viruses works in our favor . 
For example , they usually find it difficult to jump between species , because they would have to change their structure . 
Birds are the greatest concern today only because the spread is easy to see . 
Deadly mutations of any kind need to be identified urgently , so that an effective vaccine can be designed before the strain becomes comfortable in the human body . 
Unfortunately our present methods of detection are not sensitive enough . 
This is even more worrying when you realize that scientists should also be monitoring bacteria , prions , and parasites . 
There are more bacteria than any other life form . 
Many live harmlessly in our bodies and perform useful functions . 
They evolve and adapt easily , which means that they learn to sidestep our drugs over time . 
Bacteria should be checked for two types of mutation : adaptation by a hostile form that enables it to become super-immune to drugs , or a deadly mutant strain that appears in one of the multitude of &quot; safe &quot; bacteria . 
Prions are a relatively new discovery . 
They are made from proteins similar to those that the body uses during healthy operations , which means that they are able to fool the body &apos;s tools into making more prions . 
They have only recently been recognized as the cause of several infectious diseases , including mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , which kill by crowding out healthy brain cells . 
Many nerve , respiratory and muscle diseases might also be caused by prions . 
Finally , parasites , simple animals that infect us , are already classified as pandemics . 
Malaria afflicts 300 million people and is the world &apos;s biggest killer of children . 
Many parasites are worms : hookworm ( 800 million people infected ) , roundworm ( 1.5 billion ) , schistosomes ( 200 million ) , and the worm that causes Elephantiasis ( 150 million ) . 
There are also antagonists that are currently ignored . 
Environmental chemicals and particulates might warrant their own categories . 
Or consider combinations of problems , such as these chemical infectors mixing with airborne pollens , and apparently pushing up incidences of asthma . 
New fungal infections are even scarier and might be harder to treat . 
The bottom line is that we can &apos;t predict where the threat will emerge , so we need a distributed , intelligent detection system . 
In practical terms , how should it be built ? 
&quot; Detectors &quot; would have to be expert enough to know when an ordinary-looking symptom is actually an emergency . 
They would be located everywhere , with an emphasis on vulnerable regions . 
Initial warning signs of a pandemic are most likely to appear in the developing world , but detection nodes should be positioned in every country , with the least possible expense . 
This is not as difficult as it sounds . 
The key is to harness existing infrastructure . 
Medical infrastructure exists everywhere , in some form . 
It also tends to be the least corrupt of institutions in regions where that is a problem . 
Medical centers and clinics would be expected to investigate the cause of ailments in a large number of their patients , even in cases where the symptoms seem common . 
A small amount of additional scientific expertise and lab equipment would need to be added to a public health system that serves ordinary needs . 
Enhancing existing resources would be effective for two reasons . 
First , illness is more likely to be reported in a city hospital than at a specialist institute . 
Second , the investment would boost latent public health in that region . 
For poor regions , investment in equipment and training would have to come from wealthier counterparts . 
Rich countries could justify the expense in terms of the savings that would result from early detection of a major threat . 
Tropical climates and urban slums are humanity &apos;s front line against pandemics , and they should be equipped properly . 
Public health is an important asset for any nation . 
With so much at stake , it makes sense to place sentinels near every swamp , city , public market , and farmyard on earth .
