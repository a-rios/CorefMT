How the West Was Re-Won 
PARIS - In 2005 , at the Royal Academy of Arts in London , a prestigious exhibit sponsored by the Chinese Government , &quot; The Three Emperors , &quot; celebrated the greatness of Chinese art . 
The show &apos;s central piece was a giant painting in the European ( Jesuit ) style depicting the envoys of the Western world lining up to pay respect to the Chinese emperor . 
The message could not have been more explicit : &quot; China is back . &quot; 
The West would have to pay tribute to China in the future the way it had kowtowed to it in the past . 
In 2012 , China is on the verge of becoming the world &apos;s largest economy and is by far the leading emerging power . 
Yet two simultaneous phenomena suggest that the West may have been buried prematurely by its own Cassandras and by Asian pundits who sometimes behave like &quot; arrogant Westerners . &quot; 
First , the West , particularly Europe , is slowly taking the measure of the Asian challenge . 
Second , it is doing so at the very moment that the emerging countries are starting to feel the consequences of a world economic crisis that has Europe as its epicenter . 
In other words , a new balance of strengths and weaknesses is emerging beneath the surface of events - and runs contrary to current mantras . 
Europe has awakened to the Asian challenge just as its own crisis exposes and intensifies the emerging countries &quot; economic , political , and social weaknesses . 
A few years ago , in my book The Geopolitics of Emotion , I stressed the differences that existed between a Western world dominated by fear and an Asia animated by hope . 
While the West accumulated debts , Asia had startled the world with its long economic boom . 
This continues to be the case , but nuances are appearing . 
There is more fear today in the West , but also a little less hope in Asia . 
Indeed , global investors are starting to hedge their bets , as if preparing themselves for a more genuinely balanced world spanning different continents and cultures . 
Asia may have caught up with the West ; 
The Arab world , too , with its ongoing revolution , may also be joining the game , overcoming the humiliation that had been its peoples &quot; animating emotional force . 
The West , meanwhile , may be slowly adapting to the new realities of a world that it no longer dominates , but in which it still occupies an essential role , owing to values whose universalism is now formulated in a more restrained and coherent way . 
Indeed , to fear , hope , and humiliation , I would now add a fourth and decisive cultural mood : modesty . 
Today &apos;s West is very different from the historical West . 
It is a reduced entity , increasingly aware that it can no longer be the center of the world , if only because of its shrinking demographic weight . 
Europe accounted for 20 % of the world &apos;s population at the beginning of the eighteenth century ; the population of the West as a whole will constitute slightly more than 10 % in 2050 . 
The West is also fragmented : the American West is growing increasingly apart from the European West . 
The question is no longer one of shared interests or common security goals , but of culture , as the United States , in particular , increasingly looks to Asia and Latin America and attracts immigrants from those regions . 
As for the Asian West , Japan will continue to remain alone and unique . 
Given this , it might seem premature , to say the least , to announce the &quot; return of the West , &quot; especially at a time when the US economy remains fragile , Europe &apos;s financial crisis is fueling an existential funk , and Japan &apos;s deep structural malaise continues . 
Still , across Europe , particularly in the south , one is witnessing a willingness to learn from others . 
There is a growing awareness , even in France - not known for its humility - that benchmarking is necessary , and that tough sacrifices will have to be made . 
In other words , Europeans are beginning to understand that they have lived well beyond their means materially , and well below their means intellectually , spiritually , and ethically - a process that might be described as the beginning of Europe &apos;s &quot; Montization , &quot; to pay tribute to Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s embodiment of responsibility and courage . 
Just imagine : a more virtuous Europe encountering a more &quot; decadent &quot; China , whose venal elites are starting to turn on each other ? 
What we may be witnessing is the consolidation of a truly multipolar world , in which the West no longer dominates , but is not about to be replaced by Asia or the emerging world in general . 
The West is not &quot; striking back . &quot;
