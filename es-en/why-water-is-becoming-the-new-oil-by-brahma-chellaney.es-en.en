The Battle for Water 
NEW YORK - The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle . 
Transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict , triggering a dam-building race and prompting growing calls for the United Nations to recognize water as a key security concern . 
Water is different from other natural resources . 
After all , there are substitutes for many resources , including oil , but none for water . 
Similarly , countries can import fossil fuels , mineral ores , and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber ; but they cannot import water , which is essentially local , on a large scale and on a prolonged - much less permanent - basis . 
Water is heavier than oil , making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline ( which would require large , energy-intensive pumps ) . 
The paradox of water is that it sustains life but can also cause death when it becomes a carrier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami , flash flood , storm , or hurricane . 
Many of the greatest natural disasters of our time - including , for example , the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 - have been water-related . 
Global warming is set to put potable-water supplies under increasing strain - even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase . 
Rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to potable water into a major issue across large parts of the world . 
Lifestyle changes , for example , have spurred increasing per capita water consumption , with rising incomes promoting dietary change , for example , especially higher consumption of meat , production of which is ten times more water-intensive , on average , than plant-based calories and proteins . 
Today , the earth &apos;s human population totals slightly more than seven billion , but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion . 
The direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population , with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself . 
Political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions , reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works . 
Consider , for example , the silent water war triggered by Ethiopia &apos;s dam building on the Blue Nile , which has elicited Egyptian threats of covert or overt military reprisals . 
A report reflecting the joint judgment of US intelligence agencies warned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions . 
The InterAction Council , comprising more than 30 former heads of state or government , has called for urgent action to prevent some countries battling severe water shortages from becoming failed states . 
The US State Department , for its part , has upgraded water to &quot; a central US foreign policy concern . &quot; 
In many countries , inadequate local water availability is increasingly constraining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants . 
The World Bank estimates that such constraints are costing China 2.3 % of GDP . 
China , however , is not yet in the category of water-stressed states . 
Those that are , stretching from South Korea and India to Egypt and Israel , are paying an even higher price for their water problems . 
These countries already understand that water is a renewable but finite resource . 
Nature &apos;s water-replenishment capacity is fixed , limiting the world &apos;s usable freshwater resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers . 
Major increases in water demand , however , are being driven not merely by economic and demographic growth , or by the additional energy , manufacturing , and food production to meet rising consumption levels , but also by the fact that the global population is getting fatter . 
The average body mass index ( BMI ) of humans has been increasing in the post-World War II period , but especially since the 1980 &quot; s , with the prevalence of obesity doubling in the past three decades . 
Heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources , especially water and energy . 
The issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed , but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet . 
For example , a study published in the British journal BMC Public Health has found that if the rest of the world had the same average body mass index as the US , this would be the equivalent of adding almost one billion people to the global population , greatly exacerbating water stress . 
With the era of cheap , bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints , many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil . 
The dramatic rise of the bottled-water industry since the 1990 &quot; s attests to the increasing commodification of the world &apos;s most critical resource . 
Not only are water shortages likely to intensify and spread , but consumers also will increasingly have to pay more for their water supply . 
This double whammy can be mitigated only by innovative water management and conservation , and by developing nontraditional supply sources . 
As in the oil and gas sector - where tapping unconventional sources , such as shale and tar sands , has proved a game changer - the water sector must adopt all unconventional options , including recycling wastewater and desalinating ocean and brackish waters . 
In short , we must focus on addressing our water-supply problems as if our lives depended on it . 
In fact , they do .
