Grading Abenomics 
TOKYO - It has been almost a year since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched his plan to lift Japan &apos;s economy out of two decades of deflation and recession . 
How has &quot; Abenomics &quot; fared so far ? 
Answering this question requires breaking Abenomics down into its three components - massive monetary easing , expansionary fiscal policy , and a long-term growth strategy - which Abe , referring to the tale of Motonari Mori , a sixteenth-century daimyo ( feudal lord ) , calls the &quot; three arrows . &quot; 
According to legend , Mori instructed each of his three sons to snap an arrow in half . 
After they had succeeded , he told them to tie three arrows together , and break the whole bundle at once ; none was able to do it . 
But Mori &apos;s arrows were bound together in parallel , whereas Abe &apos;s policy arrows are connected through underlying structural relationships . 
While the first and second arrows aim to transform Japan &apos;s actual growth path , the third operates on the economy &apos;s potential growth path , which assumes the optimal use of all available resources and technologies . 
Since Abenomics was launched , the &quot; deflation gap &quot; ( the difference between actual and potential output ) has dropped from roughly three percentage points to below 1.5 . 
This implies that , while the first two arrows are helping to improve Japan &apos;s actual growth path , the third arrow has yet to do much for potential growth . 
In fact , since Abe &apos;s first arrow took flight , Japan &apos;s stock market has soared with it , recording an unprecedented 40 % annual gain , while the yen has depreciated against the dollar by 20 % , boosting Japanese firms &quot; export competitiveness . 
Moreover , credit growth has accelerated and asset prices have risen - trends that will encourage consumption by triggering the wealth effect ( when people spend more because they feel richer ) . 
And monetary expansion is also having a positive impact on the labor market : the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 % , and the job-to-applicant ratio is nearing parity . 
With real GDP growth around 4 % in the first half of the year ( though it did fall below 2 % in the third quarter ) , the first arrow has already hit the bull &apos;s eye - a performance worthy of an A + . 
The second arrow entails a sharp increase in short-term fiscal expenditure , especially investment in infrastructure projects . 
While those who , like me , adhere to the Mundell-Fleming framework ( according to which fiscal stimulus will be offset by the resulting increase in capital inflows , currency appreciation , and reduced export competitiveness ) do not stress the impact of flexible fiscal policy , Keynesians take it very seriously . 
On the assumption that faster growth will neutralize any threat to debt sustainability , the second arrow receives a B. 
When the first and second arrows lift actual growth above potential growth , monetary expansion will no longer be able to produce substantial GDP or employment gains . 
That is when the third arrow , which aims to boost Japan &apos;s potential growth through structural change ( including increased private investment , technological innovation , improved trade links , and reformed corporate-tax policy ) , will become far more important . 
Abe has set out the vision behind his long-term growth plan . 
&quot; Japan is a country that challenges , that is open , and that innovates , &quot; he says . 
Japan &apos;s longtime approach to industrial policy , in which the Ministry of International Trade and Industry provided support and subsidies for selected industries , helping them to compete in world markets , is now obsolete ( indeed , MITI &apos;s role was taken over by the Ministry of Economy , Trade , and Industry in 2001 ) . 
When Japanese firms operate at the frontier of industry , bureaucrats cannot choose the winners . 
Given this , the government &apos;s role should be confined to areas where externalities exist , such as carbon-emissions reduction . 
Unfortunately , a new , clearly defined approach to industrial policy is still missing . 
In fact , descriptions of some third-arrow projects seem to be based on little more than wishful thinking , with new technology or knowhow apparently expected simply to fall into Japan &apos;s lap . 
A more effective approach would entail achievable , concrete goals like relaxing labor- and financial-market regulations , reducing corporate income taxes , liberalizing trade by joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and perhaps easing immigration policy . 
The problem is that bureaucrats like the power that regulation affords them . 
Indeed , deregulation would require them to put their country &apos;s long-term interests above their own short-term interests - a choice that they have so far resisted . 
To paraphrase John F. Kennedy , it is time for Japan &apos;s leaders to ask not what their country can do for its government , but what the government can undo for its country . 
In this context , the third arrow of Abenomics cannot yet be fairly assessed . 
While its impact has so far been lacking , it certainly cannot be deemed a failure , with Japan &apos;s top leaders still working tirelessly to build the needed momentum . 
The most appropriate grade is therefore an &quot; E &quot; for effort . 
One hopes that it is an effort that proves adequate to overcome bureaucratic resistance to deregulation in the coming year . 
With an A + , a B , and an &quot; E , &quot; Abenomics &apos;s first-year report card reflects important progress , providing plenty of reason for enthusiasm . 
It even spells its originator &apos;s name .
