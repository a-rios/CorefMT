Tradable Prosperity 
MILAN - The global economy is experiencing a major growth challenge . 
Many advanced countries are attempting to revive sustainable growth in the face of a decelerating global economy . 
In particular , the tradable and non-tradable parts of a range of economies differ in important ways . 
In the non-tradable sector ( 60-70 % of the economy in advanced countries ) , the main growth inhibitors are weak demand , as in the United States following the financial crisis , and structural and competitive impediments to productivity , as in Japan . 
In the tradable sector , growth depends on a country &apos;s productivity relative to incomes and competitiveness . 
At the global level , there can also be a shortage of aggregate demand on the tradable side . 
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow has shown that growth comes from three sources : the working population , capital investment , and technological progress . 
A growing young population helps to maintain fiscal balance and ensure intergenerational equity , but it does not by itself increase incomes . 
On the other hand , economic growth below the sum of growth in the working population and the labor-saving part of technological change fuels unemployment . 
Developing countries , once they enter rapid-growth mode , generate growth from capital deepening via investment , in a sense making up for past underinvestment . 
So a legitimate part of a strategy to restore growth is investment . 
But , as Solow noted , investment has its limits , owing to diminishing marginal returns . 
Often , these limits are not binding , but , once capital deepening is exhausted , technological progress , which makes inputs more productive in creating final value , is the long-run driver of growth . 
The challenge is to apply these insights in a world characterized by global economic interdependence , major imbalances , and a worsening growth and employment problem . 
It is a world in which economies are connected directly in the tradable sector of the global economy , and indirectly through the demand and employment linkages between the tradable and non-tradable sectors of individual economies . 
In the short run , the non-tradable sector is , by definition , subject to domestic-demand constraints . 
A shortfall in non-tradable demand inevitably limits growth on that side of the economy . 
Government can , of course , bridge the gap via deficit spending ( preferably focused on employment-generating investment that enhances future growth ) . 
Just how fiscally constrained these countries are remains subject to debate . 
Italy and Spain are clearly constrained by the absence of private capital in their respective sovereign-debt markets , with rising yields threatening their fiscal stability and reform programs . 
They need the eurozone core and the International Monetary Fund as temporary lenders of last resort until they restore policy credibility and regain investors &quot; confidence . 
The US sovereign-debt market shows no similar evidence of having reached a limit yet . 
The more complex growth issues have to do with the tradable part of the global economy , where global aggregate demand - and the derived demand that lands in various places in global supply or value-added chains - is the target of competition . 
Total demand and its growth do matter , but so does market share . 
Given the growth patterns across advanced and developing countries prior to the crisis , and then the large negative shock , it is likely that there is a shortfall of tradable global aggregate demand , impeding an important component of global growth . 
But , for individual economies , relative productivity versus income levels determines the share of global tradable aggregate demand that is accessible . 
Unlike the non-tradable side of the economy , the domestic component of global tradable demand is not an absolute constraint on growth ; nor is the rate of growth of global tradable demand an absolute constraint , given the possibility of increasing share . 
Of course , not everyone can gain share at the same time . 
Fortunately , if countries increase productivity with the aim of boosting relative productivity and growth potential on the tradable side , this will increase incomes and accelerate the growth of global aggregate demand . 
It may look like a zero-sum game , but it is not . 
When incomes get significantly out of line with productivity levels ( as they have recently ) , reviving growth requires resetting the terms of trade , which can be done with exchange rates , whether managed or set by markets . 
In the eurozone , where countries with competitiveness problems do not have the exchange-rate adjustment mechanism , restrained income growth and productivity-boosting reforms are probably needed , as was the case in Germany between 2000 and 2006 , and now in several southern European countries . 
What is true for countries on the tradable side is also true for workers , who are differentially affected by the evolution of global supply chains . 
The efficient integration of global supply chains has created employment opportunities in developing countries and in the higher value-added sectors of advanced countries . 
Many countries are struggling to adapt their growth patterns to the new challenges they face in a slowing global economy . 
To be effective and properly targeted , policies need to include an accurate diagnosis of growth potential and impediments in both the tradable and non-tradable parts of the economy . 
Focusing on one ( say , the competitiveness problem in the tradable sector ) to the exclusion of the other ( perhaps a serious non-tradable demand shortfall or stagnant absolute productivity ) will not be enough .
