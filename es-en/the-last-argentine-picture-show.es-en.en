The Last Argentine Picture Show 
SANTIAGO - The only thing worse than a terrible movie is a terrible movie that we have already seen . 
By nationalizing oil giant YPF , Argentina has treated us to a tale of economic nationalism of a kind that the world knows all too well . 
We have seen this show before , and it ends badly . 
Start with the predictably overwrought reaction of businessmen and conservative politicians . 
That is false , just as previous claims that no one would lend to Argentina after its umpteenth debt default turned out to be false . 
As P.T. Barnum reminds us , there is a sucker born every minute ; a sucker who will be bailed out by his government if he over-lends surely is born almost as often . 
What is at stake every time Argentine governments put on a populist display is not the fate of foreign investors , but of the country &apos;s citizens . 
Populism and economic nationalism have been impoverishing Argentines at least since the 1940 &quot; s . 
Argentina has been making a hash of its energy sector for more than a decade . 
After the economic crisis of 2001 , the authorities fixed the price of energy in nominal pesos and kept it there for years , even though inflation was running at 20 % or more ( according to independent estimates , that is ; official figures are cooked to show lower inflation ) . 
No surprisingly , consumers over-consumed and firms under-invested . 
Output stagnated . 
With gas increasingly scarce , Argentina defaulted on its gas-export contracts to Chile , and imposed an abusive and arbitrary tax on gas sales to its Andean neighbor . 
Today , Argentina is reported to have the world &apos;s third largest reserves of shale gas at the suggestively named Vaca Muerta ( Dead Cow ) field . 
The Argentine government has neither the money nor the technology to exploit these vast resources . 
Argentina could choose to follow Bolivia &apos;s lead : kick out the foreign companies and then fail to extract the gas . 
Otherwise , it will have to find partners , most likely foreign . 
So the question is not whether Argentines will proudly go it alone , but what kind of partners they will have . 
Argentina has just expelled a company whose capital came mostly from a democratic country , Spain . 
For all of their faults - they were never models of innovation or forward-looking management - YPF and its parent company , Repsol , at least were bound by the strictures required for trading on advanced countries &quot; stock exchanges . 
If press reports are correct , YPF &apos;s next foreign partners could well come from China . 
And Chinese companies &quot; record in Africa , where they have engaged in an all-out race to control natural resources , with little regard for the niceties of transparency and modern accounting , let alone environmental protection , human rights , and democratic freedoms , is not exactly encouraging . 
From all recent indications , the new YPF is unlikely to be a model company . 
Recognizing that many European and Asian countries have successful state-owned enterprises , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has developed a code of best practices . 
The OECD recommends placing firms at arms-length from politicians &quot; short-term interests , appointing independent boards , enhancing disclosure , monitoring conflicts of interests , and hiring professional managers . 
Those were the principles at work when the Chilean Congress , as part of Chile &apos;s accession to the OECD , voted in 2009 to revamp the corporate governance of copper giant CODELCO . 
In Argentina , by contrast , a deputy government minister , whose professional background is in academic theorizing , has been tapped to run YPF . 
The quality of management is likely to be as high as in recently re-nationalized Aerolíneas Argentinas , whose grumpy flight assistants and perennially delayed departures have made it the butt of industry jokes . 
The YPF board will be packed with members of La Cámpora , the Peronist youth group led by Máximo Kirchner , President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner &apos;s son . 
The prospect that YPF could be the launching pad for the next generation of the Kirchner dynasty would be laughable were it not eerily plausible . 
The Kirchner family seems to be working hard to prove Marx &apos;s famous dictum that history repeats itself , &quot; the first time as tragedy , the second time as farce . &quot; 
Indeed , governance under the Kirchners owes more to Groucho , Chico , and Harpo than it does to Karl . 
How sad for Argentina .
