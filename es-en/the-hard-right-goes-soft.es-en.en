The Hard Right Goes Soft 
PARIS - The central paradox of French politics was confirmed once again on March 27 . 
In a nationwide vote to select local authorities ( the so called Conseiller Général ) , the far-right National Front gained 11 % of the votes cast , but secured only 0.1 % of the seats . 
This discrepancy between the National Front &apos;s popular strength and its actual representation has been a permanent feature of French politics since Jean-Marie Le Pen established the party 40 years ago . 
But Le Pen was replaced in January by his no less charismatic daughter , Marine . 
And , with that change , the fate of the Front may be changing , too . 
The Front &apos;s scant number of elected officials reflects the strategy pursued by its two main adversaries , the Socialist Party and President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s Union pour un Mouvement Populaire ( UMP , formerly the Gaullist party ) , which have essentially shared all elected posts at the national and local level since the 1980 &quot; s . 
In order to preserve their shared domination , they have more or less agreed to a &quot; Republican Front &quot; strategy aimed at excluding the National Front in the second round of all elections . 
Thus , in a direct run-off between a Front candidate and a Socialist or UMP candidate , the Socialists and the UMP usually vote for each other . 
The most striking demonstration of this &quot; Republican &quot; alliance was the 2002 Presidential election , when , with Socialist support , Jacques Chirac , the Gaullist incumbent , received 85 % of the popular vote in the run-off against Jean-Marie Le Pen . 
So far , this &quot; Republican Front &quot; strategy of exclusion has succeeded in keeping the far right out of any significant political office for four decades , but it has never reduced the size of its electoral base . 
On the contrary , the National Front gains credibility by never having to test its program in government . 
For last Sunday &apos;s run-off , however , Sarkozy broke with convention : in races where a Socialist candidate faced off against the National Front , his position was &quot; No , neither . &quot; 
As a result , UMP voters split between abstaining , supporting the Socialist , and voting for the National Front . 
Compared to Chirac &apos;s rigid refusal to consider any kind of rapprochement with the Front , Sarkozy &apos;s policy is thus a small step towards recognition of the Front &apos;s legitimacy . 
The left has , of course , denounced this move as risking fascism . 
But , like it or not , the Front is a legal party . 
It may be xenophobic , but its leaders never denigrate the Republic : there may be fascists members within it , but the party plays by the democratic rules . 
And , like it or not , the Republican Front may crumble altogether under Marine Le Pen &apos;s leadership of the party her father founded . 
Her father was , above all , an ideologue , a &quot; populist &quot; Napoleon who would never moderate his vision of a white and Catholic France in need of a moral revival . 
Thus , he rejected the French Revolution and the modern welfare state as much as he opposed Muslim immigration . 
Gaullists and Socialists are proud that they never compromised with Jean-Marie Le Pen , but he would not have negotiated with them , anyway . 
Le Pen &apos;s ambition was always to &quot; save &quot; France , not to become Minister of Tourism . 
His daughter , however , has clearly softened the tone . 
Since Marine Le Pen took the helm , she has proven herself able to combine the National Front &apos;s trademark anti-immigration stance , the hard core of its ideology , with praise for the state and the Republic . 
And she has brought a fresh anti-capitalist tone to the Front &apos;s rhetoric - always a crowd pleaser in France . 
Marine Le Pen is seeking the same path to power traveled by Italy &apos;s Northern League , the Flemish Interest Party , Liveable Netherlands , and the Danish People &apos;s Party , all of which first became &quot; soft &quot; populist parties . 
As a result of this shift , in the near future Sarkozy &apos;s conservatives may have no choice but to ally with the Front . 
Sarkozy &apos;s attempt to co-opt far-right rhetoric on security and immigration has not worked , because , when it comes to national chauvinism , the French prefer its authentic purveyors . 
And the French - and voters elsewhere in Europe - vote for far-right parties the most when the far left is weakest . 
Indeed , the National Front is strongest precisely where the Communist Party once was the leading force . 
Between one-quarter and one-third of Continental Europeans feel permanently disenfranchised , and are prepared to vote for any &quot; protest &quot; party , whether far right or far left . 
The reason is essentially the same throughout Europe : slow economic growth implies few prospects for a better life , while the welfare state has failed to create jobs . 
The far left indicts capitalism ; the far right points the finger of blame at immigrants . 
The far left would recommend revolution ; the far right , ethnic cleansing . 
Anti-capitalist revolution was tried in half of Europe in the last century , with dire results . 
Expulsion of immigrants has not . 
Given a slow economy , a failed welfare state , and uncontrolled immigration - challenges for which no mainstream parties on the right or the left have any coherent proposals - the appeal of the far right &apos;s soft populism will continue to haunt France and Europe .
