Rich Europe , Poor Europe 
From its earliest days , the European Union has aimed for balanced economic development across its many regions . 
The Maastricht Treaty contains the striking phrase &quot; overall harmonious development . &quot; 
But , however admirable this sentiment may be , there is no &quot; scientific truth &quot; about the &quot; right &quot; level of disparities and the correct speed of convergence . 
Nevertheless , it is useful to compare economic disparities in the EU with those in the United States to assess regional convergence in Europe - bearing in mind , of course , that the US has been a nation-state for more than two centuries , while the EU is best seen as a confederation of 27 states under a supra-national structure . 
Let us first take a historical look at the western part of the EU . 
In 1960 , disparities in what later came to be known as the EU-15 were about twice as large as those between US states . 
Today , they are comparable with American income disparities . 
Income disparities have halved both in nominal terms when expressed in euros and in real terms when taking into account differences in purchasing power . 
Western Europe first saw a period in which real incomes converged , followed by a period of converging prices . 
In the 1960 &quot; s and early 1970 &quot; s , disparities in purchasing power declined by about 40 % , then stalled , while nominal income disparities fell by a similar margin from the mid-1970 &quot; s to 1990 . 
With the introduction of the euro , and with falling inflation , nominal convergence and real convergence have grown similar , both making gradual progress since the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
The average population of the EU-15 is about 25 million , many more than the six million in the average US state , which more closely resembles the average population of EU regions , such as Bavaria , Wallonia , ÃŽle-de-France and the Canary Islands . 
So perhaps it is more useful to compare the 50 US states with the EU &apos;s 72 regions . 
The convergence trend in the EU at the country level is reflected in the regions . 
But income disparities in the regions are still substantial in western Europe when compared with American states . 
It is true that poorer EU countries tend to outgrow richer ones , but poor regions do not necessarily outgrow rich regions or even the country average . 
So regional disparities may persist or even grow , posing a challenge for policymakers concerned with stimulating economic growth and regional cohesion . 
And what about wealth disparities in today &apos;s EU of 27 members ? 
With the accession of 10 new states in 2004 and another two at the beginning of 2007 , the Union &apos;s membership now spans central and eastern Europe . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , these ex-communist countries had to face temporary income slumps as most of their industrial production became virtually made obsolete overnight . 
New production capacity has now been created and new markets conquered , but the catching-up process is still far from complete . 
Unsurprisingly , then , regional disparities in income are much greater across the enlarged EU &apos;s countries than across the US states . 
In 2005 , average income disparities were twice as high within the then-EU-25 as within the American states . 
But they have come down by nearly one-third over the past 12 years . 
As with the EU-15 , income convergence for the regions again turns out to be slower than convergence between countries . 
Recent empirical evidence suggests that the central and eastern European regions benefiting most from EU membership are those around the country &apos;s capital city or sharing a border with one of the 15 countries . 
But as long as poorer member states grow faster than their richer counterparts , one should not be overly concerned about temporary increases in intra-national disparities . 
In fact , a temporary increase in intra-national disparities may be a good thing . 
Globalization and technological change are reshaping production throughout Europe , leading to the decline of traditional industries and rapid growth of high-technology manufacturing , banking and finance , scientific research , and business services . 
The fact that companies in these sectors benefit from operating close to one another may boost economic development at the expense of peripheral regions . 
In the US , successful convergence in economic conditions across regions relies strongly on labor mobility . 
Internal migration is the main driver of income convergence , helped by a common language and all the other factors that foster mobility in America , such as comparatively easy access to housing and education . 
By contrast , labor in the EU is largely immobile . 
Despite populist speeches about the threat posed by &quot; Polish plumbers , &quot; net migration flows between regions are generally insensitive to differences in unemployment rates among regions . 
Of course , Europe &apos;s labor immobility is partly caused by linguistic and cultural differences - barriers that cannot easily be removed . 
But other barriers can be overcome by reforming housing policies , reducing the cost of moving , and revising social-welfare policies in order to end fears of losing long-term benefits . 
Reducing the labor supply in economically depressed areas of Europe and increasing it in booming regions would do much to reduce differences in wages and unemployment rates . 
It &apos;s time to start thinking seriously about how to make Europeans move .
