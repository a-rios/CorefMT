The Strange Death of Multiculturalism 
An ideology which holds that people from different cultures must live in separate communities within a country , should not take an interest in each other and must not criticise each other is both wrong and unworkable . 
Of course , multiculturalism &apos;s more thoughtful advocates never imagined that a cultural community could or should substitute for a political community . 
They believed that so long as everyone abided by the law , it was not necessary for citizens to have a single hierarchy of values . 
The ideal of multiculturalism at home was echoed with an ideology of cultural relativism abroad , especially in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
African dictators might do dreadful things but somehow they did not meet with condemnation from many European intellectuals , for criticism implied cultural arrogance . 
The Netherlands , where I was born , has perhaps been divided by the debate over multiculturalism more than any other country . 
The murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh two and a half years ago by an Islamist assassin has incited a wrenching debate about the country &apos;s entrenched culture of tolerance and easy access for asylum-seekers . 
Long before the arrival of Muslim guest workers in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s Dutch society was in a sense &quot; multicultural &quot; in that it was already organised into Protestant , Catholic , liberal and socialist &quot; pillars , &quot; each with its own schools , hospitals , TV stations , papers and political parties . 
When guest workers from Morocco and Turkey became de facto immigrants , some began to champion the creation of an additional Muslim pillar . 
But at the moment that multiculturalism &apos;s advocates were making this suggestion , Dutch society was undergoing a dramatic transition . 
With secularization taking hold , the traditional pillars began to break down . 
Moreover , fierce attacks on Muslims started to come from people who , raised in deeply religious families , had turned into radical leftists in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s . 
From defining themselves as anti-colonialists and anti-racists - champions of multiculturalism amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; they have become fervent defenders of so-called Enlightenment values against Muslim orthodoxy . 
These people feared the comeback of religion ; that the Protestant or Catholic oppressiveness they knew first-hand might be replaced by equally oppressive Muslim codes of conduct . 
But their turn away from multiculturalism is not what prevented the emergence of a &quot; Islamic &quot; pillar in Dutch society . 
The main problem with this idea was that people from Turkey , Morocco , and the Arab countries , some deeply religious and some quite secular , and all with perceptible animosities towards each other , would never have agreed on what should constitute such a pillar . 
In any case , it is now too late to create such a pillar . 
With the earlier pillars having collapsed , the emergence of a new one would bring about a situation where an increasingly integrated majority would be negotiating with a minority , thus perpetuating its isolation in the process . 
Whether Europeans like it or not , Muslims are part of Europe . 
Many will not abandon their religion , so Europeans must learn to live with them and with Islam . 
Of course , this will be easier if Muslims come to believe that the system also works to their benefit . 
Liberal democracy and Islam are reconcilable . 
Indonesia &apos;s current political transition from dictatorship to democracy , although no unqualified success , shows that this is achievable . 
Even if all of Europe &apos;s Muslims were Islamists - which is a far cry from reality - they could not threaten the Continent &apos;s sovereignty and , by the same token , its laws and Enlightenment values . 
Of course , there are groups to which Islamism appeals . 
The children of immigrants , born in Europe , sense they are not fully accepted in the country where they grew up , but neither do they feel a special bond with their parent &apos;s native country . 
Islamism , besides offering them an answer to the question why they do not feel happy with the way they live , gives them a sense of their self-worth and a great cause to die for . 
In the end , the only thing that can truly damage European values is Europe &apos;s response to its non-Muslim majority . 
Fear of Islam and of immigrants could lead to the adoption of non-liberal laws . 
By defending Enlightenment values in a dogmatic way Europeans will be the ones who undermine them . 
Our laws prohibiting incitement to violence and insulting people for reasons of their religion are sufficient . 
Further constraints on freedom of speech - such as anti-blasphemy laws or , indeed , those laws that make Holocaust denial punishable - go too far . 
But this doesn &apos;t mean that we should not weigh our words with care . 
We should distinguish carefully between different kinds of Islam , and not confuse violent revolutionary movements with mere religious orthodoxy . 
Insulting Muslims simply on the basis of their faith is foolish and counterproductive , as is the increasingly popular notion that we must make sweeping pronouncements as to the superiority of &quot; our culture . &quot; 
The trouble today is that Enlightenment values are sometimes used in a very dogmatic way against Muslims . 
They have become in fact a form of nationalism - &quot; our values &quot; have been set against &quot; their values . &quot; 
The reason for defending Enlightenment values is that they are based on good ideas , and not because they are &quot; our culture . &quot; 
To confuse culture and politics in this way is to fall into the same trap as the multiculturalists . 
And it has serious consequences . 
If we antagonize Europe &apos;s Muslims enough we will push more people into joining the Islamist revolution . 
We must do everything to encourage Europe &apos;s Muslim to become assimilated in European societies . 
It is our only hope .
