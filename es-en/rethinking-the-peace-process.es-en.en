Rethinking the Peace Process 
WASHINGTON , D.C. : Many stories coming out of Sharm el-Sheikh convey the idea that the hastily convened Middle East summit was a success . 
The reality , however , is both more complicated and more sobering . 
Yes , Israelis and Palestinians agreed to issue public statements calling for an end to the violence . 
And yes , the two sides also agreed to take steps so that they are less likely to come into open conflict with one another . 
Yet the reality is less reassuring . 
President Clinton announced the accord ; 
Moreover , we have seen assurances like this before only to see renewed violence . 
The same could all too easily happen again . 
Even more important , President Clinton had little to say about the future path of Middle East diplomacy other than to note the United States would consult with parties on how to more forward . 
But moving forward promises to be easier called for than carried out . 
The Middle East peace process , as it has evolved over three decades , may well be over . 
Ironically , this development comes only months after the one attempt to actually solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
How has the situation reached such a point ? 
Some point a finger at Ariel Sharon , citing his provocative visit to the Temple Mount area of Jerusalem . 
A much stronger case can be made that the lion &apos;s share of the responsibility falls upon Yasir Arafat , who at Camp David rejected a generous Israeli offer . 
He then added insult to injury both by failing to do all that he could to curb the violence , which followed the Sharon visit and by releasing more than one hundred accused terrorists from Palestinian prisons . 
But the Clinton administration must also share some criticism , by pushing for a comprehensive peace when it was clear that the necessary spade-work had not been done . 
Diplomacy must be tailored to fit the opportunity ; at Camp David , President Clinton pushed for more than Arafat was going to endorse . 
It would have been far wiser to resist the entreaties coming from both the Israeli and Palestinian sides to solve the conflict and stick with the more modest step-by-step approach that had been shown to work . 
Others will have their own analysis of how we reached the current imbroglio ; no matter . 
What does matter is that there is no going back to where we were just weeks ago . 
The images C of the lynching of Israeli soldiers , the shooting of that Palestinian boy C have had their effect . 
Doves and moderates on either side of the divide are in retreat . 
The result is that no &quot; Camp David 3 &quot; can hope to accomplish what July &apos;s summit failed to do . 
Yasir Arafat will not be more inclined than he was to compromise or to promise an end to the decades-old conflict . 
Ehud Barak , Israel &apos;s embattled Prime Minister , is unlikely to be as forthcoming as he was even if he wanted to be . 
A second approach would return the focus of peacemaking to where it was just a few months ago , namely , on taking modest steps as called for by the Oslo agreement . 
The problem with resurrecting this gradual diplomacy now is that neither side is prepared to embrace it . 
Israelis are in no mood to give up more tangible territory for intangible promises of Palestinian good behavior ; the Palestinians will resist signing on to any process that does not deliver to them all that they want . 
There may be , however , an alternative path for diplomacy : what I call Aconcerted unilateralism . &quot; 
Some times it is possible for parties to live with certain outcomes even if they cannot formally sign an agreement ratifying them . 
This could be the case in today &apos;s Middle East . 
In this case , the two sides would still have to script events . 
At the core would be the declaration of a Palestinian state and Israeli annexation of land including the bulk of the settlers . 
Israel would give up some territory containing settlements that could not be easily defended . 
Palestinians living outside the area would be able to move to the new Palestinian state but not to Israel . 
In short , the two sides would coordinate the implementation of the less controversial aspects of what had been negotiated at Camp David C and put off trying to solve the most difficult issues , including Jerusalem . 
The result would not be peace or an end to the conflict or a signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House . 
Rather , it would be a de facto separation of the two sides reflecting a tacit arrangement to stabilize the situation . 
It would still require cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian officials , but it would not require either side &apos;s leadership to explain to its citizens why it forfeited certain powerful symbols or jettisoned deeply-held goals . 
Such an approach is not ideal , but it is potentially doable and is far preferable to what is going on or could develop . 
This approach does , however , require that we let go for now of the idea of solving the Middle East problem and return to the more modest but still demanding task of managing the situation . 
It is time to rethink the peace process .
