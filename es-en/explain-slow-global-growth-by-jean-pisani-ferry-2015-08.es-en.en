A Tale of Two Theories 
PARIS - Global growth disappoints again . 
A year ago , the International Monetary Fund expected world output to rise 4 % in 2015 . 
Now the Fund is forecasting 3.3 % for the year - about the same as in 2013 and 2014 , and more than a full percentage point below the 2000-2007 average . 
In the eurozone , growth in the latest quarter was underwhelming . 
Japan has returned to negative territory . 
Brazil and Russia are in recession . 
World trade has stalled . 
And China &apos;s economic slowdown and market turmoil this summer have created further uncertainty . 
True , there are bright spots : India , Spain , and the United Kingdom are beating expectations . 
The United States &quot; recovery is solid . 
Africa is doing well . 
But , overall , it is hard to deny that the global economy lacks momentum . 
This is partly because trees cannot grow forever : China &apos;s economy could not continue to get 10 % bigger every year . 
And in part , it is because growth is not unconditionally desirable : Citizens may be better off with a little less of it , and more clean air . 
But many countries are still poor enough to be endowed with strong growth potential , and many others , though rich , have not yet recovered from the global financial crisis . 
So there must be something else holding growth back . 
There are essentially two competing explanations . 
The first , the Secular Stagnation Hypothesis , has been proposed by Larry Summers . 
Its key premise is that the equilibrium interest rate at which demand would balance supply is currently below the actual interest rate . 
This seems paradoxical , because interest rates are close to zero in most advanced economies . 
But what matters is the real rate of interest , that is , the difference between the market rate and inflation . 
Aggregate economic balance may require a negative real interest rate ; but with inflation at an all-time low - the IMF expects it to be negative this year and next in the advanced economies , and zero in the emerging economies - this is not feasible . 
There are several reasons why the equilibrium interest rate could have reached negative territory . 
Some are structural : saving is high globally , especially in Asia but also in Europe , where aging countries like Germany put money aside for retirement . 
At the same time , the new digital economy is less capital-intensive than the old brick-and-mortar economy . 
This may be accentuated in the future by the advent of the so-called sharing economy . 
Other factors are temporary . 
In several countries , debt-financed housing booms have left households and companies over-leveraged ; and governments have reduced deficits to contain their own debt . 
As a result , there are likely to be too few investors and too many savers . 
The Secular Stagnation Hypothesis is worrying , because it gives few reasons to believe that things will improve by themselves . 
True , debt deleveraging is not without limits . 
But it is impeded by slow growth and , thanks to high unemployment and weak global demand , persistently low inflation . 
Worse , over the longer term , low investment undermines productivity , while protracted unemployment destroys skills . 
Both reduce future potential growth . 
A vicious circle , it seems , is at work . 
The way to break it , according to Summers , is to sustain monetary stimulus and boost demand aggressively through fiscal policy . 
The alternative explanation for the persistence of weak global growth has been best formulated by the Bank for International Settlements , an organization of central banks . 
The BIS maintains that excessively low interest rates are a big reason why growth is disappointing . 
This explanation may seem even more paradoxical than the first , but the logic is straightforward : Governments often try to escape the hard task of improving economic efficiency through supply-side reforms and rely on demand-side fixes instead . 
So , when confronted with a growth slowdown caused by structural factors , many countries responded by lowering interest rates and stimulating credit . 
But cheap credit promotes bad investment and excessive debt , which borrowers often are unable to repay . 
More fundamentally , investment is a bet that cannot pay off if growth is structurally depressed . 
Artificial growth promotion only ends in tears . 
Furthermore , the BIS claims that credit may well aggravate structural deficiencies . 
Housing bubbles and investments in dubious projects result in a waste of resources and a misallocation of capital that ultimately dampens potential growth . 
The best example is perhaps Spain in the 2000s , where students left university before graduating to take part in the real-estate frenzy . 
Amassing useless concrete and losing human capital , the country lost twice . 
So here , too , the logic points to a vicious circle : Slower growth leads to artificial remedies and further erosion of long-term growth potential . 
The BIS argues in favor of fiscal restraint , debt restructuring if needed , and swift normalization of monetary policies - quite explicitly criticizing the US Federal Reserve &apos;s caution and the European Central Bank &apos;s aggressive stance . 
Both theories are internally consistent . 
Both also fit only some of the facts . 
The Secular Stagnation Hypothesis accounts well for the mistakes made in the eurozone in the aftermath of the global recession , when sovereigns attempted to deleverage while companies and households were unwilling to spend , and the ECB was keeping monetary policy relatively tight . 
The BIS &apos;s explanation reads like a summary of the woes of China , where growth has slowed from 10 % to 7 % or less , but the authorities still push investment amounting to almost half of GDP and promote all sorts of low-return projects . 
So which theory fits the facts better globally ? 
So far , it is odd to claim that advanced countries have stimulated demand excessively . 
Persistently low employment and near-zero aggregate inflation do not suggest that they have erred on the side of profligacy . 
True , financial recklessness remains a risk , but this is why regulatory instruments have been added to the policy toolbox . 
So the BIS &apos;s call for across-the-board monetary normalization is premature ( though this does not mean that reforms should wait ) . 
In the emerging world , however , the mismatch between growth expectations and actual potential has often become a serious issue that demand-side stimulus and endless debt accumulation cannot cure . 
Rather , governments should stop basing their legitimacy on inflated growth prospects .
