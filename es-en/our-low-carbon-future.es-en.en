Our Low-Carbon Future 
LONDON - The United Nations climate change conference , to be held in Copenhagen this December , should provide the climax to two years of international negotiations over a new global treaty aimed at addressing the causes and consequences of greenhouse-gas emissions . 
A global deal on climate change is urgently needed . 
Concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached 435 parts per million ( ppm ) of CO2-equivalent , compared with about 280 ppm before industrialization in the nineteenth century . 
If we continue with business-as-usual emissions from activities such as burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests , concentrations could reach 750 ppm by the end of the century . 
Should that happen , the probable rise in global average temperature relative to pre-industrial times will be 5 ˚ C or more . 
It has been more than 30 million years since the earth &apos;s temperature was that high . 
The human species , which has been around for no more than 200,000 years , would have to deal with a more hostile physical environment than it has ever experienced . 
Floods and droughts would become more intense and global sea levels would be several meters higher , severely disrupting lives and livelihoods , and causing massive population movements and inevitable conflict around the world . 
Some parts of the world would be under water ; other would become deserts . 
Developing countries recognize and are angered by the inequity of the current situation . 
Current greenhouse-gas levels are largely due to industrialization in the developed world since the nineteenth century . 
Yet developing countries are the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change , which threaten the economic growth that is necessary to overcome poverty . 
At the same time , emissions cannot be reduced at the extent required without the central contribution of the developing world . 
Climate change and poverty , the two defining challenges of this century , must be tackled together . 
If we fail on one , we will fail on the other . 
The task facing the world is to meet the environment &apos;s &quot; carbon constraints &quot; while creating the growth necessary to raise living standards for the poor . To avoid the severe risks that would result from a rise in global average temperature of more than 2 ˚ C , we must get atmospheric concentrations below 450 ppm . 
This will require a cut in annual global emissions from about 50 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent today to below 35 gigatonnes in 2030 , and less than 20 gigatonnes by 2050 . 
Today , per-capita annual emissions in the European Union are 12 tonnes , and 23.6 tonnes in the United States , compared to six tons for China and 1.7 tons for India . 
As the projections for 2050 suggest that the world &apos;s population will be about nine billion , annual per-capita emissions must be reduced to approximately two tons of CO2-equivalent , on average , if the global annual total is to be less than 20 gigatonnes . 
Most developed countries are targeting reductions in annual emissions of at least 80 % - relative to levels in 1990 - by 2050 . 
If they are to convince developing countries that the 2050 goal is credible , they must be both ambitious and realistic about the domestic political challenges they face in adopting and implementing demanding targets for 2020 , 2030 , and 2040 . 
Developing countries need substantial help and support from rich nations in order to implement their plans for low-carbon economic growth , and to adapt to the effects of climate change that are now inevitable over the next few decades . 
Developed countries should also provide strong support for measures to halt deforestation in developing countries , and for reducing emissions substantially , quickly , and at reasonable cost . 
Based on recent estimates of the developing world &apos;s extra requests as a result of climate change , rich countries should be providing annual financial support - in addition to existing foreign-aid commitments- of about $ 100 billion for adaptation and $ 100 billion for mitigation by the early 2020 &quot; s . 
Some of the latter can come through carbon market . 
Rich countries must also demonstrate that low-carbon growth is possible by investing in new technologies , which should be shared with developing countries to boost their mitigation efforts . 
We are already seeing extraordinary innovation by the private sector , which will drive the transition towards a low-carbon global economy . 
Investments in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies could also pull the global economy out of its economic slowdown over the next couple of years . 
More importantly , in driving the transition to low-carbon growth , these technologies could create the most dynamic and innovative period in economic history , surpassing that of the introduction of railways , electricity grids , or the internet . 
There is no real alternative . 
High-carbon growth is doomed , crippled by high prices for fossil fuels and killed off by the hostile physical environment that climate change will create . 
Low-carbon growth will be more energy-secure , cleaner , quieter , safer and more bio-diverse . 
We should learn from the financial crisis that if risks are ignored , the eventual consequences are inevitably worse . 
If we do not start to combat the flow of greenhouse-gas emissions now , the stock in the atmosphere will continue to grow , making future action more difficult and costly . 
Other public expenditure can be postponed , but delaying climate-change measures is a high-risk , high-cost option . 
Climate change poses a profound threat to our economic future , while low-carbon growth promises decades of increased prosperity . 
The choice in Copenhagen will be stark , and the stakes could not be higher . 
We know what we must do , and we can do it .
