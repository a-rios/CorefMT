Big Banks &quot; Shadow Dance 
WASHINGTON , DC - One of the great myths propagated by very large financial institutions is that , if they were to become effectively regulated again , many investors and financial transactions would flee to &quot; shadow banks . &quot; 
That sounds bad . 
Anything that lurks in shadows must have nasty intent , potentially dangerous consequences , or both . 
And its very shadowiness implies that nothing can be done about it - whatever is there must be beyond the reach of regulation or effective supervision . 
So perhaps financial-system risk would increase , not decrease , if we regulated very large non-shadow banks properly . 
So much for scary fairytales . 
In reality , there are three kinds of &quot; shadow &quot; activities , all of which are obvious , operate in plain sight , and could be controlled in a straightforward and responsible fashion . 
Whether we have the political will to implement effective controls is , as always , another question - in large part because the big banks are very powerful and they would like the shadows to remain as shadowy as they are now . 
The first set of shadow activities includes those conducted by the banks themselves , for example , as a way to reduce the amount of equity funding that they need . 
The people who run big banks like leverage : More borrowed money ( and less of their own ) means that they get more upside , in the sense of a higher return on capital , unadjusted for risk . 
When things go against them , it also means more losses . 
But that is why it is good to be big - you can get more downside protection from the Federal Reserve or other official sources . 
For example , Citigroup created so-called &quot; special-purpose vehicles &quot; to invest in mortgage-related securities prior to 2007 . 
They funded this activity with a lot of short-term debt and a wafer-thin cushion of equity . 
When the market boomed , such schemes &quot; authors were heralded as geniuses . 
But when house prices fell and mortgage-backed securities ( and derivatives based on them ) became illiquid , Citigroup took the liabilities back onto its balance sheet - and then needed to be rescued through massive , repeated bailouts . 
These shadow activities were the work of Citigroup and other large complex financial institutions that are subject to regulation . 
Their boom-and-bust character reflected nothing more than the relevant regulators &quot; failure - or refusal - to understand the risks involved . 
The regulators were &quot; captured &quot; - meaning that they identified so closely with the intellectual perspective and worldview of large complex financial institutions that they were persuaded to allow something that was actually very dangerous . 
Unfortunately , despite all we have been through in the past five years , these big banks &quot; shadows survive in various forms today - and regulators do not seem sufficiently inclined to turn on the lights . 
The second set of shadow activities involves banking-type activities that really are conducted outside banks . 
The most prominent example is money-market mutual funds . 
These entities take money from investors and buy various kinds of assets , some of which may be risky - like short-maturity corporate debt . 
The problem is that these funds create the impression that anything invested with them is just as safe as a deposit at an insured bank . 
You can write checks on a money-market account , and your monthly statement shows it to have a stable value - just like your bank account . 
In fact , the value of assets held by such funds fluctuates , and it is only an accounting convention - permitted by regulators - that allows them to report a stable value . 
As a result , when the possibility arises that a money-market fund will be unable to pay investors in full - as happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 - all hell breaks loose . 
There were similar fears recently when it became known that US-based money-market funds had lent heavily to European banks . 
And some leading US banks also rely on money-market funding ; here , too , the &quot; shadows &quot; and the banks have aligned interests . 
There is a simple fix to this problem - require money-market funds to show the actual floating value of their assets , so that everyone understands that it is not a fixed number . 
Some US regulators are pushing in this direction . 
Unfortunately , the money-market funds - and their friends in the big banks - are pushing back hard . 
The third set of shadow activities includes those that may yet emerge . 
We should not underestimate the creativity of financiers seeking to escape capital requirements and leverage up . 
A brilliant book by Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig , The Bankers &quot; New Clothes , demonstrates the pervasiveness of this problem and highlights its potentially devastating consequences for the economy . 
The right approach is to search for and prevent excessive systemic risk wherever it manifests itself . 
The US authorities now have a legal mandate to do this . 
But will they be able to stand up to the powerful lobby of big banks and their shadowy allies ?
