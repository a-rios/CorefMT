Why Castro Survives 
In a rehearsal studio , a young Cuban ballet dancer turns through the air , pivoting as though some invisible power has unfurled him in an arc . 
Then , without pause , he leaps once , twice , and I gasp at the height of his grandes jet√©s and then gasp again because his pointed toe is heading right for a barre . 
Welcome to Cuba , a country that dazzles and disappoints , where one finds miracles and monsters , but no easy answers . 
Cubans recognize the contradictions as readily as any outsider . 
Yet even as inflation rises and the 77-year-old dictator tightens Internet access and closes the economic openings that encouraged self-employment in the mid-1990 &apos;s , it is unlikely that Cubans will turn Castro out before he dies . 
The rabidly anti-Castro Cuban exiles clustered in Miami argue that it is fear that holds Cubans back , but that &apos;s not true . 
A visitor in Cuba finds many ready to complain , but the palpable fear and visceral hatred rampant in El Salvador and Chile in the 1980 &apos;s is absent in today &apos;s Cuba . 
Instead there is a kind of paralysis - born of a mix of loyalty , fear , and indoctrination - as they grudgingly wait for Castro to expire . 
Unlike many of Latin America &apos;s freely elected governments , Castro has actually provided his constituents with public services - and without earning a reputation for corruption . 
&quot; All the free education and health care gives a certain balance , &quot; said a prominent writer . 
&quot; Their work is less valuable , &quot; he said referring to the pesos Cubans earn in an economy sustained by dollar remittances from the foreign diaspora . 
So , unlike the East Europeans who overthrew their corrupt political leaders in 1989 , and some Latin Americans who did so more recently in Bolivia , Argentina , and Ecuador , Cubans have failed to rally against Castro . 
Yes , Castro jailed 75 independent journalists and others in an April sweep - that is the monster in him . 
But other dissidents remain free . 
That is the contradiction . 
Moreover , unlike other luxury-loving Latin American leaders , Cuban officials do not flaunt lavish lifestyles . 
Among Latin American countries , only Chile and Uruguay rate better than Cuba in Transparency International &apos;s corruption index . 
Already , the dollar has created a divide in living standards between those who have greenbacks and those who don &apos;t . 
Despite a moribund economy , Castro still delivers what the majority of Latin American residents fail to get - free health care and education and a relatively drug- and crime-free environment . 
With more than 40 % of Latin America &apos;s population living in poverty , Cuba stands out as an example of a country where being poor does not mean a life of squalor . 
Even World Bank president James Wolfensohn acknowledged in 2001 that Cuba had done a &quot; great job &quot; on education and health care . 
More recently , in discussing the Bank &apos;s 2004 report Making Services Work for Poor People , officials put Cuba among countries like Sri Lanka , Costa Rica , and China that &quot; managed to achieve a level of outcomes in health and education that are extremely favorable . &quot; 
This winter , the Cuban government reinvested some of its income from tourism in upgrading schools that deteriorated in the years following the loss of Soviet aid . 
&quot; Cubans are still endeared by that , &quot; said one Western diplomat . 
Amazingly , many Latin America leaders fail to make the connection between reducing poverty and their own popularity . 
Compare Castro &apos;s campaign to improve schools to a poverty reduction program waged by Mexico &apos;s Institutional Revolutionary Party during a six-year period in the 1990 &apos;s . 
Mexico spent 1.2 % of GDP per year to provide basic services to communities in Mexico . 
According to Santa Deverajan , the director of the World Bank &apos;s World Development Report 2004 , some studies showed that the program could have reduced poverty by as much as 64 % . 
Instead , the money was doled out to municipalities based on political loyalty , so poverty fell by only 3 % . 
&quot; If they had just given it out equally to the entire Mexican population , &quot; Deverajan says , &quot; it would have reduced poverty by 13 % . &quot; 
Examples like this abound in Latin America , but it is a mistake for Castro to think that Latin America is the competition . 
Cubans don &apos;t think it is . 
Their touchstones are Madrid , Paris , and New York . 
An educated professional with a wife and two children takes a breath when he recalls a trip to Spain . 
&quot; It &apos;s hard to explain how I felt when I went there . 
It wasn &apos;t like another world or another planet ; it was like another galaxy . &quot; 
With family in Spain , he could immigrate , but he doesn &apos;t consider that option seriously . 
&quot; This is where I want to live , but 5 % of the way things are run has got to change . 
They blame everything on the embargo . 
We have a self-imposed embargo . 
We limit ourselves . &quot; 
More precisely , Castro limits Cubans . 
They want to breathe , but life with a patriarchal tyrant can be suffocating . 
Younger Cubans often sound like well-educated teenagers with parents who are too strict . 
They want to travel , publish what they want , dance when and where they want , and experience the world as Castro experienced it . 
&quot; It &apos;s not my fight , &quot; says one 28-year-old Cuban , referring to the political battle of communism versus capitalism that keeps him trapped on the island . 
&quot; I &apos;m a new generation . 
I want to see as they had the chance to see . &quot;
