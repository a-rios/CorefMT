Europe &apos;s Contested Neighborhood 
BRUSSELS - What is the most important source of disagreement today between Russia and the West ? 
It is not the issues most often in the news - Iran or Afghanistan . 
It is Europe &apos;s contested neighborhood - the future of those countries between the eastern border of NATO and the European Union and the western border of Russia . 
While the West and Russia still talk the talk of cooperative security in Europe , geopolitical competition for influence has been renewed in these regions . 
Russia today openly lays claim to a sphere of interest in its borderlands - in direct contradiction to commitments made under the Helsinki process . 
It has embraced policies and a military doctrine that labels NATO a threat and justifies the right to intervene in these countries . 
While packaged in smooth diplo-speak , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s new proposal for European security has the less-than-hidden goal of stopping and rolling back Western influence . 
Rather than moving into the twenty-first century , Russia seems determined to revert to nineteenth-century strategic thinking . 
With the Obama administration focused on Afghanistan and Iran , the Kremlin hopes that a West in need of its cooperation will acquiesce in its demands . 
And it is not only words . 
Eighteen months ago , a war took place in Europe between Russia and Georgia . 
It was a little war , but one that raised big questions . 
It was not fought over the future status of Georgia &apos;s Russian-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia ( though that source of conflict was a real one ) . 
Instead , the war &apos;s root cause was Georgia &apos;s desire to align itself with the West and Russia &apos;s determination to stop it . 
Many diplomats would prefer to forget the Russo-Georgian war or sweep it under the rug . 
But none of the underlying tensions are resolved . 
There is no stable solution in sight for Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
Russia has not abandoned the goal of breaking Georgia &apos;s desire to go West . 
Instability and separatism are growing in the northern Caucasus , making the broader region more volatile . 
In late January , the Obama administration issued its first unequivocal reaffirmation of the strategy of democratic enlargement that has guided Western thinking since the collapse of the Iron Curtain two decades ago . 
Speaking in Paris , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reminded us that NATO and EU enlargement created an unprecedented degree of stability and security in the eastern half of the continent , that Russia too had benefited from this stability , and that it was critical that Europe &apos;s doors remain open to further enlargement . 
Clinton went on to reject as unnecessary Medvedev &apos;s call to re-make current European security arrangements . 
NATO has also finally started engaging in defense planning and other forms of strategic reassurance for its allies in Central and Eastern Europe , which are unsettled by Russia &apos;s new assertiveness . 
But what about those countries in between - countries like Ukraine and Georgia and the southern Caucasus ? 
Ukraine has just elected as its president Viktor Yanukovych , who is unlikely to pursue a NATO integration agenda , and if follows through on his commitment to join a customs union with Russia , Belarus , and Kazakhstan , membership in the EU would be precluded . 
But that does not mean that tensions with Russia will automatically disappear . 
Yanukovych &apos;s victory notwithstanding , Ukraine is a country that is becoming more European and gradually moving out of Russia &apos;s orbit in its own chaotic way . 
Regardless of whether Georgians like or dislike Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvilli , they want to go West , too . 
So Russia &apos;s attempts to bring these countries to heel are likely to continue and remain a bone of contention and conflict . 
And what is Western policy ? 
In reality , the West today no longer has a grand strategy toward the East . 
The moral and strategic vision of the 1990 &quot; s has exhausted itself and come to a grinding halt after the shock of the Russo-Georgian war and the recent Ukrainian election . 
As welcome as Clinton &apos;s recent clear words were on the need to defend the right of countries to decide their own fate , you don &apos;t have to go very far in Europe to hear whispers that some kind of new &quot; Finlandization &quot; might be a reasonable compromise for countries like Ukraine and Georgia . 
It is time for the West to openly debate what its strategy is - and what it is not . 
Two decades ago , the West rejected &quot; spheres of influence , &quot; because Europe &apos;s bloody history taught us that compelling nations to align themselves with others against their will was wrong and a recipe for future conflict . 
If we still believe that today , we need an updated moral and strategic vision for such countries , and to back it up with a real strategy . 
We need to be clear that Moscow has a right to security , but that it does not have the right to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors , to topple their governments , or to deny them their own foreign-policy aspirations . 
Barack Obama is right to try to reset relations with the Kremlin and engage a revisionist Russia . 
But we need to do so knowing what our strategy is on this key issue . 
As the United States and Russia close in on a new arms-control treaty , it is time to face the question of how we deal with Europe &apos;s contested neighborhood .
