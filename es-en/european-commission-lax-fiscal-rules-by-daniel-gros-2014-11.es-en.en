Europe &apos;s Dog in the Nighttime 
BRUSSELS - The new European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker is off to a rocky start . 
But one would not know it from reading the news headlines . 
As Sherlock Holmes understood , a dog that does not bark in the nighttime usually goes unnoticed . 
In Europe &apos;s case , the European Union &apos;s fiscal rules are at issue , and the Commission - in principle the EU &apos;s watchdog - should bark loudly when they are flouted . 
Last month , howls seemed inevitable after two large EU countries , Italy and France , submitted budget plans for 2015 that clearly violated their governments &quot; vows of continued austerity . 
At first , the Commission dutifully rejected the two budgets as incompatible with the rules of the EU &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) . 
But then something happened that was as &quot; curious &quot; as in Arthur Conan Doyle &apos;s story . 
Within days , both countries offered mini-adjustments to their budgets , worth about 0.2 % of GDP , and their finance ministers wrote to the Commission that their budgets should now be approved . 
The Commission did not react , leaving French and Italian leaders to claim that they , not Brussels bureaucrats , had the last word . 
In fact , the latest forecast reflects an even worse outcome for France and Italy this year than originally promised , with France &apos;s deficit set to increase slightly for 2015 and Italy &apos;s cyclically adjusted deficit expected to deteriorate . 
The Stability and Growth Pact prescribes an annual improvement of at least 0.5 % of GDP . 
The new Commission thus risks losing its authority from the very start of its mandate . 
Whether it does is a crucial question , because maintaining a high degree of credibility is essential to economic policymaking in the eurozone . 
To see why , it is worth recalling that the SGP &apos;s original rules were judged &quot; stupid &quot; by one former Commission president ( Romano Prodi ) , because the single-minded pursuit of a deficit below 3 % of GDP could be inappropriate during recessions . 
That argument was accepted , and the SGP was supposedly rendered more &quot; intelligent &quot; by , for example , permitting budget deficits to be adjusted for the economic cycle , adding medium-term objectives for expenditure , and introducing escape clauses . 
But the new rules obviously require a strong institution to interpret them , and whose judgment is accepted by everybody . 
Though checking whether a budget is below the SGP &apos;s ceiling of 3 % of GDP may be a straightforward matter , there can be reasonable disagreement about whether the business-cycle adjustment should be estimated at 0.5 % or 0.8 % of GDP , or whether a country is adhering to its medium-term expenditure objective . 
The Commission is supposed to have the last word , thereby ensuring the rules &quot; credibility and consistency - and it seems to have lost this fight in the first round . 
One could , of course , argue that the SGP should be scrapped , because austerity makes no sense when the eurozone faces the risk of deflation . 
But the Commission , not fiscally louche member countries , should be the one to decide that . 
The other problem for Europe is a dog that does bark , but for no reason . 
This is the case of the United Kingdom , which has been asked to pay an additional contribution to the EU budget of about € 2 billion ( $ 2.5 billion , which amounts to a rounding error of the UK &apos;s own budget ) . 
The reason for this additional levy is that a few weeks ago the UK &apos;s Office for National Statistics announced , proudly , that it had discovered that the country &apos;s gross national income ( GNI ) had been much higher than previously assumed , not only in 2013 , but also in all previous years . 
Including the revisions for the 2002-2012 period , the difference comes to about £ 350 billion ( $ 560 billion ) . 
Because every EU member state is obliged to contribute about 1 % of its GNI to the Union &apos;s budget , the UK &apos;s data revision had to lead to a back payment of billions of euros . 
But British Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government has declared that it does not intend to pay money that &quot; the European Commission was not expecting and does not need . &quot; 
These two cases - the dog that should have barked but did not , and the dog that barked for no reason - threaten the EU &apos;s fundamental workings , which are based on a clear rulebook enforced vigorously by a strong Commission . 
Juncker &apos;s Commission risks losing its authority from the start if the rules can be bent or broken to accommodate the larger member states &quot; domestic political priorities . 
The Commission must regain political and intellectual leadership and make its choice : either explain why the SGP rules must be followed even now , in the face of deflation , or agree with those who argue that the current environment calls for a fiscal stimulus . 
It cannot avoid taking sides by insisting publicly on austerity rules but then acquiescing when member states break them . 
Leaders in member states have to play their part as well . 
Pandering to populists may be attractive in terms of short-term electoral gains , but the long-term cost in terms of credibility , both their own and that of the EU , will be very high .
