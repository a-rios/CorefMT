Time to Wait on the Euro 
On September 14 , Swedish voters will vote on whether to join the Euro . 
Today , a majority of Swedes appear likely to vote no . 
To advocates of the Euro , this is a mystery . 
Isn &apos;t the Euro a success , as marked by the currency &apos;s increasing strength against the dollar ? 
Why shouldn &apos;t Sweden be part of that success story ? 
No one ever doubted that the Euro would gain acceptance as a currency - in economists &apos; jargon , that the Euro would become an important &quot; medium of exchange , &quot; or even a good &quot; store of value . &quot; 
But currencies are not ends in themselves ; they are means - to stronger , more stable growth . 
Whether the Euro - with its associated institutions , including an independent European Central Bank ( ECB ) which focuses on inflation - is &quot; good &quot; or &quot; bad &quot; should be judged by economic performance - whether it leads to faster , steadier growth . 
Judged on those terms , the best that can be said for the Euro is that the jury remains out . 
The worse that can be said is that the Euro has failed its first test . 
Growth in Euroland since the introduction of the Euro four-and-a-half years ago has been dismal , and immediate prospects look little better . 
Yet the Euro was supposed to enhance growth by lowering interest rates and stimulating investment . 
While it may have done so in a few countries , it has not done so in Europe as a whole . 
So the UK and Sweden are right in questioning whether it will deliver better growth to them . 
Indeed , there is every reason to believe the contrary - that the Euro will lead to slower growth and higher unemployment . 
Of course , the Euro alone is not to be blamed for Europe &apos;s slow growth . 
The weak global economy , including moribund America , is part of the problem . 
But economies are always buffeted by shocks . 
A good monetary system should protect an economy against such shocks . 
Before the Euro was introduced , Euro skeptics worried that in focusing on Europe &apos;s core ( Germany and France ) , the periphery would be disadvantaged . 
For example , if economic growth in the center were strong but smaller countries were showing weaknesses , monetary policy would be determined by the needs of the center . 
Smaller countries would not get the monetary stimulation they needed . 
Few anticipated how events turned out : institutional rigidity prevented the ECB from responding in a timely manner to weaknesses in Europe &apos;s most important economy , Germany . 
Combined with the Stability Pact  -  another case of institutional rigidity that prevents effective use of fiscal policy  -  Europe has unnecessarily slipped into a major slowdown , if not a recession . 
Confidence in the Euro , along with mounting evidence of America &apos;s economic mismanagement , provided an opportunity for Europe to lower interest rates to stimulate growth . 
By focusing narrowly on inflation , the ECB made Europe lose twice : both the lost investment that lower interest rates might have prompted , and the loss of exports and increase in imports that are sure to follow from the Euro &apos;s higher exchange rate . 
Supporters of the Euro point to the success of the US , with its single currency . 
But America &apos;s institutional structure differs markedly from Europe . 
Labor mobility is an important part of the adjustment mechanism in the US . 
In the early and mid-1990 &apos;s , when vast cutbacks in defense expenditure led to unemployment rates in excess of 10 % in California , many Californians migrated to other parts of the country where jobs where easier to find . 
Moreover , the federal government could boost California &apos;s economy by re-directing its expenditures to that state . 
While cross country labor mobility in Europe is higher nowadays , language and cultural barriers mean that mobility is far lower than in the US . 
Apart from the Common Agricultural Policy , expenditures at the European level are meager . 
Finally , America has steadfastly refused to tie its hands in the way that Europe has . 
A balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution was rejected , as were attempts to change the Federal Reserve &apos;s charter , which mandates that it focus on employment and growth , as well as inflation . 
International exchange rate markets can be volatile , and this uncertainty translates into higher effective borrowing costs . 
But such risks are far less important for countries with sound economic management and low levels of indebtedness . 
Furthermore , modern techniques of dynamic hedging have improved the capacity to manage these risks . 
It is not destabilizing speculation that poses the biggest threat to Sweden today , but rather poor monetary management - including an excessive focus on inflation in the manner of the ECB . 
For economies with a strong track record , such as Sweden and the UK , joining the Euro offers little to gain and much to lose - at least for now . 
Today , the Stability Pact appears frayed . 
Large economies , like Germany and France , extract forbearance when they breach the Pact &apos;s deficit ceiling . 
But small countries , like Portugal , do not . 
The ECB is unlikely to pay serious attention to Sweden &apos;s specific needs , so Sweden will probably not be given the wiggle room granted its larger neighbors . 
Euro membership may become more attractive in the future . 
The institutional framework responsible for Euroland &apos;s poor economic performance may improve , or capital markets may become more volatile , making the cost of bearing exchange rate risks intolerable . 
But matters within Euroland may also worsen : the Stability Pact , with its de facto separate rules for large and small countries , will almost certainly be replaced . 
But with what ? 
Uncertainty about the future direction of economic policy may lead to higher than necessary interest rates in Euroland - and thus slower growth . 
When uncertainties about the direction of institutional change within Euroland are settled , decisions about joining the Euro can be made . 
For now , Britain &apos;s decision to postpone Euro membership makes sense . 
Swedish voters seem likely to show similar wisdom .
