The Global Home 
Homes are the most local of investments , rooted to a particular place like a tree , and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions . 
The whole world flashes by on our television screens , but the market for our homes , which is comprised almost entirely of local amateurs , remains grounded right there in our own backyard . 
Soon , however , this could all change . 
Within a month , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , in collaboration with my company , MacroMarkets , as well as Fiserv and Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , will launch futures and options contracts on home prices in ten cities in the United States . 
The contracts will be settled on the S &amp; P / Case-Shiller Home Price Indices , which developed out of academic work that my colleague Karl Case and I pioneered almost twenty years ago . 
For many years we have been campaigning for housing futures , but no exchange wanted to use such indices to create a futures market until now . 
The futures markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest in US homes indirectly , by buying interests in them through these markets . 
An investor in Paris , Rio de Janeiro , or Tokyo will be able to invest in owner-occupied homes in New York , Los Angeles , and Las Vegas . 
A fundamental principle of financial theory - &quot; diversification &quot; or &quot; risk spreading &quot; - implies that interest in the new contracts will be high . 
People and businesses in New York , for example , are overexposed to their local real estate risks , so they should reduce this risk by selling New York home price futures . 
People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right . 
The New Yorkers still live in their own homes , but now they have spread their investment risk worldwide . 
A genuine futures market on single-family homes has not been attempted since 1991 when the London Futures and Options Exchange ( now merged into Euronext.liffe ) failed in its effort to launch such a market in Britain . 
That attempt never generated much trading volume . 
The Exchange threw a party and no one came . 
British spread-betting markets for home prices , and some retail online markets , have never amounted to much either . 
Will it be different this time ? 
To be sure , starting a new market is always an uncertain proposition : people want to go to parties only if a lot of other people are there ; if no one is there , no one wants to come . 
Likewise , in markets without many investors , not enough trades can be executed to generate the returns needed to attract them . 
As is often true of great parties , it can be a bit of a mystery how substantial new markets get started , but we know that it does happen from time to time . 
Initial indications suggest growing interest in futures trading for home prices , particularly as so much talk about the &quot; housing bubble &quot; underscores the importance of diversifying risk . 
After the CME &apos;s announcement , one of its competitors , the Chicago Board Options Exchange , said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions , to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors . 
But , aside from strong public interest in investing in housing and in hedging housing risks , another critical issue must be resolved if futures markets are to succeed : prices must be revealed , and investors must understand what these prices mean . 
I believe there is a very good chance that many of these futures markets will soon be predicting substantial price declines in some US cities over the next year . 
They will be in what traders call &quot; backwardation &quot; : the future price in the market today is lower than the price of a home today . 
Maybe backwardation won &apos;t appear on the first day that housing futures are traded , but there is a good chance it will come within a matter of months . 
We may need backwardation in some of these markets if they are to fulfill their function . 
Everyone knows that there has been a huge real estate boom in many of these cities ( and elsewhere in the world ) in recent years . 
International investors are not likely to want to invest in these cities unless expectations of a price decline are built into the futures markets , as people in Tokyo understand from their own bitter experience . 
But if backwardation is strong enough , even investors who think that the US housing market is headed for a fall will still be able to expect a good return from home price futures , because they are already getting a discounted price in the futures market . 
Nevertheless , it will require some adjustment for New Yorkers seeking to hedge their own real estate investments to sell futures contracts that have a built-in price decline . 
They will have to get used to the idea that the market already expects the decline , and that they can protect themselves only for that margin of possible future price declines that exceed this expectation . 
In fact , such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices . 
Until now , the future course of real estate prices has been merely a matter of diverse opinion . 
When markets create an international consensus on the future price of homes in cities around the world , we will be better able to manage the risks facing these cities , thereby stabilizing their economies - and our own lives .
