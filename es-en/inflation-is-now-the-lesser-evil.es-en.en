Inflation is Now the Lesser Evil 
CAMBRIDGE - It is time for the world &apos;s major central banks to acknowledge that a sudden burst of moderate inflation would be extremely helpful in unwinding today &apos;s epic debt morass . 
Yes , inflation is an unfair way of effectively writing down all non-indexed debts in the economy . 
Price inflation forces creditors to accept repayment in debased currency . 
Yes , in principle , there should be a way to fix the ills of the financial system without resort to inflation . 
Unfortunately , the closer one examines the alternatives , including capital injections for banks and direct help for home mortgage holders , the clearer it becomes that inflation would be a help , not a hindrance . 
Modern finance has succeeded in creating a default dynamic of such stupefying complexity that it defies standard approaches to debt workouts . 
Securitization , structured finance , and other innovations have so interwoven the financial system &apos;s various players that it is essentially impossible to restructure one financial institution at a time . 
System-wide solutions are needed . 
Moderate inflation in the short run - say , 6 % for two years - would not clear the books . 
But it would significantly ameliorate the problems , making other steps less costly and more effective . 
True , once the inflation genie is let out of the bottle , it could take several years to put it back in . 
No one wants to relive the anti-inflation fights of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . But right now , the global economy is teetering on the precipice of disaster . 
We already have a full-blown global recession . 
Unless governments get ahead of the problem , we risk a severe worldwide downturn unlike anything we have seen since the 1930 &quot; s . 
The necessary policy actions involve aggressive macroeconomic stimulus . 
Fiscal policy should ideally focus on tax cuts and infrastructure spending . 
Central banks are already cutting interest rates left and right . 
Policy interest rates around the world are likely to head toward zero ; the United States and Japan are already there . 
The United Kingdom and the euro zone will eventually decide to go most of the way . 
Steps must also be taken to recapitalize and re-regulate the financial system . 
Huge risks will remain as long as the financial system remains on government respirators , as is effectively the case in the US , UK , the euro zone , and many other countries today . 
Most of the world &apos;s largest banks are essentially insolvent , and depend on continuing government aid and loans to keep them afloat . 
Many banks have already acknowledged their open-ended losses in residential mortgages . 
As the recession deepens , however , bank balance sheets will be hammered further by a wave of defaults in commercial real estate , credit cards , private equity , and hedge funds . 
As governments try to avoid outright nationalization of banks , they will find themselves being forced to carry out second and third recapitalizations . 
Even the extravagant bailout of financial giant Citigroup , in which the US government has poured in $ 45 billion of capital and backstopped losses on over $ 300 billion in bad loans , may ultimately prove inadequate . 
When one looks across the landscape of remaining problems , including the multi-trillion-dollar credit default swap market , it is clear that the hole in the financial system is too big to be filled entirely by taxpayer dollars . 
Certainly , a key part of the solution is to allow more banks to fail , ensuring that depositors are paid off in full , but not necessarily debt holders . 
But this route is going to be costly and painful . 
That brings us back to the inflation option . 
In addition to tempering debt problems , a short burst of moderate inflation would reduce the real ( inflation-adjusted ) value of residential real estate , making it easier for that market to stabilize . 
Absent significant inflation , nominal house prices probably need to fall another 15 % in the US , and more in Spain , the UK , and many other countries . 
If inflation rises , nominal house prices don &apos;t need to fall as much . 
Of course , given the ongoing recession , it may not be so easy for central banks to achieve any inflation at all right now . 
Indeed , it seems like avoiding sustained deflation , or falling prices , is all they can manage . 
Fortunately , creating inflation is not rocket science . 
All central banks need to do is to keep printing money to buy up government debt . 
The main risk is that inflation could overshoot , landing at 20 or 30 % instead of 5-6 % . 
Indeed , fear of overshooting paralyzed the Bank of Japan for a decade . 
But this problem is easily negotiated . 
With good communication policy , inflation expectations can be contained , and inflation can be brought down as quickly as necessary . 
It will take every tool in the box to fix today &apos;s once-in-a-century financial crisis . 
Fear of inflation , when viewed in the context of a possible global depression , is like worrying about getting the measles when one is in danger of getting the plague .
