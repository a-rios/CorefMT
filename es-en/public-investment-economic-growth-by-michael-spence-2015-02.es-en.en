Why Public Investment ? 
MILAN - The world is facing the prospect of an extended period of weak economic growth . 
But risk is not fate : The best way to avoid such an outcome is to figure out how to channel large pools of savings into productivity-enhancing public-sector investment . 
Productivity gains are vital to long-term growth , because they typically translate into higher incomes , in turn boosting demand . 
That process takes time , of course - especially if , say , the initial recipients of increased income already have a high savings rate . 
The danger lies in debt-fueled investment that shifts future demand to the present , without stimulating productivity growth . 
This approach inevitably leads to a growth slowdown , possibly even triggering a financial crisis like the one that recently shook the United States and Europe . 
Such crises cause major negative demand shocks , as excess debt and falling asset prices damage balance sheets , which then require increased savings to heal - a combination that is lethal to growth . 
If the crisis occurs in a systemically important economy - such as the US or Europe ( emerging economies &apos; two largest external markets ) - the result is a global shortage of aggregate demand . 
And , indeed , severe demand constraints are a key feature of today &apos;s global economic environment . 
Though the US is finally emerging from an extended period in which potential output exceeded demand , high unemployment continues to suppress demand in Europe . 
One of the main casualties is the tradable sector in China , where domestic demand remains inadequate to cover the shortfall and prevent a slowdown in GDP growth . 
Another notable trend is that individual economies are recovering from the recent demand shocks at varying rates , with the more flexible and dynamic economies of the US and China performing better than their counterparts in the advanced and emerging worlds . 
Excessive regulation of Japan &apos;s non-tradable sector has constrained GDP growth for years , while structural rigidities in Europe &apos;s economies impede adaptation to technological advances and global market forces . 
Reforms aimed at increasing an economy &apos;s flexibility are always hard - and even more so at a time of weak growth - because they require eliminating protections for vested interests in the short term for the sake of greater long-term prosperity . 
Given this , finding ways to boost demand is key to facilitating structural reform in the relevant economies . 
That brings us to the third factor behind the global economy &apos;s anemic performance : underinvestment , particularly by the public sector . 
In the US , infrastructure investment remains suboptimal , and investment in the economy &apos;s knowledge and technology base is declining , partly because the pressure to remain ahead in these areas has waned since the Cold War ended . 
Europe , for its part , is constrained by excessive public debt and weak fiscal positions . 
In the emerging world , India and Brazil are just two examples of economies where inadequate investment has kept growth below potential ( though that may be changing in India ) . 
The notable exception is China , which has maintained high ( and occasionally perhaps excessive ) levels of public investment throughout the post-crisis period . 
Properly targeted public investment can do much to boost economic performance , generating aggregate demand quickly , fueling productivity growth by improving human capital , encouraging technological innovation , and spurring private-sector investment by increasing returns . 
Though public investment cannot fix a large demand shortfall overnight , it can accelerate the recovery and establish more sustainable growth patterns . 
The problem is that unconventional monetary policies in some major economies have created a low-yield environment , leaving investors somewhat desperate for high-yield options . 
Many pension funds are underwater , because the returns required to meet their longer-term liabilities seem unattainable . 
Meanwhile , capital is accumulating on high-net-worth balance sheets and in sovereign-wealth funds . 
Though monetary stimulus is important to facilitate deleveraging , prevent financial-system dysfunction , and bolster investor confidence , it cannot place an economy on a sustainable growth path alone - a point that central bankers themselves have repeatedly emphasized . 
Structural reforms , together with increased investment , are also needed . 
Given the extent to which insufficient demand is constraining growth , investment should come first . 
Faced with tight fiscal ( and political ) constraints , policymakers should abandon the flawed notion that investments with broad - and , to some extent , non-appropriable - public benefits must be financed entirely with public funds . 
Instead , they should establish intermediation channels for long-term financing . 
At the same time , this approach means that policymakers must find ways to ensure that public investments provide returns for private investors . 
Fortunately , there are existing models , such as those applied to ports , roads , and rail systems , as well as the royalties system for intellectual property . 
Such efforts should not be constrained by national borders . 
Given that roughly one-third of output in advanced economies is tradable - a share that will only increase , as technological advances enable more services to be traded - the benefits of a program to channel savings into public investment would spill over to other economies . 
That is why the G-20 should work to encourage public investment within member countries , while international financial institutions , development banks , and national governments should seek to channel private capital toward public investment , with appropriate returns . 
With such an approach , the global economy &apos;s &quot; new normal &quot; could shift from its current mediocre trajectory to one of strong and sustainable growth .
