France Ã  la Sarkozy 
Eight months into his presidency , is Nicolas Sarkozy delivering the &quot; rupture &quot; from 30 years of French immobility that he promised ? 
Dubbed the &quot; hyper-president &quot; by bewildered media , he has launched a vast number of reforms , many of which were once considered political suicide . 
He has targeted many areas - including universities , the judiciary , foreign policy , immigration , taxation , and the environment - but it is the economy that will prove to be the make-or-break issue . 
Sarkozy &apos;s slogan &quot; work more to earn more &quot; has won him considerable support . 
The crucial test will be his ability to reform the labor market , whose rigidities are widely seen as the main cause of France &apos;s relatively poor economic performance , with an unemployment rate that has never dipped below 8 % over the last 25 years . 
While the government has begun many projects , with few exceptions , including tax breaks for the wealthy , most are still in the making . 
The most important concern public employment , pensions , labor legislation , and the length of the workweek , all of which generate fierce resistance . 
The main reason for the slow pace - noting that previous presidents had no pace at all - is a 2005 law that requires that all measures affecting the labor market first be negotiated in good faith with the trade unions . 
Naturally , the unions impede negotiations as much as possible . 
As a result , France is likely soon to surpass Sweden as the world &apos;s highest public spender . 
All French finance ministers lament that they had very little room for cutting costs , given the scope of entitlements , particularly civil servants &quot; salaries and pensions . 
With half of all current civil servants set to retire over the next ten years , Sarkozy has pledged to replace only one of every two . 
In 2007 , the attrition rate was one out of three - short of the pledge , but a sharp reversal from previous decades , in which the ranks of civil servants grew significantly faster than private-sector employment . 
Sarkozy believes that he has a popular mandate to push his labor-market reforms through parliament , where he controls a large majority . 
By contrast , the unions argue that they have &quot; social legitimacy , &quot; a claim that may surprise many outside France , but that holds considerable sway in a country where large-scale demonstrations or drawn-out strikes are interpreted as a valid representation of popular will . 
From the outset , both sides expected a defining fight , which occurred last November , after the government decided to align the retirement age in the public sector with that of the private sector . 
When President Jacques Chirac &apos;s first government attempted such a reform in 1995 , railroad workers , who can retire at age 50 or 55 , spearheaded the resistance . 
After nearly three weeks of complete stoppage of trains , the government caved in , and soon thereafter lost a general election . 
The 1995 strike became an icon of &quot; social legitimacy , &quot; instilling fear in all succeeding governments . 
But this time around , the unions caved in after nine days , largely because the reform had been explained and promised to the public during the presidential campaign . 
Democratic legitimacy won a major battle over social legitimacy . 
This opens the way to more and deeper reforms . 
A law restricting transport strikes took effect on January 1 , and Sarkozy intends to break the 35-hour workweek , albeit indirectly . 
Instead of repealing the law , overtime work is to become easy and relatively cheap . 
He is also preparing to raise the retirement age to 61 , from 60 . 
Even more provocative are the next steps : a plan to revamp the standard work contract and to require that all workers be invited to vote after eight days of a strike . 
Indeed , probably the most fundamental measure is to transform radically the way trade unions operate . 
Their role is currently codified by a post-1945 law that gives them enormous influence , even though their membership has dwindled to a mere 8 % of employees . 
The plan , yet to be fully articulated , is to make them accountable to all workers , not just to their membership - another way of promoting democratic legitimacy , but this time at the heart of the social system . 
One reason why Sarkozy could succeed where previous governments have never dreamt to venture , aside from his popular mandate for reform , is a &quot; win-win &quot; strategy , whereby victory for reform implies substantial compensation . 
For example , Sarkozy has promised that half of the savings from the reduction in public employment will go to higher pay - possibly based on merit , another red line for the trade unions . 
But Sarkozy is not quite turning France , long a country hostile to supply-side reform , into what many would consider a normal economy . 
While he has the right instincts concerning labor markets , he is very French on other issues . 
He is a staunch advocate of industrial policies , which will lead him into sharp confrontation with the European Commission and many of his colleagues . 
He also harbors a deep distrust of financial markets and often advocates more regulation , and sees the strong euro as a threat to French industry and the result of speculation , which has already provoked serious clashes with the European Central Bank . 
On all these issues , much of the decision-making power has been transferred to the European Union , which dramatically reduces Sarkozy &apos;s room for maneuver . 
But France will hold the EU &apos;s rotating presidency in the second half of 2008 . 
Nobody &apos;s perfect , least of all Sarkozy , so we should expect some infuriating initiatives .
