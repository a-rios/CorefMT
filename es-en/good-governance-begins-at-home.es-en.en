Good Governance Begins At Home 
The whole sorry Wolfowitz affair looks like it is finally drawing to a close . 
It is hard to believe that he will stay on much longer at the World Bank , and it is time to start thinking more closely about the future of that institution . 
From the first , I was critical of the way he was chosen because I have long opposed the &quot; old boy &quot; agreement between the United States and Europe , by which the US always appoints the head of the World Bank and Europe the head of the IMF . 
This unspoken arrangement dates from the founding of the Bretton Woods institution at a time when colonialism was still alive , and makes no sense in the twenty-first century . 
There are reports that European leaders have told the US that if they get Wolfowitz to step down quickly and quietly , they will be allowed to choose Wolfowitz &apos;s successor . 
It &apos;s easy to see why the US and Europe want to stick to business as usual , but such a deal would amount to a wasted opportunity . 
I can think of no better way to restore confidence in these two venerable institutions than to finally open up the way their presidents are selected . 
One of the lessons of the Wolfowitz debacle is that it does actually matter how stakeholders and employees feel about the Bank &apos;s leadership . 
The world was prejudiced against him from the start because of his involvement in the Iraq War . 
But people were willing to give him a chance . 
Some said that perhaps he would be another Robert McNamara , the US defense secretary who helped mire America in the Vietnam War , but used his service to the Bank as penance . 
At first , there was reason for hope : Wolfowitz was forceful in arguing for debt forgiveness and an end to agricultural subsidies . 
But he also hired old friends and political allies - many of whom did not have experience in development - and sealed himself off from his staff , alienating the very people whose support he needed . 
As we learned from the case of Larry Summers at Harvard , relationships inside institutions ( not just with donors and funders ) matter . 
In this respect , Wolfowitz , while by all accounts an intelligent and pleasant person , did not do himself any favors . 
Worse , Wolfowitz did not seem to have a grand vision for the Bank . 
Instead of a development strategy , there was simply an expansion of the anti-corruption agenda initiated by his predecessor , James Wolfensohn . 
As the World Bank &apos;s Chief Economist under Wolfensohn , I had argued that failing to deal with corruption risked undermining growth and poverty alleviation . 
By the time I left the Bank , these ideas were widely accepted , and I was pleased that Wolfowitz supported continuing the Bank &apos;s efforts . 
But the fight against corruption was always to be only one part of a more comprehensive development agenda that was required . 
Indeed , aid effectiveness could be undermined just as much by incompetence as by corruption . 
Sadly , the anti corruption agenda of the Bank became politicized . 
There was a push to give money to Iraq - a country rife with corruption - while other countries were accused of corruption without adequate hard evidence or specific details . 
And here , too , an opportunity was lost . 
The aims of the campaign were laudable , but it generated hostility and ill will , undermining its effectiveness . 
The World Bank , in its efforts to support democracy and good governance , must insist on the highest standards of due process : charges of corruption should be treated seriously , and the evidence turned over to national authorities for use in open , transparent , and independent proceedings . 
This is something for Wolfowitz &apos;s successor to bear in mind . 
If anti-corruption campaigns are to be seen as effective , they must be fair and transparent . 
The same is true of the selection of the World Bank &apos;s president . 
There is still a chance to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat . 
What has been a sad and sorry saga could have a happy ending if Wolfowitz &apos;s successor is chosen in an open , transparent process . 
This , one hopes , is the silver lining in the cloud now hanging over the World Bank .
