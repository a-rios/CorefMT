­ A New European Growth Agenda 
BRUSSELS - Austerity alone cannot solve Europe &apos;s economic and financial crisis . 
Growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal . 
European Union leaders now recognize this : kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council &apos;s meeting on January 30 . 
But the big question remains : How ? 
The need for immediate action is clear . 
The eurozone &apos;s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011 ; even Germany &apos;s shrank . 
The new year is looking grim . 
France is flat-lining ( as is Britain ) . 
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession . 
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump . 
And eurozone unemployment is at record highs , with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece . 
The economic headwinds are formidable : fiscal austerity , high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries , credit cutting by banks , deleveraging households , weak private-sector investment , and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand . 
Until growth resumes , any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile . 
Recession will hit banks &quot; and governments &quot; already-weak balance sheets , increasing pressure for faster deleveraging . 
But , while gradual adjustment is essential , faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating : big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown - and thus a vicious downward spiral . 
A big new push for growth is therefore vital . 
So far , the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms , which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility . 
The crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries ; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately ( one exception is permitting shops to open longer ) . 
On the contrary , a shakeout of less productive jobs , for example , would at first raise unemployment , increase government outlays , and reduce private spending . 
And , because demand is depressed , credit is in short supply , and barriers to enterprise are often high , it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs . 
In short , structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012 . 
Instead , the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit - such as France , Italy , and Spain ( and the United Kingdom ) - and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands . 
The European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks ; now it needs to support the real economy , too . 
While official interest rates are only 1 % , solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5 % to borrow for ten years , while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates , if at all . 
So the ECB should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy ; the European Banking Authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9 % ratio ; and , where necessary , national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses . 
While improving access to finance is vital , governments also need to do more to boost investment . 
They should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business , lift barriers to venture capital , and introduce temporary 100 % capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment . 
At the EU level , the ( callable ) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased , as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September , so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment , notably in infrastructure . 
Boosting exports is also essential . 
Deficit countries need to become more competitive , increasing productivity while cutting costs . 
A more competitive currency would be welcome : just as the sterling &apos;s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports , a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports . 
A fiscal devaluation - slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT - would also help . 
Surplus countries , too , must do their part , which is in their own interest . 
Just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise , so Germany - whose current-account surplus exceeds China &apos;s both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms - needs a higher real exchange rate . 
That means that Germans need to earn higher wages , commensurate with their increased productivity , so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays . 
If businesses will not oblige , an income-tax cut would do the trick . 
That brings us to fiscal policy . 
Governments that cannot borrow cheaply ( or at all ) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts . 
But they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity . 
So they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure , while cutting subsidies and transfer payments . 
They should also legislate now for future reforms , notably to encourage people to work longer . 
Last but not least , governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates - 0 % in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany - must play their role in supporting demand . 
Would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year ?
