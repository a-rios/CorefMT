Rethinking Fortress Europe 
LONDON - There is something rotten about the European Union &apos;s debate on migration . 
The continent &apos;s political leaders , paralyzed by the rise of anti-immigrant populism , are turning their backs on desperately vulnerable people fleeing war , human-rights abuses , and economic collapse . 
Nowhere is the human cost of European policies more visible than in the Mediterranean Sea . 
The waters between Europe and Africa are the world &apos;s deadliest migration route . 
Roughly 300,000 people are estimated to have made the crossing in 2014 - more than twice as many as in 2013 . 
Some 3,000 died from drowning , hunger , exposure , or asphyxiation . 
Most migrants set out from Libya , which has emerged as the center of a multi-million-dollar human-trafficking industry . 
Until recently , most migrants setting out for Italy made the crossing on small vessels . 
But , in a new twist , Italian authorities at the beginning of this year rescued hundreds of migrants , including pregnant women and dozens of children , aboard an aging steel-hulled freighter . 
The crew had jumped ship . 
Given its close proximity to a deadly conflict in Syria and countries marked by extreme poverty , human-rights abuses , and weak or collapsed states and economies , the EU is inevitably a magnet for migrants and asylum-seekers . 
That is why it needs a migration policy that reflects the values on which it was founded . 
Unfortunately , respect for human life has taken a back seat to baser political calculations . 
Consider Europe &apos;s approach to search and rescue operations . 
Last November , Italy suspended its Mare Nostrum rescue operation ( which it launched in 2013 , after more than 300 migrants drowned off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa ) , because other EU member states refused to share the costs - some € 9 million ( $ 10.6 million ) a month . 
In its place , the EU border agency , Frontex , has begun conducting a limited coastal mission called Operation Triton . 
Why the reluctance to share the cost of humanitarian rescue operations ? 
Senior ministers in the United Kingdom and other northern European countries , relying on little more than armchair behavioral economics , argued that Mare Nostrum encouraged more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing . 
In other words , allowing children to drown is a legitimate deterrent . 
Back in the real world , the desperation and aspiration driving people to flee outweigh the risks posed by the crossing - meaning that the closure of Mare Nostrum will do nothing to reduce the number of people attempting the journey to Europe . 
But Europe &apos;s debate on migration is so toxic that the forces actually causing people to move are seldom discussed . 
According to Frontex , roughly a quarter of the migrants who crossed the Mediterranean in 2014 were Syrian families escaping the civil war there . 
Young Eritreans - fleeing a country that imposes indefinite military conscription on dissidents - made up another quarter . 
Many others came from poor , violence-prone countries : Palestine , Somalia , Sudan , Mali , and Nigeria . 
Faced with a humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean , the EU has responded by trying to build a fortress . 
It has invested heavily in a fenced border between Turkey and Greece . 
Amnesty International has documented the widespread practice of pushing back migrants and refugees attempting to cross into Greece and Bulgaria - a practice that contravenes international law . 
But the fortress has merely rechanneled , rather than stemmed , the flow of people , forcing migrants and refugees to attempt dangerous sea crossings - even as search and rescue operations are being scaled back . 
The only beneficiaries are the human traffickers that charge Syrian refugees some € 6,000 for space in a dangerous boat or freighter . 
The EU &apos;s efforts to develop a coherent approach to the crisis have bordered on farce . 
What drives people to Europe is a complex set of forces , ranging from conflict and political persecution to poverty and economic pressures . 
Europe &apos;s institutional response is to view all migration as a border-management issue . 
The EU Commission &apos;s various departments - notably , those that focus on development - are barely consulted . 
Meanwhile , the patchwork of national asylum and migration policies makes a cohesive framework impossible to devise . 
This challenge was reflected in the EU foreign ministers &quot; recent declaration on migration , which was so vague that it defied practical interpretation . 
Correcting these policy failures is made more difficult by the rise of populist political forces . 
The National Front in France , the United Kingdom Independence Party , and far-right anti-immigration parties in Sweden , Denmark , and Italy are picking up votes and shutting down informed public debate on a tough policy question that has no easy answers . 
Europe desperately needs to have a mature , fact-based conversation about migration . 
Strict border controls can never be more than one part of the solution to the EU &apos;s migration challenge . 
The crises in Syria , Iraq , and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa are likely to lead to yet more dislocation . 
Higher fences , more vigilant surveillance , and increased policing will not be enough to address the increase in migration that is almost certain to result . 
Instead , acting on the EU &apos;s founding values , member states should co-finance a search and rescue operation along the lines of Mare Nostrum ; strengthen their efforts to protect the rights of refugees ; and share the burden of granting asylum . 
Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Sweden took in 70 % of those granted refugee status in the EU last year . 
Others - notably Spain - need to do more . 
Wider responses are also needed . 
For example , more coherent and generous approaches to the provision of temporary work visas would benefit both migrants and Europeans . 
And EU member states could use their aid budgets to provide greater support for the Syrian refugees living in dire circumstances in neighboring countries . 
The lesson of the migration crisis in the Mediterranean is clear : Fortress Europe is not working . 
The EU must map out a new approach .
