Food or Fuel ? 
When United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon recently visited Antarctica , he was impressed by the melting ice he saw there . 
Then he was in Brazil , where he was impressed by the country &apos;s use of bio-fuel to power a quarter of its automotive traffic . 
Oil pressed from rapeseed can be used as diesel fuel , and maize or sugar beets can yield ethanol to replace gasoline . 
The UN and many countries officially share the view that bio-fuel is one option in fighting climate change . 
The United States generously subsidizes production of ethanol from maize , with output there currently growing 12 % annually and almost 10 % worldwide . 
EU countries subsidized bio-fuels production with â‚¬ 3.7 billion in 2006 , and intend to cover 8 % of their motor fuels from biological sources by 2015 and 20 % by 2020 . 
The Kyoto Protocol allows countries to meet their target reductions of CO2 emissions by substituting bio-fuels for fossil fuels . 
But is it really a wise and ethically acceptable strategy to burn food rather than eat it ? 
If we allow food to be used to produce bio-fuels , food prices will be linked to the oil price , as the head of the German farmers association happily announced . 
Indeed , food prices are currently increasing in Europe , because more and more farmland is being used for bio-fuels instead of for food production . 
This is not sustainable . 
The so-called tortilla crisis , which led to protests in Mexico City in January , foreshadows what we can expect . 
The price of maize , half of which is imported from the US , more than doubled in a year , primarily because of production of bio-ethanol . 
Mexico tried to solve the problem by imposing a state-administered price ceiling for maize tortillas , combined with duty-free maize imports . 
The problem is that advocates of reducing the greenhouse effect by promoting bio-fuels production have not made clear where the land will come from . 
In principle , there are only three ways to procure it : by withdrawing it from food or fodder production , from the production of natural materials - particularly wood - or from nature . 
The perversity of the first alternative is obvious : there is no surplus food production in the world . 
Whoever wishes to grow bio-fuels on land that was previously used for food production must recognize that this would increase food prices , harming the poorest of the poor . 
Similarly , to cultivate bio-fuels on land that would otherwise be used to produce sustainable construction materials would drive up the prices of these materials and encourage their substitution by non-sustainable materials like concrete and steel . 
This may be unobjectionable on ethical and social-policy grounds , but it certainly would not help the environment . 
Wood stores carbon , owing to photosynthesis . 
The larger the stocks of wood on earth , in the form of living trees or wooden construction material in buildings , the less CO2 there is in the atmosphere and the cooler the earth remains . 
So , taking land for the production of bio-fuels from forests means speeding up global warming , because bio-fuel crops store much less carbon than trees . 
To be sure , in addition to the negative storage effect , there might be a positive effect on the world climate insofar as bio-fuels may replace fossil fuels for combustion processes . 
But this assumes that the oil sheikhs will extract less oil because there is more bio-fuel . 
If they don &apos;t , the positive effect will vanish . 
World market prices of fossil fuels will simply be lower than they otherwise would be such that total consumption of fossil and bio-fuels rises by the extra production of bio-fuel . 
The remaining alternative is to use land that has not previously been used commercially . 
But such land is usually wooded . 
The substitution of forests by maize , rape , and other oilseed cultivation reduces the stock of biomass and likewise leads to an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere . 
Brazil has cleared huge areas of its jungle in order to produce the bio-ethanol that impressed the Secretary General . 
By doing so , the country has done a great disservice to the cause of fighting climate change . 
Indeed , every year , the world loses forest area the size of Ireland . 
The effect on the atmosphere is equivalent to 18 % of annual CO2 emissions , more than from the world &apos;s entire transport sector . 
Deforestation must be reversed , not accelerated . 
It makes no sense to use land in whatever form to produce bio fuels . 
Only producing bio-fuels without the use of additional land is justifiable in terms of environmental and social policy . 
This would mean using agricultural and other waste , which would otherwise rot and produce nearly equal amounts of CO2 and methane , an even more dangerous greenhouse gas . 
That option should be supported . 
But official encouragement of production of bio-fuels on land that would have been used for other purposes must stop .
