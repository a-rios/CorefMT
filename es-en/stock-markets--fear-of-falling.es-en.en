Stock Markets &quot; Fear of Falling 
The sharp drop in the world &apos;s stock markets on August 9 , after BNP Paribas announced that it would freeze three of its funds , is just one more example of the markets &quot; recent downward instability or asymmetry . 
That is , the markets have been more vulnerable to sudden large drops than they have been to sudden large increases . 
Daily stock price changes for the 100-business-day period ending August 3 were unusually negatively skewed in Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Japan , Korea , Mexico , the United States and the United Kingdom . 
In the US , for example , the Standard and Poor &apos;s 500 index in July recorded six days of declines and only three days of increases amounting to more than 1 % . 
In June , the index dropped more than 1 % on four days , and gained more than 1 % on two days . 
Going back further , there was a gigantic one-day drop on February 27 , 2007 , of 3.5 % , and no sharp rebound . 
The February 27 decline began with an 8.8 % one-day drop in the Shanghai Composite , following news that the Chinese government might tax capital gains more aggressively . 
This news should have been relevant only to China , but the drop there fueled declines worldwide . 
For example , the Bovespa in Brazil fell 6.6 % on February 27 , and the BSE 30 in India fell 4 % the next day . 
The subsequent recovery was slow and incremental . 
In the US , the skew has been so negative only three other times since 1960 : at the time of the 6.7 % drop on May 28 , 1962 , the record-shattering 20.5 % plummet on October 19 , 1987 , and the 6.1 % decline on October 13 , 1989 . 
Stock markets &quot; unusually negative skew is not inconsistent with booming price growth in recent years . 
The markets have broken all-time records , come close to doing so , or at least done very well since 2003 ( the case in Japan ) by making up for the big drops incrementally , in a succession of smaller increases . 
Nor is the negative skew inconsistent with the fact that world stock markets have been relatively quiet for most of this year . 
With the conspicuous exception of China and the less conspicuous exception of Australia , all have had low standard deviations of daily returns for the 100-business-day period ending August 3 when compared with the norm for the country . 
The February 27 drop in US stock prices was only the 31st biggest one-day drop since 1950 . 
But all of the other 30 drops occurred at times when stock prices were much more volatile . 
Thus , the February 27th drop really stands out , as do other recent one-day drops . 
Indeed , one of the big puzzles of the US stock market recently has been low price volatility since around 2004 , amid the most volatile earnings growth ever seen . 
Five-year real earnings growth on the S P 500 set an all-time record in the period ending in the first quarter of 2007 , at 192 % . 
Before that , between the third quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2002 , real S P 500 earnings fell 55 % - the biggest-ever decline since the index was created in 1957 . 
One would think that market prices should be volatile as investors try to absorb what this earnings volatility means . 
But we have learned time and again that stock markets are driven more by psychology than by reasoning about fundamentals . 
Is psychology somehow behind the pervasive negative skew in recent months ? 
Maybe we should ask why the skew is so negative . 
Should we regard it as just chance , or , when combined with record-high prices , as a symptom of some instability ? 
The adage in the bull market of the 1920 &quot; s was &quot; one step down , two steps up , again and again . &quot; 
The updated adage for the recent bull market is &quot; one big step down , then three little steps up , again and again , &quot; so far at least . 
No one is looking for a sudden surge , and volatility is reduced by the absence of sharp up-movements . 
But big negative returns have an unfortunate psychological impact on markets . 
People still talk about October 28 , 1929 , or October 19 , 1987 . 
Big drops get their attention , and this primes some people to be attentive for them in the future , and to be ready to sell if another one comes . 
In fact , willingness to support the market after a sudden drop may be declining . 
The &quot; buy-on-dips stock market confidence index &quot; that we compile at the Yale School of Management has been falling gradually since 2001 , and has fallen especially far lately . 
The index is the share of people who answered &quot; increase &quot; to the question , &quot; If the Dow dropped 3 % tomorrow , I would guess that the day after tomorrow the Dow would : Increase ? 
Decrease ? 
Stay the Same ? &quot; 
In 2001 , 72 % of institutional investors and 74 % of individual investors chose &quot; increase . &quot; 
By May 2007 , only 48 % of institutional investors and 59 % of individual investors chose &quot; increase . &quot; 
Perhaps the buy-on-dips confidence index has slipped lately because of negative news concerning credit markets , notably the US sub-prime mortgage market , which has increased anxiety about the fundamental soundness of the economy . 
But something more may be at work . 
Everyone knows that markets have been booming , and everyone knows that other people know that a correction is always a possibility . 
So there may be an underlying sensitivity to price drops , which could fuel a succession of downward price changes , amplifying public concerns about problems in the economy and heralding a profound change in investor sentiment .
