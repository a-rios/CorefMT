Invasion of the Culture Snatchers ? 
The specter of &quot; Americanization &quot; haunts the world . 
Its consequences are demonized everywhere , sometimes going as far as to draw on the metaphor of a ( need I say American ) science-fiction movie entitled Invasion of the Body Snatchers , within which hostile aliens imperceptibly take control of our bodies and our minds . 
But hyperbolic rhetoric about invasions misses the complexity of the cultural change taking place all around us . 
Neither side in the debate about Americanization offers a convincing explanation for the phenomenon . 
Those who argue that Americanization is a virulent form of &quot; cultural imperialism &quot; apparently see it as a product of growing market domination by American media concerns . 
However , many giant cultural corporations - Japanese-owned Sony , Canadian-owned Seagram , Murdoch &apos;s empire or Germany &apos;s Bertelsmann - are no longer American , even though they promote American cultural models . 
Even if the media were American-owned , it is too facile to say that consumers of culture the world over are mere clay in the hands of skilled marketing experts . 
It makes more sense to assume that there are some elements of social , psychic , and aesthetic gratification that explain the resonance of American cultural models , and provide for their commercial usefulness . 
The other side in the debate over Americanization emphasizes the liberating , anti-authoritarian power of American popular culture . 
At times , this may be fitting : in 1950 &apos;s Germany , for example , American youth culture had a strong anti-authoritarian component that helped to undermine authoritarianism and contributed to the process of postwar democratization . 
Only rarely , however , does American-inspired popular culture possess this dimension explicitly . 
More often , its attack on authority takes the form of willful provocations or ever-more uninhibited and graphic depictions of violence . 
At other times , the refreshingly anti-authoritarian appeal of such programs as The Simpsons is commercially exploited to strengthen global media empires , such as Rupert Murdoch &apos;s . 
In other words , anti-authoritarianism is not the whole story either . 
We need to look with more nuance at the forward march of American culture instead of demonizing it as a form of crude imperialism or merely celebrating its liberating potential . 
In particular , American popular culture must be viewed in light of the drawn-out historical process of cultural modernization . 
In the past , culture was tied to privilege and wealth . 
Until the 18 th century , books were comparatively expensive ; their ownership was limited largely to the propertied classes . 
Moreover , a certain educational grounding ( such as knowledge of Latin or Greek ) was necessary to make sense of most cultural objects . 
&quot; Popular culture &quot; is our word for a form of culture that gradually abolished these restrictions . 
Its earliest manifestation , the novel , aided by new print technologies , created a market that allowed for much wider access to literature . 
Knowledge of meter or classical poetics was no longer necessary . 
The novel became the literature of the middle class , and the dime novel , an &quot; abbreviated novel &quot; for a dime and slimmed down to magazine-size , expanded readership to the lower strata of society , especially to adolescent readers . 
The development of an &quot; entertainment culture &quot; around the turn of the 20 th century , including vaudeville theater , amusement parks , a dance craze triggered by the domestication of black plantation dances , and silent movies , further reduced the prerequisites for cultural understanding . 
The invention of radio and television extended the audience for this new &quot; mass &quot; culture even more , and the shift to the priority of pictures and music created a &quot; universal &quot; language , not limited to a particular community . 
For a number of reasons , America was in the forefront of this cultural revolution . 
Due to its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural composition , especially in the formative years of modern entertainment culture around 1900 , American popular culture was faced with the challenge of a market that anticipated the present global market on a smaller scale . 
This led to the development of broadly comprehensible , non-verbal forms of performance , relying preferably on visual and auditory forms of expression . 
Before Americanization of other societies could occur , American culture itself had to be &quot; Americanized . &quot; 
What is the meaning and cultural significance of this process of &quot; Americanization ? &quot; 
The constant reduction of the prerequisites for making sense of culture may confirm the view that consumers of mass culture are passive . 
Popular music , in particular , is highly effective in insinuating itself into the listener almost imperceptibly ; no intellectual processing of its content is required because it makes no claim to inform . 
Instead , moods are created by subliminal effect . 
The characteristic form by which music activates the imagination is by short evocations of out-of-context images , or a diffuse feeling of boundlessness , both of which need not be integrated into any meaningful context . 
Listeners to popular music need not &quot; earn &quot; their aesthetic experience through participation . 
Contrary to prior visual forms of cultural expression , including the movies , there is no longer a need for continuity in the flow of images ; contrary to what happens with a novel , no mental translation is required because the sensual effect of music creates associations that are shaped not by narrative but by mood . 
The development of popular culture from the novel via the image to the triumph of popular music and the &quot; center-less &quot; heterogeneity of television , created forms of cultural expression that are singularly useful for the purposes of imaginary self-extension and self-empowerment . 
The result is an increasing separation of expressive elements from moral , social , even narrative contexts . 
Here is the triumph of &quot; mood over morals . &quot; 
Americanization , indeed , is carried by the promise of heightened imaginary self-realization for individuals who are freed from the bonds of social norms and cultural traditions . 
Americanization , thus , cannot be viewed as a tacitly engineered hidden cultural takeover but as a process in which individualization is the driving force . 
This process is most advanced in the US for a number of reasons . 
The promise of a particular form of individualization provides the explanation why American popular culture finds so much resonance in other societies where it has taken hold almost without resistance ( mostly carried by a young generation trying to escape tradition ) . 
Cultural Americanization is thus part of a modernizing process . 
Americanization is not a form of cultural imperialism , but the embodiment of modernity &apos;s promise of painless self-realization for each individual , in contrast to the demands made by more traditional concepts of emancipation . 
Globalization , which often appears as the triumph of cultural standardization , in reality undermines standardization . 
No single national culture is the driving force but , instead , globalization is powered by a restless individualism drawing on a growing store of mass symbols . 
So : we are not becoming Americanized . 
We &quot; Americanize &quot; ourselves .
