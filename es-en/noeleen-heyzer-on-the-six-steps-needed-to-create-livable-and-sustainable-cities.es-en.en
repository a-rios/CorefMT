Mastering Our Urban Future 
NEW YORK - By the end of this century , ten billion people will inhabit our planet , with 8.5 billion living in cities . 
This could be the stuff of nightmares . 
Cities are hubs of economic and social power . 
They drive national and global development by concentrating skills , ideas , and resources in a single location . 
As cities expand , they swallow up land that would otherwise be used for food production . 
They drain water supplies , account for almost 70 % of global energy use , and generate more than 70 % of greenhouse-gas emissions . 
If global growth is to be sustainable and equitable , we will need to alter the balance between rapid urbanization and the unrelenting consumption of resources that it fuels . 
This is a main goal of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development , which has warned of the unprecedented pressures that economic growth will impose in coming decades on infrastructure ( especially transportation ) , housing , waste disposal ( especially of hazardous substances ) , and energy supplies . 
The battle to keep the world &apos;s cities - and thus the global economy - both dynamic and sustainable can be won by developing innovative ways to consume our limited resources , without diminishing them or degrading the delicate ecological systems on which they depend . 
To achieve this , the world must meet six broad challenges . 
First , we must change the way we design cities . 
Sustainability must be central to all urban planning , particularly in coastal cities that will soon face the ravaging effects of climate change . 
Denser cities use land more efficiently , reduce the need for private cars , and increase the quality of life by making space for parks and nature . 
Likewise , tightly integrated mass-transit systems reduce greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically . 
Second , we must rethink how we design and operate buildings so that they use less energy - or , better still , generate energy . 
Buildings are responsible for substantial CO 2 emissions , owing to the materials used in their construction , their cooling and heating requirements , and auxiliary functions such as water supply , wastewater , and solid-waste disposal . 
Our building codes need to promote energy-efficient engineering and construction technologies , which can be supported by tax incentives and stricter regulations . 
With almost 30 % of city dwellers in the Asia-Pacific region living in slums , one of our greatest tests will be to improve their living conditions without wreaking havoc on the environment . 
The third challenge is to alter citizens &apos; transport habits . 
Indeed , wherever possible , we should try to reduce the need to travel at all . 
Transport systems that favor cars and trucks cause accidents , pollution , and chronic congestion . 
Moreover , the transport sector accounted for 23 % of all energy-related CO2 emissions in 2004 , and it is the fastest growing source of emissions in developing countries . 
Instead , we need to integrate transportation , housing , and land use , encourage reliance on public transportation , and make our streets pleasant and safe for walking ( especially for women and the disabled ) . 
This includes creating more efficient energy systems and increasing our investment in renewable sources ( which will , one hopes , create jobs in the process ) . 
We can also encourage households to consume less energy , and companies to reduce the amount of energy that they waste . 
Fifth , we must reform how we manage water resources and water infrastructure , so that this precious resource can be re-used several times , and on a city-wide scale . 
Finally , we must change the way we manage solid waste so that it becomes a resource , not a cost . 
In many developing countries , 60-80 % of solid waste is organic , with open dumping causing excessive amounts of methane to enter the atmosphere . 
Cash-strapped local governments spend 30-40 % of their budgets on waste management but derive little in return . 
Yet , with some simple technological and design improvements - aimed , for example , at achieving higher rates of composting and recycling - 90 % of this waste could be converted into something useful , such as biogas and resource-derived fuel . 
These six steps require a comprehensive and coordinated change in behavior , and will require government at all levels to cooperate , invest at scale , share ideas , replicate best practices , and plan for the long term . 
It is a monumental and daunting challenge , but not an impossible one . 
If it can be achieved , the world may yet get the urban future that it deserves .
