France Says &quot; No &quot; To Chirac , Not to Europe 
Voting No on the EU Constitution would not constitute a French No to Europe , as some believe ; it would merely be a vote of no confidence in Chirac &apos;s presidency . 
Anything that diminishes Chirac - who has weakened the EU by pushing a protectionist , corporate state model for Europe , and telling the new smaller members to &quot; shut up &quot; when they disagreed with him - must be considered good news for Europe and European integration . 
So those desiring a stronger integrated EU should be rooting for a French No , knowing full well that some voting No would be doing the right thing for the wrong reasons . 
Even before the May referendum , there have been indications that France &apos;s ability to mold the European Union to its interests has been waning . 
Just recently , Romanian president Traian Barescu signed the Treaty to join the European Union . 
In the period preceding the signing , however , French foreign minister Michel Barnier chastised him for lacking a &quot; European reflex . &quot; 
The reason ? 
Barescu plans to align Romania with Anglo Saxon liberal economic policies , and wants a special relationship with Great Britain and the United States to improve security in the Black Sea region . 
Rather than buckling to France &apos;s will , the Romanian president warned French leaders to stop lecturing his country . 
This is Europe &apos;s future . 
Even those with close historical ties to France , like Romania , are standing up to France , because Chirac and his colleagues do not offer them the type of &quot; European reflex &quot; they want and need . 
The Netherlands - a traditionally pro-European country - also may vote No on the Constitution in its own referendum ( which takes place after the French one )  - not only as a protest against the conservative and moralistic policies of the Balkenende government , but as a rejection of a corporatist Europe dominated by French and German interests . 
The corporate state simply has not delivered the goods in continental Europe , and polls are showing voters may take it out on the proposed Constitution . 
Certainly the Yes camp is concerned , with some arguing a French No will stall EU enlargement and sink the euro . 
&quot; What prospects would there be for constructive talks with Turkey , or progress towards entry of the Balkan states if the French electorate turned its back on the EU ? &quot; asks Philip Stephens in The Financial Times . 
True enough . 
But a &quot; No &quot; will not mean the French electorate has turned its back on Europe . 
What &apos;s at stake is not enlargement , but whether enlargement takes a more corporatist or market-based form . 
Wolfgang Munchau of The Financial Times thinks French rejection of the EU constitution could sink the euro . 
&quot; Without the prospect of eventual political union on the basis of some constitutional treaty , &quot; writes Munchau , &quot; a single currency was always difficult to justify and it might turn out more difficult to sustain .... Without the politics , the euro is not nearly as attractive . &quot; 
But French rejection of the Constitution does not imply political fragmentation of the EU . 
If the Constitution is not ratified , the Treaty of Nice becomes the Union &apos;s operative document . 
There is no reason whatsoever why the EU should fall into chaos - and the euro wilt - now under the Treaty of Nice when it did not do so before . 
The truth is that not only will the euro survive a No vote ; it will prosper . 
Britain &apos;s liberal economic principles are more conducive to European economic growth and prosperity than France &apos;s protectionist , corporate state ones . 
The market realizes this . 
With the polls forecasting a No vote , the euro remains strong in the currency markets . 
Finally , not only will a French No serve to marginalize Chirac in Europe , but it will also help undermine the Franco-German alliance that has served France , Germany and Europe so badly in recent years . 
Europe , in fact , might be on the verge of a major political re-alignment if the French vote No and Tony Blair wins big in the forthcoming UK election . 
With Chirac down and Blair up , an Anglo Saxon-German alliance might well replace the present Franco-German one . 
That would be progress indeed .
