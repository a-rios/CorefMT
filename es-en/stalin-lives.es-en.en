Stalin Lives 
The legacy of dead dictators from vanquished totalitarian regimes should no longer be ambivalent . 
Only Germany &apos;s lunatic fringe dares to commemorate Hitler . 
Not even the pathetic remnant of the Khmer Rouge celebrates Pol Pot &apos;s memory . 
Yet , as Russia approaches the 60th anniversary of its victory over Nazi Germany , marking Stalin &apos;s role in that victory is proving to be damnably awkward . 
Indeed , earlier this year , Moscow was roiled by debates about whether or not to build a statue to the dead dictator . 
In large bookstores across Russia , a huge number of political biographies and histories portray Stalin and his era . 
Some of these , based on newly opened archival material , are critical . 
But the majority of these books and authors portray Stalin in a positive light . 
Indeed , when Russians are asked to list the most important people of the twentieth century , Stalin is still tied for first place - with Lenin . 
Some see the hand of what remains of the Communist Party behind this . 
The Party has moved far from its old Leninist ideals , as it seeks support nowadays through a witch &apos;s brew of Russian nationalism , hyper-orthodox Christianity , and &quot; state Stalinism . &quot; 
Of course , towns and cities are no longer named for Stalin . 
In the late 1950 &quot; s , countless Stalin monuments were demolished . 
Yet many symbols of Stalin &apos;s rule have been carefully preserved , including the national anthem he personally approved in 1944 . 
There are seven high-rises in Moscow that Russians still call &quot; Stalin &apos;s vysotki . &quot; 
Next to Lenin &apos;s tomb is Stalin &apos;s grave and monument , where heaps of fresh flowers are always to be seen on the anniversaries of his birth , his death , and the victory over Hitler . 
To be sure , Khrushchev &apos;s uncovering of Stalin &apos;s crimes and cult of personality in 1956 made a huge impression both in the Soviet Union and abroad . 
But many people in the political elite and military circles were enraged by Khrushchev &apos;s revelations . 
This incited many attempts to rehabilitate Stalin , especially during the 20 years of Leonid Brezhnev &apos;s rule , which we now call the period of &quot; stagnation . &quot; 
Mikhail Gorbachev continued to uncover the crimes of Stalinism , shedding light on dark pages that Khrushchev lacked the courage to open to public view . 
During Boris Yeltsin &apos;s presidency , this criticism became even stronger . 
But demolishing the ideological , political and economic structures of the past is not enough to renew society . 
Yeltsin understood this . 
Eight years ago the remains of the Romanov family were publicly buried in the Peter-Paul castle in Saint Petersburg . 
Nicolas II gained the status of saintly martyr . 
The reburial of the Romanovs , however , didn &apos;t touch the public &apos;s emotions for long . 
Over 50 % of Russia &apos;s population , including teachers , scientists , doctors , and military personnel , have seen their quality of life fall since communism &apos;s demise . 
No surprise , then , that they are nostalgic for the past , including Stalin . 
People of the older generation do , of course , remember the hardships of the 1930 &quot; s and 1940 &quot; s . 
But most Russians do not view the entire Soviet period as some sort of black hole . 
They see a time of hardship , yes , but also of great achievements - in economic development , science , culture , education , and defense of the motherland during the war . 
Today , Russians listen to old Soviet songs and watch Soviet-era movies . 
May 1 ( Labor Day ) , and November 7 ( the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution ) remain much more meaningful than newly installed postcommunist holidays , such as June 12 ( Independence Day ) . 
In fact , for many Russians , the declaration of Russia &apos;s independence in 1990 represents a low point in the country &apos;s history , a year of anarchy and disarray . 
What can Russians be proud of in the 15 years of postcommunism ? 
Shock therapy that ruined the economy and gave away the country &apos;s wealth to private but rarely clean hands ? 
Neither democracy nor markets are seen by most Russians as absolute values , because they have failed to deliver either prosperity or security . 
What victories has Russia &apos;s army achieved in these years ? 
It could not even subdue Chechnya , a small republic within the Russian federation . 
The Russian federation remains a collection of multinational states in need of some unifying idea of statehood and nationality to keep them together . 
The easiest and the most understandable idea for Russians to cling to is patriotism . 
Only two events have the power to mobilize and energize this sense of patriotism : the October revolution of 1917 and the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 , which turned the USSR and Russia into a great world power . 
The victory over fascism , because so many of its participants remain active , is a living event in our memory . 
Victory Day this year will likely be the last &quot; round &quot; anniversary of 1945 that Russia can commemorate while many thousands of veterans are alive and able to participate . 
So the Kremlin is preparing to mark the event on a scale that Russia has never seen before . 
Needless to say , Stalin &apos;s name will be mentioned countless times during these celebrations . 
But it would be a mistake to see this public recognition of Stalin as a real yearning for every aspect of the system he created . 
Instead , acknowledging Stalin is a way for Russians to recall a time of great deeds and perhaps even greater sacrifices . 
Patriotism everywhere is always based on such notions .
