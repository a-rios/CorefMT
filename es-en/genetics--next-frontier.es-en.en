Genetics \ u0027 Next Frontier 
In 1974 , I published a paper entitled &quot; The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans , &quot; also known as the nematode . 
Its first sentence read : &quot; How genes might specify the complex structures found in higher organisms is a major unsolved problem of biology . &quot; 
This remains true today . 
How do genes build organs , bones , or skin and specify their function ? 
Has our slowness in finding out been due to our difficulties in choosing the right organism to study ? 
Until the early 1960 &apos;s , biology &apos;s great-unanswered question was far more modest : how does DNA determine the simplest of proteins ? 
But then it became clear that all you have to do is get a gene and sequence it , get a protein and sequence it , and simply translate one into the other . 
In principle , we could learn what genes do just by reading their chemical language . 
Of course we didn &apos;t have the right tools at the time . 
We did have primitive tools to sequence proteins , so we could figure out their chemistry . 
But we could not tackle the chemistry of genes . 
All we could do was follow the standard - and painfully slow - procedure established by Gregor Mendel , the 19 th Century founder of genetics . 
According to Mendel , a gene &apos;s presence in an organism is confirmed only when we find an alternative form of it , called an allele . 
For example , Mendel could not say that there was a gene for tallness in a plant species until he discovered dwarf mutants of the same species . 
This approach defines genes according to an organism &apos;s observable characteristics . 
Fortunately , technological progress lets us define genes much faster than Mendel could . 
With the discovery of genetic recombination in viruses that penetrate rapidly reproducing bacteria , it became possible to measure variation in offspring much more minutely , and thus to dissect the fine structure of a gene . 
So it was natural by this point for biologists to ask whether a similar approach would crack the genetics of more complex , multi-cellular organisms . 
The rule from the earlier research on bacteria was to obtain mutants and study them as deeply as possible . 
What was needed was an organism with a rapid growth rate , like bacteria . 
This would provide us with lots of genetic variation , enabling us to analyze the genes fully . 
I was interested in the nervous system , and thought it important to study it in a way that it could be summarized in the form of a wiring diagram . 
The plan was not to trace genes directly to behavior , but to separate the problem into two questions : a developmental question ( &quot; how do genes build nervous systems ? &quot; ) , and a physiological question ( &quot; how do nervous systems or brains generate behavior ? &quot; ) . 
The idea was to study mutants of C. elegans in the hope of finding mutants of genes that regulate behavior . 
But even in an organism as simple as C. elegans , our technological limits made it extremely difficult to pinpoint the function of genes . 
We started by studying muscle , simply because it gave us large amounts of proteins . 
The invention in the mid-1970 &apos;s of technology to clone and sequence DNA opened new vistas for research , and its use on humans and other mammals has been enormously successful in terms of scientific discovery . 
But the development of genetics has remained dependent on the ability to study model organisms like C. elegans and Drosophila ( the fruit fly ) . 
In fact , the great risk nowadays is that with so many genetic descriptions of organisms pouring out , we are drowning in a sea of data but are moving further away from understanding biological complexity . 
The basic functional units of all complex living organisms , it should be remembered , are cells , not genes . 
What we need now are cell maps and maps of how cells talk to each other . 
Our first job is to say how many different cells there are in a complex organism . 
I think we can now say that for C. elegans . 
But for vertebrate organisms like ourselves , we are still very far away . 
This struck me recently while I was attending a meeting on the mouse , which is a model for human beings . 
The meeting proposed that we create a genetically mixed pool of 30,000 mice . 
We would train people to go around examining these mice and diagnose high blood pressure , diabetes , greed , and so forth . 
Then we would study the genotypes of these mice - the particular variants of their genes . 
The problem is that we are technologically incapable of mapping 30,000 genotypes . 
But it occurred to me that even if one could map 30,000 genotypes , why would one work on a mouse ? 
After all , we already have many highly trained people to examine subjects , namely physicians . 
So , when technology permits ( and I think it can and will ) , why don &apos;t we work directly on humans ? 
The right way to do this would be to work with a population where everybody is anonymous . 
We can prove that we understand the genetic structure of a human disease by synthesizing the same disease in a mouse . 
But the very purpose of using model organisms is to confirm what we find in the real thing .
