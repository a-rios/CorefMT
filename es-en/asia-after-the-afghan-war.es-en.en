Asia After the Afghan War 
TOKYO - July will mark two milestones in America &apos;s sometimes-tortured relations with Asia . 
One is the beginning of the end of the nearly decade-long struggle in Afghanistan - the longest war in United States history - with President Barack Obama announcing the withdrawal of 30,000 US troops from the country by next summer . 
The other is the 40th anniversary of Henry Kissinger &apos;s secret mission to Beijing , a turning point in the Cold War and the first step on China &apos;s road to modernization - but at the time a huge shock to Asia , particularly Japan . 
The looming Afghan withdrawal recalls , at least for some Asians , a third , even more traumatic event : America &apos;s chaotic exit from Saigon in April 1975 . 
Back then , that debacle seemed to presage a broader US withdrawal from Asia , with a war-weary American public seeking the supposed comforts of isolationism . 
Today &apos;s Asian nervousness exists not only because isolationism appears to be gaining ground once more in America , but also because Afghanistan &apos;s stability remains in doubt , while China &apos;s power is rising in the absence of any pan-Asian consensus or institutional structure . 
America did , indeed , turn inward following the fall of Saigon , and its neglect of Afghanistan following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 led to chaos and Al Qaeda &apos;s near-takeover of the country . 
So it is not surprising that many Asian leaders are asking themselves what commitments the US will maintain once its troops leave Afghanistan . 
Perhaps equally important , many people in Asia are also debating whether the region would be able to rebalance itself should the US scale back its military presence . 
Fortunately , US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has reassured America &apos;s Asian friends and allies that regional disengagement is not being contemplated . 
At the recent Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore - indeed , in the presence of Chinese Minister of Defense General Liang Guanglie - Gates outlined his ideas for continuing US cooperation in and with Asia . 
Gates promised to increase the number of US warships deployed to Singapore as part of the US-Singapore Strategic Framework Agreement ; increase the number of US Navy calls in Asian ports ; hold more joint naval exercises ; and improve multilateral military cooperation . 
Even more reassuring were the principles that will , according to Gates , guide America &apos;s future Asian strategy : free and open commerce ; support for the rule of law and the rights , responsibilities , and sovereignty of Asia &apos;s states ; open access to Asian and global sea lanes , airspace , and cyberspace ; and peaceful resolution of all conflicts . 
These principles matter , because Australia , Japan , South Korea , Thailand , the Philippines , India , Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia , New Zealand , Vietnam , and even Mongolia all regard America &apos;s military presence in the region as essential to counterbalancing China &apos;s increasing might . 
Gates , however , is due to step down from his post shortly , which is unfortunate , because the Obama administration &apos;s apparent lack of any explicit Asia strategy means that Gates &apos;s reassurances might not reassure for very long . 
Nowadays , US policy on Asia needs the type of strategic vision and insight that guided Kissinger &apos;s discussions with Mao Zedong and Zhou En-lai four decades ago . 
Without a clear and convincing doctrine , at least some Asian leaders are likely to remain dubious of America &apos;s ability to remain Asia &apos;s dominant military force , particularly given its economic woes , projected fiscal retrenchment , and other overseas commitments . 
This lack of clarity may become particularly troublesome should China &apos;s leaders underestimate the enduring quality of America &apos;s Asian commitments . 
Securing a structure of peace in Asia , however , is not solely America &apos;s responsibility . 
America &apos;s friends and allies need to think hard about what sort of regional order they want , and they must begin to collaborate in order to breathe life into a structure of peace within which all of Asia can prosper and feel secure . 
Japan &apos;s government in particular needs to identify a coherent Asia strategy and stick to it , instead of leaning towards China one minute , and America the next . 
In constructing a viable strategy , deepening Japan &apos;s partnerships with Asia &apos;s great democracies - India , Indonesia , and South Korea - must be a priority . 
But the biggest question concerns China &apos;s place in a consensual Asian order , and its willingness to collaborate with its neighbors , as well as with the US , in creating it . 
The doubts that many Asians now hold about China &apos;s intentions are well grounded , given the secretive nature of China &apos;s military build-up , and its leaders &quot; increasingly aggressive tone in territorial disputes with India , Japan , the Philippines , and Vietnam . 
China &apos;s unconditional support for North Korea &apos;s wayward regime , despite its repeated crimes against peace , is also a cause for concern about whether China will treat its neighbors &quot; security concerns with respect . 
Today &apos;s Asia-Pacific region has now become the focus of the global economy . 
According to the World Bank , three of the top five economic powers ( China , Japan , and India ) will be Asian powers within this decade . 
The boom that has brought this shift occurred because America &apos;s military presence in the region provided stability and predictability . 
America &apos;s withdrawal from Afghanistan must not be allowed to call this stability into question . 
What happens in Afghanistan as America begins to draw down its troops will test the willingness of all of Asia &apos;s powers to work together to build a secure regional order . 
In Afghanistan , their long-term interests are essentially in harmony , as none - including China - wants to see Afghanistan become a haven for terrorism once again . 
If such a consensus can be forged , however , it will provide a foundation for further collaboration in building a pan-Asian order based on consent , not military might .
