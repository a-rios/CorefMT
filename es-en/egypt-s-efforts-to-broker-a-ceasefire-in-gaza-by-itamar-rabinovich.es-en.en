Egypt the Peacemaker ? 
TEL AVIV - Before the current fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza escalates further , a ceasefire must be negotiated . 
Of course , like previous ceasefires , any truce is likely to be temporary , inevitably undermined by the forces that perpetuate Israel &apos;s armed conflict with Hamas . 
Nonetheless , with Syria consumed in civil war and the wider Middle East already unsteady , a ceasefire is essential both for saving lives and preserving today &apos;s uneasy regional peace . 
Much depends on Egypt , which is best placed to broker an agreement . 
But assessing the prospects of any diplomatic effort requires understanding the protagonists &quot; perspectives and agendas . 
Israel does not have a comprehensive policy toward Gaza . 
Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon took a courageous step by withdrawing unilaterally from Gaza and dismantling the Israeli settlements there . 
His successor , Ehud Olmert , began negotiating a final-status agreement with the Palestinian Authority &apos;s president , Mahmoud Abbas . 
But this did nothing to end the violence emanating from Gaza , which has effectively seceded from the Palestinian Authority and become a Hamas-controlled proto-state . 
Israel &apos;s Operation Cast Lead in the winter of 2008-2009 re-established deterrence and brought a period of relative calm ; but it has been clear since the start of 2012 that the parties were once again on a collision course . 
During his first term as Israel &apos;s prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu refused to continue to negotiate with the Palestinian Authority on Olmert &apos;s terms , and never considered holding talks with Hamas . 
He agreed to swap Palestinian prisoners for an abducted soldier , Gilad Shalit ; but , for Netanyahu , as for most Israelis , negotiating with an organization whose blatantly anti-Semitic charter rejects Israel &apos;s right to exist is pointless . 
From Netanyahu &apos;s point of view , the Gaza problem has no satisfactory solution . 
His aim is to obtain and maintain calm along the border . 
Israel provides electricity , water , and passage to Gaza , but also maintains a siege intended to prevent imports of larger , more lethal weapons . 
Israeli leaders were aware of Hamas &apos;s buildup of medium-range missiles , mostly smuggled through Sinai in underground tunnels , but continue to argue that , absent the siege , Iran and others would supply more ( and more sophisticated ) weapons . 
In fact , Israel discovered over the last few years that Gaza contained enough rockets and missiles to paralyze its south . 
Major Israeli cities were hit several times . 
For Israeli leaders , it was only a matter of time before Tel Aviv could and would be hit . 
For its part , Hamas , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s Palestinian branch , seeks to consolidate its control over Gaza and use it as a base from which to take control of the West Bank and the Palestinian national movement . 
This outcome would be comparable to the Brotherhood &apos;s takeover in Egypt , further establishing its ascendancy in the region . 
Recent events appear to have emboldened Hamas . 
Although the conflict between Iran and its Sunni rivals and the Syrian civil war forced it to loosen ties with Iran and Syria and move into the Sunni fold , in many respects this has been a comfortable shift . 
Hamas feels more confident next to an Egypt dominated by its parent movement . 
The Emir of Qatar paid a visit to Gaza as a reward for Hamas &apos;s break with Iran and left a check . 
But Hamas is not alone in Gaza . 
Its hegemony is challenged by the more radical Islamic Jihad ( which remains allied with Iran ) and a host of Salafi and jihadi groups , some connected to radical elements in Sinai , which complicates Hamas &apos;s relations with Egypt . 
Moreover , these groups have frequently initiated attacks on Israel from Gaza or through Sinai , generating cycles of violence that have embarrassed Hamas . 
At the same time , pressure from these more radical groups may have forced Hamas itself to become more aggressive in recent months , perhaps bolstered by the knowledge that its arsenal of dozens of Fajr-5 rockets could hit the Tel Aviv area should Israel retaliate on a larger scale . 
The change in Egypt &apos;s politics and policies had a similar effect : Hamas calculated that Israel would not jeopardize its fragile relationship with Egypt by launching another ground operation in Gaza . 
Hamas was taken by surprise when Israel attacked , killing its military leader , Ahmed al-Jabari , and destroying most of its Fajr-5 arsenal . 
It responded with massive shelling of southern Israel , and managed to send several missiles toward Tel Aviv and one toward Jerusalem . 
Air raid sirens were finally heard in Israel &apos;s two largest cities . 
In response , Israel is visibly preparing for a large-scale ground operation . 
There is no appetite in Israel for a second Operation Cast Lead ; but nothing less than a stable , long-lasting ceasefire is acceptable . 
Such a truce is possible . 
Israel &apos;s assault scored impressive initial successes , while Hamas can take pride in having reached Tel Aviv with its missiles , an achievement that eluded Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War . 
Moreover , Egypt , Hamas &apos;s patron and senior ally , maintains a relationship and channels of communication with Israel , and does not want to sever all ties - not least because to do so would provoke a confrontation with the United States , which underwrites the Egyptian army . 
In fact , Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi is seeking more financial aid from the US and the International Monetary Fund , and wants his coming visit to Washington , DC , to be a success . 
He also wants to restore Egypt &apos;s position as a major regional force . 
Playing the peacemaker would serve him well on all counts . 
So Morsi is juggling . 
He has denounced and warned Israel , recalled Egypt &apos;s ambassador to Tel Aviv , and sent his prime minister to Gaza . 
But , so far , he has not crossed a single red line . 
There is little time to act . 
If the US and Europe choose to remain inactive , they must at least encourage Egypt to play its role . 
Egypt &apos;s major obstacle is Hamas &apos;s insistence on an end to the Israeli siege and targeted killings as part of a ceasefire agreement . 
The challenge for Egyptian leaders is to persuade Hamas to settle on lesser terms without further fighting .
