The Development Round That Wasn &apos;t 
Whatever face-saving measures are taken , the meeting in Hong Kong in mid-December to wrap up the current Development Round of world trade talks will almost surely fail the only test that matters : whether such an agreement promotes the poorest countries &quot; development . 
Cynics will say that the advanced countries , in the tradition of previous trade deals , intended to provide only the bare minimum in the way of concessions , while generating the full maximum in the way of &quot; spin , &quot; to get the developing countries on board . 
What has happened since the beginning of the Development Round at Doha in November 2001 has been a huge disappointment for me . 
As chief economist of the World Bank , I reviewed the Uruguay Round of 1994 and concluded that both its agenda and outcomes discriminated against developing countries . 
In March 1999 , I went to the headquarters of the World Trade Organization in Geneva to call for a development round to redress these imbalances . 
For a moment , I thought my call had been heeded . 
Two years ago , I was asked by the Commonwealth , a diverse group of mostly ex-British colonies , countries from both the North and the South , to prepare a study of what a true development round would look like . 
This month , Oxford University Press is publishing an expanded version of that report , called Fair Trade for All : How Trade can Promote Development . 
Both as it was conceived , and even more as it has evolved , today &apos;s Development Round does not deserve its name . 
Many of the issues that it has addressed should never have been on the agenda of a genuine development round , and many issues that should have been on the agenda have not been . 
Agriculture is not the only - or even the most important - trade issue , though it is understandable why it has become pivotal . 
When the Uruguay Round began , there was a Grand Bargain to expand the trade agenda to include services and intellectual property rights - two issues of particular concern to developed countries . 
In return , developed countries were to make major concessions on agriculture - the livelihood of the vast majority of people in developing countries - and textile quotas , the only trade area ( besides sugar ) in which quantitative restrictions persist . 
In the end , developed countries got what they wanted , and developing countries were told to be patient : eventually the developed countries would fulfill their part of the deal . 
Even as the rich countries urged developing countries to make quick adjustments , they claimed that they needed a decade to make the transition to a quota-free textile regime . 
In truth , they were just buying time ; they did nothing for a decade , and when the quotas finally ended last January , they pleaded that they were still not prepared , and thus negotiated a three-year extension with China . 
What happened in agriculture was even worse . 
While the understanding was that rich countries &quot; enormous subsidies and restrictions would be reduced , the United States almost doubled its subsidies . 
To be sure , the US had inserted fine print that created a category of allowed agricultural subsidies - those that didn &apos;t distort trade - and it claimed all of its increases were of this kind . 
( By contrast , everything Europe did was trade distorting . 
Indeed , one of America &apos;s great achievements in the charade of trade negotiations during the past year has been to portray Europe as the culprit . ) 
America &apos;s claims were not based on economic analysis - as the WTO concluded when it ruled on America &apos;s cotton subsidies . 
A subsidy distorts trade if it increases production ( unless magically , it raises consumption by the same amount . ) 
America &apos;s agricultural subsidies do just that . 
Those in the developing world who believe that there has been a history of bargaining in bad faith have a strong case . 
That leaves developing countries facing a hard choice : will they be better off accepting the crumbs being offered to them ? 
Whatever the economics , taking this route may be harder today than ever before : with so many developing countries becoming vibrant democracies , electorates may punish governments that accept what is widely viewed as another unfair trade agreement . 
Unsurprisingly , the rich countries &quot; negotiators throw around big numbers when describing the gains from even an imperfect agreement . 
Developing countries soon discovered that their gains were far less than advertised , and the poorest countries found , to their dismay , that they were actually worse off . 
Simply put , the advanced countries have lost their credibility . 
To be sure , the great achievement of the Uruguay round was the establishment of a basic rule of law in international trade . 
Even the most powerful country , the US , has reluctantly yielded to its finding , for instance , that its steel tariffs violated international trade law . 
Presumably , the same will eventually happen with America &apos;s cotton subsidies , illegal dumping provisions , and tax subsidies to exporters . 
A rule of law , even if unfair , is better than no rule of law . 
But with that goal reached , developing countries today need to take a hard look at the details of what is being offered . 
Will the benefits - increased access to international markets - be greater than the costs of meeting rich countries &quot; demands ? 
Many developing countries are likely to come to the conclusion that no agreement is better than a bad agreement , particularly one as unfair as the last .
