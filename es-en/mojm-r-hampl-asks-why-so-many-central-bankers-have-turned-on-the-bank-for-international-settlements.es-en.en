The BIS Bashers 
PRAGUE - It might seem an unlikely proposition , but central banking has become exciting . 
This is not necessarily a welcome development . 
Decisions taken by the leading monetary authorities since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis have been unorthodox , creative , and at times risky . 
Their high-stakes choices today will affect the global economy for decades to come . 
Moreover , central bankers have become more vocal in expressing strongly held positions in the mass media , as if seeking to win over popular opinion . 
It is a potent and dangerous mix . 
In this environment , sober , informed voices , like that of the Bank for International Settlements , the central bank of central banks , should also be given a fair hearing . 
Unfortunately , many central bankers have sought to marginalize the BIS rather than engage with it . 
One of the most contentious debates has been over when to end the &quot; unconventional &quot; monetary-policy measures that were introduced in the aftermath of the financial crisis to ensure that banks continued to lend , thereby stimulating growth and averting deflation . 
Some central bankers now worry that ending these measures prematurely will tip the economy back into recession . 
Yet others fear that the current strategy , though originally intended to prevent an economic collapse , is now sowing the seeds of future instability , including the emergence of another asset-price bubble . 
In their efforts to resolve such dilemmas , policymakers are also wrestling over whether to focus on traditional monetary tools such as interest rates , or make greater use of so-called &quot; macro-prudential measures , &quot; such as capital add-ons and buffers or adjustments to banks &quot; loan-to-value ratios . 
At the heart of the debate - currently being conducted within leading economies &quot; treasuries and central banks , as well as in supranational bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the BIS - is the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability . 
The BIS , for example , has suggested that financial stability is closely connected with monetary policy , and has advised policymakers to start weaning their economies off of easy money sooner rather than later . 
Central bankers , however , seem to want to try macro-prudential tools first ( and sometimes exclusively ) . 
It is unusual to witness a clash of views among monetary policymakers that is so radical and clear-cut that it has grabbed wider political and media attention . 
To be sure , a country &apos;s domestic economic circumstances , and the tools available to policymakers , should guide policy . 
But the harsh reactions to the BIS &apos;s analysis seem misplaced and unfair . 
It is always difficult to find the right monetary-policy stance for any given economy at a given moment . 
Central banks employ an army of experts to try to get it right , and other institutions are seldom so well resourced to present equally sophisticated counter-arguments . 
The BIS , however , is one of the few organizations that not only has the necessary research and analytical capabilities , but also a track record of making good calls . 
One should not forget - as many central bankers appear to have done - that the BIS was one of the first to warn of the dangers of financial excesses , several years before the 2008 crisis . 
The BIS has a right to be heard . 
It exists not just to represent central banks , but also to offer ideas and intellectual feedback . 
Indeed , it serves policymakers well by challenging , debating , and perhaps swaying opinion . 
Rather than bash the BIS , monetary authorities should be grateful for the informed perspectives that it provides .
