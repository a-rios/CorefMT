Europe &apos;s Clash of Generations 
LONDON - As Europe &apos;s financial crisis goes from acute to chronic , the dispute over who will bear the costs of resolving it is fueling the emergence of a new generation of political movements . 
In the so-called periphery , political upstarts promise citizens an alternative to austerity . 
In the eurozone &apos;s &quot; core &quot; countries , they purport to protect taxpayers from relentless demands for debtor-country relief . 
How Europe &apos;s leaders respond to these new political challengers will determine whether the monetary union stabilizes or fractures . 
Europe &apos;s political elite have , for the most part , been strongly integrationist . 
Given that they are largely of the post-World War II generation , they are acutely aware of the benefits of a peaceful Europe . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , differing visions of European integration led to a problematic compromise . 
In order to secure France &apos;s backing for German reunification , Germany agreed to create a monetary union - but not a fiscal union . 
Now , Europe is suffering the consequences of that Faustian bargain . 
At the same time , Europe &apos;s leaders are under pressure from a new generation of voters , who grew up in the shadow of the Berlin Wall &apos;s collapse . 
The lifting of the Iron Curtain gave the West access to a vast supply of cheap labor in Eastern Europe . 
China &apos;s subsequent emergence expanded that supply further , culminating with China &apos;s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 . 
As a result , many of Europe &apos;s economies began to fall behind . 
European leaders hoped that a monetary union would help Europe &apos;s less competitive economies catch up to the richer countries of the north . 
And , during its first decade , the euro ostensibly delivered . 
Just as cheap mortgage financing papered over the cracks of growing income inequality in the United States , cheap capital from the north accelerated Europe &apos;s apparent economic convergence . 
The post-Wall generation seemed to have all the luck - at least for a while . 
But income inequality was worsening steadily in all member countries , with more highly educated citizens benefiting from the booming services industry , while the less educated suffered as manufacturing moved to cheaper locations . 
Then , the global financial crisis struck , income inequality rose sharply , and the post-Wall generation in southern Europe suffered the largest drop in living standards since WWII . 
Unlike the US , which was founded on a political cause - opposition to British colonialism - that forged a common national identity , countries joining the European Union sought simply to avoid further warfare on the continent . 
While laudable , this cause was inadequate to foster a shared European identity . 
On the contrary , it allowed national identity to flourish . 
The post-Wall generation , whose members are less than 40 years old and thus far removed from WWII , has little appreciation for this cause . 
For them , debtor and creditor countries &quot; increasingly divergent economic objectives are much more meaningful . 
Citizens of debtor economies , who grew up complacent about economic convergence , have lost their savings and , in many cases , have run out of hope . 
Meanwhile , citizens of creditor countries are focused on protecting the gains made before the crisis ; after all , it was their savings that financed their neighbors &quot; reckless spending . 
Throughout the eurozone , rising income inequality has created an underclass that is increasingly suspicious of the monetary union . 
As the post-war generation ages - with most of its members now at least 60 years old and its leaders either in senior leadership positions or acting as senior statesmen - the remaining support for integration is waning . 
Many post-Wall voters stand on the margins of established parties or are forming parties of their own , while a more pragmatic group is being pulled between the old order and new movements . 
The muddled , reactive response to the euro crisis reflects the compromises that traditional political parties have made in order to remain in power as generational differences have become increasingly extreme . 
Political revolutions rarely arise out of brief periods of acute crisis . 
Rather , they follow one or more generations of chronic decline , when fear of economic loss gives way to targeted anger , and charismatic voices surface to orchestrate the response . 
This pattern has recurred throughout history , from the French Revolution all the way to the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
Although markets may have been cowed into submission for now , the cracks in the eurozone &apos;s political foundations are beginning to show . 
For now , the post-Wall generation lacks a clear focus for its anger . 
New populist parties in Italy , Greece , and Germany reflect the direction in which politics is moving , not the final destination . 
Their ability to win support from both the left and the right suggests a shared aspiration to rebuild the protective national barriers that the post-War generation demolished . 
Against this background , most European leaders are afraid that their electorates will reject anything that seems to imply more integration . 
It is a classic prisoner &apos;s dilemma : all countries are better off if they contribute to a common cause , but the pressure of national elections impedes politicians &quot; ability to champion that cause . 
The ultimate test of leadership will be a commitment to EU treaty reform , with all the thorny negotiations and referenda that this entails . 
The post-war generation &apos;s political leaders must respond promptly and effectively to the challenge posed by emerging political movements while they are still immature . 
If they wait too long , the old walls will be restored and the euro &apos;s guardians will be left out in the cold .
