Europe , America , and the Drumbeat of War with Iran 
America &apos;s capital is once again abuzz with talk of war , not only of the latest &quot; strategy for victory &quot; in Iraq , but now also of military action against Iran . 
The harder it becomes to discern any rationality in the Bush administration &apos;s actions , the louder the rumor mill grinds . 
Will Bush order an air and Special Forces attack on Iran ? 
Ever since Bush &apos;s State of the Union address at the end of January , hardly a day has passed without something happening in connection with Iran or without the Bush administration &apos;s ratcheting up its rhetoric . 
Clearly , the US is also pressing ahead with preparations for an air strike . 
Indeed , the confrontation with the Iranians in Iraq is visibly intensifying , and it may be gathering strength elsewhere as well . 
A bomb directed at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard recently exploded on Iran &apos;s border with Afghanistan . 
And there are , of course , new attempts by the United States to drum up &quot; evidence &quot; of an Iranian threat that may justify an attack . 
Is this all a bluff ? 
The world could perhaps calmly wait for an answer , but for the fact that the progress of Iran &apos;s nuclear program and the approaching end of President Bush &apos;s term might create an incalculable dynamic of its own . 
As with Iraq , America &apos;s strength may be enough to start a war , but not to win it . 
But the consequences of a military adventure in Iran would far surpass those of the war in Iraq . 
Doing things by halves yet again in the Middle East would be the worst of all possible options - bad for the region and bad for its neighbors . 
The first among the neighbors affected would be Europe . 
So how has Europe , with its vital security interests at stake , responded to these developments ? 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has already adapted to the US administration &apos;s new confrontational rhetoric . 
French President Jacques Chirac unguardedly speculated that an Iran with one or two nuclear bombs might not pose a serious a threat , given the possibility of nuclear retaliation  -  his musings so startled French officials that they quickly jumped in to correct the President &apos;s comments . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel gives speeches at security conferences that find favor in America , but otherwise Germany prefers to stay in the background . 
Across Europe , risk avoidance seems to be the order of the day , even at the expense of the common interest and NATO solidarity . 
The German navy is defending the Lebanese coast against Hezbollah , while other European nations bear the brunt of policing Lebanon on the ground . 
In Afghanistan , Germany , with its strong military presence in the north , has been turning a deaf ear to calls for help from the Canadian allies fighting a revived Taliban in the south . 
Germany now wants to send some Tornado jets for reconnaissance purposes - better than nothing , but not by much . 
In terms of security policy , Europe is stagnating , if not regressing , at the very moment when unity is needed more then ever . 
The Big Three of Europe - and Germany , as the current EU president in particular - must find a way to act together in strategic security matters . 
If they don &apos;t , Europe will largely cease to matter when the going gets rough . 
And the going is now getting quite rough in Iran and the Persian Gulf . 
Should Iran be attacked this year , the consequences will be borne first and foremost by the region , but also by Europe as the Middle East &apos;s immediate western neighbor - and they will be felt for a long time to come . 
Indeed , Europe will have to share the costs if Iran prevails and becomes a nuclear power . 
So there is much at stake for the old continent . 
To be precise , two overriding EU security interests are at stake : avoiding a war with Iran and preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power . 
These two apparently contradictory interests can be reconciled and translated into a common strategy by adopting a three-pronged approach based on efficient isolation , effective containment , and direct negotiations . 
The Europeans - led by Merkel , Blair , and Chirac - should agree to assure the US that Europe is ready to pay a high , perhaps very high , economic price by taking decisive action to intensify the sanctions against Iran . 
But they should offer this only on two strict preconditions : that the military option be taken off the table , and that all parties involved - including the US - enter into direct negotiations with Iran . 
The policy of isolation coupled with direct negotiations would be strengthened further by a common strategy toward Syria , aimed not at &quot; regime change , &quot; but at &quot; coalition change &quot; - that is , drawing Syria away from its close alliance with Iran . 
It was both right and important that the EU Council of Foreign Ministers agreed on sanctions against Iran . 
Faced with the threat of financial sanctions , Iran &apos;s political elite is increasingly realizing the price of its confrontational course . 
It is imperative to further this process in a resolute manner , while at the same time rejecting military adventurism . 
It is up to Europe to prevent the two worst developments in Iran - war and nuclear armament - by acting jointly and with determination . 
Vital European and transatlantic interests are at stake . 
It is thus Europe &apos;s responsibility - and especially Germany &apos;s , as the current EU president - to act now .
