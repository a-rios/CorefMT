Is the Boss Overpaid ? 
Ever since 2001 , when France enacted a law requiring listed companies to reveal their executives &quot; pay packages , newspapers have had a field day denouncing greedy bosses . 
Not only are fixed salaries revealed , but so are bonuses , fees for serving on boards of directors , returns on stock options , pension packages , and other perks , such as corporate jets or chauffeur-driven cars . 
But executive remuneration has usually faded from view once the journalistic spotlight shifts elsewhere - that is , until now . 
This year , executive heads have started to roll . 
In June , Antoine Zacharias , chairman and CEO of Vincy , France &apos;s biggest public concessions and construction company , was obliged to resign when a majority of the board of directors judged his remuneration to be outrageous : € 4.3 million in salary , a € 13 million retirement bonus , a € 2.2 million pension , and an estimated € 173 million in stock options . 
But the focus of debate was a € 8 million exceptional bonus that he requested after successfully executing a financial operation at the end of his tenure . 
More recently , Noel Forgeard , the French co-CEO of the Franco-German aeronautical and defence company EADS , was forced to resign under a cloud of suspicion : he sold his EADS shares in March , before the company announced a costly delay in production of the Airbus A380 . 
Whether Forgeard acted illegally is still under investigation , but , with the announcement causing the share price to plummet by 26 % overnight - wiping out € 5.5 billion of the company &apos;s value - his position became untenable . 
Such events have brought old questions back to the fore in almost every rich country : Are bosses being paid too much ? 
Should laws governing stock options be reformed ? 
Although the circumstances are different , the fundamental issues are always the same , for they touch on questions of legitimacy and morality . 
If remuneration is perceived as unjust , trust in the capitalist system will suffer . 
The French debate about executive compensation is particularly striking in this respect , because managers &quot; salaries are in fact lower than those paid to their German , British , and American counterparts , and their remuneration has grown in step with corporate share prices , increasing six-fold in 25 years . 
Moreover , like managers everywhere , their responsibility is great , making their positions less secure , while companies must compete for the relatively few good ones , driving up their price . 
But critics argue that the best managers are not necessarily the best paid , that the market for them is not transparent , and that boards of directors are often partial to their presidents when setting compensation . 
Likewise , they insist that mergers and acquisitions , which make big companies bigger , should not be motivated by salary considerations , and that &quot; golden parachutes &quot; should not be granted to failed managers . 
More fundamentally , they claim that it is simply immoral that bosses should earn as much in a day as their employees do in a year . 
No manager is a superstar , a Tiger Woods or Michael Schumacher of the boardroom . 
Stock options , too , often stir passionate criticism . 
Allowing managers to buy shares at prices fixed in advance was intended to align their interests with those of other shareholders by giving them a personal stake in building the value of the company . 
But , for some managers , stock options have created an incentive to inflate profits and hide losses , thereby enriching themselves artificially while jeopardizing their companies and other shareholders . 
The question is not specific to France . 
In the United States , a recent study by two university professors showed that more than 25 % of the companies reviewed had manipulated the dates of stock-option allowances to increase the profits of the beneficiaries . 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the US Department of Justice apparently decided to fight the &quot; backdating &quot; practices , which where especially common in Silicon Valley . 
In France , a law adopted in 2005 requires that severance pay for company managers now be subject to a shareholder vote , and the EADS scandal has spurred consideration of further legal changes . 
A bill proposed by former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur seeks to eliminate perverse incentives by barring corporate officers from exercising their stock options until they leave the company . 
Jacques Chirac , more cautiously , stated that stock options should be legally &quot; encadrés &quot; ( framed ) . 
Others suggest broadening the scope of stock options to include more employees . 
Some Socialists are more radical , advocating , as Laurent Fabius recently did , the suppression of stock options . 
The problem with legal measures , however , is that they can have pernicious side effects and unintended consequences , especially when they are tailored to a particular crisis . 
The state &apos;s function should be to enact and enforce laws on corporate governance and taxation of managers &quot; compensation . 
In all other areas , legislation cannot serve as a substitute for the exercise of common sense , discernment , and responsibility by a company &apos;s board of directors . 
But if we must have laws to bolster our ethics , their guiding principle should be that remuneration is always linked to the performance and services it is intended to compensate . 
Only measures that ensure that companies reward true merit will be considered legitimate by employees , shareholders , and the public .
