Towards an Asia-Europe Partnership 
BERLIN amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; 
By the decade &apos;s end , China &apos;s economy will be larger than Germany &apos;s . 
By 2040 three of the world &apos;s five largest economies - China , India , and Japan - will be in Asia . 
That is one side of the Asian picture . 
The other side is persistent poverty , lack of development , massive environmental degradation , a widespread rural-urban divide , demographic problems , and troubled banking systems . 
The picture is further complicated by security risks such as nuclear arms proliferation , fundamentalism , and weak or failing governance . 
The sweeping changes underway in Asia are not just economic , but have also created new political realities that cannot be ignored . 
Asian countries now act with much greater self-assurance than in the past . 
Their military budgets are expanding , and there are regional rivalries . 
Thus , along with tremendous opportunities implied by globalization , political risks must also be addressed . 
German and European policymakers must make clear what Europe has to offer Asia , and can do so at this month &apos;s EU / ASEAN and EU / China summits . 
The &quot; soft power &quot; of Europe &apos;s political and social model is well known . 
As an Asian leader once told me , Europeans have what many Asian societies aspire to : democratic government , advanced infrastructure , civil rights , world-class companies , high educational and social standards , and a rich cultural heritage . 
This gives us considerable standing . 
It is crucial to ensure that our European model , with its emphasis on a fair deal for everyone , remains competitive . 
Nevertheless , Germany stands to lose more than any other country from any protectionist-minded retreat from globalization . 
In the first six months of 2007 alone , the value of German exports nearly passed â‚¬ 500 billion . 
But free trade is a two-way street . 
Artificially low exchange rates , restrictions on capital flows , and excessively large currency reserves all create global imbalances . 
Any strategic partnership between Europe and Asia must encourage global economic responsibility based on cooperation and transparency . 
Europe and Asia must jointly commit to an agenda underscoring global resources and sustainability . 
Environmental , climate , and energy issues concern everyone . 
China is already a top carbon dioxide emitter . 
Environmental degradation in Asia not only harms its population &apos;s health , but will become an impediment to growth . 
Growth is important to us in Europe , and it is even more important to Asia &apos;s emerging economies . 
But , as European experience shows , it is often worth sacrificing short-term benefits for the sake of longer-term gain . 
The history of European integration suggests that regional cooperation , give and take , the pursuit of shared goals , and even in some areas the transfer of sovereignty are the best ways to overcome tensions and promote peaceful problem-solving . 
Certain elements of this European path may be relevant to Asia &apos;s own regional cooperation . 
Indeed , Asian trade and commodity flows are increasingly interlinked . 
ASEAN members conduct almost 50 % of their trade within Asia . 
Economic relations between major players such as China and Japan are increasingly close - owing not only to booming trade , but also to direct investment and regional production networks . 
Economic links pave the way for political rapprochement and closer ties . 
ASEAN , together with its affiliated bodies such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit , is the driving force behind the intensification of Asian cooperation , in which security , too , is a factor . 
ASEAN is working with its partners to tackle global issues such as security , energy , and climate change , and its plans for a charter on enhanced cooperation is an encouraging first step toward creating a political architecture . 
This year , the EU &apos;s contacts with ASEAN and its members have become much closer . 
The foreign ministers &quot; meeting held during Germany &apos;s EU Council presidency produced the Nuremberg Declaration , which established a framework for closer EU-ASEAN partnership . 
Europe must become a stakeholder in Asia if both sides are to gain maximum benefit from cooperation and help shape the world of the future . 
In Asia , people increasingly realize that sharing in global prosperity also means sharing responsibility for global peace and development . 
We see this in the higher profile that China has taken in defusing the North Korean nuclear crisis and in drafting the recent Security Council resolution on Darfur . 
With Japan &apos;s upcoming G-8 presidency and the Beijing Olympic Games next year , Asia will be under a spotlight as never before . 
In the light of developments such as in Myanmar , ASEAN must state clearly where it stands . 
This recalibration of global responsibility will have to be a step-by-step process fostering dialogue and stability . 
Here , too , it would be wrong to take an all-or-nothing approach . 
Europe must take Asian views on global governance seriously . 
By the same token , the new Asian players must take into account the progress achieved in this regard in the latter half of the twentieth century . 
The challenge for twenty-first century statecraft will be to devise joint solutions to common problems . 
This was what inspired the Heiligendamm Process launched at this year &apos;s G-8 Summit , which for the first time brought G-8 leaders together with leaders of the world &apos;s major emerging economies , including China , India , Brazil , Mexico , and South Africa . 
There is no inevitable contradiction between European values , on the one hand , and what are deemed Asian values , on the other . 
Where interests conflict and opportunities coexist with tensions , a readiness and capacity for dialogue is the only way forward . 
We have mutually enriching Euro-Asian traditions that could serve as a basis for such a dialogue . 
It is in this context that Europe &apos;s commitment to internal reform , human rights , international law , and responsible governance should be seen . 
Global values are a cause that Europe intends to promote worldwide . 
Obviously , that means meeting the standards that we expect of others . 
In this progressive transformation of the international system , German and European foreign policy will play an active role . 
What is needed is not rhetoric , but levelheaded efforts to find practical and forward-looking solutions to key issues on which regional and international cooperation is urgently required .
