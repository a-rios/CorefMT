Israel &apos;s Centrist Victory 
JERUSALEM - Israel &apos;s election is a victory for centrism and national consensus . 
Indeed , that is the key to understanding not only the vote count , but also Israeli public opinion , the next government , and its policies . 
From experience , most Israelis have developed a worldview that combines traditional left-wing and right-wing thinking . 
On one hand , they want to achieve a comprehensive political solution with the Palestinians based on creating a Palestinian state , in exchange for real , lasting peace . 
On the other hand , they understand that there is no Palestinian leadership strong or moderate enough to bring it about . 
Both the left and the right have been proven wrong . 
The left offered big concessions and was ready to take high risks for the sake of peace . 
Yet there is no credible way to achieve an agreement with such radical forces as Iran , Syria , Hamas , and Hezbollah , all of whom seek Israel &apos;s destruction . 
The Palestinian Authority ( PA ) is less extreme , but its leadership is weak , doesn &apos;t control Gaza , and is still full of hard-line elements . 
This approach also lost credibility as a result of the rise of Hamas and its determination to wage permanent war on Israel ; 
In addition , the world didn &apos;t reward Israel for making concessions and taking risks . 
Indeed , the more Israel gave , the more slander and hostility it faced in many sectors . 
At the same time , the right-wing mantra - victory - failed to offer a credible way to replace the Iranian and Syrian governments , or to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah . 
There is neither the illusion nor the desire to hold onto captured territories permanently , or to build Jewish settlements , and Israel has virtually no international support for any of these goals . 
With alternatives to the status quo constrained , it has become clear that Israel is in a long transitional period in which old ideas don &apos;t work and a new approach is needed . 
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni &apos;s Kadima party , opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s Likud party , and Defense Minister Ehud Barak &apos;s Labor party all fall - with only secondary variations - within a centrist consensus , which also reflects a popular national consensus . 
Thus , regardless of who becomes prime minister , the next government will not commit to real concessions to the Palestinians in exchange for a two-state solution unless the result will be an end to the conflict and a long , stable peace . 
Few believe that the PA and Hamas &apos;s main rival , Fatah , will be willing or able to make such an agreement for decades . 
The same applies to Syria . 
As a result , any real changes affecting the status of Jerusalem , the Golan Heights or West Bank settlements are a long way off . 
Moreover , no deal can be made with Hamas . 
This also means that at some point a big decision may have to be made on attacking Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities . 
As a result of this national consensus - accepted by Labor , Likud , and Kadima , along with many others - the next government will most likely be a national unity government consisting of this trio . Its policy guidelines are already clear : 
· To stress Israel &apos;s willingness to make peace , its readiness to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state , and its refusal to bear responsibility for the continuing conflict and violence ; 
· To preserve the best possible relations with the United States , Europe , and other countries , as long as this does not involve risks to Israel &apos;s national interests or its citizens ; 
· Security cooperation with the PA to prevent terrorist attacks on Israel , in exchange for economic aid and assistance to prevent a Hamas takeover ; 
· To strike back at Hamas - and potentially Hezbollah - based on any attacks against Israel , with the precise response to depend on timing , opportunity , and these groups &quot; behavior ; 
· To work for the international isolation of Iran , Hezbollah , and Hamas ; 
· To negotiate with Syria for peace , though without illusions as to the probability of success . 
The main differences between the leading Israeli parties are more atmospheric than real , mainly concerning how much to concede and how much to demand . 
Even so , Netanyahu will not embark on a settlement-building campaign , and Livni is not about to give away east Jerusalem . 
The most important decision that Israel &apos;s new government is likely to face , when the time comes , is whether the country &apos;s well being and even survival requires acting decisively against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities . 
Which path will be chosen is not clear , but it is far better that a broad coalition be responsible for making such a vital , even existential decision .
