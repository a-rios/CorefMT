Europe &apos;s Bargain 
MILAN - In July , the European Commission published its sixth report on economic , social , and territorial cohesion ( a term that can be roughly translated as equality and inclusiveness ) . 
The report lays out a plan for substantial investment - â‚¬ 450 billion ( $ 583 billion ) from three European Union funds - from 2014 to 2020 . 
Given today &apos;s difficult economic and fiscal conditions , where public-sector investment is likely to be crowded out in national budgets , this program represents a major commitment to growth-oriented public sector investment . 
The EU &apos;s cohesion strategy is admirable and smart . 
Whereas such investment in the past was heavily tilted toward physical infrastructure - particularly transport - the agenda has shifted to a more balanced set of targets , including human capital , employment , the economy &apos;s knowledge and technology base , information technology , low-carbon growth , and governance . 
That said , one can ask what the economic and social returns on these investments will be . 
True , sustaining high growth rates requires sustaining high levels of public investment , which increases the return to ( and hence the levels of ) private investment , in turn elevating output and employment . 
It will do some good in all scenarios , but its impact will be much larger beyond the short term if other binding constraints are removed . 
Three complementary issues seem crucial . 
One , mainly the province of the European Central Bank , involves price stability and the value of the euro . 
The second is fiscal , and the third is structural . 
Inflation rates , now well below the ECB &apos;s 2 % annual target , are in the deflationary danger zone . 
Because deflation drives up the real burden of sovereign debt and public non-debt liabilities such as pension systems , its emergence would undermine the already fragile state of many countries &quot; public finances and kill growth . 
In a post-crisis environment of aggressive and unconventional monetary policy in other advanced countries , the ECB &apos;s less aggressive policies ( owing to its more restrictive mandate ) have resulted in an exchange rate that has damaged competitiveness and the growth potential of many eurozone economies &quot; tradable sectors . 
This is crucial , because most economies experienced pre-crisis growth patterns characterized by unsustainably high levels of domestic aggregate demand . 
So rebalancing requires shifting toward the tradable sector and external demand . 
A weakening euro will help . 
The ECB understands this , and , without being explicit about it , is expanding its asset-purchase programs to elevate inflation and bring down the euro . 
ECB President Mario Draghi has been clear that restoring target inflation and weakening the currency is not a growth strategy . 
Difficult reforms are needed to put many national economies &quot; fiscal affairs in order and to increase their structural flexibility . 
The ECB cannot do it alone . 
On the fiscal side , sovereign-debt levels are too high and still rising . 
It is clearly necessary to implement credible plans to arrest the growth of these liabilities . 
But these liabilities also have to be reduced , because they are already imposing a crushing fiscal burden , largely owing to rapid aging , with rising longevity a major contributor . 
The US has a similar problem , though it is more distant . 
A recent analysis for the US suggests that entitlements programs &quot; liabilities will hit the public budgets in about ten years . 
By contrast , in Italy , for example , with its less favorable demographics , they have already hit . 
Growth would reduce this burden , but growth in the short and medium term is highly problematic . 
Inflation would reduce the real value of both debt and other non-indexed non-debt liabilities . 
Governments could raise taxes to cover a larger fraction of the required expenditures . 
Likewise , issuing more debt to cover the portion of liabilities coming due would merely shift the composition of liabilities without reducing them . 
The only other alternative is direct reduction . 
For sovereign debt , that means default , which will happen only in extreme circumstances ; for non-debt liabilities , it means changing systemic parameters - for example , increasing the retirement age - which is contentious and exceptionally difficult to do politically . 
The third missing ingredient is structural flexibility , which is needed for two reasons . 
First , most advanced economies have maintained the unbalanced growth patterns that led to the global crisis in 2008 . 
Restoring growth requires structural changes . 
In the US , though growth remains well below potential , data suggest that about half of the recovery in growth has resulted from a shift in capital and labor to the tradable side of the economy , with shale gas providing a big boost . 
The exception is Spain , which initiated labor-market reforms in late 2012 . 
Perhaps as these reforms &quot; impact becomes more visible , reform momentum will increase in other countries . 
Even without crisis-related imbalances , structural flexibility in all economies is necessary to adapt to the shifts caused by globalization and the labor-saving and skill-biased technological shifts associated with the rising value of digital capital . 
In the past 30 years , the global economy added 1.5 billion new connected workers in developing countries , with three billion new consumers in sight . 
Digital technologies have eliminated millions of routine white- and blue-collar jobs , and we are rapidly entering the realm of cognitive-based employment . 
If investment in human capital is to keep up with the changing composition of employment , structural flexibility is needed . 
Europe has a real chance to conclude a bargain : member countries implement fiscal and structural reforms in exchange for short-run relaxation of fiscal constraints - not to increase liabilities , but to focus on growth-oriented investments to jump-start sustained recovery . 
Private investors would take note , accelerating the recovery process . 
The challenge now is to seize the opportunity .
