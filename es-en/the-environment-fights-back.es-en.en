The Environment Fights Back 
Our political systems and global politics are largely unequipped for the real challenges of today &apos;s world . 
Global economic growth and rising populations are putting unprecedented stresses on the physical environment , and these stresses in turn are causing unprecedented challenges for our societies . 
Yet politicians are largely ignorant of these trends . 
Governments are not organized to meet them . 
And crises that are fundamentally ecological in nature are managed by outdated strategies of war and diplomacy . 
Consider , for example , the situation in Darfur , Sudan . 
This horrible conflict is being addressed through threats of military force , sanctions , and generally the language of war and peacekeeping . 
Yet the undoubted origin of the conflict is the region &apos;s extreme poverty , which was made disastrously worse in the 1980 &quot; s by a drought that has essentially lasted until today . 
It appears that long-term climate change is leading to lower rainfall not only in Sudan , but also in much of Africa just south of the Sahara Desert - an area where life depends on the rains , and where drought means death . 
Darfur has been caught in a drought-induced death trap , but nobody has seen fit to approach the Darfur crisis from the perspective of long-term development rather than the perspective of war . 
Darfur needs a water strategy more than a military strategy . 
Its seven million people cannot survive without a new approach that gives them a chance to grow crops and water their animals . 
Yet all of the talk at the United Nations is about sanctions and armies , with no path to peace in sight . 
Water stress is becoming a major obstacle to economic development in many parts of the world . 
The water crisis in Gaza is a cause of disease and suffering among Palestinians , and is a major source of underlying tensions between Palestine and Israel . 
Yet again , billions of dollars are spent on bombing and destruction in the region , while virtually nothing is done about the growing water crisis . 
China and India , too , will face growing water crises in the coming years , with potentially horrendous consequences . 
The economic takeoff of these two giants started 40 years ago with the introduction of higher agricultural output and an end to famines . 
Yet part of that increased agricultural output resulted from millions of wells that were sunk to tap underground water supplies for irrigation . 
Now the water table is falling at a dangerous pace , as the underground water is being pumped much faster than the rains are recharging it . 
Moreover , aside from rainfall patterns , climate change is upsetting the flow of rivers , as glaciers , which provide a huge amount of water for irrigation and household use , are rapidly receding due to global warming . 
Snow pack in the mountains is melting earlier in the season , so that river water is less available during summer growing seasons . 
For all of these reasons , India and China are experiencing serious water crises that are likely to intensify in the future . 
The United States faces risks as well . 
Midwestern and southwestern states have been in a prolonged drought that might well be the result of long-term warming , and the farm states rely heavily on water from a huge underground reservoir that is being depleted by over-pumping . 
Just as pressures on oil and gas supplies have driven up energy prices , environmental stresses may now push up food and water prices in many parts of the world . 
Given the heat waves , droughts , and other climate stresses across the US , Europe , Australia , and elsewhere this year , wheat prices are now shooting up to their highest levels in decades . 
Thus , environmental pressures are now hitting the bottom line - affecting incomes and livelihoods around the world . 
With rising populations , economic growth , and climate change , we will face intensifying droughts , hurricanes and typhoons , powerful El Ni√±o &apos;s , water stress , heat waves , species extinctions , and more . 
The &quot; soft &quot; issues of environment and climate will become the hard and strategic issues of the twenty-first century . 
Yet there is almost no recognition of this basic truth in our governments or our global politics . 
People who speak about hunger and environmental crises are viewed as muddle-headed &quot; moralists , &quot; as opposed to the hard-headed &quot; realists &quot; who deal with war and peace . 
This is nonsense . 
The so-called realists just don &apos;t understand the sources of tensions and stresses that are leading to a growing number of crises around the world . 
Our governments should all establish Ministries of Sustainable Development , devoted full-time to managing the linkages between environmental change and human well-being . 
Agriculture ministers by themselves will not be able to cope with water shortages that farmers will face . 
Health ministers will not be able to cope with an increase in infectious diseases due to global warming . 
Environment ministers will not be able to cope with the pressures on oceans and forests , or the consequences of increasing extreme weather events like last year &apos;s Hurricane Katrina or this year &apos;s Typhoon Saomai - China &apos;s worst in many decades . 
A new powerful ministry should be charged with coordinating the responses to climate change , water stress , and other ecosystem crises . 
At the global level , the world &apos;s governments should finally understand that the treaties that they have all signed in recent years on climate , environment , and biodiversity are at least as important to global security as all of the war zones and crisis hotspots that grab the headlines , budgets , and attention . 
By focusing on the underlying challenges of sustainable development , our governments could more easily end the current crises ( as in Darfur ) and head off many more crises in the future .
