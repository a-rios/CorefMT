The Kingdom Betrayed ? 
LONDON - The old saying &quot; lonely is the head that wears the crown &quot; has literally taken on new meaning for Saudi Arabia &apos;s King Abdullah . 
Not only has he watched close regional allies , Egypt &apos;s President Hosni Mubarak and Yemen &apos;s Ali Abdullah Saleh , be toppled , but fellow crowned heads in Bahrain , Morocco , and Jordan have also felt their thrones quake from public protest . 
Now the Kingdom &apos;s longtime protector , the United States , which let down Abdullah by ( reluctantly ) embracing the Arab Spring , is poised to pull its troops out of neighboring Iraq . 
Who , Abdullah wonders , will keep the Iranian wolf from the Kingdom &apos;s door ? 
According to a security agreement reached with Iraq &apos;s government , the US is to withdraw its forces by the end of this year . 
Saudi Arabia , along with its Sunni-ruled Gulf neighbors , is anxious that some US troops remain in Iraq to help keep a resurgent Iran at bay . 
The US government does not need to be convinced about that , but the American people - and ordinary Iraqis - want to see the troops go home . 
No Iraqi political faction wants to be blamed for prolonging the occupation , but most , with the exception of Muqtada al-Sadr &apos;s movement , will agree to extend America &apos;s military presence by another five years . 
Although the US and the Gulf monarchies share a fear of Iran , much else about Iraq and the region is now in dispute . 
Saudi Arabia still loathes the idea of a democratic Iraq under majority Shia rule . 
The Shia , considered apostates by the Kingdom &apos;s Wahhabi establishment , are viewed as a threat to the Saudi state &apos;s legitimacy and existence , not only because of Iran &apos;s power , but also because of the Kingdom &apos;s large , indigenous Shia population , which is concentrated around the country &apos;s oil fields . 
Ever since the fall of Saddam Hussein , the US has urged Saudi Arabia to invest politically and economically in Iraq . 
Instead , Saudi authorities treated Iraq &apos;s leaders with contempt and closed their eyes to Wahhabi fatwas that encouraged jihadi volunteers to fight against the Shia &quot; apostates . &quot; 
By shunning Shia-dominated Iraq , Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and the Gulf states have virtually no influence in Baghdad , thus leaving the field open to Iran . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s fears about Iraq are driven by security concerns . 
Despite the bloody civil war that followed Saddam Hussein &apos;s ouster , Iraq still believes that it has a right to regional leadership . 
The region &apos;s monarchs , however , have excluded Iraq from the Gulf Cooperation Council . 
Saudi Arabia , fearing that any role for Iraq in determining regional security would diminish Saudi political and military dominance among the Gulf countries , has still not opened an embassy in Baghdad . 
Saudi Arabia also fears that Iraq will regain its oil-output quota within OPEC , which the country couldn &apos;t meet , owing to poor security and infrastructure constraints . 
The Saudis suspect that rising oil prices will revive Iraq &apos;s economy , and that of Iran , thus boosting their regional clout . 
This explains the Kingdom &apos;s eagerness to increase oil production , which would weaken its competitors &quot; economies ( and please the West ) . 
So the Saudi and Sunni Gulf rulers want to keep US military forces in Iraq partly in order to keep the country down . 
Indeed , Kuwait refuses to forgive Iraq &apos;s Saddam-era debts , and is building a port at Mubarak al-Kabir , which Iraqis view as a naked attempt to suffocate Iraq &apos;s already limited access to the Persian Gulf . 
And Bahrain has responded to Iraqi criticism of its political repression by halting its national airline &apos;s flights to Baghdad , Beirut , and Teheran , all perceived to be Shia demons . 
The majority of Iraqis deeply resent Saudi Arabia - and with good reason . 
Saudi jihadis were at the heart of the mayhem that killed hundreds of thousands in the years immediately following the 2003 US-led invasion . 
The Saudis even spent billions of dollars to build a security wall along its vast border with Iraq , in order to contain the violence that it was exporting there . 
But the real protective shield for the Gulf rulers is the presence of US troops in Iraq , because the Kingdom &apos;s blinkered strategists failed to see that a failure to engage with post-Saddam Iraq would leave the field open to Iran . 
But the Saudi dream of turning back the clock and to a minority Sunni-ruled Iraq made realistic diplomacy impossible . 
Despite this failure , Iraq continues to be shunned by the region &apos;s Sunni-controlled states . 
Iraq has attempted to forge a political role for itself within the Arab world by participating in Arab summits , but when its turn came to play host , the summit was postponed for a year , owing partly to the Arab spring , but also to some Gulf countries &quot; refusal to participate in a meeting held in Baghdad . 
In the Saudi view , a US military exit would mean handing the entire country to Iran . 
The Saudis could well be right : the departure of US troops would represent a sweeping victory for Iran , which has no military presence in Iraq , but is the strongest player there . 
No other country allied to the US , not even Turkey , could equal Iranian influence in the country . 
America &apos;s military withdrawal from Iraq will indeed be a gift to Iran . 
But that is entirely because the Saudis have behaved since 2003 as if they feared Iraq &apos;s Shia - and their own - much more than they do the Iranian regime .
