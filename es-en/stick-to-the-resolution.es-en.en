Stick to the Resolution 
MELBOURNE - The international military intervention in Libya is not about bombing for democracy or for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s head - let alone keeping oil prices down or profits up . 
Legally , morally , politically , and militarily , it has only one justification : protecting Libyans from the kind of murderous harm that Qaddafi inflicted on unarmed protestors four weeks ago ; has continued to inflict on those who oppose him in the areas that his forces control ; and has promised to inflict on his opponents in Benghazi and other rebel-held territory . 
When that job is done , the military &apos;s job will be done . 
Regime change is for the Libyan people themselves to achieve . 
It should not be necessary to rearticulate and reargue these basic points . 
But it is . 
Despite the best efforts of US President Barack Obama , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , and others who have stayed admirably focused and consistent , other voices - from the right , the left , and the simply muddled - are now capturing media attention , and are beginning to drown , or at least confuse , the basic message . 
US Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman , for example , have said that the aim must be not only to protect civilians , but also to drive Qaddafi from power . 
British Defense Minister Liam Fox has suggested that Qaddafi could be targeted . 
And from the other side , many commentators - anxiously or cynically , according to taste - have drawn parallels with Iraq and other past misuses of Western military power . 
Many others talk of being drawn inexorably into an Afghanistan-style quagmire . 
To clarify the issues , the best place to start is with the two UN Security Council resolutions . 
The first , Resolution 1970 , adopted on February 26 , invoked &quot; the Libyan authorities &quot; responsibility to protect its population , &quot; condemned its violence against civilians , demanded that this violence stop , and sought to concentrate Qaddafi &apos;s mind by applying targeted sanctions , an arms embargo , and the threat of prosecution for crimes against humanity . 
The follow-up Resolution 1973 , adopted on March 17 , deplored the failure to comply with Resolution 1970 , reasserted a determination to ensure the protection of civilians , and called for an immediate ceasefire and a complete end to violent attacks against and abuses of civilians . 
Then , for the first time ever , the Council explicitly authorized military intervention by member states to achieve these objectives . 
Coercive military action was allowed to take two forms : &quot; all necessary measures &quot; to enforce a no-fly zone , and &quot; all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack . &quot; 
Boots on the ground - &quot; a foreign occupation force &quot; - were expressly excluded . 
The language of these resolutions could hardly be clearer in prescribing the scope and limits of what should be done . 
In the case of enforcing the no-fly zone , Resolution 1973 allows the destruction , by aircraft or missile , of any loyalist jet or helicopter that takes off , any pro-Qaddafi forces &quot; anti-aircraft batteries or missile-launch sites , and the disabling of any airstrip . 
And , as for the wider mandate to protect civilians , the resolution allows airborne attacks to knock out tanks or troop columns advancing on Benghazi or other rebel-held towns , and - should they exist - concentrations of forces within those areas that pose a direct and immediate threat to Qaddafi &apos;s opponents . 
In both cases , some questions do arise at the margin . 
Is it within the scope of the no-fly zone to take out command and control centers that might direct aircraft ? 
Can it possibly be legitimate to kill regime forces actually fleeing from a protected area , or in some other way posing no obvious or imminent threat to civilians ? 
Should a line be drawn against any otherwise legitimate action against Qaddafi &apos;s forces that would be likely to put innocent civilians at risk ? 
Beyond these questions , there is nothing to debate . 
Military action expressly designed to kill Qaddafi or force him into exile , to ensure a rebel victory in a civil war , or to achieve a more open and responsive system of government in Libya is not permissible under the explicit terms of Resolution 1973 . 
True , one or more of these results might , conceivably , be the effect of permissible military action , but they cannot be its objective . 
It also follows from these legal and moral first principles that once there are reasonable grounds for confidence that the threat to civilian populations has been removed or neutralized ( as seems now to be largely the case , at least in the east ) , military action should cease . 
Of course , a close watch should be maintained , so that enforcement action under Resolution 1973 can be very quickly reinstated . 
But offshore-based airborne action , with a sharply defined and limited objective , is much less susceptible to the kind of mission-creep and quagmire problems that often beset intervening ground forces , especially those with an inherently confused mandate , as in Afghanistan . 
As the situation in Libya and the wider Middle East unfolds , policymakers are bound to face further acute dilemmas , not least in responding to continuing repression in Tripoli , or the similarly ugly and fragile situations in Bahrain and Yemen . 
Mustering the cross-cultural political will to give the responsibility to protect real - and consistent - teeth will always be difficult . 
But , at least in the case of Libya , a vital precedent has been set . 
The Security Council has written the right script ; we must now make sure that we follow it .
