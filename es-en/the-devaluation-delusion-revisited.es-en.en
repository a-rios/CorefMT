The Devaluation Delusion Revisited 
&quot; The dollar is our currency and your problem . &quot; 
So America &apos;s Treasury Secretary quipped before President Nixon pulled the plug on the Bretton Woods system three decades ago . 
What John Connolly &apos;s bluntness reflected was America &apos;s ability - and willingness - to export its economic problems by driving down the dollar &apos;s value while scapegoating countries opposed to that strategy . 
President George W. Bush seems hell-bent on repeating Nixon &apos;s misbegotten policy . 
Like the Nixon / Connolly team , the Bush administration is responding to America &apos;s massive budget and trade deficits by letting the dollar fall - and hard  - while it also tries to distract attention from its responsibility by pointing an accusing finger at China as the cause for both US joblessness and deflationary pressures . 
This strategy , however , is likely to prove as ineffective now as it was for Nixon , who succeeded only in ushering in an era of stagnation . 
Bush &apos;s policy is doomed to fail because , as in the 1970 &apos;s , America &apos;s economic problems are homegrown . 
They are not imported and cannot be fixed merely by changing the dollar &apos;s value . 
The world &apos;s reliance on the US as the one source of growth in global demand buttresses America &apos;s currency power play , but at the cost of aggravating vast global imbalances . 
Since 2000 , America &apos;s excess productive capacity has outstripped the Euro area and Japan combined , its economy growing far more slowly than its 3.5 % to 4 % annual potential , with US unemployment rising . 
This pitiful performance incites angry cries that American jobs are disappearing abroad , and that low-cost exports may result in deflation . 
Sadly , America is not alone in viewing devaluation as a panacea for domestic problems . 
Too timid to undertake serious reforms at home , Japanese authorities fight to keep the yen &apos;s value as low as possible against the dollar and rival Asian currencies . 
Similarly , the European Union created the euro to give its members increased currency stability . 
When the euro was down , wounded pride forced EU governments to try talking it up . 
The euro &apos;s dizzying trade-weighted ascent over the past year is , indeed , exacerbating near-term pressures within the EU . 
But the Union &apos;s finance ministers would be better off pushing the internal reforms Europe needs , rather than following the Bush example and pressing the European Central Bank to force a strong currency down to earth . 
Yet America &apos;s currency strategy is the most reckless - another mighty error in an economic policy so wayward that it is hard to know where to begin listing the mistakes . 
Perhaps the best place to start is with the speedy deterioration in America &apos;s federal budget in the past two years . 
From a surplus of 1.4 % of GDP in 2000 , the Bush administration has delivered a deficit of 4.6 % of GDP this year . 
US budget deficits may have spared America and the world economy even worse performances over the past two years , but fixing what ails the US is now far more difficult . 
Tightening fiscal policy would go a long way towards boosting confidence in the US . 
Growth elsewhere might help America export more . 
This is partly because the final price of an imported good reflects numerous costs such as distribution and marketing , which are unaffected by the exchange rate . 
Indeed , many countries that export to the US - especially Japan and China - price their goods in dollars . 
Because these countries are keen to maintain their share in the world &apos;s biggest market , they often absorb the effect of a drop in the dollar by cutting their profits rather than raise prices . 
As a recent study by J.P. Morgan &apos;s Chief Economist John Lipsky shows , the link between exchange rates and trade is weakening . 
What makes US strategy reckless is that the Bush administration is attacking China at the very moment that America &apos;s dependence on Chinese purchases of US government bonds is growing . 
Without these purchases , the US might face a rise in domestic interest rates that could threaten both its economic recovery and the global economy . 
Moreover , if China decided to sell its dollar holdings , the bond market would discount US government securities , raising US long-term interest rates and canceling much ( perhaps all ) of whatever stimulus has been provided by the dollar &apos;s depreciation . 
Luckily , China &apos;s government knows that America &apos;s advice to let the renminbi float right now is dangerous - both to China and for the world economy . 
Policies intended to benefit one country &apos;s economy at the expense of another , such as competitive devaluations , were widespread during the Great Depression of the 1930 &apos;s . 
So it is bizarre that , today , leaders in the world &apos;s strongest economies are dabbling in such dangerous nonsense again . 
But with presidential elections looming , no US government would cut spending or raise taxes . 
The silver lining here is that this failure may revive the realization that no country - not even mighty America - can devalue its way out of trouble .
