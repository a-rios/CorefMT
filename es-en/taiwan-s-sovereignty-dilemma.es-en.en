Taiwan \ u0027s Sovereignty Dilemma 
To allay China &apos;s fury over his private trip to Taiwan this summer before becoming Singapore &apos;s prime minister , Lee Hsien Loong said that his country will not support Taiwan should it declare formal independence from mainland China . 
Indeed , no country , declared Lee , would take a different line . 
This diplomatic strike occurred at roughly the same time that Taiwan was failing - for the thirteenth time - in its bid to re-enter the United Nations , having been expelled when China was admitted in 1971 . 
While Taiwanese athletes competed in the recent Athens Olympics , advertisements supporting the team were removed on its arrival at Athens airport . 
Returning home from a trip to three Central American allies , Premier Yu Shyi-kun &apos;s entourage was forced to transit in Okinawa to escape the effects of Typhoon Aere , inciting a protest from China against Japan &apos;s government . 
Such symbolic politics forms a key part of the mainland &apos;s relentless effort to isolate Taiwan internationally . 
To display its displeasure at Lee Hsien Loong &apos;s visit , China &apos;s government warned Singapore that a bilateral free-trade deal might be in jeopardy . 
Commenting on Taiwan &apos;s UN application , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan demanded that Taipei stop pursuing its &quot; two China &apos;s &quot; policy . 
China &apos;s diplomatic offensive against Taiwan escalated in early August , when President Hu Jintao telephoned US President George W. Bush to demand a halt to the sale of advanced weapons to Taiwan . 
Hu told Bush that the Taiwan issue was &quot; very sensitive , &quot; and that China would &quot; absolutely not tolerate Taiwan independence . &quot; 
As a result of such pressure , Taiwan has become the most isolated country in modern history , which is all the more glaring in view of its economic and political success . 
Indeed , that anomaly , if not rectified , is increasingly dangerous . 
Frustrated by a lack of recognition , popular disgust in Taiwan with terms like &quot; China &quot; and &quot; Chinese &quot; is rising . 
Although opinion polls indicate that a majority still supports the status quo , many are beginning to believe that if the country &apos;s official name , the Republic of China , is not acceptable to the international community , then another name might be . 
Millions of people took to the streets during the presidential election last March to demand a name change . 
The latest source of contention - both on the domestic front and in relations with the mainland - concerns whether to write a new constitution . 
Enacted in Nanjing before the Chiang Kai-chek &apos;s Kuomintang government resettled in Taipei after the Chinese Civil War of the 1940 &apos;s , Taiwan &apos;s constitution is considered by some an anachronism , unfit for a democracy with a population of over 23 million . 
Within Taiwan , the debate over constitutional reform has led to disturbing developments . 
Most worryingly , it has heightened tensions between Taiwan &apos;s various ethnic groups over national identity and relations with China . 
Of course , Taiwan &apos;s parlous relations with China have suffered further as a result , with China &apos;s government denouncing calls for a new constitution as a calculated move towards independence . 
China &apos;s Taiwan Affairs Office issued a warning on the eve of President Chen Shui-bian &apos;s inauguration in May , forcing Taipei to choose between war and peace . 
Alarmed by a potential conflict between the two archrivals , the Bush administration urged Chen , who won a second term in March , to exercise restraint . 
Consequently , in his inauguration speech on May 20 , Chen promised to amend the constitution via the current mechanism , rather than adopting an entirely new constitution via referendum . 
But the passage of recent constitutional reforms by the Legislative Yuan illustrates the continuing volatility of the situation . 
In addition to replacing the multi-member-district , single-vote electoral system with a single-member-district , two-round voting system , the amendment reduces the number of seats in the Yuan by half . 
The reforms have been lauded as a crucial step towards a more stable two-party system . 
Similarly , a higher electoral threshold for winning seats should counter vote buying by candidates . 
For China , however , the reforms are a smoke screen erected by Taiwan &apos;s government . 
China fears that the government still wants to write a new constitution - one from which Taiwanese independence would be derived . 
This senseless political warfare has hampered cross-strait economic relations . 
Bilateral trade turnover reached $ 50 billion in 2003 , and Taiwanese took almost four million trips to the mainland . 
It is imperative for both economies that direct transport links be established immediately . 
But , here , too , political sensitivities loom large . 
China wants the link defined as domestic in nature , with rights reserved exclusively to airlines registered on either side , while Taiwan insists that services be open to foreign competition . 
Thus does the fight over sovereignty overshadow all bilateral issues . 
Indeed , with China bent on unification , it refuses even to define relations with Taiwan as &quot; bilateral , &quot; while China &apos;s growing global influence suggests that Taiwan &apos;s diplomatic fortunes are not about to improve . 
That , however , may merely strengthen support in Taiwan for independence as the only way out .
