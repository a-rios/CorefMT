Can China Avoid Deflation ? 
BERLIN - In his speech at the 2015 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos , Chinese Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged that China &apos;s economy is facing strong headwinds . 
Annual GDP growth in 2014 was 7.4 % , the lowest rate since 1990 . 
But , to stabilize economic growth , he pledged that China will &quot; continue to pursue a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy . &quot; 
China &apos;s current economic slowdown was policy-induced . 
During the last two years , the government has tightened fiscal and monetary policy , in the hope of offsetting the adverse effects of the large stimulus package implemented in response to the 2008 global financial crisis . 
Li &apos;s Davos speech was intended to signal that the Chinese government will not allow the growth rate to slip further . 
China &apos;s stimulus package was by far the world &apos;s largest and most effectively implemented . 
It stabilized growth in China and moderated the global economic contraction . 
But it left in its wake some serious problems for the Chinese economy . 
Most important , the country &apos;s economy has become highly leveraged . 
Housing prices shot up , real-estate developers borrowed recklessly , and local governments became heavily indebted . 
As a result , broad money ( M2 ) increased rapidly , and now stands at more than two times China &apos;s GDP - one of the highest levels in the world . 
This flood of money rang alarm bells for Li and President Xi Jinping when they took office in early 2013 . 
The government has since reined in money-supply growth and started to impose limits on local governments &quot; borrowing . 
Monetary expansion has decelerated . 
The budget law has been revised to allow local governments to issue government bonds , and their borrowing from commercial banks is being closely monitored . 
These policies have raised capital costs , with monetary tightening , in particular , taking a large toll on local governments and real estate developers . 
Because slower growth forces them to borrow new money to pay their maturing debts , interest rates are bid up , and businesses in the real economy are crowded out , creating a further drag on growth . 
Meanwhile , producer prices have been falling , while consumer prices are flat . 
So , like much of the rest of the world , China is facing the risk of deflation . 
Indeed , global deflationary pressure would have emerged much sooner had China not launched its two-year stimulus plan in 2008 , which boosted investment demand and thus delayed the fall in world commodity prices . 
Now that the fall has arrived , domestic deflation has become a real threat , particularly given slower domestic fiscal expansion . 
That is why China &apos;s government would do well to recall the Asian financial crisis of 1997 . 
In response to Deng Xiaoping &apos;s famous tour to the south , which provided a needed boost to the reform process , investment increased rapidly in the first half of the 1990s . 
As a result , China &apos;s annual inflation rate soared to an all-time high of 24 % in 1994 . 
The government &apos;s subsequent measures to curb inflation might have engineered a soft landing ; but the financial crisis hit China severely , leading to six years of deflation . 
The main lesson of the Asian financial crisis - or , for that matter , of any financial crisis - is that deflation is the ultimate threat to recovery . 
Because the 1997 crisis was confined to East Asia , China was able to escape deflation after it joined the World Trade Organization . 
But today is different . 
The entire world is in the grip of deflationary forces . 
If China enters the vortex , its trade partners will not be able to pull it out this time . 
So the key question for China &apos;s government is whether the country can do so on its own . 
The proactive fiscal policy that Li pledged at Davos will help , but monetary policy also needs to change . 
The conundrum facing China &apos;s authorities is that monetary expansion would merely fuel a run-up in asset prices , rather than resulting in higher credit flows to the real economy . 
The blockages used to be local governments and zombie real-estate developers . 
But that is likely to change this year . 
Borrowing by local governments will be strictly monitored , and their new debt financing will come mainly from government bonds . 
And , though most observers believe that China &apos;s first-tier cities ( Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and Shenzhen ) will still struggle in 2015 to digest the huge housing stock they built up in recent years , some second- and third-tier cities have already reached the bottom , and have started to recover . 
China is the largest trading country in the world , prompting calls for Chinese leaders to assume greater responsibility for the overall health of the global economy . 
China &apos;s post-crisis stimulus package demonstrated the authorities &quot; willingness to do so . 
Likewise , the government &apos;s anti-deflation effort will help not only China , but the rest of the world as well .
