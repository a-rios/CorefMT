The Myth of &quot; Superstar Cities &quot; 
In a much-talked-about recent paper entitled &quot; Superstar Cities , &quot; economists Joseph Gyourko , Christopher Mayer , and Todd Sinai argue that such high-status cities - not only London , Paris , and New York , but also cities like Philadelphia and San Diego - may show an &quot; ever-widening gap in housing values &quot; when compared with other cities . 
The authors seem to be saying , in effect , that a housing boom in these areas can go on forever . 
Any claim like that will inevitably attract attention . 
As a well-known skeptic about booming housing prices , I have been asked on several recent occasions to participate in debates with one or another of the authors . 
Many people view the superstar city theory as confirming their hunch that , despite the current slowdown in home prices elsewhere ( particularly in the United States ) , investors can expect to make huge long-term gains by buying homes in these cities , even though the homes there are already expensive . 
But , as I have said in my debates with the authors , if one reads their paper carefully and thinks about the issues , one would see that there is no reason at all to draw such a conclusion . 
Why should home values in glamour cities increase forever ? 
Gyourko , Mayer , and Sinai justify their claim by arguing that these cities really are unique . 
They have only limited land , and if one assumes ever-increasing GDP and rising income inequality , there will always be more and more wealthy people to bid up prices in these scarce areas . 
They show convincing evidence for these basic facts . 
Rich people increasingly populate the most expensive cities . 
Real GDP has been increasing at around 3 % a year in advanced countries , and even faster recently in many emerging countries . 
And , of course , we aren &apos;t getting any more land in these cities . 
But what do these arguments really mean for the outlook for investments in homes in superstar cities ? 
Let us consider the fixity of land . 
While there is only so much land in any one of the existing superstar cities , in every case , there are vast amounts of land where a new city could be started . 
And new cities are started , taking away from the &quot; uniqueness &quot; of existing cities . 
The best-known examples of such grand new cities are planned capitals , typically built near countries &quot; geographic center . 
In each of these cases , a planner built the whole city infrastructure to make it a cohesive , attractive place . 
The obvious success of these cities , as both government and economic centers , attests to the fact that urban land derives value from the presence of a well-planned city there . 
Where land today is cheap , it will have great value in the future if only someone takes the dramatic step of planning and creating a whole city there . 
True , the establishment of such cities is a relatively rare event . 
Private developers have trouble getting a large plot free of restrictions . 
But they tend to be ingenious at developing glamorous new areas from little towns within an hour &apos;s commute from major cities . 
It happens in so many places and so regularly that we take it for granted and rarely even notice it . 
Indeed , since the industrial revolution , the development of such new urban areas is a central theme in the history of the world . 
New cities are constantly ripening like so many cherries on a tree , drawing people away from older , original cities . 
And the new cities have a way of looking brighter and fresher than the old urban areas , which are often seen as jumbled and decaying . 
How much might we expect a home in a famous city to outperform other real estate as a long-term investment ? 
The answer : not much at all . 
Prices in the cities that Gyourko , Mayer , and Sinai identify as superstars generally appreciated by no more than one or two percent a year more than in the average city from 1950 to 2000 , and even that difference is probably largely due to an increase in the size and quality of homes . 
According to the Coldwell Banker Home Price Comparison Index , which compares the price of a standard 2,200 square-foot four-bedroom house across cities , the most expensive city in the US is Beverly Hills ( the legendary home of movie stars ) . 
The standard home there is 4.25 times as expensive as one in an average city in the US . 
Assuming that quadrupling of relative value occurred over a hundred years , the excess return on investment amounts to only 1.5 % per year - hardly the kind of performance that real estate enthusiasts are expecting . 
Finally , as Gyourko , Mayer , and Sinai themselves note , even these small long-term differences in home price across cities have tended to be offset by lower rent-price ratios in the superstar cities . 
For an investor , the rate of return is the sum of the rate of appreciation and the rent-price ratio , so the low rent-price ratio reduces the advantage of faster appreciation . 
Most of the popular attention that the &quot; superstar cities &quot; theory has received merely reflects the psychology of the housing boom that we have been seeing , as well as a wishful thinking bias . 
People want to believe that the boom will continue , and that their investments in their favorite city are thus special and exciting . 
But there is no generally applicable reason to make aggressive investments in superstar cities . 
On the contrary , there are many reasons to worry about investing in such places .
