Africa &apos;s Dictator-Diplomat 
BRUSSELS - The recent death in Brussels of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi finally brings to light what lay behind his mysterious two-month disappearance from public life . 
Ethiopia &apos;s government had strenuously denied rumors of serious ill health caused by liver cancer . 
Now that the worst has , indeed , proven true , Ethiopia and all of East Africa will need to learn to live without the stabilizing influence of its great dictator-diplomat . 
Meles was certainly both . 
Ethiopia has undergone a remarkable transformation under his strongman rule since 1991 , when his Tigrayan minority group from the country &apos;s north came to power with the overthrow of the odious Communist Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam ( still enjoying a comfortable retirement in Robert Mugabe &apos;s Zimbabwe ) . 
Initially serving as the president of the first post-Derg government , and then as Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister from 1995 until his death , Meles ( his nom de guerre in the revolution ) oversaw 7.7 % annual GDP growth in recent years . 
Strong economic performance is somewhat surprising , given his party &apos;s interventionist policy approach , but Meles showed himself to be a consummate pragmatist in attracting investment - particularly from China - to drive growth . 
Meles &apos;s own political provenance as the leader of the Tigrayan People &apos;s Liberation Front was Marxist-Leninist . 
But , when the Cold War ended , so , too , did his dogmatism . 
To his credit , child mortality was reduced by 40 % under his government ; 
Once a basket-case associated in the world &apos;s eyes only with famine and drought , Ethiopia has become one of Africa &apos;s largest economies - and without the benefit of gold or oil . 
Perhaps more important than Meles &apos;s domestic achievements was his diplomatic record . 
He was an indispensable ally of the West in the fight against Islamist terrorism , culminating in Ethiopia &apos;s military operation in neighboring Somalia in 2006 . 
More recently , Meles coordinated efforts with Kenya to stage limited strikes against the al-Shabaab militia , which has waged an unrelenting war to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy . 
At the same time , Meles courted China as both an investor and as a hedge against the West &apos;s criticism of his human-rights record . 
And yet he controversially but rightly held out a hand of friendship to the breakaway region of Somaliland , before it became fashionable , and went as far as he could short of formal re-recognition of that ray of democratic hope in the Horn of Africa . 
Meles will be sorely missed in Hargeisa , as he planned to run a Chinese-financed gas pipeline through Somaliland territory from the Ogaden to the coast . 
More important , Meles put Addis Ababa on the map as the home of the African Union , and as a capital where Africa &apos;s worst problems could be discussed in a pragmatic manner , unburdened by colonial grudges . 
Meles himself became a major diplomatic player , particularly over climate-change policy , and most recently was active in mediating border and natural-resource disputes between Sudan and the newly independent ( and oil-rich ) South Sudan . 
He will be remembered for accepting the painful secession of Eritrea in 1993 , rather than prolong the civil war , and for his efforts to reach an agreement with Egypt over the use of the Blue Nile waters . 
The great stain on Meles &apos;s record will always be his intolerance of dissent . 
To be sure , his human-rights record was far better than the Derg &apos;s . 
For example , he allowed a private press to flourish , and in 2000 he became the first Ethiopian leader to hold multi-party parliamentary elections . 
Moreover , compared to neighboring Eritrea under President Isaias Afewerki or Omar al-Bashir &apos;s Sudan , his regime was by no means the worst offender in the region . 
Nor was there much evidence of personal enrichment or widespread corruption . 
Nevertheless , following a violently contested parliamentary election in 2005 , in which more than 30 parties participated , Meles demonstrated open contempt for democratic pluralism and press freedom , jailing several journalists in recent years . 
At the same time , he imposed increasingly strict central control on his ethnically and linguistically diverse country . 
Although nominally governed by &quot; ethnic federalism , &quot; where this threatened secession , as in Oromia or the Ogaden , Meles was quick to ignore the constitutional set-up . 
Although he strengthened religious freedom and peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians , the human-rights situation in Ethiopia remained poor . 
For example , groups like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented widespread official repression of the Oromo people . 
And yet Meles is irreplaceable - unmatched intellectually as an African leader ( he dropped out of medical school , but went on to teach himself impeccable English and obtain European university degrees by correspondence ) , and unmatched politically at home , with no obvious successor groomed to replace him . 
In the Horn of Africa , there is no leader of his stature who could ensure the stability and strong governance that the region so desperately needs . 
Hailemariam Desalegn , Meles &apos;s foreign minister , will take over Ethiopia &apos;s government . 
But there will be considerable concern in the West about the danger of a power vacuum or struggle in a geopolitically vital but fractious country - and just when neighboring Somalia is supposed to be undergoing a transition to a new parliament and elected government . 
For his admirers and critics alike , Meles leaves behind a potent political legacy . 
He will be remembered as an African leader of major historical significance : visionary , despotic , and indispensable .
