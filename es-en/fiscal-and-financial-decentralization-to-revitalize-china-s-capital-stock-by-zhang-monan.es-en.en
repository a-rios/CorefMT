Chinese Reform Goes Local 
BEIJING - Since the eruption of the global financial crisis in 2008 , China has used massive economic stimulus to sustain GDP growth . 
But unresolved structural problems have meant that the stimulus packages generated significant fiscal and financial risk , while doing little to improve China &apos;s capital stock . 
Indeed , while China &apos;s overall capital stock is by no means small , capital-structure and maturity mismatches have led to the accumulation of massive volumes of non-performing assets , undermining China &apos;s economic stability and financial efficiency . 
In order to create the stability needed to reach the next stage of economic development , China must shift its focus from sustaining high GDP growth toward revitalizing its capital stock . 
China &apos;s new leadership seems to recognize this . 
Premier Li Keqiang has declared that the government will not introduce any additional economic stimulus ; instead , the authorities will pursue profound and comprehensive economic reform , even if that means slower GDP growth . 
Moreover , Li has called upon the banking sector to reinvigorate idle capital and allocate incremental capital more effectively . 
And the State Council recently published Guidelines for the Structural Adjustment , Transformation , and Upgrading of the Financially Supported Economy , which outlines ten key measures for revitalizing the capital stock . 
This implies major macroeconomic reforms . 
China &apos;s government is now attempting fiscal decentralization to revitalize the public-finance position , while adopting financial decentralization to maintain currency stability . 
Indeed , the quest for macroeconomic balance has become the government &apos;s main economic-policy goal . 
Over the last three decades , the gradual decentralization of China &apos;s fiscal-management system enabled it to regulate fiscal transfers to sub-national governments , with the primary aim of clarifying revenue and expenditure at all levels of government . 
Why , then , did local-government balance sheets swing from surplus to deficit over the same period ? 
In 1994 , China &apos;s economic-reform process reached a turning point with the introduction of a tax-distribution system that reduced the proportion of tax revenue held by local governments from 78 % in 1993 to 52 % in 2011 , while raising the proportion of expenditure from 72 % to 85 % over the same period . 
Faced with intense competition to contribute to GDP growth , local governments were compelled to seek other ways to augment fiscal revenue . 
As a result , they turned to land transfers and debt financing , exacerbating the problem of soft budget constraints . 
Cash-strapped local governments began seizing farmland in order to sell it to commercial real-estate developers , while accumulating massive debt through off-balance-sheet loans and short-term interbank funding to finance local-government investment vehicles and real-estate investment . 
In doing so , they dramatically increased their financial vulnerability . 
By the end of 2012 , the combined liabilities of 36 of the most indebted local governments totaled roughly Â¥ 3.8 trillion ( $ 620 billion ) , up nearly 13 % from 2010 . 
Furthermore , a large proportion of the credit was invested in the overheated real-estate sector , as well as in infrastructure projects with low rates of return , creating large-scale structural overcapacity that has undermined the efficiency of investment and resource allocation , and contributed to the structural mismatch of fiscal resources . 
Now , China &apos;s government must take fiscal decentralization further , giving each local government the authority to collect taxes and control its budget &apos;s scale and structure . 
Only by adjusting the distribution of public finance can China &apos;s leadership help local governments to decrease their reliance on land-transfer revenues and bank loans . 
The next challenge for China &apos;s leadership is to establish better mechanisms for ratification and approval of the overall budget , which comprises the general public budget , the government-fund budget , and the budget for state-owned capital . 
Currently , while sub-national governments are required to submit their budgets for approval to the people &apos;s congress immediately above them , as well as to the National People &apos;s Congress , the drafts undergo little scrutiny . 
Ensuring that all budgets are reviewed by people &apos;s congresses at various levels would enhance resource efficiency by reducing fiscal competition between the central and local governments as well as among local governments . 
China can further enhance the capacity of existing financial resources to support the real economy through financial decentralization . 
In recent years , the central government has tightened its control over the banking sector , undermining the financial system &apos;s development , not least by impeding banks &quot; ability to assess credit risk . 
By forcing banks to offer lower interest rates to state-owned enterprises , the government drove private firms and households to informal lenders , fueling the emergence of a large and risk-laden shadow-banking sector . 
Likewise , the requirement that banks offer very low or even negative real interest rates to private depositors drove them to invest in fixed assets , leading to overcapacity in some sectors , such as real estate . 
As a result , market-oriented interest-rate reform is now needed to help optimize capital allocation and support the development of China &apos;s financial market , thereby laying the groundwork for future capital-account and exchange-rate liberalization . 
But financial decentralization extends beyond interest-rate liberalization . 
Breaking the central government &apos;s domination of China &apos;s financial resources will fundamentally change the system of implicit guarantees that is currently generating significant financial risk . 
It will also help to synchronize financial development between urban and rural areas , ultimately eliminating China &apos;s longstanding dual financial structure . 
If China &apos;s leaders are genuinely committed to revitalizing the capital stock , they must begin with fiscal and financial decentralization . 
Such an approach would promote efficiency , stability , innovation , and dynamism at the local level - exactly what China needs to support its progress toward advanced-economy status .
