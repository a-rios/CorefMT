The Demise of Parliaments 
August is the traditional month when parliaments recess for the summer . 
It offers a moment to examine why they are so enfeebled . 
Across Europe , it is not only British Prime Minister Tony Blair who is accused of &quot; presidentialism &quot; nowadays . 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der faces the same charge in the current German election campaign . 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy , indeed , does not even like being called Prime Minister . 
Because he is technically President of the Council ( of ministers ) , he insists on using the title of President . 
France , of course , is a presidential democracy . 
To many , &quot; presidentialism &quot; sounds like the American constitution ; but those who suspect in today &apos;s trend another facet of the Americanization of Europe are wrong . 
American presidents have powers which are severely restricted by Congress via the US constitution ; they are but one in a triad of separate powers . 
Europe &apos;s &quot; presidential &quot; prime ministers , on the contrary , are what a British Lord Chancellor once called , &quot; elective dictators . &quot; 
This means , above all , that they have ceased to take parliaments seriously . 
Some Prime Ministers rarely attend their parliaments . 
When they graciously consent to appear , they are treated with deference . 
Parliaments are in some cases handmaidens of the executive rather than the source of sovereignty . 
Prime Minister Berlusconi has persuaded the Italian Parliament to pass legislation which primarily benefits him and his business interests . 
The mother of parliaments itself , the British parliament at Westminster , frequently cuts short debates by a procedural device known as the &quot; guillotine , &quot; so that important legislation , like the current Asylum Bill , remains largely undebated in the House of Commons . 
( The absurd consequence is that the unelected House of Lords becomes the real legislature of the country . ) 
All governments have acquired the habit of using secondary legislation by orders and regulations without parliamentary control . 
The European Union sets a particularly bad example in all this . 
Its legislature is the Council of Ministers which sometimes allows the elected Parliament to engage in a little &quot; co-decision-making . &quot; 
The Council of course meets in camera , that is without public scrutiny . 
How could this happen ? 
What is the reason for the apparent demise of the central institution of democracy , parliament ? 
Why is it no longer the place in which the representatives of the people debate great issues and hold the executive to account ? 
Is democracy itself at risk ? 
One can think of a number of reasons for the evisceration of parliaments . 
One is globalization . 
Decisions have emigrated from the spaces for which parliaments are elected . 
They take place in remote and often unknown places . 
These can be the boardrooms of companies , or private international meetings of leaders , or just a course of events which escapes all controls . 
The collapse of the &quot; new economy &quot; is an example , but in a curious way also the probable attack on Iraq will also be arrived at in such a way . 
Even if national parliaments tried to come to grips with such developments , they would fail . 
Another reason is the separation of the political game from the lives and concerns of most people . 
Parties have become machines for allocating power rather than for gathering and representing the interests of citizens . 
The party game has lost its representative quality . 
As a result , leaders have developed a tendency to turn directly to the people without allowing much debate . 
This can be done by opinion polls and the use of focus groups ; it can also be achieved by referenda and plebiscites . 
In both cases , parliaments become dispensable . 
The danger of such developments is that they strengthen an already strong trend towards a new authoritarianism . 
The political class becomes a kind of nomenklatura of leaders who prefer popularity to debate . 
They find it awkward to give reasons for their policies and regard parliaments as no more than a reservoir for those with whom they are prepared to share power . 
As reasoned debate falls by the wayside , citizens lose interest in politics . 
Along with parties and parliaments , elections have lost their charm . 
Declining voter turnout tells the story . 
The demise of parliaments is above all a decline in democratic debate and scrutiny . 
It is not a development which defenders of the constitution of liberty can accept . 
The time has come for a revolt of parliaments against both the arrogance of those in power and voter apathy . 
In a sense , we need more rather than less presidentialism in Europe , at least if this is understood in the proper American way , in which legislative and executive powers are separately legitimated and equally strong .
