Europe &apos;s Futile Search for Cheaper Money 
BRUSSELS - Various forms of common &quot; European bonds , &quot; more precisely eurobonds , have been proposed recently as a way out of the current euro crisis , with proponents stressing the promise of lower borrowing costs . 
But this seems mostly to be wishful thinking . 
To see why , one needs only to reflect on the longer-term benefits that one might expect from such bonds . 
Would European bonds carry lower interest rates than the average rates for national bonds ? 
Proponents of European bonds argue that they would create a much larger and more liquid market than those for national bonds . 
But this advantage is likely to be limited , a potential savings of a few tenths of a basis point , given that the interest rates on similar , high-quality sovereign bonds - such as those issued by Germany and Austria - differ by only this amount . 
Another purported advantage of European bonds could be risk pooling : if the risks that individual eurozone members experience payment difficulties were not too dissimilar - and not too closely correlated - joint issuance of bonds should , in principle , reduce credit risk for European bonds relative to the average risk of national bonds . 
But that is not an argument that can be used at the present time , when eurozone risks are so lopsided ( zero for the core and considerable for the periphery ) and , among peripheral countries , so highly correlated ( they are vulnerable to the same shocks , e.g. , higher interest rates or low growth ) . 
Thus , the eurozone-wide gains from European bonds are likely to be negligible . 
The key insight of the dismal science bears repeating : there is no free lunch . 
What debtor countries gain in terms of lower financing costs would be offset by the losses for creditor countries both in terms of higher borrowing costs and lower interest income . 
But countries such as Greece , Ireland , Portugal , and Spain face a real problem : now that their consumption and construction booms have ended , a long period of slow growth looks unavoidable . 
At the same time , they have to pay much higher interest rates , driving up their debt while their capacity to service that debt stagnates . 
Lower interest rates are thus vital for these countries . 
But it is unlikely that European bonds would achieve even this limited aim . 
There have been many proposals , but all share two features . 
First , they would allow eurozone countries to issue bonds that are guaranteed &quot; jointly and severally &quot; by all members up to a certain level - for example , 40 % of GDP , as in the latest proposal by Luxembourg &apos;s Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti . 
Second , the European bonds would be senior to private claims . 
This second component is crucial , because it would make all other government debt junior . 
In practice , this would mean that if Greece , say , were to have to restructure its debt once the bonds had been issued up to the limit , it would presumably service these bonds ( which essentially represent official multilateral debt ) in full , with private lenders bearing all the losses . 
The value of private claims would thus fall . 
Issuing European bonds would not lower a country &apos;s overall debt , but only change its composition . 
We know that companies cannot change their total market value by changing the composition of liabilities ( making some claims senior to others ) . 
The same applies to countries : making some claims senior to others would not lead to lower average borrowing costs , owing to the higher cost of private financing after it is reduced to junior debt . 
The partial substitution of national debt with European bonds might reduce the marginal debt-service cost for distressed countries while they are being issued . 
Ultimately , however , their average cost would not be lower , because , again , if official creditors are senior to private lenders , large-scale official financing - which is used mainly to repay maturing debt - would impede governments &quot; access to private credit markets . 
Moreover , as more European bonds are issued , this problem becomes more acute , because the existing overhang of private debt becomes increasingly risky . 
As borrowing costs tend to rise proportionally more than the increase in risk , a country with a large volume of European bonds outstanding might actually face higher borrowing costs . 
Experience also shows that bad risks are often shut out of the market , which implies that a country with a high debt burden and many European bonds outstanding might not be able to issue any private debt at all . 
Of course , if member countries were willing to pool all their borrowing , they might gain , on average , a small reduction in debt-service costs . 
But this would require Europeanization of overall economic policy , including , for example , tax rates and pension rules . 
Given that eurozone members rejected even the idea of automatic sanctions for countries with excessive deficits , they are not likely to countenance such a wide ranging loss of sovereignty . 
Does this imply that European bonds are a bad idea in general ? 
No . 
If all member countries had little public debt , issuing European bonds up to 40 % or 60 % of GDP would cover all their funding needs , and they could reap a modest liquidity premium . 
Markets would not allow them to issue much additional debt , and there would be no default risk . 
A key condition for contemplating European bonds is thus that public debt first be reduced to a sustainable level . 
But this is not on the official agenda , at least for the time being .
