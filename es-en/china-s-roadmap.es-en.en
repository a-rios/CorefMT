China &apos;s Roadmap 
China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan , setting the stage for the continuation of probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history , while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world &apos;s population . 
Never before has the world seen such sustained growth ; never before has there been so much poverty reduction . 
Part of the key to China &apos;s long-run success has been its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision . 
While much of the rest of the developing world , following the Washington Consensus , has been directed at a quixotic quest for higher GDP , China has once again made clear that it seeks sustainable and more equitable increases in real living standards . 
China realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth that is imposing enormous - and unsustainable - demands on the environment . 
Unless there is a change in course , living standards will eventually be compromised . 
That is why the new five-year plan places great emphasis on the environment . 
Even many of the more backward parts of China have been growing at a pace that would be a marvel , were it not for the fact that other parts of the country are growing even more rapidly . 
While this has reduced poverty , inequality has been increasing , with growing disparities between cities and rural areas , and between coastal regions and the interior . 
This year &apos;s World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality , not just poverty , should be a concern , and China &apos;s 11th five-year plan attacks the problem head-on . 
The government has for several years talked about a more harmonious society , and the plan describes ambitious programs for achieving this . 
China recognizes , too , that what separates less developed from more developed countries is not only a gap in resources , but also a gap in knowledge . 
So it has laid out bold plans not only to reduce that gap , but to create a basis for independent innovation . 
China &apos;s role in the world and the world &apos;s economy has changed , and the plan reflects this , too . 
Its future growth will have to be based more on domestic demand than on exports , which will require increases in consumption . 
Indeed , China has a rare problem : excessive savings . 
People save partly because of weaknesses in government social-insurance programs ; strengthening social security ( pensions ) and public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities , increase citizens &quot; sense of well-being , and promote current consumption . 
If successful - and , so far , China has almost always surpassed even its own high expectations - these adjustments may impose enormous strains on a global economic system that is already unbalanced by America &apos;s huge fiscal and trade imbalances . 
This is a topic for another day , but that day may not be far off . 
With such a clear vision of the future , the challenge will be implementation . 
China is a large country , and it could not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization . 
But decentralization raises problems of its own . 
Greenhouse gases , for example , are global problems . 
While America says that it cannot afford to do anything about it , China &apos;s senior officials have acted more responsibly . 
Within a month of the adoption of the plan , new environmental taxes on cars , gasoline , and wood products were imposed : China was using market based mechanisms to address its and the world &apos;s environmental problems . 
But the pressures on local government officials to deliver economic growth and jobs will be enormous . 
They will be sorely tempted to argue that if America cannot afford to produce in a way that preserves our planet , how can we ? 
To translate its vision into action , the Chinese government will need strong policies , such as the environmental taxes already imposed . 
As China has moved toward a market economy , it has developed some of the problems that have plagued the developed countries : special interests that clothe self-serving arguments behind a thin veil of market ideology . 
Some will argue for trickle-down economics : don &apos;t worry about the poor , eventually everybody will benefit from growth . 
And some will oppose competition policy and strong corporate governance laws : let Darwinian survival work its wonders . 
Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies : higher gasoline taxes , for example , will kill our nascent auto industry . 
Such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only fail to deliver growth ; they would threaten the entire vision of China &apos;s future . 
There is only one way to prevent this : open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today . 
George W. Bush has shown the dangers of excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants . 
Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent to which its leaders , by contrast , have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations ( even with foreigners ) as they strive to solve the enormous problems they face . 
Market economies are not self-regulating . 
They cannot simply be left on autopilot , especially if one wants to ensure that their benefits are shared widely . 
But managing a market economy is no easy task . 
It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes . 
China &apos;s 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap for that response . 
The world watches in awe , and hope , as the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed .
