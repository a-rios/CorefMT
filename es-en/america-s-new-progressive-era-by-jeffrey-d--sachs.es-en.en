America &apos;s New Progressive Era ? 
NEW YORK - In 1981 , US President Ronald Reagan came to office famously declaring that , &quot; Government is not the solution to our problem . 
Government is the problem . &quot; 
Thirty-two years and four presidents later , Barack Obama &apos;s recent inaugural address , with its ringing endorsement of a larger role for government in addressing America &apos;s - and the world &apos;s - most urgent challenges , looks like it may bring down the curtain on that era . 
Reagan &apos;s statement in 1981 was extraordinary . 
It signaled that America &apos;s new president was less interested in using government to solve society &apos;s problems than he was in cutting taxes , mainly for the benefit of the wealthy . 
More important , his presidency began a &quot; revolution &quot; from the political right - against the poor , the environment , and science and technology - that lasted for three decades , its tenets upheld , more or less , by all who followed him : George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and , in some respects , by Obama in his first term . 
The &quot; Reagan Revolution &quot; had four main components : tax cuts for the rich ; spending cuts on education , infrastructure , energy , climate change , and job training ; massive growth in the defense budget ; and economic deregulation , including privatization of core government functions , like operating military bases and prisons . 
Billed as a &quot; free-market &quot; revolution , because it promised to reduce the role of government , in practice it was the beginning of an assault on the middle class and the poor by wealthy special interests . 
These special interests included Wall Street , Big Oil , the big health insurers , and arms manufacturers . 
They demanded tax cuts , and got them ; they demanded a rollback of environmental protection , and got it ; they demanded , and received , the right to attack unions ; and they demanded lucrative government contracts , even for paramilitary operations , and got those , too . 
For more than three decades , no one really challenged the consequences of turning political power over to the highest bidders . 
In the meantime , America went from being a middle-class society to one increasingly divided between rich and poor . 
CEOs who were once paid around 30 times what their average workers earned now make around 230 times that amount . 
Once a world leader in the fight against environmental degradation , America was the last major economy to acknowledge the reality of climate change . 
Financial deregulation enriched Wall Street , but ended up creating a global economic crisis through fraud , excessive risk-taking , incompetence , and insider dealing . 
Maybe , just maybe , Obama &apos;s recent address marks not only the end of this destructive agenda , but also the start of a new era . 
Indeed , he devoted almost the entire speech to the positive role of government in providing education , fighting climate change , rebuilding infrastructure , taking care of the poor and disabled , and generally investing in the future . 
It was the first inaugural address of its kind since Reagan turned America away from government in 1981 . 
If Obama &apos;s speech turns out to mark the start of a new era of progressive politics in America , it would fit a pattern explored by one of America &apos;s great historians , Arthur Schlesinger , Jr . , who documented roughly 30-year intervals between periods of what he called &quot; private interest &quot; and &quot; public purpose . &quot; 
In the late 1800 &quot; s , America had its Gilded Age , with the creation of large new industries by the era &apos;s &quot; robber barons &quot; accompanied by massive inequality and corruption . 
The subsequent Progressive Era was followed by a temporary return to plutocracy in the 1920 &quot; s . 
Then came the Great Depression , Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal , and another 30 years of progressive politics , from the 1930 &quot; s to the 1960 &quot; s . 
The 1970 &quot; s were a transition period to the Age of Reagan - 30 years of conservative politics led by powerful corporate interests . 
It is certainly time for a rebirth of public purpose and government leadership in the US to fight climate change , help the poor , promote sustainable technologies , and modernize America &apos;s infrastructure . 
If America realizes these bold steps through purposeful public policies , as Obama outlined , the innovative science , new technology , and powerful demonstration effects that result will benefit countries around the world . 
It is certainly too early to declare a new Progressive Era in America . 
Vested interests remain powerful , certainly in Congress - and even within the White House . 
These wealthy groups and individuals gave billions of dollars to the candidates in the recent election campaign , and they expect their contributions to yield benefits . 
Moreover , 30 years of tax cutting has left the US government without the financial resources needed to carry out effective programs in key areas such as the transition to low-carbon energy . 
Still , Obama has wisely thrown down the gauntlet , calling for a new era of government activism . 
He is right to do so , because many of today &apos;s crucial challenges - saving the planet from our own excesses ; ensuring that technological advances benefit all members of society ; and building the new infrastructure that we need nationally and globally for a sustainable future - demand collective solutions . 
Implementation of public policy is just as important to good governance as the vision that underlies it . 
So the next task is to design wise , innovative , and cost-effective programs to address these challenges . 
Unfortunately , when it comes to bold and innovative programs to meet critical human needs , America is out of practice . 
It is time to begin anew , and Obama &apos;s full-throated defense of a progressive vision points the US in the right direction .
