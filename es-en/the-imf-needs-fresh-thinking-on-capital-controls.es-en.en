The IMF Needs Fresh Thinking on Capital Controls 
CAMBRIDGE - Why does the International Monetary Fund make it so hard for people like me to love it ? 
The IMF has said and done all the right things since the crisis . 
It has acted as quickly as any international bureaucracy can to establish new lines of credit for battered emerging-market countries . 
It revamped its loan conditions to fit the times . 
Under its capable managing director , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , and distinguished chief economist , Olivier Blanchard , it has been a voice for sanity on global fiscal stimulus in the midst of much cacophony . 
For an institution that seemed on the verge of irrelevance not too long ago , this is quite a transformation . 
But now Strauss-Kahn is throwing cold water on proposals to tax international flows of &quot; hot money . &quot; 
The occasion was Brazil &apos;s decision to impose a 2 % tax on short-term capital inflows to prevent a speculative bubble and further appreciation of its currency . 
When asked about the role of capital controls , Strauss-Kahn said he was not wedded to any rigid ideology on the subject . 
Nonetheless , according to the Financial Times which reported the IMF chief &apos;s views , &quot; the IMF would not recommend them as a standard prescription either - as they carried costs and were usually ineffective . &quot; 
Unfortunately , this makes the new IMF sound too much like the old one . 
Prudential controls on capital flows make a lot of sense . 
Short-term flows not only wreak havoc with domestic macroeconomic management , but they also aggravate adverse exchange-rate movements . 
In particular , &quot; hot &quot; capital inflows make it difficult for financially open economies like Brazil to maintain a competitive currency , depriving them of what is in effect the most potent form of industrial policy imaginable . 
To be sure , by sending mixed signals to financial markets , the Brazilians may have botched their attempt to cool down inflows . 
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had dismissed talk of capital controls just a few days before they were imposed . 
A meaningful effort to influence the currency &apos;s level requires determination to adjust financial taxes and complementary policies until they show their effects . 
Timidity is counterproductive , because it backfires . 
But more important was the symbolism of Brazil &apos;s move , for it suggests that emerging markets may be getting over their doomed infatuation with foreign finance . 
Surely , as the economists Arvind Subramanian and John Williamson have written , emerging markets deserve the IMF &apos;s help in designing better prudential controls over capital inflows instead of having their wrists slapped . 
Strauss-Kahn &apos;s response that taxes on capital flows are costly and ineffective is therefore unfortunate . 
It is also emblematic of the knee-jerk reaction that often obfuscates the pros and cons of capital controls . 
You can oppose capital controls because you believe financial markets are on the whole a force for good , and that any interference will therefore generate efficiency losses . 
Or you can oppose controls because you think that they can be easily evaded and are therefore doomed to remain ineffective . 
What you can &apos;t do is oppose capital controls because they are both costly and ineffective . 
Think about it . 
If capital controls can be easily evaded - say , by manipulating the timing of transactions or through mis-invoicing of trade flows - then there will be little effect on the actual volume of capital inflows . 
The controls will impose few costs on markets ( though they may involve some administrative costs for the government ) . 
If , on the other hand , market participants do bear significant costs - either because of the taxes they pay or because of the expenses they incur to evade them - the controls will be effective in restraining inflows . 
If you are trying to have it both ways , the chances are you have made up your mind before you have really thought hard about it . 
It may seem curious that Strauss-Kahn &apos;s instincts are so off the mark on the matter of capital controls . 
One might have thought that a socialist , and a French Socialist at that , would be more inclined toward finance skepticism . 
But the paradox is more apparent than real . 
Financial markets in fact owe French Socialists a great debt . 
Received wisdom holds the United States Treasury and Wall Street responsible for the push to free up global finance . 
But far more influential may have been the change of heart that took place among French Socialists following the collapse of their experiment in Keynesian reflation in the early 1980 &quot; s . 
When capital flight forced François Mitterrand to abort his program in 1983 , France &apos;s Socialists performed an abrupt volte-face and embraced financial liberalization on a global scale . 
According to Harvard Business School &apos;s Rawi Abdelal , this was the key event that set in motion the developments that would ultimately enshrine freedom of capital movement as a global norm . 
The first stop was the European Union in the late 1980 &quot; s , where two French Socialists - Jacques Delors and Pascal Lamy ( the president of the European Commission and his assistant , respectively ) - led the way . 
Then it was the turn of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) . 
Eventually , the IMF joined the bandwagon under Michel Camdessus , another Frenchmen who had served as Governor of the Bank of France under Mitterrand . 
The IMF &apos;s reaction to Brazil &apos;s financial taxes reflects how ingrained finance fetishism has become , and how difficult it is to reintroduce some balance in the debate on capital flows - even in the aftermath of the greatest financial crisis the world has experienced since the Great Depression . 
The problem is not just right-wing market fundamentalists . 
The failure of imagination extends across the entire political spectrum . 
Referring to capital controls , John Maynard Keynes famously said : &quot; what used to be heresy &#91; restrictions on capital flows &#93; is now endorsed as orthodoxy . &quot; 
That was at the dawn of the Bretton Woods era in 1945 . 
What an irony that more than 60 years later we need to undergo the same shift in mindset .
