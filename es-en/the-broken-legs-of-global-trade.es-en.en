The Broken Legs of Global Trade 
NEW YORK - The Doha Round , the latest phase of multilateral trade negotiations , failed in November 2011 , after ten years of talks , despite official efforts by many countries , including the United Kingdom and Germany , and by nearly all eminent trade scholars today . 
While trade officials in the United States and the European Union blamed the G-22 developing countries &quot; excessive demands for the failure of earlier negotiations in Canc√∫n in 2003 , there is general agreement that this time it was the US whose unwarranted ( and unyielding ) demands killed the talks . 
So , now what ? 
The failure to achieve multilateral trade liberalization by concluding the Doha Round means that the world lost the gains from trade that a successful treaty would have brought . 
Of course , multilateral trade negotiations are only one of three legs on which the World Trade Organization stands . 
The costs here may also be large . 
Until now , preferential trade agreements ( PTAs ) among small groups of countries co-existed with multilateral , non-discriminatory trade-liberalization rounds . 
As a result , the rules that govern trade , such as anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties to offset illegal subsidies , were in the domain of both the WTO and the PTAs . 
So , while powerful , &quot; hegemonic &quot; countries like the US managed to impose their own rules on weaker partners in the PTAs that they helped to proliferate , big emerging economies like India , Brazil , China , and South Africa insisted on rejecting such demands when made as part of multilateral trade rounds like Doha . 
Now , however , with the era of multilateral trade rounds and system-wide rules behind us , the PTAs are the only game in town , and the templates established by the hegemonic powers in unequal trade treaties with economically weaker countries will increasingly carry the day . 
In fact , such templates now extend beyond conventional trade issues ( for example , agricultural protection ) to vast numbers of areas unrelated to trade , including labor standards , environmental rules , policies on expropriation , and the ability to impose capital-account controls in financial crises . 
The US-led public-relations blitzkrieg of euphemism has already begun , with US Assistant Trade Representative Wendy Cutler describing the latest PTA , the Trans-Pacific Partnership , as a &quot; high standard &quot; agreement . 
Other American officials have taken to calling PTA &apos;s &quot; trade agreements for the twenty-first century . &quot; 
Who could possibly be against the twenty-first century ? 
What is disturbing is the way in which some trade economists in Geneva and in Washington have capitulated to such propaganda , and regard capitulation by the WTO as a way to &quot; salvage &quot; and reshape the organization . 
The WTO , like a village during the Vietnam War , must be destroyed in order to be saved . 
Unfortunately , this insidious attack on the second leg of the WTO also extends to the third leg , the dispute-settlement mechanism . 
The DSM is the pride of the WTO : it is the only impartial and binding mechanism for adjudicating and enforcing contractual obligations defined by the WTO and accepted by its members . 
It gives every member , big or small , a platform and a voice . 
Once PTA-based DSMs are established , however , adjudication of disputes will reflect asymmetries of power , benefiting the stronger trade partner . 
Moreover , third countries will have little scope for input into PTA-based DSMs , though their interests may very well be affected by how adjudication is structured . 
Given that the US has abandoned any pretense of leadership on world trade , it is up to major emerging economies and like-minded developed countries to establish their own template , one that adheres to trade objectives and discards what special-interest lobbies in hegemons like the US seek to foist on PTAs . 
This is exactly what India has done with the EU , which is now stripping such features out of its proposed PTA . 
Other countries - Brazil , South Africa , and China among the major emerging economies , and Japan and Australia among the developed countries - should back such &quot; garbage-free &quot; PTAs as well . 
That just might be an adequate rebuff to the rise of PTAs whose main objective is to serve hegemonic interests alone - perhaps even sufficient to get the multilateral approach back on track .
