Nuclear Disarmament &apos;s Asian Pivot 
WASHINGTON , DC - In 2009 , US President Barack Obama pledged to seek a world without nuclear weapons . 
But , while he delivered on his promise to negotiate a New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia a year later , progress has since stalled . 
To break the deadlock , the current bilateral framework for negotiation , which has remained largely unchanged since the Cold War , must be transformed into a trilateral framework that includes China . 
To be sure , such a move would significantly complicate negotiations . 
After all , while decades of bilateral dialogue have given the United States and Russia a good sense of each other &apos;s strategic perspectives - including the issues on which they disagree - China &apos;s perception of strategic stability is unfamiliar . 
But trilateral dialogues , catalyzed by skillful US diplomacy , could also serve as an opportunity to manage the countries &quot; strategic relations , which currently are characterized by contradictions and mistrust . 
Russia seeks China &apos;s support in opposing American missile-defense systems , and calls for the involvement of all nuclear states in future strategic arms-control talks , but then cites concerns about China &apos;s military modernization to justify its refusal to negotiate with NATO on tactical nuclear-weapon reduction . 
China , which has never adopted legally binding limits on its nuclear weapons or strategic nuclear-delivery vehicles , rejects Russia &apos;s call to join negotiations - a stance that the US supports until the Russian and US nuclear arsenals move closer in size to those of China . 
At the same time , US officials deny that their country &apos;s missile-defense programs are directed against Russia or China , but refuse to offer a legally binding guarantee . 
And the US Department of Defense is developing a robust program of long-range conventional strike weapons , which China and Russia cite to justify their efforts to strengthen their offensive nuclear forces . 
Although multilateral cooperation on nuclear issues has been effective in some cases , such as in ratifying the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , it has been inadequate in others , such as in easing tensions with Iran and North Korea . 
In fact , even when China , Russia , and the US share the same agenda , their differing diplomatic tactics often undermine their ability to achieve their objectives . 
For example , the three countries &quot; policies are inadvertently contributing to proliferation pressures in Asia and Europe . 
US pledges to defend Japan against a nuclear attack from China or North Korea have played a decisive role in dissuading the Japanese from seeking their own nuclear weapons . 
Given this , a Chinese nuclear surge - even one that did not lead to US-China parity - could undermine the credibility of American deterrence commitments , possibly motivating Japan to launch its own nuclear program . 
Similarly , some of NATO &apos;s newer members , many of which are former Soviet-bloc states , are anxious about the prospect of Russian rearmament . 
As a result , they oppose efforts to reduce the number of American nuclear weapons in Europe , part of NATO &apos;s &quot; nuclear sharing &quot; policy . 
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to initiating a trilateral dialogue is Chinese resistance to formal nuclear arms-control agreements , which is rooted in the memory of Cold War-era nonproliferation initiatives aimed partly at preventing China from developing its own nuclear deterrent . 
Since then , Chinese officials have insisted that they do not belong in US-Russian strategic-arms talks , because the two countries &quot; nuclear arsenals dwarf theirs . 
But , as the US and Russia reduce their nuclear stockpiles , this excuse is becoming less valid , and China &apos;s exclusion from negotiations is becoming an increasingly significant hindrance to disarmament . 
Securing a binding commitment from China &apos;s government to limit its nuclear development is crucial to reassuring the US and Russia that further strategic-weapons cuts will not undermine global or regional stability . 
Several recent developments could help to minimize obstacles to trilateral cooperation . 
China &apos;s new leadership is further removed from Maoist-era reflexive opposition to nuclear negotiations ; 
Meanwhile , faced with a large federal budget deficit , many American voters would welcome reduced spending on nuclear weapons . 
The US should capitalize on this situation , leveraging Russian concerns and interests to induce China to join strategic arms-control efforts . 
China might be willing to make a unilateral , but enforceable , commitment not to augment its nuclear arsenal , if Russia and the US reduce theirs further . 
Determining the circumstances that might induce such restraint - and the conditions that would be needed to sustain it - is crucial to reinvigorating nuclear disarmament efforts . 
With Russia ostensibly on board , it is up to the US to initiate a transformation in the nuclear-negotiation framework - and that means convincing China to participate .
