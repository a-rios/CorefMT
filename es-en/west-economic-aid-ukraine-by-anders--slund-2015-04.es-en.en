What the West Owes Ukraine 
WASHINGTON , DC - Ukraine may not be grabbing as many headlines now as it did a year ago , but the crisis there is far from over . 
The latest ceasefire agreement , concluded in Minsk in February , has contained , but not stopped , Russian military aggression . 
And , though the stabilization program that Ukraine agreed with the International Monetary Fund last month is superior to last year &apos;s deal - this one includes both more financing from the IMF and a more credible economic-reform plan from the government - it will be insufficient to repair the country &apos;s economy . 
What Ukraine really needs is to escape the old Soviet order - and , for that , it needs the West &apos;s help . 
Ukraine never managed to recast its state after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse . 
Instead , the old Soviet elites held onto power - and most of the country &apos;s wealth - through corrupt practices that became entrenched in the country &apos;s economy and political system . 
Reforming both will be a major challenge - one that Ukraine &apos;s leaders have lately committed themselves to meeting . 
Since February of last year , when the parliament voted then-President Viktor Yanukovych out of power by more than a two-thirds majority , Ukraine has held fresh elections for both institutions . 
Hundreds of top officials have been replaced by young , Western-educated professionals , and the government is now working feverishly to implement deep and comprehensive reforms , including a new law on public procurement and a package of anti-corruption legislation . 
Dozens of superfluous inspection agencies have been abolished , significantly reducing the regulatory burden . 
Just last month , President Petro Poroshenko sacked the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region , the billionaire tycoon Igor Kolomoisky 
More recently , the authorities have been working to reform the energy sector - a hub of corruption . 
On April 1 , household gas prices were quadrupled , taking them to half the market price , with offsetting compensation provided to the poor . 
And the parliament has enacted a law that harmonizes energy standards with those of the European Union , thereby delineating clearly the state &apos;s role and opening the gas market to investors . 
But Ukraine still has a long way to go . 
The good news is that the public largely understands and supports the government &apos;s reform efforts . 
The bad news is that Ukraine still faces considerable destabilizing threats - beginning with a renewed Russian military offensive . 
A Russian attack on , say , Mariupol , eastern Ukraine &apos;s second-largest port ( accounting for roughly one-third of the country &apos;s exports ) , would devastate an economy that is already tanking . 
Though several factors - including Western sanctions , a lack of public support for war in Ukraine , and the Russian economy &apos;s rapid decline - should discourage the Kremlin from taking such a step , they may not be enough . 
After all , Russia &apos;s leaders have shown themselves to be unpredictable . 
Even absent further Russian aggression , Ukraine &apos;s economic woes could prevent further progress on reform . 
The economy contracted by 6.8 % year on year in 2014 , and output has plunged by 15 % in each of the two last quarters . 
Moreover , at the end of February , with the country running low on reserves , Ukraine &apos;s currency , the hryvnia , lost half its value ; as a result , annualized inflation surged to 45 % in March . 
A full-scale financial meltdown was avoided only when the IMF provided an early disbursement that doubled Ukraine &apos;s reserves , to $ 9.9 billion ; by the end of the month , the exchange rate more or less recovered . 
Nonetheless , the international financing that Ukraine has received , though invaluable , remains insufficient to support genuine recovery and reform . 
The latest bailout program foresees about $ 40 billion in funding , nearly half of which will come from the IMF , over the next four years . 
That means that , this year , Ukraine will receive only $ 10 billion - not enough to enable the country to replenish its reserves and service its debts . 
Indeed , given Ukraine &apos;s large bond debts , many of which will mature in the next two years , there is a $ 15.3 billion funding gap in the bailout package , which the IMF and Ukraine &apos;s government hope to plug with a debt restructuring . 
It needs more strategic support as well . 
European politicians &quot; overwhelming opposition to supplying Ukraine with defensive arms is difficult to fathom . 
Europe &apos;s leaders claim that they want to avoid giving Russia reason to escalate its war on Ukraine . 
But that is already happening , and Ukraine &apos;s fight against Russia is , after all , a defense of core European values - and , indeed , of Europe itself . 
The EU flag has draped the caskets of Ukrainians killed in that fight . 
Europe &apos;s leaders argue that the central focus of their policy toward Ukraine must be to support its economic recovery . 
If the United States then met Europe halfway ( at least ) , Ukraine &apos;s financial crisis could finally be contained . 
On April 28 , Ukraine &apos;s government will host a donor conference in Kyiv . 
At a time when the country &apos;s leaders and public are more committed than ever to combating corruption , building a welfare-creating economy , and becoming a normal liberal democracy , Europe should be eager to support it . 
It is time for Western politicians to remember their ideals - and stand up for them .
