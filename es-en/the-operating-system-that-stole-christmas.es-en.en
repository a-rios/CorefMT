The Operating System that Stole Christmas 
Before asking for a new Windows PC this holiday season , remember the old adage : &quot; Be careful about what you wish for . &quot; 
In the best of all worlds , we would all benefit from the so-called &quot; network effects &quot; that result from most people using the same software : everyone could easily communicate with each other and teach each other how to use the software efficiently . 
Unfortunately , since Microsoft uses network effects to maximize its profits rather than to benefit users , the world it delivers is far from the best . 
Consider Vista , yet another &quot; great &quot; new operating system that Microsoft rolled out this year , together with Office 2007 . 
The first person at my company to use Vista was our Executive Vice-President . 
He was furious . 
Vista and Office 2007 came with his new Dell computer by default . 
Dell didn &apos;t ask : &quot; Would you prefer the old versions of the operating system and MS Office that you know how to use ? &quot; 
So our VP got a shiny new computer that he didn &apos;t know how to use : functions were rearranged , and keyboard shortcuts were different . 
Think of the productivity cost of millions like him having to adjust to a new system . 
Moreover , his coworkers couldn &apos;t read the Microsoft Word files that he sent them in the new . &quot; docx &quot; format . 
They wrote back and asked him to resend files in the older . &quot; doc &quot; format - which might not have worked if he had inadvertently used some new-fangled formatting feature . 
To be sure , Microsoft does provide a patch that allows old versions of Office to read the new . &quot; docx &quot; format . 
But Microsoft doesn &apos;t publicize it - or warn you if your Office 2007 file is about to become incompatible with older versions . 
While Microsoft could have kept the traditional . &quot; doc &quot; as its default format for MS Word , this would not have served its purpose : eventually , after enough of the world pays for Office 2007 , holdouts will be dragged along , kicking and screaming . 
Then , in four or five years , Microsoft will begin our agony all over again . 
Obviously , Microsoft owns its old software and can decide at what price to sell it - or whether to sell it at all . 
More subtly , Microsoft can control expectations , which turn out to be self-fulfilling when network economies are substantial , as they are in software markets . 
If everyone woke up tomorrow expecting that the world would shift to Apple within a year , sales of Windows would plummet . 
Why buy a Windows machine when all your colleagues will own Macintoshes and can help you on them but not Windows , and when all the independent software developers will be programming for the Mac &apos;s new Leopard operating system ? 
But that is not our world . 
Whenever Microsoft rolls out a new operating system , the question is not whether you should switch , but when . 
Adding new features can speed the transition , but what is necessary is only that the new system be incompatible with existing systems in certain respects , and that a sufficient number of people expect that it will become the new standard . 
Of course , creating new software is costly . 
The Nobel laureate Ronald Coase answered that question long ago . 
According to &quot; the Coase Conjecture , &quot; a monopolist selling a durable good must sell it at marginal cost . 
For Microsoft , the problem is that the marginal cost of software is zero . 
As a result , Microsoft cannot extract anything close to its full monopoly rents unless it sells upgrades . 
After all , even though Microsoft has a monopoly of primary sales of its software , copies sold in 2007 compete with those sold in 2006 . 
So , by creating incompatibilities , some subtle and some obvious , that make its old software obsolete , Microsoft can sell its operating systems at high profit margins without fear that people will wait until the price drops . 
The price will never drop , because Microsoft will just roll out a new system , again at high profit margins . 
Microsoft has been in antitrust trouble for 15 years , and , despite the company &apos;s recent agreement with the European Union to license its source code , it will probably be in trouble again . 
When that happens , I hope the antitrust authorities will consider a remedy that Ian Ayres , Hal Varian , and I devised . 
Suppose Microsoft had to license its old software freely whenever it brings out a new version . 
This would give the company an incentive to ensure that new versions are compatible with and significantly better than old versions - otherwise the new versions wouldn &apos;t sell , or at least not easily . 
If Microsoft &apos;s new software had to compete successfully at least against its old software , we would know the world was improving . 
In the meantime , I recommend installing the Microsoft patch to your old computer ( http : / / office.microsoft.com / en-us / word / HA100444731033.aspx ) and just suffering the devil you know .
