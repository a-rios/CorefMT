Libya &apos;s Jihadist Minority 
DOHA - &quot; They are armed , I am not going to fight a losing battle and kill my men over a demolished shrine , &quot; said Fawzi Abd al- &quot; Aali , the former Libyan interior minister , before he &quot; resigned &quot; last August . 
He was referring to the armed Salafi groups that were accused of destroying Sufi shrines . 
One of the accused groups was the Ansar al-Shariah Brigade , which was quick to support the demolition , but denied any responsibility for it . 
Ahmed Jibril , Libya &apos;s deputy ambassador to London , has now accused the Brigade , headed by Muhammed Ali Al-Zahawy , of perpetrating the attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi , which killed the American ambassador , Christopher Stevens , and three other US personnel , as well as Libyan guards . 
Others have quickly embraced and promoted Jibril &apos;s allegation . 
The Brigade denied responsibility in a written statement , as well as in a brief interview with its spokesperson , who at the time was in charge of guarding Al Jala Hospital in Benghazi . 
Like its statement on the destruction of Sufi shrines , it denied involvement in the attack on the US Consulate , but stressed the gravity of the insult against the Prophet that putatively triggered it . 
The Brigade attracted public attention last June as well , when around 300 armed members staged a rally in Benghazi , sparking outrage among Libyans . 
&quot; We wanted to send a message to the General National Council members , &quot; according to Hashim Al-Nawa , &quot; one of the Brigade &apos;s commanders . 
&quot; They should not come near the Shariah . 
But was the Ansar al-Shariah Brigade really behind the attack on the US Consulate ? 
The nature of Libya &apos;s post-revolution armed Islamist forces is by no means straightforward . 
Salafi jihadism is not an organization , but an ideological trend based on the core belief that armed tactics of all kinds are the most effective - and , in some versions , the most legitimate - method of bringing about social and political change . 
Last year , its adherents did play an important role in the removal of Libya &apos;s brutal dictator , Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
Many subsequently matured politically , revised their worldview , and shifted from armed to unarmed activism , forming political parties and contesting elections . 
The Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , for example , has produced two main political parties . 
The other , Al Umma al-Wasat ( The Central Nation ) , is led by Sami al-Saadi , the group &apos;s former chief ideologist , and Abd al-Wahad Qaid , an LIFG military commander and the brother of the deceased Al Qaeda commander Hasan Qaid ( Abu Yahya al-Libi ) . 
Both parties fared poorly in the election in July of a new General National Congress , with only Qaid winning a seat . 
Indeed , the GNC elections were in many ways a defeat for Libya &apos;s non-violent Salafi parties ( such as Al Asala ) , as well as for the post-jihadists . 
Other armed Islamist formations , including Salafi groups , accepted integration into Libya &apos;s new state institutions , such as the Supreme Security Committee ( interior ministry ) and the Libyan Shield Force ( defense ministry ) . 
The National Guard , headed by the former LIFG deputy leader , Khaled al-Sharif , absorbed more than 30 brigades , mostly from the west and southwest . 
But several armed formations , such as Ansar al-Shariah and the Imprisoned Sheikh Omar Abd al-Rahman Brigades , still reject the transition to party politics and integration into state institutions . 
These organizations are numerous , but small . 
&quot; Nobody asked us to join the army or the police , &quot; Sufian bin Qumu , Ansar al-Shariah &apos;s commander in Derna and a former Guant√°namo detainee , said in an interview last April . 
&quot; They did not even give me or any of my men a reward for fighting . &quot; 
Bin Qumu has a small paramilitary force training in the Bou Musafir forest on the outskirts of Derna . 
He insists that if the head of the boy scouts or the city &apos;s clan leaders asked him to disband the training camp , he would do so . 
The tragic death of Stevens and his colleagues has engendered wide public outrage in Libya , adding to the isolation and de-legitimization of the armed groups . 
Dozens of Libyan activist groups have uploaded videos paying tribute to Stevens , as well as issuing statements against terrorism and Al Qaeda . 
One of the Muslim Brothers &quot; Web sites includes such a statement , and Libya &apos;s Grand Mufti , Sheikh Sadeq al-Gheriani , also condemned the attack . 
Two issues remain critical in Libya to prevent future tragedies . 
The first is the need to capitalize on public support and continue the disarmament , demobilization , and reintegration process that started under the National Transitional Council but was never completed . 
Second , the government must enhance its communication strategy . 
Arab Spring governments condemned the outrageous movie smearing the Prophet of Islam , but they should have stressed that American official and unofficial bodies had nothing to do with the film &apos;s production . 
Collective punishment and targeting the innocent is forbidden in the Koran in more than 20 verses : &quot; That no burdened person ( with sins ) shall bear the burden ( sins ) of another &quot; ( The Star Chapter 53 : 38 ) .
