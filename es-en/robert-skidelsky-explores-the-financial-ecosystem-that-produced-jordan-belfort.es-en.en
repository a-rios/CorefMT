The Wolves of Wall Street 
LONDON - &quot; What a commentary on the state of twentieth-century capitalism , &quot; mused &quot; motivational speaker &quot; Jordan Belfort as he looked back on his life of fraud , sex , and drugs . 
As head of the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont , he fleeced investors of hundreds of millions of dollars in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
I saw Martin Scorsese &apos;s film The Wolf of Wall Street and was sufficiently intrigued to read Belfort &apos;s memoir , on which the screenplay is based . 
I learned quite a lot . 
For example , the scam known as &quot; pump and dump , &quot; which netted Belfort and his fellow Strattonites their ill-gotten gains , comes into much clearer view in the memoir than it does in the film . 
The technique works by buying up the stock of worthless companies through nominees , selling it on a rising market to genuine investors , and then unloading all of it . 
It was not just small investors who were ruined ; what stands out is the greed and gullibility of the rich who were sold the same rubbish by the &quot; young and stupid &quot; salesmen Belfort preferred to hire . 
Belfort was ( is ) obviously a super-slick snake-oil merchant , brilliant in his trade until drugs ruined his judgment . 
Belfort , once again selling the elixir of success after a brief stint in prison , professes to feel shame for his behavior ; but I suspect that deep down his contempt for those he swindled outweighs any sense of remorse . 
In a recent book , Capital in the Twenty-First Century , the economist Thomas Piketty highlights the phenomenon of &quot; meritocratic extremism &quot; - the culmination of a century-long passage from the old inequality , characterized by inherited wealth and discreet lifestyles , to the new inequality , with its outsize bonuses and conspicuous consumption . 
Stratton Oakmont was a conspicuous example of this trajectory . 
The rich were the old-money Protestant establishment whose members had lost their skills for protecting their wealth , which was therefore rightfully forfeited to street-savvy up-and-comers - mainly Jewish - amoral enough to help themselves to it . 
But Stratton Oakmont &apos;s peculations were hardly an exception on Wall Street . 
As a good friend , who was an SEC regulator for 20 years , told me when I asked about the extent of fraud , &quot; I found it to be pervasive . 
The system simply makes it too easy , and human nature colludes on both sides . 
Greed is the source of all cons . &quot; 
The Wolf of Wall Street was a predator , but so were all those reputable investment banks that shorted the products they were selling , and the retail banks that offered mortgages to unviable borrowers , which they could then repackage and sell as investment-grade securities . 
They were all wolves in sheep &apos;s clothing . 
A decent banking system has two functions : to look after depositors &quot; money and to bring together savers and investors in mutually profitable trades . 
Savings are deposited with banks because they are trusted not to steal them , and custody has a price . 
The deals that banks arrange between borrowers and lenders are the lifeblood of modern economies - and risky work for which bankers deserve to be well rewarded . 
But any money that bankers earn over and above the cost of compensating them for providing an essential service represents what former British regulator Adair Turner calls &quot; social waste , &quot; or what used to be described as &quot; usury . &quot; 
It is not the extent of the financial system that should alarm us , but its concentration and connectivity . 
In the United Kingdom , an ever-increasing share of bank assets has been concentrated in the five largest banks . 
Standard economic theory tells us that excessive profits are the direct result of concentrated ownership . 
Connectivity is the link between banks . 
These links can be locational , as in Wall Street or the City of London . 
But they became global through the development of derivatives , which were supposed to increase the stability of the banking system as a whole by spreading risk . 
Instead , they increase the system &apos;s fragility by correlating risk over a much larger space . 
As a paper by Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England and the zoologist Robert May points out , derivatives were like viruses . 
Financial engineers and traders shared the same assumptions about the risks they were taking . 
When these assumptions turned out to be false , the entire financial system was exposed to infection . 
Concentration and connectivity reinforce each other . 
Two-thirds of the recent growth of banks &quot; balance sheets in the UK represents internal claims among banks rather than claims between banks and non-financial firms - a clear case of money breeding money . 
Reformers want to cap bankers &quot; bonuses , create firewalls between banking departments , or ( more radically ) limit a single bank &apos;s share of total banking assets . 
But the only durable solution is to simplify the financial system . 
As Haldane and May put it : &quot; Excessive homogeneity within a financial system - all the banks doing the same thing - can minimize the risk for each individual bank , but maximize the possibility of the entire system collapsing . &quot; 
As long as banks can make a profit from trading , they will continue to expand derivatives in excess of any legitimate hedging demands from non-banks , creating redundant products whose only function is to make profits for their inventors and sellers . 
How to curtail derivatives is now by far the most important topic in banking reform , and the search for solutions should be guided by the recognition that economics is not a natural science . 
As May recounts : &quot; The odds on a 100 year storm do not change because people think that such a storm has become more likely . &quot; 
In financial markets , the odds do depend on what people think . 
The less thinking they have to do , the better . 
Jordan Belfort was partly right : people who go into finance should not be too clever .
