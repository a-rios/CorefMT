India &apos;s Democratic Tempest 
NEW DELHI - April might be the cruelest month , but , for India &apos;s major political parties this year , March was fairly brutal . 
On March 6 , following an American-style &quot; Super Tuesday &quot; of its own , India announced the results of five state assembly elections , which confounded pollsters , surprised pundits , and shook a complacent political establishment . 
Nothing went according to script . 
The Congress party was expected to come to power in Punjab , where chronic &quot; anti-incumbency &quot; has traditionally precluded the re-election of any state government . 
Instead , the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal won convincingly . 
By contrast , in the northeastern state of Manipur , Congress was expected to yield ground to critics of its long-serving chief minister , Okram Ibobi Singh , who instead pulled off an overwhelming victory . 
In the tourist paradise of Goa , the Congress government expected to be re-elected , but was trounced by a resurgent Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . 
Meanwhile , the two parties found themselves neck-and-neck in the hill state of Uttarakhand , with neither claiming a majority , though Congress had been heavily favored in the polls . 
But the greatest surprise was in India &apos;s largest state , Uttar Pradesh ( with a population of 200 million ) , where 402 legislators were elected to its massive state assembly . 
The incumbent chief minister , Mayawati , whose Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) won an absolute majority last time by forging a &quot; rainbow coalition &quot; composed of her Dalit ( formerly &quot; untouchable &quot; ) constituency and upper castes , was summarily ousted . 
Neither of the national parties , however , benefited from the BSP &apos;s demise . 
Congress limped to the finish line with just 27 seats , and the BJP fared little better . 
Instead , a local socialist group , the Samajwadi Party , claimed a convincing 221 seats . 
What does all of this portend for India ? 
The obvious fear is that the apparent weakening of both major national parties ( Congress and the BJP ) will lead to political instability . 
But India takes electoral convulsions in its stride , and the results triggered no turmoil in financial markets . 
Thanks to the vagaries of the parliamentary system and the country &apos;s sprawling size , elections seem to take place somewhere every six months , and investors and political analysts are rarely perturbed by even the most unpredictable outcomes . 
In the short term , some worry that the ruling Congress will be enfeebled by the results , and that India might soon face an early general election , which is not due until 2014 . 
Congress depends on the support of a number of coalition partners , as well as backing from non-government parties like Samajwadi that do not support the BJP-led opposition , to pass the annual budget and survive parliamentary confidence votes . 
But recent electoral successes for at least two of the regional parties - the Trinamool Congress , which rules West Bengal , and now Samajwadi - have fueled speculation that they might be tempted to bring down the central government in order to emerge stronger after early polls . 
But , even if an early general election cannot be ruled out completely , it seems implausible that either party will feel it has much to gain from precipitating the collapse of the national government . 
On the contrary , both Trinamool and Samajwadi stand to benefit from having a government in New Delhi that is dependent on their goodwill . 
Why , with the central government in thrall to them , should they venture into the unknown perils of an early election ? 
It might seem that India has too much democracy - elections in one state or another every few months , a fragmented political establishment ( with more than 40 parties represented in Parliament ) , and electoral processes that do little to strengthen a stable system built on two dominant parties . 
Indeed , some look with envy across the Himalayas at India &apos;s giant neighbor , China , which , untroubled by the vagaries of democratic politics , is in the process of stage-managing a long-planned leadership change completely from above . 
By contrast , India strikes many as maddening , chaotic , divided , and seemingly directionless as it muddles its way through the second decade of the twenty-first century . 
Another view , though , is that India is a country that has found in democracy the most effective way to manage its immense contradictions . 
This should be exciting , not alarming . 
&quot; India , &quot; wrote the late British historian E.P. Thompson , &quot; is perhaps the most important country for the future of the world . 
All the convergent influences of the world run through this society .... 
India expresses itself in many ways . 
Its strength is that it has preserved an idea of itself as one land embracing many - a country that endures differences of caste , creed , color , culture , conviction , costume , and custom , yet still rallies around a democratic consensus . 
That consensus is the simple principle that , in a democracy , it is not necessary to agree - except in terms of how to disagree . 
The reason that India , despite predictions of its imminent disintegration , has survived the stresses that have beset it during more than six decades of independence , is that it has maintained a consensus on how to manage without consensus . 
This is the India that Mahatma Gandhi fought to free , and its turbulent politics is well worth celebrating .
