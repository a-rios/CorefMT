Free Trade in an Age of Terror 
The war on terror appears to be causing a surge in protectionism . 
Some anti-terrorist warriors are so worked up about immigrants that they want to build a wall along the entire United States-Mexican border . 
They also are fighting the proposed takeover of US ports by a Dubai company , because they fear terrorists could gain vital intelligence from the investments . 
In Europe , the movement to stop inflows of migrants from Muslim countries is extremely popular . 
These developments do not constitute more protectionism in the usual meaning of the term , where private interests subvert the public good , as when farmers charge higher prices because competitive imports are restricted . 
National security concerns are not foolish . 
While a nation has a clear interest in the benefits of free and open trade , it also has a vital interest in its citizens &quot; safety . 
National security versus globalization is not an either-or issue though they sometimes come into conflict with each other , so balancing them is the key to successful policy . 
US President George W. Bush , for example , is seeking balance on the immigration issue by proposing to restrict , but not eliminate , guest worker entry . 
His proposal - which lies somewhere between the extremes of building a wall on the US-Mexican frontier and open borders on the other - is the right approach when guest workers could be disguised terrorists . 
Naturally , the greater the terrorist threat on the border , the more restrictive the policy should be . 
Compensating for the expected diminution of guest workers on the global stage is a likely increase in outsourcing , which provides an alternative and potentially more attractive way to import labor services when globalization is tainted by terrorism . 
Like guest workers , outsourcing imports labor services , but the foreign workers stay in their own backyards . 
Either the desired service is performed from abroad - telemarketing , for example - or the work is sent abroad for processing and later imported to the home country ( in Europe , more and more industrial work is being outsourced from West to East ) . 
Outsourcing keeps terrorists - and other foreigners who would get expensive welfare subsidies - at bay without sacrificing the benefits of globalization . 
Bush may be right on guest workers , but his controversial proposal to have a Dubai-based company run six US ports is a big mistake . 
In a safer world , the deal would go unnoticed - and rightfully so . 
But American public opinion , worried about the threat of terrorism , seems set against the takeover . 
Free traders are dismayed . 
They take popular opposition to the deal as a sign that America &apos;s commitment to an open economy may be waning . 
But , after the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , is it &quot; frenzy &quot; for Americans to demand greater public safety and national security from their elected officials ? 
In this age of terrorism , doctrines like free trade must be re-defined to include the public &apos;s interest in &quot; goods &quot; like safety as well as more conventional goods like televisions and autos . 
Otherwise , such doctrines lose their relevance . 
The transfer of potentially strategic information about ports into foreign and perhaps unfriendly hands clearly carries with it national security risks . 
It is futile for the Bush administration to deny it . 
Even the US Coast Guard could not rule out that the company &apos;s assets could be used for terrorist operations . 
Banning the takeover , on the other hand , would mean less efficient management of the ports , since the Dubai-based company is considered a better manager than the current one . 
This would mean a loss for the US , because , sooner or later , some of the efficiency gains achieved by the Dubai firm would be passed on to US ports in the form of higher lease payments . 
This case requires balancing national security risks with the efficiency gains from better management . 
Experts argue that the probability of a terrorist attack because of the Dubai takeover is small . 
Should the damage inflicted by a terrorist attack also be small , there would be no problem . 
But the damage inflicted by an attack might be tremendous , because ports are thought to be one of the few ways terrorists might smuggle nuclear weapons into the US . 
Because of this , Americans can &apos;t afford to take even the minutest of chances with their ports - the consequences of error being too staggering to contemplate . 
The American public understands this , even if their president does not . 
Free traders should not be dismayed . 
Rather than being protectionism in the usual sense , saying no to the Dubai takeover would reflect the desire to maximize the public interest more broadly and properly defined . 
This is the opposite to protectionism .
