Europe &apos;s Hidden Stimulus 
LONDON - When the European Council next meets , on February 7 , it should look at private investment as a means to kick-start Europe &apos;s stagnant economy . 
With the usual drivers of GDP growth constrained across Europe , the one economic sector able to spend is the non-financial corporate sector . 
Indeed , publicly traded European companies had excess cash holdings of € 750 billion ( $ 1 trillion ) in 2011 , close to a 20-year high . 
Unlocking that cash would give Europe a much larger stimulus package than any government can provide . 
In 2011 , for example , private investment in Europe totaled more than € 2 trillion , compared to government investment of less than € 300 billion . 
And yet , while trends among European economies have varied , private investment was , overall , the hardest-hit component of GDP during the crisis , plunging by more than € 350 billion - ten times greater than the fall in private consumption and four times more than the decline in real GDP - between 2007 and 2011 . 
The magnitude of the private-investment downturn was , in fact , unprecedented - and lies at the heart of Europe &apos;s economic malaise . 
Likewise , by historical standards , the private-investment recovery is running late . 
In more than 40 past episodes in which GDP fell and private investment declined by 10 % , recovery took an average of five years . 
Europe is four years removed from the onset of recession , but private investment in 2011 was still lower than its 2007 level in 26 of the European Union &apos;s 27 member states . 
To be sure , the fact that companies are holding on to their cash , rather than paying it out in dividends , signals that they expect investment opportunities to return - a far more positive situation than in Japan , for example , where companies lack cash to invest . 
But European companies remain hesitant , despite low interest rates , keeping private investment well below its previous peak . 
Governments can help to persuade companies to let go of their cash by removing regulatory barriers such as zoning regulations in retail and a plethora of requirements in the construction sector concerning everything from the height of ceilings to the size of staircase areas . 
They should also address the lack of uniform standards across Europe &apos;s internal borders ; for example , there are 11 separate signaling systems for rail freight in the EU-15 . 
After Sweden eased planning laws in its retail sector during the 1990 &quot; s , the country posted the strongest retail productivity growth in Europe ( and outstripped that of the United States ) between 1995 and 2005 . 
Standardization and liberalization in European telecoms underpinned 9 % growth in value added and productivity in this period , compared to 6 % growth in the US . 
The largest scope for renewed private investment is in capital-intensive sectors in which government has a major presence as regulator . 
Even if European countries were to close only 10 % of the variation in capital stock per worker at the subsector level , the impact could be more than € 360 billion in additional investment - offsetting the € 354 billion difference in private investment between 2007 and 2011 . 
Many projects , from airports to university campuses , benefit from returns over decades , which implies that weak demand in the short term will have only a limited impact on their overall viability . 
Even among more near-term projects , some - for example , retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient features - could become viable with action from policymakers . 
Some degree of investment will add to demand , which may persuade others to invest - a virtuous circle . 
This approach is not about &quot; picking winners and losers . &quot; 
It is about targeted microeconomic reforms that reduce or remove barriers to private investment , thereby encouraging the non-financial corporate sector to propel European GDP growth . 
But it is important to get this policy activism right . 
First , governments need to focus on sectors in which action is likely to trigger renewed investment on a scale large enough to boost GDP - and quickly enough to enable private investment to drive the recovery . 
Governments often become enamored of innovative sectors , such as semiconductors , that account for only a very small share of total investment . 
Policymakers may wish to develop these sectors as a catalyst to innovation , but they should not expect that such initiatives alone can spur a recovery in private investment . 
In fact , construction and real estate are the most promising candidates , as they account for roughly one-third of European fixed investment and more than 17 million jobs . 
Although these sectors are unlikely to rebound to pre-crisis levels in Greece , Ireland , and Spain for many years , other European economies , including the United Kingdom , Italy , and Sweden , as well as some Eastern European economies , have scope for further investment . 
To meet Europe &apos;s ambitious 2020 energy targets , retrofitting existing buildings and improving new buildings &quot; energy efficiency , including the use of more energy-efficient materials and equipment , could lead to roughly € 37 billion in additional annual investment between now and 2030 . 
In most European countries , action to spur private investment in local services and transport - both large sectors - should also be considered . 
Governments , however , need to understand the barriers to investment : regulatory failures ; weak enablers , including financial and human capital ; poor infrastructure ; and substandard technology . 
And they must undertake rigorous cost-benefit analyses , in order to ensure that any intervention translates into private investment that promotes productivity growth . 
It is here - at the level of execution - that governments often perform poorly . 
Too often , they spend money to support private-sector projects that fail to provide a positive return for the broader economy . 
Three ingredients are vital to getting it right : backing for initiatives at the highest political level ; participation by all key stakeholders in deciding what action to take and driving its implementation ; and establishing small , high-powered delivery units with clear mandates to coordinate interventions . 
Europe &apos;s leaders need to put private investment at the center of their growth strategy by devising policies that open the gates to large potential flows . 
The European Council meeting on February 7 is an ideal opportunity to make a start .
