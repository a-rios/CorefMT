Europe &apos;s Unending Berlusconi Problem 
LONDON - Silvio Berlusconi , Italy &apos;s three-time prime minister and the country &apos;s dominant politician for two decades , has now been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison - a sentence since reduced to one year . 
But few people in Italy - or in Europe - believe that Berlusconi will fade from Italian , or European , politics anytime soon . 
Just a few days ago , he declared his intention to remain involved in politics , though not to run for prime minister a fourth time . 
Whatever role Berlusconi chooses to play , it is unlikely to be a marginal one . 
He may not wish to be king again , but he certainly can be a kingmaker , owing to his control of Mediaset , Italy &apos;s largest media group . 
And , given his abysmal popularity ratings , he may decide to play the wild card , embrace a euro-skeptic and anti-government stance , and try to bring down Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s technocratic administration . 
Monti &apos;s government took over from Berlusconi in November 2011 , arriving with a clear mandate , and full parliamentary support , to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reassure Italy &apos;s eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund that the country was not going down the path taken by Greece . 
At the time of the G-20 summit in Cannes that month , Italy - and Europe - was dangerously close to collapse , with Berlusconi &apos;s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country &apos;s debt-service costs . 
Domestic political deadlock , and Berlusconi &apos;s inability to engage with Germany and France resulted in spiraling refinancing costs , with the spread relative to German bunds consistently over 500 basis points between July and November 2011 . 
The Monti government has restored market confidence and Italy &apos;s international credibility . 
The interest-rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points , but is still higher than it was three years ago . 
In addition , Italy &apos;s economic outlook remains highly uncertain . 
Indeed , the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding Italy . 
According to the IMF , the economy will remain in recession next year , and , though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 ( -0.7 % in 2013 , compared to -2.3 % this year ) , the unemployment rate is expected to rise further , from 10.6 % to 11.1 % . 
More needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term , improve the country &apos;s fiscal position in the medium term , and implement the structural reforms needed to make the Italian economy more robust and internationally competitive in the long term . 
Italy is ranked 43rd in the World Economic Forum &apos;s global competitiveness index , well below the main eurozone countries , owing to lack of investment - especially in human capital - and structural rigidities that have constrained growth for many years . 
The answer to Italy &apos;s economic problems is not , as Berlusconi advocates , an exit from the eurozone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency , which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competitiveness through irresponsible devaluations . 
Italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the eurozone , which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation , not currency devaluation , are the main drivers of competitiveness . 
A stable , competent , and responsible government with a comfortable parliamentary majority is essential to continue what Monti &apos;s government has initiated . 
While the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition , many uncertainties could derail the reform process . 
In particular , whether Italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a &quot; normal &quot; government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states . 
From this perspective , what Berlusconi advocates for Italy , and the consequences of his agenda for the eurozone , is not good news . 
Any hint that the country may be locked again in parliamentary inertia , as in the final months of Berlusconi &apos;s last government , would push the markets to question the credibility of Italy &apos;s fiscal-consolidation plan , jeopardizing the country &apos;s ability to refinance its debt . 
That debt is the largest in the eurozone - at roughly â‚¬ 2 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) , or 120 % of the country &apos;s GDP - which means that Italy can be helped , but not rescued . 
With potential instability looming , Monti should ensure that Italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability . 
Unlike some months ago , now the European Central Bank can intervene and buy troubled countries &quot; debt . 
Italy should follow this route without delay . 
It is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be unarmed in a time of need .
