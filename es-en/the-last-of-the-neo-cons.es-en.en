The Last of the Neo-Cons 
NEW YORK - With George W. Bush &apos;s presidency about to end , what will happen to the neo-conservatives ? 
Rarely in the history of American politics has a small number of bookish intellectuals had so much influence on foreign policy as the neo-cons had under Bush and his vice president , Dick Cheney , neither of whom are noted for their deep intellectual interests . 
Most presidents hope to attach some special meaning to their time in office . 
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , gave neo-con intellectuals the chance to lend their brand of revolutionary idealism to the Bush / Cheney enterprise . 
Writing for such journals as The Weekly Standard , and using the pulpits of think tanks , such as the American Enterprise Institute , neo-cons offered an intellectual boost to the invasion of Iraq . 
The logic of the American mission to spread freedom around the globe - rooted , it was argued , in US history since the Founding Fathers - demanded nothing less . 
Objections from European and Asian allies were brushed away as old-fashioned , unimaginative , cowardly reactions to the dawn of a new age of worldwide democracy , enforced by unassailable US military power . 
The neo-cons will not be missed by many . 
They made their last stand in the presidential election campaign of John McCain , whose foreign policy advisers included some prominent members of the fraternity ( most were men ) . 
None , so far , seem to have found much favor in the ranks of Barack Obama &apos;s consultants . 
Such clout as the neo-cons wielded under Bush is unusual in the political culture of the US , which is noted for its skepticism toward intellectual experiments . 
A certain degree of philistinism in politics is not a bad thing . 
Intellectuals , usually powerless themselves outside the rarified preserves of think tanks and universities , are sometimes too easily attracted to powerful leaders , in the hope that such leaders might actually carry out their ideas . 
But wise leaders are necessarily pragmatic , because messy reality demands compromise and accommodation . 
Only zealots want ideas to be pushed to their logical extremes . 
The combination of powerful leaders with authoritarian bent and intellectual idealists often results in bad policies . 
This is what happened when Bush and Cheney took up the ideas promoted by the neo-cons . 
Both had previously been pragmatic men . 
Bush first ran for office as a cautious conservative , prepared to be moderate at home and humble abroad . 
Cheney was better known as a ruthless bureaucratic operator than a man of bold ideas . 
The combustible mix of autocratic ambition and misguided idealism took hold soon after the terrorist attacks in September 2001 . 
Even if , by some miracle , Iraq were to evolve into a stable , harmonious , liberal democratic state , the price already paid in ( mostly Iraqi ) blood and ( mostly American ) treasure is already too high to justify the kind of revolutionary military intervention promoted by the neo-cons . 
Another casualty of neo-conservative hubris might be the idea of spreading democracy itself . 
Similar things have happened before , of course . 
The idealism of Japanese intellectuals in the 1930 &quot; s and early 1940 &quot; s was partly responsible for Japan &apos;s catastrophic war to &quot; liberate &quot; Asia from Western imperialism . 
The ideal of pan-Asian solidarity in a common struggle for independence was not a bad one ; in fact , it was commendable . 
But the idea that it could be enforced by the Imperial Japanese Army running amok through China and Southeast Asia was disastrous . 
Socialism , too , was a brave and necessary corrective to the social inequalities that emerged from laissez-faire capitalism . 
Watered down by the compromises without which liberal democracies cannot thrive , socialism did a great deal of good in Western Europe . 
But attempts to implement socialist or communist ideals through force ended in oppression and mass murder . 
This is why many Central and Eastern Europeans now view even social democracy with suspicion . 
Even as Barack Obama is worshipped in Western Europe , many Poles , Czechs , and Hungarians think he is some kind of socialist . 
The neo-cons , despite their name , were not really conservatives at all . 
They were radical opponents of the pragmatic approach to foreign strongmen espoused by people who called themselves &quot; realists . &quot; 
Even though the arch-realist Henry Kissinger endorsed the war in Iraq , his brand of realpolitik was the primary target of neo-con intellectuals . 
They believed that aggressive promotion of democracy abroad was not only moral , and in the American tradition , but in the national interest as well . 
There is a core of truth in this assertion . 
Liberals , too , can agree that Islamist terrorism , for instance , is linked to the lack of democracy in the Middle East . 
Realism , in the sense of balancing power by appeasing dictators , has its limits . 
Democracy must be encouraged , wherever possible , by the most powerful democracy on earth . 
But revolutionary wars are not the most effective way to do this . 
What is needed is to find a less belligerent , more liberal way to promote democracy , stressing international cooperation instead of blunt military force . 
Obama is unlikely to repeat the mistakes of the neo-cons .
