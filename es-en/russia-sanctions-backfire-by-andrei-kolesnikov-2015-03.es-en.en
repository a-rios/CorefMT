Why Sanctions on Russia Don &apos;t Work 
MOSCOW - The Western approach to Russia is predicated on the supposition that continued pressure on the country will cause President Vladimir Putin &apos;s regime to make concessions or even crumble . 
Nothing could be further from the truth . 
The assumption underlying the efficacy of Western sanctions is that the sharp economic deterioration that results from them will turn the Russian public , particularly the financial and political elite , against the Kremlin . 
Putin will not be able to withstand mounting dissent from affluent urban areas and the country &apos;s burgeoning middle class . 
Meanwhile , the thinking goes , military pressure - in the form of potential lethal aid to Ukraine - will similarly mobilize ordinary Russians against Putin . 
Unwilling to see their boys die for the Donbas , they will form an anti-war movement that will force him to rein in his territorial ambitions . 
Pressed at once from above and from below , the Kremlin will be have to change its policies , and perhaps even begin to democratize . 
What Western policymakers fail to understand is that such an approach is less likely to undermine the regime than to cause Russians to close ranks behind it . 
Opinion polls show that Russians perceive Western pressure and sanctions to be aimed not at Putin and his cronies , but at Russia and its citizens . 
In January , 69 % of Russians supported the Kremlin &apos;s policy in Ukraine , according to a poll by the independent Levada Center . 
To be sure , Putin &apos;s support is not rock-solid ; indeed , there is widespread suspicion about corruption in his government . 
And in this case , the compatriots under attack are Putin and his government . 
Known in the country as the Great Patriotic War , the effort to defend the country from German invasion remains sacred to many Russians . 
That is why the Kremlin has repackaged derogatory historical terms like &quot; Nazis &quot; to refer to Ukraine &apos;s current political elites . 
Russian society has been militarized for decades , if not centuries . 
Military preparedness was one of the most important shared values in the Soviet Union - a sentiment captured in the slogan emblazoned on the badges issued to children who excelled in athletics : &quot; Ready for Work and Defense . &quot; 
It is in this context that Putin has been able to use Western pressure as a tool to regain the support of many Russians , who only a few years ago would have felt detached from , if not alienated by , his government . 
Presented with a real or imagined threat to the fatherland , the average Russian supports the country &apos;s leaders . 
Nor is the Russian middle class , which makes up some 20-30 % of the population , likely to pose much of a threat to Putin . 
With many of its members owing their recent wealth to high oil prices and the economic recovery of the 2000s , loyalty to the Putin regime is one of the Russian middle class &apos;s abiding characteristics . 
Russian opinion polling and sociological research tends to show that the higher one &apos;s position in society , the more likely one is to vote for the incumbents . 
The motives behind such voting patterns may vary - some voters made a fortune during the economic recovery , while others are simply satisfied with the status quo . 
Indeed , only a small portion of the middle class attended the protests that gathered force in late 2011 and early 2012 , most of them concentrated in Moscow . 
And , in any case , Putin &apos;s clampdown on dissent was predictably ruthless . 
He tightened legislation aimed at throttling civil society , pursued lawsuits against protesters , and blocked the activity of Alexei Navalny , a promising opposition politician . 
These efforts have had a lasting effect on the groups that were at the heart of the protest movement . 
Russians of all walks of life have shown that they prefer passive adaptation over protest . 
In the face of growing economic pressures , Russia &apos;s middle class is steering clear of political involvement . 
The working class is no different . 
The more the West increases its pressure , the less likely it becomes that this will change .
