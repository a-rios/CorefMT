Asia in the World 
NEW YORK - Before I became the UN &apos;s Secretary-General , I was an Asian diplomat . 
While I was foreign minister of the Republic of Korea , my Government and I strongly advocated d√©tente with the North . 
When some in the world called for sanctions and punitive action , South Korea pushed for dialogue . 
That requires listening as well as speaking . 
It means sticking to principles , but also attempting to understand the other side , however irrational or intransigent it may sometimes appear . 
This remains my style at the United Nations . 
I believe in the power of diplomacy and engagement . 
I prioritize dialogue over debate or declaration . 
Above all , I seek results . 
We are doing that now in Myanmar . 
My Special Adviser , Ibrahim Gambari , has been back in Yangon . 
His brief is to be the honest broker , the facilitator of a dialogue between government and opposition leaders , particularly Aung San Suu Kyi . 
The goal is for Myanmar &apos;s Government to release all detained students and demonstrators , engage with the opposition , move toward a more democratic society , and rejoin the international community . 
This brand of diplomacy is not quick or easy . 
There is seldom applause , and often no outward evidence of movement . 
It is a quiet , painstaking slog behind the scenes . 
You have to work the phones , cajole world leaders to do this or that . 
It is a symphony - often not a very harmonious one - of small steps that you hope will lead to something greater . 
You expect nothing . 
You can only keep trying , keep pushing . 
Maybe it works , maybe not . 
Then you try some more , in a different way , aiming all the while for some small progress that makes the next step possible . 
We are at this point in Darfur . 
I have spent hundreds of hours working behind closed doors with various parties to the conflict - Sudan &apos;s Government , rebel leaders , neighbouring countries , and African Union partners . 
Meanwhile , we are pushing ahead with one of the most complex peacekeeping operations in our history , feeding and protecting hundreds of thousands of displaced people , and sponsoring difficult peace negotiations in Libya . 
But even as I push my brand of &quot; Asian &quot; diplomacy , it can sometimes feel a bit lonely to be an Asian at the international community &apos;s diplomatic roundtable . 
We Asians inhabit the world &apos;s largest continent , with the world &apos;s largest population and its fastest-growing economies . 
We have a rich history and ancient cultures . 
Yet our role in international affairs is far less than it could , or should be . 
Asia &apos;s contribution to the UN , though significant , could be greater . 
Its humanitarian assistance , to put it politely , is less than generous . 
We are the only continent where regional integration and common markets have not taken hold . 
Latin Americans and North Americans dream of creating a free-trade zone . 
Europeans speak of building a United States of Europe . 
The African Union aspires to become a United States of Africa . 
Why no United States of Asia ? 
There are many reasons why Asia is different : history , cultural diversity , unresolved territorial and political disputes , a lack of multilateral experience , and the predominance of one or two centers of power . 
But the main reason is that we have not tried . 
Asia does not do itself justice . 
As an Asian Secretary-General , I hope to see this change . 
I hope to see an Asia that is both better integrated and more internationally engaged . 
I expect particularly great things of my fellow Koreans , a remarkable people who have come into their own . 
I hope to see Korea assume more responsibility in the world , commensurate with its growing economic clout - especially in the area of development , one of the three pillars of the UN Charter . 
Koreans need to step up , speak out , and do more , and that should start with more generous official development assistance . 
Koreans have already shown their penchant for multi-lateral diplomacy and trouble shooting through the six-party talks . 
Now , they , and Asians at large , need to bring both their skills and their success to bear on the most pressing global issues of the day . 
This is not just my hope , it is also Asia &apos;s obligation .
