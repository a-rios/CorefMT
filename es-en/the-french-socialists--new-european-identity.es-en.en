The French Socialists &quot; New European Identity 
The French Socialist Party may well have just saved ratification of the European Union &apos;s draft Constitutional Treaty by France in next summer &apos;s referendum . 
At the beginning of December , party members and supporters voted overwhelmingly in favor of the treaty . 
With the popularity of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin - and French rightist forces more broadly - in steep decline , a &quot; no &quot; vote could have tipped the public against ratification . 
But the French Socialists &quot; vote is also important for the European Left . 
The French Socialist Party never had its &quot; aggiornamento &quot; or &quot; Bad Godesberg &quot; ( where the German SPD in 1959 renounced its last vestiges of Marxism ) . 
As a result , French Socialists always positioned themselves to the left of their European partners , giving a major economic role to the state following the big nationalizations that took place in 1981 after François Mitterrand was first elected president . 
Later it fought against Tony Blair &apos;s &quot; Third Way &quot; and Gerhard Schröder &apos;s &quot; new center &quot; in the late 1990 &quot; s . 
The party did choose Europe over dogma in 1983 , when Mitterrand decided to remain in the European Monetary System . 
That December vote on the EU Constitutional Treaty closed this parenthesis : by approving of it , the Socialists consciously accepted a reformist , social democratic , European identity . 
They have positioned themselves as a great power on the left , with a central position in the European Socialist Party , offering an alternative to the prescriptions of New Labour and the SPD . 
This outcome did not come without a fight . 
Powerful mainstream Socialists , such as former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius , joined traditional leftist minorities in the party - either rigidly euroskeptic or unrealistically euromaximalist - to rally around refusal . 
This stance came as a shock from Fabius , a signatory of the Single Act of 1986 , a party leader during the Maastricht Treaty negotiations , and Finance Minister when France adopted the euro in 2001 . 
Clearly , political calculations played a role : Fabius intuitively felt that the French , especially those on the left , oppose the construction of Europe in its current form , and that carrying the banner of rejection could win him the party leadership - and thus its presidential nomination in 2007 . 
This reasoning proved wrong : the Socialists &quot; members and voters know that there is no alternative to Europe and accepted the Treaty as a means of going further , despite its imperfections . 
But limiting the significance of the &quot; no &quot; vote to mere political calculation would be a mistake , for it also reflects the importance of the &quot; French malaise &quot; about Europe . 
The French perceive Europe as distant , technocratic , and often the Trojan horse of liberal globalization and deindustrialization . 
These doubts are even stronger among those who consider the ideals of a social Europe insufficiently fulfilled , owing to the right &apos;s political dominance : control of 18 of 25 governments , the same number of European commissioners , and a majority in the European Parliament . 
Moreover , Lionel Jospin &apos;s elimination from the presidential election in 2002 by the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen is widely interpreted - wrongly in my opinion - as the result of the Socialists &quot; pro-European position . 
But the Socialist &quot; yes &quot; to Europe should not be confused with the &quot; yes &quot; given by the right . 
French Socialists support the Constitutional Treaty as a way to strengthen political effectiveness and democratic accountability in the EU , and because it advances the cause of social progress by integrating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and defining goals such as full employment , sustainable development , anti-discrimination , and gender equality . 
The Socialist &quot; yes &quot; also means support for increasing Europe &apos;s standing as a global power through the creation of an EU ministry of foreign affairs . 
This doesn &apos;t amount to a conversion to liberal principles or a substitution of Europe for the ideals of the left and of socialism . 
The treaty is but a necessary step to successful EU enlargement and further progress on Europe &apos;s construction ; it is not an end in itself . 
The essential task for the European Socialist Party now is to build a vision for Europe that addresses its constituencies &quot; concerns and inspires their hopes . 
The party cannot evade demands for a more social Europe and for solutions to weak growth and high unemployment . 
The European Socialists will also have to define a more ambitious budget strategy , with higher spending for research , education , and other social investments , develop an industrial policy that transcends the simplistic logic of competitiveness , affirm a legal framework for European public services , and support greater EU-wide social and fiscal homogeneity . 
There has been progress on all these issues , guided by a report entitled &quot; For a progressive Europe &quot; delivered by Pascal Lamy to the European Socialist Party &apos;s leader , former Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen . 
Clearly , the French &quot; yes &quot; did not solve everything . 
Europe &apos;s left must still clarify its vision of the future . 
The internal debates will be heated and their conclusions difficult for some to accept .
