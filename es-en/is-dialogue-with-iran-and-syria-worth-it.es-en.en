Is Dialogue with Iran and Syria Worth It ? 
Despite frequent claims to the contrary , the fundamental problem in the Middle East is not intervention by the West . 
On the contrary , the real problem is that , for all their dabbling , the Western powers seem capable of neither war nor dialogue . 
This leaves everyone in the region at the mercy of the Middle East &apos;s oppressive regimes and proliferating terrorists . 
Advocates of the Iraq war lacked an understanding of the complexities on the ground to wage an effective war of liberation and democratization . 
As a result , their policies merely ended up eliminating Iran &apos;s two major regional rivals : the Taliban and Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime . 
This presented Iran with a golden opportunity to project itself as a regional hegemon , and Iran &apos;s leaders are unlikely to let this opportunity slip away . 
Advocates of dialogue with the Iranians and their Syrian allies , like former United States Secretary of State James Baker , labor under the delusion that they can actually reach an understanding that can enable a graceful US exit from Iraq and help stabilize that wounded country . 
The delusion is based on two false assumptions : that the Iranians and the Syrians can succeed in Iraq where the US has failed , and that the international community can afford to pay the price of ensuring their cooperation . 
True , Syria and Iran are playing a major role in supporting Iraqi insurgents , and Syria is still encouraging the trafficking of jihadists and weapons across its borders with Iraq . 
But the idea that these activities can be halted at will is na√Øve . 
For one thing , the interests of the Shia communities in Iraq and Iran are not the same . 
Iraqi Shia have never accepted Iranian dictates , and many took part in Saddam &apos;s war against Iran in the 1980 &quot; s . 
After all , the Iraqi Shia are Arabs , and if they are now willing to coordinate their activities with their Persian counterparts , their main goal will always be to secure an independent course as soon as possible , even while they carry on with their internecine disputes within Iraq . 
Iran is in no better position than the US to convince them to resolve their differences . 
President Basher al-Assad of Syria faces a similar dilemma . 
Although he has opened Syria &apos;s border to jihadists and has allowed Saddam &apos;s supporters to operate freely there , that choice may not be entirely his . 
Syria &apos;s aid to Saddam in maneuvering around the United Nations &quot; oil-for food program brought Iraqi money to inhabitants of the border region , who have always been closer in customs , dialect , and outlook to their Iraqi neighbors than to their fellow Syrians . 
In the absence of government investment , local inhabitants &quot; loyalty went to Iraqi Baathists who helped improve their lot . 
Indeed , even local security apparatuses have been unwilling to comply with dictates from Assad and his clique to seal the borders . 
In these cirumstances , neither Syria nor Iran seems capable of delivering anything but mayhem in Iraq . 
What , then , would the proposed dialogue between the US and these states achieve other than continue to empower their corrupt yet ambitious regimes ? 
The story gets more complicated when one considers the UN inquiry into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri . 
Assad wants nothing more than to see this affair forgotten - and the proponents of dialogue think that they can give him what he wants in the hope of breaking Syria &apos;s alliance with Iran . 
But that is merely another erroneous ( not to mention amoral ) assumption . 
The alliance between Syria and Iran dates back more than two decades , and was explicitly reaffirmed by the two ruling regimes as recently as January 2005 . 
Indeed , the two regimes are now joined at the hip . 
Assad &apos;s recent refusal to attend a summit in Tehran with his Iranian and Iraqi counterparts was a mere tactical move designed to appeal to the proponents of dialogue . 
In fact , Iran has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Syria , and annual bilateral trade tops a billion dollars . 
Irani &apos;s growing influence over the Syrian security apparatus is well established , and Iran is funding an effort to create Syrian Shia militias to compensate for Assad &apos;s sagging support in the army and in the minority Alawite community . 
Assad cannot turn his back on all of this . 
No deal would be sweet enough , even if it included the return of the Golan Heights . 
For Assad and his supporters , survival is more important than sovereignty . 
Still , to read the well-known names of commentators and policymakers who are recommending engaging Syria and / or Iran is a testament to how inconsequential and cut off the Western powers have become from the realities on the ground in the world &apos;s most turbulent region . 
That , it seems , is the price of their arrogance .
