How to Emerge from the Crisis in 2009 
WASHINGTON , DC - In the maelstrom of events and news that characterize the current global crisis , it is often difficult to keep a clear head and a sense of what is really going on . 
Let me first set the scene by making three observations on where we are today . 
First , in the advanced countries , we have probably seen the worst of the financial crisis . 
There are still land mines , from unknowable credit default swap ( CDS ) positions to hidden losses on balance sheets , but the worst days of frozen money markets and obscene risk spreads are probably over . 
Second , and unfortunately , the financial crisis has moved to emerging countries . 
In crossing borders , the sharp portfolio reallocations and the rush to safer assets are creating not only financial but also exchange-rate crises . 
Add to this the drop in output in advanced countries , and you can see how emerging countries now suffer from both higher credit costs and decreased export demand . 
Third , in the advanced economies , the hit to wealth , and even more so the specter of another Great Depression , has led people and firms to curtail spending sharply . 
Not only have they revised their spending plans , but , in many cases , they have delayed purchases , waiting for the uncertainty to clear . 
The result has been a sharp drop in output and employment , reinforcing fears about the future , and further decreasing spending . 
Let me now turn to policy . 
If my characterization of events is correct , then the right set of policies is straightforward : 
First , the measures put in place earlier to repair the financial system must be refined and consolidated . 
One silver lining of the worst days of the crisis in October was to scare governments into action on the financial front . 
Central banks generously provided liquidity . 
But governments soon realized that the main issue was solvency . 
They pledged to implement programs aimed at asset purchases ( to clarify the balance sheets of financial institutions ) , recapitalization ( to make sure that , if solvent , they could operate and continue to lend ) , and guarantees ( to reassure depositors and some investors that their funds were safe ) . 
The basic architecture for these measures is now in place , but the implementation has been often haphazard . 
Lessons from previous banking crises around the world could have been learned faster . 
The twists and turns in some of the programs , most notably in the United States , have left markets confused , and have led private investors to stay on the sidelines , waiting for policy clarification before taking a stake in financial institutions . 
I have little doubt that learning by doing will eventually lead to coherent programs . 
Second , emerging market countries must get help in adjusting to the financial crisis . 
It is not just a question of providing them with liquidity so that they can simply maintain their exchange rates in the face of a large capital outflows . 
Many investors who want out will not return for some time , and countries must accept this fact and adjust accordingly . 
In some cases , they can do this on their own , so all that is needed is liquidity support to avoid a collapse of the exchange rate and allow for the adjustment to occur . 
In other cases , the capital outflows only worsen already difficult situations . 
These countries need more than liquidity ; they need financial help to carry out the necessary adjustments . 
Are the proper help measures in place ? 
Yes and no . 
For a few countries , the main central banks have provided access to liquidity through swap lines . 
The International Monetary Fund , for its part , has created a new liquidity facility , enabling countries that pre-qualify to apply and get funds with little or no conditionality . 
For the time being , these arrangements have been sufficient . 
As for countries that need more help , this is the IMF &apos;s natural function . 
A number of countries have already obtained funds under program lending . 
Third , governments must counteract the sharp drop in consumption and investment demand . 
In the absence of strong policies , it is too easy to think of scary scenarios in which depressed output and troubles in the financial system feed on each other , leading to further large drops in output . 
It is thus essential for governments to make clear that they will do everything to eliminate this downside risk . 
Can they credibly do it ? 
The answer is yes . 
With interest rates already low , the room for monetary policy is limited . 
First , in countries in which there is fiscal space , they must announce credible fiscal expansions ; we - the IMF - believe that , as a whole , a global fiscal expansion about 2 % of world GDP is both feasible and appropriate . 
Finally , and just as importantly , governments must indicate that , if conditions deteriorate , further fiscal expansion will be implemented . 
Only with such a commitment will people and firms be confident that we are not headed for a repeat of the Great Depression , and start spending again . 
My strong belief is that if these policies are followed , by the end of 2009 , if not sooner , the world economy will start recovering from the crisis .
