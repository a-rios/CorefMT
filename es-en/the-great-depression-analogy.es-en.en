The Great Depression Analogy 
PRINCETON - Whenever today &apos;s economic crisis is discussed , analogies to the Great Depression are never far away . 
In its latest &quot; World Economic Outlook , &quot; the IMF examines the analogy explicitly , in terms not only of the collapse of financial confidence , but also of the rapid decline in global trade and industrial activity . 
In general , history , rather than economic theory , seems to offer a guide to interpreting wildly surprising and inherently unpredictable events . 
Almost every contemporary use of the depression analogy takes the year 1929 as a reference point . 
But two completely different pathologies were manifest in the Great Depression ; each called for different diagnoses - and different cures . 
The first , and most famous , pathology was the stock market crash of October 1929 in the United States . 
No other country had a stock market panic of similar magnitude , in large part because no other country had experienced the euphoric run-up of stock prices that sucked large numbers of Americans , from very different backgrounds , into financial speculation . 
The second pathology was decisive in turning a bad recession into the Great Depression . 
A series of bank panics emanated from central Europe in the summer of 1931 and spread financial contagion to Great Britain , then to the US and France , and finally around the world . 
The 1929 panic has dominated all analysis of the depression for two rather peculiar reasons . 
First , no one has ever been able to explain satisfactorily the October 1929 market collapse in terms of a rational cause , with market participants reacting to a specific news event . 
So the crash presents an intellectual puzzle , and economists can build their reputations on trying to find innovative accounts . 
Some people conclude that markets are simply irrational . 
Others strain to produce complicated models , according to which investors might have been able to foresee the Depression , or ponder the likelihood of protectionist reactions in other countries to the American tariff act , though the US legislation had not yet even been finalized . 
The second reason that 1929 has been popular with academic and political commentators is that it provides a clear motive for taking particular policy measures . 
Keynesians have been able to demonstrate that fiscal stimulus can stabilize market expectations , and thus provide an overall framework of confidence . 
Monetarists tell an alternative but parallel story of how stable monetary growth avoids radical perturbations . 
The 1929 crash had no obvious cause , but two very plausible solutions . 
The European banking disaster of 1931 was exactly the other way round . 
No academic laurels are to be won by finding innovative accounts as its cause : the collapses were the result of financial weakness in countries where bad policies produced hyper-inflation , which destroyed banks &quot; balance sheets . 
Intrinsic vulnerability made for heightened exposure to political shocks , and disputes about a Central European customs union and about war reparations was enough to topple a house of cards . 
But repairing the damage was tough . 
Unlike 1929 , there were ( and are ) no obvious macroeconomic answers to financial distress . 
Some famous macroeconomists , including Larry Summers , the current chief economic thinker of the Obama administration , have tried to play down the role of financial-sector instability in causing depressions . 
The answers , if they exist , lie in the slow and painful cleaning up of balance sheets ; and in microeconomic restructuring , which cannot simply be imposed from above by an omniscient planner , but requires many businesses and individuals to change their outlook and behavior . 
The improvement of regulation and supervision , while a good idea , is better suited to avoiding future crises than to dealing with the consequences of a catastrophe that has already occurred . 
The consequence of the long academic and popular discussion of the 1929 crisis is that people have come to expect that there must be easy answers . 
But the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 was a 1931-like event , highly reminiscent of the world of depression economics . 
Austrian and German bank collapses would not have driven the entire world from recession into depression if those countries had simply been isolated or self-contained economies . 
But they had built their economies on borrowed money - chiefly from America - in the second half of the 1920 &quot; s . 
That dependence is analogous to the way in which money from emerging economies , mostly in Asia , flowed into the US in the 2000 &quot; s , when an apparent economic miracle was based on China &apos;s willingness to lend . 
The bank collapses in 1931 , and in September 2008 , have shaken the confidence of the international creditor : then the US , now China . 
Both lessons - about the slowness and painfulness of bank reconstruction , and about dependence on a large external provider of capital - are unpalatable . 
For a long time , it was much easier to repeat the soothing mantra that the world community had collectively learned how to avoid a 1929-style collapse , and that the world &apos;s central banks clearly showed this in 1987 or 2001 . 
Governments undoubtedly merit praise for stabilizing expectations , and thus preventing crises from worsening . 
But it is misleading when officials tout simple , if not simplistic , policy proposals as the basis for hoping that we can avoid a long period of difficult economic adjustment .
