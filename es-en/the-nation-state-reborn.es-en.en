The Nation-State Reborn 
CAMBRIDGE - One of our era &apos;s foundational myths is that globalization has condemned the nation-state to irrelevance . 
The revolution in transport and communications , we hear , has vaporized borders and shrunk the world . 
New modes of governance , ranging from transnational networks of regulators to international civil-society organizations to multilateral institutions , are transcending and supplanting national lawmakers . 
Domestic policymakers , it is said , are largely powerless in the face of global markets . 
The global financial crisis has shattered this myth . 
Who bailed out the banks , pumped in the liquidity , engaged in fiscal stimulus , and provided the safety nets for the unemployed to thwart an escalating catastrophe ? 
Who is re-writing the rules on financial-market supervision and regulation to prevent another occurrence ? 
Who gets the lion &apos;s share of the blame for everything that goes wrong ? 
The answer is always the same : national governments . 
The G-20 , the International Monetary Fund , and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have been largely sideshows . 
Even in Europe , where regional institutions are comparatively strong , it is national interest and national policymakers , largely in the person of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who have dominated policymaking . 
Had Merkel been less enamored of austerity for Europe &apos;s debt-distressed countries , and had she managed to convince her domestic electorate of the need for a different approach , the eurozone crisis would have played out quite differently . 
Yet even as the nation-state survives , its reputation lies in tatters . 
The intellectual assault on it takes two forms . 
First , there is the critique by economists who view governments as an impediment to the freer flow of goods , capital , and people around the world . 
Prevent domestic policymakers from intervening with their regulations and barriers , they say , and global markets will take care of themselves , in the process creating a more integrated and efficient world economy . 
But who will provide the market &apos;s rules and regulations , if not nation-states ? 
Laissez-faire is a recipe for more financial crises and greater political backlash . 
Moreover , it would require entrusting economic policy to international technocrats , insulated as they are from the push and pull of politics - a stance that severely circumscribes democracy and political accountability . 
In short , laissez-faire and international technocracy does not provide a plausible alternative to the nation-state . 
Indeed , the erosion of the nation-state ultimately does little good for global markets as long as we lack viable mechanisms of global governance . 
Second , there are cosmopolitan ethicists who decry the artificiality of national borders . 
As the philosopher Peter Singer has put it , the communications revolution has spawned a &quot; global audience &quot; that creates the basis for a &quot; global ethics . &quot; 
If we identify ourselves with the nation , our morality remains national . 
But , if we increasingly associate ourselves with the world at large , our loyalties will expand , too . 
Similarly , the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen speaks of our &quot; multiple identities &quot; - ethnic , religious , national , local , professional , and political - many of which cross national boundaries . 
It is unclear how much of this is wishful thinking and how much is based on real shifts in identities and attachments . 
Survey evidence shows that attachment to the nation-state remains quite strong . 
A few years ago , the World Values Survey questioned respondents in scores of countries about their attachments to their local communities , their nations , and to the world at large . 
Not surprisingly , those who viewed themselves as national citizens greatly outnumbered those who regarded themselves as world citizens . 
But , strikingly , national identity overshadowed even local identity in the United States , Europe , India , China , and most other regions . 
The same surveys indicate that younger people , the highly educated , and those who identify themselves as upper class , are more likely to associate themselves with the world . 
Nevertheless , it is difficult to identify any demographic segment in which attachment to the global community outweighs attachment to the country . 
As large as the decline in transport and communications costs has been , it has not obliterated geography . 
Economic , social , and political activity remains clustered on the basis of preferences , needs , and historical trajectories that vary around the globe . 
Geographical distance is as strong a determinant of economic exchange as it was a half-century ago . 
Even the Internet , it turns out , is not as borderless as it seems : one study found that Americans are much more likely to visit Web sites from countries that are physically close than from countries that are far away , even after controlling for language , income , and many other factors . 
The trouble is that we are still in the grasp of the myth of the nation-state &apos;s decline . 
Political leaders plead impotence , intellectuals dream up implausible global-governance schemes , and the losers increasingly blame immigrants or imports . 
Talk about re-empowering the nation-state and respectable people run for cover , as if one has proposed reviving the plague . 
To be sure , the geography of attachments and identities is not fixed ; indeed , it has changed over the course of history . 
That means that we should not entirely dismiss the likelihood that a true global consciousness will develop in the future , along with transnational political communities . 
But today &apos;s challenges cannot be met by institutions that do not ( yet ) exist . 
For now , people still must turn for solutions to their national governments , which remain the best hope for collective action . 
The nation-state may be a relic bequeathed to us by the French Revolution , but it is all that we have .
