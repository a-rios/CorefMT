China &apos;s Aborted Openness 
China &apos;s state-run Xinhua news agency recently reported on a government investigation into a string of forced sterilizations and abortions in the village of Linyi , Shandong province . 
The speed of the investigation - said to have begun days after the kidnapping of Chen Guangcheng , a blind activist who had been a public advocate for the victims - and the candor of the report created the impression of greater government responsiveness and bolder official media . 
Is this impression right ? 
The story in Linyi is the kind of news that propaganda officials usually bury in the Communist Party &apos;s secret files . 
According to reports , local authorities in Linyi , seeking to avoid exceeding birth quotas under China &apos;s &quot; one-child &quot; policy , forced several women to undergo abortions and forcibly sterilized many couples with more than one child . 
Villagers who hid to avoid the campaign reportedly saw their family members jailed . 
Some in Linyi alleged degrading treatment , torture , and extortion . 
Why investigate and report this scandal ? 
The Xinhua reports , I believe , are best read as damage control . 
China is trying to secure funding from the United Nations to improve reproductive health - an effort that has been set back by reports of forced abortion . 
Central authorities did not investigate the Linyi abuses until news of the harassment of Chen Guangcheng - and his abduction with the help of Beijing police - spread into international media . 
Chen had reported the abuses to officials and asked a non-governmental organization , the Citizens &quot; Rights Defense Group , to investigate . 
The group went to Linyi in May . 
A month later , the network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders reported the group &apos;s findings and demanded the intervention of the central government &apos;s Family Planning Commission ( FPC ) . 
As a volunteer for the network , I was in touch with Chen and followed events closely . 
In July , having failed to elicit any government response , Chen began seeking legal aid from prominent lawyers to prepare lawsuits on behalf of the victims , causing alarm among local officials . 
My &quot; personal safety was threatened , &quot; he wrote on August 30 in the last email I received from him . 
Following strenuous international protests over Chen &apos;s kidnapping , the FPC decided to investigate . 
Xinhua announced that local officials responsible for the violence might be prosecuted . 
Central authorities seemed to sense an immediate need to quell criticism of its controversial population-control efforts . 
However , central government authorities have done little to halt intimidation of Linyi &apos;s villagers . 
Chen was released from detention but remains under house arrest and was dragged back to the police station on September 2 for unknown reasons . 
Police refuse to return Chen &apos;s personal computer and cell phone . 
The village , too , is mysteriously without phone service . 
Meanwhile , through arrests , threats , and bribery , authorities are forcing villagers to withdraw accounts of abuse and back out of their lawsuits , warning of the dire consequences of cooperating with Chen and the lawyers . 
The FPC declines to intervene , citing lack of law-enforcement powers . 
On October 10 , the villagers &quot; lawyers were told that the court hearing scheduled that day was canceled . 
On their way back to Beijing , thugs reportedly assaulted the lawyers . 
Viewed in this context , the belief that the government &apos;s approach to Linyi reflects a new responsiveness to human-rights abuses seems na√Øve . 
If the government were truly becoming more responsive , why have we not seen similar responses to other disputes over the theft of farmland , compromised investors &quot; rights , or high-level corruption ? 
In all these cases , authorities have responded with repression , including the hiring of plain-clothes militias to kidnap or beat up people who attempt to publicize problems . 
China &apos;s belated bouts of openness about the rural spread of AIDS and the SARS epidemic clearly indicate that the central government regards transparency solely as a matter of expediency . 
Others argue that China &apos;s government is simply losing its grip over local authorities . 
This prospect is hardly encouraging . 
If abuses and repression in the provinces continue no matter how attentive the central government , or how assertive the press might have become , what then ? 
More likely , however , the central authorities are following a policy that most Chinese know well : neijin waisong , or &quot; controlled inside , relaxed outside . &quot; 
Applied here , the policy means consolidating power at home while disarming critics abroad . 
I believe that the government &apos;s loss of control in the provinces has been stage-managed . 
Chaos provides a cover for crackdowns . 
It is too convenient when unidentified strongmen beat and harass activists who question Party rule , and it is too easy for officials to blame an out-of-control &quot; criminal society &quot; when international media start asking questions . 
Suspiciously targeted &quot; criminal &quot; assaults have , indeed , occurred in places other than Linyi . 
Thugs thrashed civil rights activist Lu Banglie in the Guangdong town of Taishi in early October . 
Six villagers in the Hebei village of Dingzhou , protesting government seizure of their land , died after bloody clashes with a gang of toughs in July . 
The list goes on . 
State media recently started releasing year-end &quot; mass incident &quot; statistics . 
Last year , the government said , there were 74,000 such incidents . 
Observers marvel that China &apos;s leaders admit to such a staggering number of protests . 
State-run media organs have been forced to admit that these protests test the Party &apos;s will to maintain power . 
They neglect to tell the real story of how the Party exercises that will , trusting that the admission itself will satisfy us . 
We should not be so quick to play along .
