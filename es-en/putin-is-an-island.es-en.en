Putin Is An Island 
No man is an island , the poet John Donne said . 
If he is well briefed for his summit in Moscow and Saint Petersburg , President Bush should discount Donne &apos;s wisdom . 
The elite &apos;s gripes about Putin &apos;s foreign policy are many , but they center mostly on the notion that America is running roughshod over Russian interests . 
American troops , they complain , are on the ground in the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Kyrgizstan , Tadjikistan , and Uzbelistan . 
The next wave of NATO expansion promises to lap onto Russia &apos;s border and indeed surpass the old Soviet borders by taking in the Baltic states . 
Foreign investment has scarcely increased . 
Putin , they allege , has surrendered Russia &apos; traditional notions of security and received nothing from the West in return . 
The crimes they attribute to Putin sound like the indictment for a treason trial . 
After making his bold moves towards the West after September 11 th , Putin undoubtedly expected to receive praise and favors in return . 
Of course , the West &apos;s ingratitude has been marked : America withdrew from the 1972 ABM Treaty and has now rammed a vague disarmament agreement - to be signed during the summit and which will allow the US not to destroy surplus missiles and warheads but rather to put them in cold storage - down Putin &apos;s throat . 
Even Putin &apos;s Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov , a former KGB colleague and a man often considered to be Putin &apos;s closest advisor within his government , does not fully agree with him on the terms of collaboration with America . 
If the Russian-Western alliance fails to bring tangible benefits to Russia soon , there is a growing fear that the loss of confidence in Putin may weaken him fatally . 
There is an eerie sense of déja vu in all this . 
Khrushchev , Gorbachev and Yeltsin all saw their hold on power undermined when they sought to please or placate the West only to receive nothing in return . 
Weakened by the perception of allowing the West to mistreat Russia , their influence among Russia &apos;s ruling elite disintegrated . 
But there is a critical difference between the Russia of today and even Yeltsin &apos;s early postcommunist Russia . 
Under Khrushchev and Gorbachev ( and also Yeltsin ) , Russia was an autocratic society in which control of the elite was the key to power . 
Civil society didn &apos;t exist . 
Only the power bureaucracy mattered . 
The faceless mass was just that : faceless and powerless . 
Public opinion didn &apos;t matter ; it didn &apos;t even exist . 
That elite , the old politburo nomenclature , was united by homogenized opinions . 
You kept power by sticking together in thought and word and deed . 
Change was anathema , risk to be avoided at all costs . 
Better to stick to a tried and failed policy than to upset the apple cart , even if the apples were rotten . 
Today &apos;s Russia is no longer a two-tier society . 
It is a society with a diversity of opinions , options , opportunities and interest groups . 
Democracy , every Westerner will tell you , is not founded on what the élite think ; it &apos;s what the people think that matters - or at least what a contending rabble of rival interests think . 
But the most important thing is that people are free to think , which Russia &apos;s people undoubtedly are now free to do . 
What they think is that Vladimir Putin is looking after Russian interests , which now include being an unconditional part of the West . 
Public opinion matters , and Russia &apos;s elite knows it . 
Yes , Putin cares that the elite are keeping their distance from his foreign policy . 
But he knows something that they don &apos;t seem to recognize : Russia &apos;s people endorse his policies and do not want them overturned . 
Of course , the elite works behind the scenes to retard Putin &apos;s efforts , which is one reason why his ideas for military reform have gone almost nowhere under Sergei Ivanov &apos;s direction . 
But obstructing is far from overthrowing . 
Putin may well be as isolated as my grandfather Nikita Khrushchev was in 1964 , when Leonid Brezhnev organized his palace coup against him . 
Yet he is nowhere near as vulnerable , thanks to his widespread grassroots support among ordinary Russians . 
Indeed , in the old days , Russia relied on its strength , mostly military , to determine its self-image . 
Russia &apos;s elite still embraces this vision . 
But after the disasters of the last two decades , including the military debacle in Afghanistan and the ruinous barbarity of the Chechen war which has blown back its violence into Russia &apos;s cities , ordinary Russians are less enamored of military might . 
They still revere their country , of course , and want the world to respect it . 
But it is respect for Russia &apos;s culture that matters most to them , and such does not come at the barrel of a gun . 
The obsession with power and prestige that galvanizes Russia &apos;s elite hardly matters at all . 
Russian society today is diversified and democratic , and its support for Putin is stronger than the grudges Russia &apos;s élite hold against him . 
So perhaps John Donne was partly right : if Putin is an island , he is one in a sea of millions of islands . 
The bell of a coup will not toll for him .
