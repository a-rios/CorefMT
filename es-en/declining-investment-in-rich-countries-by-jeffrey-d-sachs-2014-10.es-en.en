A New Macroeconomic Strategy 
NEW YORK - I am a macroeconomist , but I dissent from the profession &apos;s two leading camps in the United States : the neo-Keynesians , who focus on boosting aggregate demand , and the supply-siders , who focus on cutting taxes . 
Both schools have tried and failed to overcome the high-income economies &quot; persistently weak performance in recent years . 
It is time for a new strategy , one based on sustainable , investment-led growth . 
The core challenge of macroeconomics is to allocate society &apos;s resources to their best use . 
It is on this third challenge that both neo-Keynesians and supply-siders have dropped the ball . 
Most high-income countries - the US , most of Europe , and Japan - are failing to invest adequately or wisely toward future best uses . 
There are two ways to invest - domestically or internationally - and the world is falling short on both . 
Domestic investment comes in various forms , including business investment in machinery and buildings ; household investment in homes ; and government investment in people ( education , skills ) , knowledge ( research and development ) , and infrastructure ( transport , power , water , and climate resilience ) . 
The neo-Keynesian approach is to try to boost domestic investment of any sort . 
Thus , neo-Keynesians have tried to spur more housing investment through rock-bottom interest rates , more auto purchases through securitized consumer loans , and more &quot; shovel-ready &quot; infrastructure projects through short-term stimulus programs . 
When investment spending does not budge , they recommend that we turn &quot; excess &quot; saving into another consumption binge . 
Supply-siders , by contrast , want to promote private ( certainly not public ! ) investment through more tax cuts and further deregulation . 
They have tried that on several occasions in the US , most recently during the George W. Bush administration . 
Unfortunately , the result of this deregulation was a short-lived housing bubble , not a sustained boom in productive private investment . 
Though policy alternates between supply-side and neo-Keynesian enthusiasm , the one persistent reality is a significant decline of investment as a share of national income in most high-income countries in recent years . 
According to IMF data , gross investment spending in these countries has declined from 24.9 % of GDP in 1990 to just 20 % in 2013 . 
In the US , investment spending declined from 23.6 % of GDP in 1990 to 19.3 % in 2013 , and fell even more markedly in net terms ( gross investment excluding capital depreciation ) . 
In the European Union , the decline was from 24 % of GDP in 1990 to 18.1 % in 2013 . 
Neither neo-Keynesians nor supply-siders focus on the true remedies for this persistent drop in investment spending . 
Our societies urgently need more investment , particularly to convert heavily polluting , energy-intensive , and high-carbon production into sustainable economies based on the efficient use of natural resources and a shift to low-carbon energy sources . 
Such investments require complementary steps by the public and private sectors . 
The necessary investments include large-scale deployment of solar and wind power ; broader adoption of electric transport , both public ( buses and trains ) and private ( cars ) ; energy-efficient buildings ; and power grids to carry renewable energy across large distances ( say , from the North Sea and North Africa to continental Europe , and from California &apos;s Mojave Desert to US population centers ) . 
But just when our societies should be making such investments , the public sectors in the US and Europe are on a veritable &quot; investment strike . &quot; 
Governments are cutting back public investment in the name of budget balance , and private investors cannot invest robustly and securely in alternative energy when publicly regulated power grids , liability rules , pricing formulas , and national energy policies are uncertain and heavily disputed . 
Neither the federal government nor the states have political mandates , funding strategies , or long-term plans to catalyze investment in the next generation of smart , clean technologies . 
Both neo-Keynesians and supply-siders have misunderstood the investment paralysis . 
Neo-Keynesians see investments , public and private , as merely another kind of aggregate demand . 
They neglect the public-policy decisions regarding energy systems and infrastructure ( as well as the targeted R D to promote new technologies ) that are needed to unleash smart , environmentally sustainable public and private investment spending . 
Thus , they promote gimmicks ( zero interest rates and stimulus packages ) , rather than pressing for the detailed national policies that a robust investment recovery will require . 
The supply-siders , for their part , seem utterly oblivious to the dependence of private investment on complementary public investment and a clear policy and regulatory framework . 
They advocate slashing government spending , naively believing that the private sector will somehow magically fill the void . 
But , by cutting public investment , they are hindering private investment . 
Private electricity producers , for example , will not invest in large-scale renewable energy generation if the government does not have long-term climate and energy policies or plans for spurring construction of long-distance transmission lines to carry new low-carbon energy sources to population centers . 
Such messy policy details have never much bothered free-market economists . 
There is also the option of using domestic saving to boost foreign investments . 
The US could , for example , lend money to low-income African economies to buy new power plants from US companies . 
Such a policy would put US private saving to important use in fighting global poverty , while strengthening the US industrial base . 
Yet here , too , neither the neo-Keynesians nor the supply-siders have exerted much effort to improve the institutions of development finance . 
Instead of advising Japan and China to raise their consumption rates , macroeconomists would be wiser to encourage these economies to use their high savings to fund not only domestic but also overseas investments . 
These considerations are reasonably clear to anyone concerned with the urgent need to harmonize economic growth and environmental sustainability . 
Our generation &apos;s most pressing challenge is to convert the world &apos;s dirty and carbon-based energy systems and infrastructure into clean , smart , and efficient systems for the twenty-first century . 
Investing in a sustainable economy would dramatically boost our wellbeing and use our &quot; excess &quot; savings for just the right purposes . 
Yet this will not happen automatically . 
We need long-term public-investment strategies , environmental planning , technology roadmaps , public-private partnerships for new , sustainable technologies , and greater global cooperation . 
These tools will create the new macroeconomics on which our health and prosperity now depend .
