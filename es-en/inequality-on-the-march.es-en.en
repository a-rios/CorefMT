Inequality on the March 
How much should we worry about inequality ? 
Answering that question requires that we first answer another question : &quot; Compared to what ? &quot; 
What is the alternative against which to judge the degree of inequality that we see ? 
Florida is a much more materially unequal society than Cuba . 
But the right way to look at the situation - if Florida and Cuba are our alternatives - is not to say that Florida has too much inequality , but that Cuba has much too much poverty . 
On the global level , it is difficult to argue that inequality is one of the world &apos;s major political-economic problems . 
It is hard , at least for me , to envision alternative political arrangements or economic policies over the past fifty years that would have transferred any significant portion of the wealth of today &apos;s rich nations to today &apos;s poor nations . 
I can easily envision alternatives , such as Communist victories in post-World War II elections in Italy and France that would have impoverished nations now in the rich North . 
I can also envision alternatives that would have enriched poor nations : Deng Xiaoping becoming China &apos;s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the job there . 
But alternatives that would have made the South richer at the price of reducing the wealth of the North would require a wholesale revolution in human psychology . 
Nor should we worry a great deal that some people are richer than others . 
Some people work harder , apply their intelligence more skillfully , or simply have been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time . 
But I don &apos;t see what alternative political-economic arrangements could make individuals &quot; relative wealth closely correspond to their relative moral or other merit . 
The problems that can be addressed are those of poverty and social insurance - of providing a safety net - not of inequality . 
But on the level of individual societies , I believe that inequality does loom as a serious political-economic problem . 
In the United States , the average earnings premium received by those with four-year college degrees over those with no college has gone from 30 % to 90 % over the past three decades , as the economy &apos;s skill requirements have outstripped the educational system &apos;s ability to meet them . 
Because the required skills acquired through formal education have become relatively scarcer , the education premium has risen , underpinning a more uneven distribution of income and wealth . 
Ceci Rouse and Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton University report that they find no signs that those who receive little education do so because education does not pay off for them : if anything , the returns to an extra year of schooling appear greater for those who get little education than for those who get a lot . 
A greater effort to raise the average level of education in America would have made the country richer and produced a more even distribution of income and wealth by making educated workers more abundant and less-skilled workers harder to find - and thus worth more on the market . 
Likewise , America &apos;s corporate CEO &apos;s and their near-peers earn ten times more today than they did a generation ago . 
Similar patterns are found elsewhere . 
Within each country , the increase in inequality that we have seen in the past generation is predominantly a result of failures of social investment and changes in regulations and expectations , and has not been accompanied by any acceleration in the overall rate of economic growth . 
For the most part , it looks like these changes in economy and society have not resulted in more wealth , but only in an upward redistribution of wealth - a successful right-wing class war . 
This kind of inequality should be a source of concern . 
Bill Gates , Paul Allen , Steve Ballmer , and the other millionaires and billionaires of Microsoft are brilliant , hardworking , entrepreneurial , and justly wealthy . 
But only the first 5 % of their wealth can be justified as an economic incentive to encourage entrepreneurship and enterprise . 
The next 95 % would create much more happiness and opportunity if it was divided evenly among US citizens or others than if they were to consume any portion of it . 
The most important item that parents in any society try to buy is a head start for their children . 
And the wealthier they are , the bigger the head start . 
Societies that promise equality of opportunity thus cannot afford to allow inequality of outcomes to become too great .
