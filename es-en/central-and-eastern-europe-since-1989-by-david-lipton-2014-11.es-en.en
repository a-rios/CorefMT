Eastern Europe &apos;s 25 Years of Transition 
WASHINGTON , DC - What a difference 25 years can make . 
In 1989 , Central and Eastern Europe embarked upon a historic transformation , from authoritarian communism to democratic capitalism . 
With memories of the old system already beginning to fade , it seems fitting to look back at the region &apos;s achievements , review the lessons learned , and examine the challenges ahead . 
It would be a mistake to assume that the success of the region &apos;s transformation was inevitable . 
At the close of the Cold War , Central and Eastern Europe &apos;s economies were burdened by pervasive state ownership and concentrated investments in heavy industry . 
Fiscal and monetary policies had focused on boosting industrial growth , without regard to macroeconomic balance , resulting in chronically excessive demand and widespread shortages . 
To make matters worse , most of the region - Czechoslovakia being a notable exception - was plagued by unsustainable external debt and soaring inflation . 
Meanwhile , few economists or policymakers had the background needed to tackle the complex tasks ahead . 
Such was the scale of the necessary transition that neither modern macroeconomics , nor the International Monetary Fund &apos;s nearly 50 years of experience , offered much guidance . 
The challenges to be overcome were daunting , and many thought it would be impossible . 
Instead , four key ingredients contributed to successful transitions . 
First , courageous politicians and policymakers took on the challenge of designing crucial reforms and explaining their consequences to a public that was understandably wary . 
They understood the historic nature of the task and embraced the challenge . 
Second , the reform strategies focused squarely on the essential : the liberalization of prices to reflect scarcity and facilitate the allocation of resources ; stabilization of finances to end shortages and inflation ; and privatization of state-owned companies and assets in order to improve corporate governance and performance . 
Countries that implemented these policies generally made the quickest and most complete progress . 
Third , the allure of rejoining Europe after years of isolation , together with the European Union &apos;s commitment to enlargement , provided a gravitational pull - and a legislative template - that helped policymakers justify and implement difficult reforms . 
Unpopular laws sometimes brought down governments , but the ultimate litmus test for any new policy remained : &quot; Will it lead us back to Europe ? &quot; 
Finally , external support helped the region &apos;s heavily indebted countries face the twin tasks of implementing structural reforms and coping with financial instability . 
Financing from the IMF , the World Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , and bilateral lenders , along with debt relief from official and commercial bank creditors , helped relieve the pressure . 
Technical assistance , capacity building , and support for privatization - of banks , in particular - further smoothed the way . 
Overall , the progress has been impressive . 
Several Central European countries have achieved per capita GDP levels ( measured in terms of purchasing power parity ) that place them on the lower rungs of the eurozone &apos;s income ladder . 
Standards of living in the region have improved dramatically - even if full convergence with Western Europe is far from achieved . 
Unsurprisingly , however , the picture is far from rosy everywhere . 
Some countries , especially in the Balkans and the Commonwealth of Independent States , are far from completing the transition and have gone through repeated cycles of hope and crisis . 
As elsewhere in the world , growth in the region has slowed sharply since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 . 
The pace of reform has slowed in many countries - and reversed in a few . 
Geopolitical considerations have complicated matters further , as the conflict in Ukraine demonstrates . 
Looking ahead , one can envision two broad scenarios . 
In the first , the region risks a cycle of weak growth , retreat from market-oriented policies , and increasing disillusionment . 
As a result , convergence with Western Europe could slow , with many countries lagging far behind - a far different outcome from that envisioned during the boom of the mid-2000s , when convergence within a generation seemed almost like a birthright . 
In the second , brighter scenario , rapid convergence to advanced-economy income levels continues , supported by a focus on two priorities , detailed in a new IMF report . 
A renewed commitment to macroeconomic and financial stability allows governments to rein in persistent deficits and growing debts and address their economies &quot; increasing volume of bad loans . 
Meanwhile , deeper structural reforms improve the business and investment climate , strengthen corporate governance , expand access to credit , free up labor markets , control public expenditure , and bolster tax administration - all of which puts their economies on track for sustained rapid growth . 
The IMF , for its part , has been a committed partner to Central and Eastern Europe and its transformation throughout the past 25 years .
