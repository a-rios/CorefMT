India at Play 
New Dehli - On June 1 , the Indian Premier League came to a thundering climax with a cliffhanger final match , watched by 60,000 cheering fans in a new stadium and an estimated 300 million television viewers around the world . 
As cheerleaders danced and waved brightly colored pom-poms , and star sportsmen from across the globe , clad in their teams &quot; multi-hued regalia , looked forward to a $ 2.5 million payday , black-market tickets changed hands for as much as $ 2,500 . 
Football ? 
Basketball ? 
No , the IPL is the newest Indian innovation revolutionizing that most staid of Victorian sports - cricket . 
As the globalizing world discovers a twenty-first-century India full of high-tech computer geeks , efficient businessmen , colorful fashions , and glitzy entertainment - a far cry from the old stock images of fakirs on beds of nails , maharajahs on elephants , and mendicants with begging bowls - it is also finding an India obsessed with what most regard as a nineteenth-century sport . 
Cricket has seized the Indian national imagination like no other sport . 
An international match can fill 100,000-seat stadiums , while attracting TV audiences of 350 million . 
Airline pilots provide passengers with the latest scores ; office-goers cluster around the nearest available television . 
The performances of our heroes are analyzed with far more passion than any political crisis . 
In no other country does a sport so often command the front pages of leading newspapers . 
Cricket first came to India with decorous English gentlemen . 
It took nearly a century for the &quot; natives &quot; to learn the sport , but when they did , they took to it like snakes to their charmers . 
Today , the public &apos;s obsession has made India into the sport &apos;s global financial powerhouse , with advertisers and sponsors pouring unheard-of sums into the game . 
It is estimated that India alone accounts for nearly 90 % of cricket &apos;s worldwide revenues , putting the game &apos;s traditional guardians , England and Australia , in the shade . 
India has become the most influential country in the sport &apos;s governing body , the International Cricket Council , which has moved its headquarters from London to Dubai , which has no cricketing tradition but is closer to the sport &apos;s new fulcrum in South Asia . 
In April and May , the new Indian Premier League revolutionized the sport . 
By bringing the world &apos;s top players to India at unprecedented salaries ( one Australian player was auctioned to his new team for $ 1.4 million , more than most cricketers previously earned in a lifetime ) , and by spicing up the game through such innovations as American cheerleaders , the IPL is transforming the sport . 
When the traditional English cricket season opened in April , as it has for the last couple of centuries , seasoned British journalists ruefully reported that while the players and officials were dutifully present , their minds were far away , following the fortunes of the lucrative league in India . 
I have often thought that cricket is really , in the sociologist Ashis Nandy &apos;s phrase , an Indian game accidentally discovered by the British . 
Everything about cricket seems ideally suited to the Indian national character : its rich complexity , the endless possibilities and variations that can occur with each delivery , the dozen different ways of getting out - all are reminiscent of a society of infinite forms and varieties . 
A country where a majority of the population still consults astrologers can well appreciate a sport in which an ill-timed cloudburst , a badly prepared pitch , a lost toss , or the sun in the eyes of a fielder can transform a game &apos;s outcome . 
Even the possibility that five tense , exciting , hotly-contested , and occasionally meandering days of cricketing could still end in a draw seems derived from ancient Indian philosophy , which accepts that in life the journey is as important as the destination . 
So , too , is the fact that cricket is a team game that showcases individual excellence . 
Indians have long been resigned to defeat for their national side ( though this is changing ) , but they have always managed to produce individual record-breakers - outstanding cricketers like the batsmen Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar , or the all-rounders Vinoo Mankad and Kapil Dev , who were considered to be among the world &apos;s best players , even if the Indian teams to which they belonged lost more often than they won . 
What offers better consolation than the thrilling endeavors of a gifted batsman or the magical wiles of a talented bowler , each performing his dharma , the individual doing his duty in a team game , just as in life each Indian fulfils his destiny within the fate of the collectivity ? 
In the old days , cricket was reproached as a sport played by Anglicized elites in the big cities . 
But now cricket is followed by the masses all over the country . 
New cricketing heroes have emerged from small towns , none more popular than India &apos;s swashbuckling captain , M.S. Dhoni , the son of a peon in the dusty town of Ranchi , who now commands millions in endorsement fees to tout products that his family could never have aspired to own . 
Cricket , once the sport of the British upper classes , is in India a great leveler . 
Indeed , the sport both reflects and transcends India &apos;s diversity . 
It is entirely fitting that the Indian team has been led by captains from each of its major faiths - Hindus , Muslims , Parsis , Christians , and a colorful Sikh . 
A land divided by caste , creed , color , culture , cuisine , custom , and costume is united in consensus around a great conviction : cricket .
