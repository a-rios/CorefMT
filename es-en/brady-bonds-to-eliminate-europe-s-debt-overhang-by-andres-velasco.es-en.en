Europe &apos;s Debt-Relief Calculus 
SANTIAGO - Europe has long been menaced by the threat of two crises . 
The first would erupt with a successful speculative attack on a large eurozone country &apos;s bonds , immediately jeopardizing the single currency &apos;s survival . 
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s vow to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to prevent a sovereign default in the eurozone seems to have diminished that danger - at least for now . 
The other looming danger is a growth crisis - a threat that has become increasingly serious . 
The ECB &apos;s most recent macroeconomic forecast , which cut expected GDP growth for both 2012 and 2013 , makes the threat all too clear : The eurozone will certainly contract this year , and grow by just 0.3 % , at best , next year . 
Europe persistently undershoots its growth targets because European policymakers persistently underestimate fiscal multipliers , pursuing austerity instead . 
And slower growth means lower revenues , which imply larger deficits and heavier debt burdens - at which point , as Wolfgang Munchau of the Financial Times and others have stressed , the entire belt-tightening exercise begins to look self-defeating . 
This is all pretty worrisome . 
The problem is not just that slow growth is driving up debt levels . 
It is also increasingly plausible that the debt overhang is itself becoming the cause of slow growth . 
Few people want to go down that route , because it leads directly to the question of debt forgiveness . 
But the issue can no longer be ignored - and not just in the case of Greece . 
The concept of a debt overhang has been around forever , but it became prominent during the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Like many aspects of that crisis , it is applicable to Europe &apos;s situation today . 
A debt overhang exists when a country &apos;s debt is large enough that the benefits of adjustment and growth go entirely to the creditors . 
As the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman pointed out a quarter-century ago , a country in this situation will be unwilling to undertake additional painful adjustment , because it gets nothing in return . 
And , because the proceeds of any new investment will be taxed away to service existing obligations , the debt overhang discourages private investment and growth . 
If the disincentive is large enough , then a larger debt burden may cause the country &apos;s repayment capacity to fall . 
This gives rise to a debt-relief Laffer curve . 
For low levels of debt , increasing the debt burden increases the flow of payments that creditors get ; but this relationship is reversed once the debt volume crosses a certain threshold . 
Reducing the face value of the debt is good not just for debtor countries on the &quot; wrong side &quot; of the curve ; it is also good for creditors , who stand to get more of their money back . 
But , while this neat theoretical construct clarifies the problem , figuring out where a country lies on its debt-relief Laffer curve is no easy matter . 
Many doctoral dissertations were written on this issue during the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s . 
In retrospect , two things seem clear . 
First , Latin American countries did not start growing again until debt had been substantially reduced through a series of initiatives - the most important being the Brady Plan of 1989 , under which Latin American countries enacted reforms in exchange for debt relief . 
Second , creditors who stayed in - by swapping old obligations either for new Brady bonds or for local equity - typically did very well . 
Skeptics will reply that Europe is not Latin America , and that the interest rates levied on European governments today are much lower than what Argentina or Mexico had to pay back then . 
Perhaps . 
France &apos;s public debt is 90 % of GDP and rising , and five European countries &quot; debt / GDP ratios are above 100 % . 
Latin American countries had to seek debt reduction when their debt burdens were smaller . 
And the recent spike in the interest-rate spread on Italian government bonds should remind optimists that , with sovereign debt so high , many things can go wrong at any time . 
More and more Europeans are coming around to the view that Greece needs to have its debt cut yet again , and that this time official claims on Greece should be cut as well . 
But few Europeans today believe that Italy , Spain or Portugal , much less France , will need debt reduction . 
Give them time . 
It was not so long ago that few Europeans could imagine a euro crisis .
