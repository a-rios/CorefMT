Decision Time for the Global Economy 
MILAN - In the dog days of summer , Milan is quieter than many European cities . 
The locals are away , and , unlike Paris or Rome , tourists do not take their place . 
Here and elsewhere , people , businesses , governments , and markets take a break , decompress , and reflect . 
Europe &apos;s economic problems will still be here , waiting for us , in September . 
And when summer ends , uncertainty about key issues will be the order of the day - and not only in Europe . 
Largely unanticipated protest movements in Turkey and Brazil have raised questions about the economic and social sustainability of emerging-market growth . 
The fires in Bangladeshi garment factories have raised new questions about the governance of global supply chains . 
In the United States , the Federal Reserve hinted at &quot; tapering &quot; its quantitative-easing policy later in the year , and a kind of global carry trade based on monetary conditions in advanced countries started to unwind as a result , causing credit tightening and market turbulence in emerging economies . 
This is probably only a preview of the complexity of the exit from the post-crisis assisted-growth model that has prevailed in the US , Europe , and now Japan . 
A possible political impasse in the US in September over the budget and debt ceiling complicates the outlook further . 
And yet much of the current uncertainty is set to dissipate . 
In the coming months , highly consequential policy decisions ( or their absence ) in systemically critical parts of the global economy will be revealed , with significant effects on growth rates , asset prices , and overall confidence . 
For starters , China &apos;s new leadership has moved away from outsize fiscal and monetary stimulus and accepted an economic slowdown , betting on structural change , systemic reform , and sustainable longer-term growth . 
The key signals will come from the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s plenary meeting in the early fall . 
China &apos;s reforms will either support the economic shift , boosting sentiment and lifting growth forecasts , or they will fall short and disappoint , with attention most likely to be focused on the size and nature of state intervention in markets . 
Either way , with the future of the global economy &apos;s principal growth engine at stake , the effects will be felt worldwide . 
In the US , economic deleveraging has proceeded significantly further than it has in Europe . 
The US is adjusting structurally and generating real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP growth ( though well below its potential annual rate of 3-3.5 % ) . 
The tradable sector is expanding and is not dependent on leverage to generate aggregate demand . 
One can think of the US economy as an 8-cylinder engine running on five , owing to residual deleveraging , fiscal consolidation and drag , public-sector investment shortfalls , and questions about the financial health and security of middle-income households ( the backbone of domestic aggregate demand ) . 
Part-time employment is spreading and may become the labor market &apos;s new normal . 
Then there is the question of the Fed &apos;s assisted-growth model . 
Is the US economy ready to grow without abnormal policy support ? 
It seems clear that tapering the Fed &apos;s monthly purchases of long-term securities later this year would cause a realignment of asset values in financial markets . 
How this spills over into the real economy is yet another source of uncertainty . 
But , despite some transitional market turbulence , the overall effect will likely be positive . 
The beneficial effect on the risk-return options available to investors / savers ( including pension funds ) will outweigh the higher cost of debt ; indeed , an important subset of growth engines in the tradable sector is not dependent on low-cost debt . 
The same cannot be said of Europe , where Germany &apos;s general election in September is viewed as a key barometer of continuing commitment to the euro . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program - though conditional , limited to short-term government debt , and so far unused - appears to have stabilized eurozone sovereign-debt markets , albeit in a low- or zero-growth environment . 
But the OMT program is dependent on German support . 
The question is how long this can last , given southern Europe &apos;s growth and employment challenges ( and an apparent lack of understanding among policymakers and the public that there are no short-term solutions ) . 
In Italy , the debate centers on taxes in general , and the rather miniscule property tax in particular . 
The income tax ( and thus the tax on employment ) is high . 
But the country is relatively wealthy , especially in terms of property assets on household balance sheets . 
So higher taxes on property and lower taxes on income would contribute to the creation of a more dynamic , competitive economy . 
But that is far from the current focus of public debate . 
The key liberalizing reforms that would enhance the economy &apos;s flexibility and pace of adjustment are simply not on the agenda ( owing to an underlying lack of trust among voters ) . 
This is important because the private sector in Italy ( and in Spain ) cannot match the structural flexibility found in the US ( and in Germany since its reforms in 2003-2006 ) . 
Think now of an 8-cylinder engine running not on five cylinders , but on two or three at best . 
( Admittedly , the Spanish labor market reforms enacted earlier this year may start to lift employment and improve competitiveness and growth on the economy &apos;s tradable side , which is constrained largely by low productivity , not weak demand . ) 
But the default option in the context of political gridlock - a halting , slow-growth strategy , focused excessively on fiscal austerity and featuring high unemployment ( especially for the young ) - is unlikely to remain workable for long . 
At some point , the political agenda will either shift toward real reform , or sentiment will shift substantially against the euro . 
Fortunately , this uncomfortable uncertainty will not last much longer - in Europe or elsewhere . 
China &apos;s leaders will make their choices , as will German voters . 
The Fed will clarify the direction of US monetary policy . 
Distortions will begin to unwind . 
Without dismissing the downside risks , I remain cautiously optimistic about the global economy &apos;s prospects . 
With greater clarity in terms of Chinese and US policy , both economies should gain momentum . 
That will give developing countries ( many of which face difficult domestic policy choices ) a tailwind , while making the substantial challenges in Europe and Japan easier to address .
