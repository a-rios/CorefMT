France Revived 
Nicolas Sarkozy won the French presidential election in May in part because he attracted a substantial portion of the far right &apos;s supporters to his conservative banner . 
Indeed , the Front National &apos;s popular support has fallen from around 15 % to 10 % , weakening the FN tremendously and strengthening the traditional French right . 
Sarkozy succeeded by embracing themes of national identity and immigration . 
As a result , many regarded his campaign as very right-leaning . 
In France and across Europe , people expected an extremely conservative government , akin to US President George W. Bush &apos;s administration . 
This was a mistake . 
Sarkozy &apos;s embrace of the theme that France &apos;s national identity has come under threat , which he linked to immigration , is not enough to make him an American style neo-conservative . 
He has chosen to demonstrate this most clearly in the field of foreign policy . 
So he gave the reins of the key foreign policy arms of the French government to left-wing politicians . 
Bernard Kouchner , a Socialist , is Minister for Foreign Affairs , having formerly been a Socialist Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Minister of Health . 
Another leftist , Jean-Pierre Jouyet , is in charge of European affairs . 
Jean-Marie Bockel , the Socialist mayor of Mulhouse , is Minister for Cooperation and Relations with the Francophone world . 
And Socialists have also been brought into other parts of Sarkozy &apos;s government . 
Fadela Amara , the manager of an NGO that defends women &apos;s right , is a secretary of state for city management . 
Sarkozy &apos;s second important initiative was to re-energize the European project . 
After the failure in 2005 of the draft European constitution , it was far from obvious that negotiations that would yield only partial progress in improving the European Union &apos;s decision-making mechanisms was the right way to proceed . 
After all , there was no immediate emergency , and everybody would have understood if Sarkozy had waited another two or three years before risking his reputation on reviving the idea of a European constitution . 
And he succeeded in convincing other European leaders to embrace the &quot; simplified treaty &quot; that he called for . 
Of course , the treaty &apos;s final text is not yet written , but success does seem possible , which would not only improve the mechanics of the EU , but would also send a signal to Euroskeptics , mainly the British and the Poles . 
France has not given up its demand for a &quot; political &quot; Europe that is more than merely a single market . 
Sarkozy &apos;s third initiative came when the head of the International Monetary Fund resigned . 
Typically , that job is given to a European . 
Sarkozy surprised everyone by offering the position to a French Socialist , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , a man with real competence who enjoys widespread respect . 
Strauss-Kahn &apos;s nomination was also an effective strike in terms of French domestic politics , as it promised to weaken the Socialists &quot; opposition . 
But , more importantly , Sarkozy &apos;s choice of Strauss-Kahn is a crucial stand in today &apos;s global economic debates . 
Sarkozy is announcing that he is an economic &quot; regulator , &quot; not a global liberal convinced that today &apos;s balance of market forces is optimal , and thus that no intervention is needed . 
The fourth initiative also concerned foreign affairs : the freeing of the six Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in Libya on false charges of infecting children deliberately with HIV / AIDS . 
Intense negotiations with Libya , particularly by Europe , had been going on for more than a year , but were not successful , because Libya &apos;s ruler , Colonel Khadafi , did not trust his interlocutors . 
Sarkozy understood that . 
Choosing his wife as a negotiator helped to unblock the case . 
Moreover , Sarkozy is seeking to intensify cooperation for development in the whole Mediterranean area . 
He began with a presidential trip to Algiers , then to Tripoli , followed by ministerial trips to Beirut . 
Assuring development of this region will be a long and difficult challenge , but one that needed to be embraced . 
The government &apos;s preparation to take the lead in international talks on climate change is another sign that Sarkozy intends to revive France as a global force . 
After the relative lifelessness of President Jacques Chirac &apos;s final years office , dynamism has returned to French foreign policy . 
That is a welcome development , and not only for France , because Sarkozy &apos;s activism also promises to boost Europe &apos;s political influence around the world .
