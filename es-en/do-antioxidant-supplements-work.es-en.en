Do Antioxidant Supplements Work ? 
NIS , Serbia - The influence of diet on health has been known since the Ancient Greeks . 
Our bodies simply cannot synthesize many essential compounds , so our health partly depends on what we eat and drink . 
Antioxidants , which are believed to help protect us against both cancer and heart disease , are one such element that must import into our bodies . 
Studies have shown that there is a significant positive association between a higher intake of fruits and vegetables and reduced risk of chronic disease . 
Fruits and vegetables are sources of numerous micronutrients , and some , including b-carotene ( a precursor of vitamin A ) , vitamin C , vitamin E , and selenium , have potential as antioxidants . 
But what specifically makes fruits and vegetables so beneficial is not clear . 
The main role of antioxidants is to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components , so it has been proposed that dietary antioxidants decrease such damage and with it the risk of disease . 
This has stimulated interest in the possible preventive potential of antioxidant supplements . 
Indeed , consumption of antioxidant supplements in developed countries has become widespread . 
More than one-third of adults in developed countries now ingest antioxidant pills , which is much easier than eating fruits and vegetables . 
But will the benefits be the same ? 
As with any therapeutic intervention , the most convincing and direct proof of the preventive efficacy of antioxidant supplements requires randomized , controlled clinical trials . 
Such trials eliminate the problems of participants &quot; dietary record and controls the effects of both known and unknown confounding factors . 
So far , many studies have been conducted to verify the supposed beneficial effects of antioxidant supplements . 
But , while the results of epidemiological studies have been almost uniformly positive , the results of clinical trials have remained largely inconclusive . 
Some clinical trials were terminated prematurely because harmful effects of antioxidant supplements were observed . 
Indeed , the overwhelming evidence currently calls into question the preventive effect of antioxidant pills . 
On the contrary , they may be harmful , leading to an increased risk of mortality in people consuming them . 
There are several possible explanations for the negative effect of antioxidant supplements . 
First , the &quot; free radicals &quot; that anti-oxidants act against perform a dual biological function . 
Free radicals are produced continuously in all cells as part of their normal functioning . 
In moderate concentrations , they are essential mediators of reactions by which our bodies eliminate unwanted cells . 
By eliminating free radicals from our body , we interfere with important defensive mechanisms for eliminating damaged cells , including cancerous cells . 
So antioxidant substances can also harm people . 
Whereas our diets typically contain safe levels , highly concentrated antioxidant supplements can be hazardous . 
In fact , the amounts of antioxidants that lend protection are not known and probably differ among individuals . 
People exposed to increased oxidative stress may have elevated antioxidant requirements . 
Moreover , antioxidant supplements in pills are synthetic and biochemically unbalanced compared to their naturally occurring counterparts . 
Nor are they subjected to the same rigorous toxicity studies as other pharmaceutical agents . 
Indeed , we still lack substantial information on how our bodies metabolize them and how they interact with one another . 
As a result , it is still unclear whether dosage , duration of use , or parallel intake of other agents determine differences in their effect . 
It also is unclear whether oxidative stress is a primary cause or a secondary phenomenon of chronic diseases , as well as of the aging process . 
In most human disease , oxidative stress is merely a symptom . 
So the link between oxidative stress and disease should not be overemphasized . 
There are still many gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of antioxidant supplements . 
Basic issues concerning the efficacy and safety of consuming relatively high doses of antioxidant supplements need to be resolved . 
Results of ongoing clinical trials and further studies are required to improve our knowledge . 
In the meantime , we know that antioxidants can cause unwanted health consequences . 
So the optimal source for antioxidants is diet , not supplements . 
In short , we should stop taking pills and eat more fruits and vegetables .
