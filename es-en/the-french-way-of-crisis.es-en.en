The French Way of Crisis 
PARIS - France is in disarray . 
According to opinion polls , Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s popularity is at the lowest point seen in decades for a French president . 
Last week , two ministers resigned , but a parliamentary and media-sustained storm continues , fueled by conflict-of-interest charges against a minister suspected of corruption when raising money for Sarkozy &apos;s presidential campaign . 
Some ministers don &apos;t care much about public perceptions when using public funds , and it is clear that the political atmosphere has become poisonous . 
But the constitution established by General Charles de Gaulle is strong , and Sarkozy will keep his position until the end of his mandate in 2012 . 
The main opposition Socialist Party &apos;s weak electoral prospects are also helping Sarkozy . 
The size of France &apos;s political crisis seems to be out of proportion with the country &apos;s real situation . 
To be sure , France has been severely hit by the global financial crisis and economic downturn . 
Two of the three Baltic countries and Greece are in deep financial distress . 
Ireland , Belgium , Italy , and the United Kingdom are still under threat , owing to large public debts or current-account deficits . 
In the short term , the situation in Germany is less severe than in France . 
Its trade balance is positive , and total public debt is not as high as it is in other countries . 
Despite high unemployment and low growth , Germany does not face a short-term threat to macroeconomic stability , though the country &apos;s population is declining and aging , implying huge challenges in the decades ahead . 
The short-term situation for France is more worrying . 
The fiscal deficit is higher than 6 % of GDP , the trade balance is negative , and public debt - albeit lower than in all other European countries except Germany and the Netherlands - is nonetheless 80 % of GDP . 
France urgently needs structural reforms - and thus a strong government . 
Of course , unethical behavior by officials - the root of the current crisis - is unacceptable . 
Two factors are intensifying the pressure on Sarkozy . 
First , the public is increasingly aware that urgent and straightforward policies are desperately needed in the areas of pension and healthcare payments , and in state organization . 
Second , in recent decades the French have been 10 % -20 % more pessimistic than the rest of the world when asked about their happiness and their attitudes toward the future for themselves or for France . 
Not only is the market economy less popular in France than in all other European countries or the US , but it is less popular than in Russia or in China ! 
Is the future more promising ? 
All emerging countries answer &quot; yes . &quot; That is also the answer of a large majority in the US and in Europe . 
But in France , the majority says &quot; no . &quot; 
This deep pessimism militates against any public debate or reform , and exaggerates the importance of the current political crisis . 
Since the first polling companies were created in the US , the UK , and France in the 1930 &apos;s , they have asked questions about happiness and attitudes about the future . 
At first , the French gave the same answer as other people . 
This very centralized and proud country , where the state matters more than elsewhere and the military had won so many wars , witnessed the complete collapse of both in the span of just two weeks . 
A non-elected government that capitulated to Hitler offered a parochial , vassal-like future . 
The French never really recovered from that trauma . 
Despite a beautiful rebirth after the war , the moral defeat of the elite and the hesitancy of the political system remain . 
Dire pessimism has become permanent , making consensus nearly impossible to reach - an impasse made worse by the under-development of civil society in France . 
So expect big shocks . 
Balancing cuts in public spending in order not to endanger growth and employment requires a stable and smart government - and time . 
The UK and Germany are , with their excessive restrictions , are preparing the ground for recessions at home . 
Will France address the issue with greater subtlety and avoid this risk ? 
The grumpy , moaning , and intractable people of France have demonstrated many times that they can wake up and meet the challenges of the day . 
The Enlightenment , after all , was born in France . 
There is the French Revolution , the Napoleonic epic , the Battle of the Marne - won in 1914 thanks to spontaneous initiative when the government and the state failed - and the great revival of 1945-1950 . 
France also has a higher birth rate than all other European countries , and is the only one that renews each generation . 
Thirty years ago , there was not a single French enterprise among the world &apos;s top 100 enterprises , whereas today there are 15 . 
France &apos;s education and health-care systems , despite difficulties , are still among the best in the world . 
Its intelligentsia and its scientists remain very creative , and are among the best in many fields . 
So don &apos;t bury France just yet . 
The French will undergo major shocks in the years to come , but France might be the only European country standing tall 30 years from now .
