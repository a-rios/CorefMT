Chinese Finance Comes of Age 
LONDON - The Chinese financial system &apos;s evolution in recent years has been extraordinary . 
I have observed its transformation as a member of the International Advisory Council of the China Banking Regulatory Commission ( CBRC ) . 
Back in 2002 , all of China &apos;s major banks were awash in non-performing loans ( NPLs ) , which in some cases amounted to more than 10 % of the total balance sheet . 
None of the major banks met even the Basel 1 standards for capital adequacy . 
Few financiers in London or New York could have named any bank other than Bank of China , which was often wrongly thought to be the central bank . 
And to suggest that the United States Federal Reserve , or the United Kingdom &apos;s Financial Services Authority , might have anything to learn from China &apos;s financial authorities would have been thought absurd . 
Less than a decade later , much has changed . 
The old NPL problem was resolved , primarily by establishing asset-management companies to take over doubtful assets , and injecting new capital into the commercial banks . 
Now , reported NPLs amount to little more than 1 % of assets . 
Foreign partners have been brought in to transfer skills , and minority shareholdings have been floated . 
Current valuations put four Chinese banks in the global top ten by market capitalization . 
They are now expanding overseas , fortified by their strong capital backing . 
Of course , challenges remain . 
Even in China there is no magic potion that can revive a loan to a defunct exporter . 
And China &apos;s big banks have lent large sums , willingly or otherwise , to local governments for infrastructure projects - many of them of dubious economic value . 
There is an ever-present risk that the property market might one day collapse , though banks would emerge in better shape than have banks in the US and the UK , because much speculative investment has been funded with cash , or with only modest leverage . 
The authorities in Beijing , especially the CBRC and the People &apos;s Bank of China ( the real central bank ) , have a good record of managing incipient booms and busts , and I would not bet against their success this time . 
They have considerable flexibility , owing to a range of policy tools , including variable capital and reserve requirements and direct controls on mortgage lending terms . 
They have already been tightening the screws on credit growth for several months , with positive effects . 
It would be flattering to think that this turnaround in China &apos;s financial system been attributable to the wise counsels of foreign advisers . 
But , while external influences have been helpful in some ways - the stimulus of Basel 1 and 2 strengthened the hands of those in Beijing determined to clean up the banking system - the Chinese now , not unreasonably , treat advice from the City of London and Wall Street with some skepticism . 
For example , recent criticism of Asian regulators by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is viewed across the region with scorn , not to mention incredulity . 
A little more humility is in order , given US regulators &quot; performance in the run-up to the crisis . 
People who live in glass houses should not throw even rhetorical stones . 
The most interesting development is that we can now see increasing convergence in the regulatory philosophies and toolkits in Beijing , London , and New York . 
Until the recent near-implosion of Western capitalism , the North Atlantic authorities thought that the end of financial history had been reached . 
Financial conditions could be controlled with one tool - the short-term interest rate - deployed exclusively in pursuit of a target , implicit or explicit , for consumer price inflation . 
Banks &quot; capital-adequacy ratios were set globally , and , once set , remained fixed . 
Otherwise , the market knew best . 
Banks had their own incentives to lend wisely , and controls on lending would necessarily prove ineffective . 
By contrast , in China , all aspects of a bank &apos;s business were directly overseen . 
Indeed , most banks were under the sway of the central bank . 
Now , in Beijing , officials see the advantages of a more hands-off approach , and of institutions with a primarily commercial focus . 
But they have not eschewed the use of variable capital and reserve requirements , loan-to-deposit ratios , and thresholds for minimum deposits and maximum leverage as controls on property lending . 
Meanwhile , in developed capital markets , we are busily reinventing these &quot; macroprudential instruments , &quot; to use the term now in vogue in Basel . 
We can now see the utility of a more flexible toolkit to respond to excessive credit expansion , or asset-price bubbles , where the manipulation of short-term interest rates can be a blunt instrument or , worse , a double-edged sword . 
An interest-rate rise might take the heat out of the mortgage market , but it will also chill the rest of the economy . 
Regulatory philosophies are converging , too . 
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher &apos;s famous injunction that &quot; you cannot buck the market &quot; was part of the regulatory mindset in the pre-crisis Anglosphere . 
And former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan resisted any attempts to rein in the animal spirits of the wealth creators on Wall Street . 
The Chinese were less ideological . 
They had no compunction about calling a bubble a bubble , or in intervening to deflate it . 
Now , only Sarah Palin reveres Thatcher &apos;s views on all issues , and Greenspan has been airbrushed out of financial history , Chinese-style . 
When the G-7 morphed into the G-20 in early 2009 , many were understandably worried that , with such a diverse range of participants , coming from such different traditions , it would be difficult to achieve consensus on regulatory matters in the Basel Committee and elsewhere . 
These concerns turned out to have been overstated . 
The elements of a broader consensus on the future role of financial regulation are in place , as long as Americans like Geithner can resist their constant desire to tell the rest of the world to do as they say , not as they do .
