Barbarians at the Gate ? 
Europe &apos;s lumpen outsiders are becoming insiders as the Continent &apos;s political pendulum swings to the right . 
After the Netherlands and France , Germany may be next ( German elections are due in the autumn , and the center-right candidate - Minister / President Stoiber of Bavaria - is now the favorite ) . 
Spain , Austria , Italy , Denmark , Portugal are already ruled by center-right governments . 
This swing does not simply mark the return of traditional conservative parties and policies - smaller governments , more attention to the interests of capital - to power . 
Something new is at work . 
What &apos;s new is the fact that many of today &apos;s center-right governments are supported by populist or nationalist parties . 
In Italy , the Netherlands , Austria , and Denmark , the government is either a coalition or a minority government propped up by the pivotal support of populist right-wing parties . 
In France the government is composed of mainstream center-right politicians . 
Yet , President Chirac owes his victory to the success of the far right National Front . 
This is a decisive novelty . 
In the past , Europe &apos;s political contests were waged between left wing parties representing the interests of labor , and right wing parties representing the interests of capital . 
Centrist parties that represented the middle classes and moderated the ideological extremes of left and right were pivotal . 
Nowadays , ideological differences between left and right are blurred . 
So a new breed of politicians and a new constituency of voters hold the balance of power . 
The successes of populist / right wing parties can largely be attributed to the failures of left-leaning governments . 
Europe &apos;s disappointing economic performance lies at the root of this . 
European unemployment remains high , and productivity growth ( and hence living standards ) has slowed since the mid-1990s . 
Even non-economically-minded voters perceive the striking difference with the US , where productivity growth has skyrocketed since the mid-1990s and unemployment is far lower . 
Some voters are beginning to think that their cherished European welfare state may be to blame . 
Many European voters also feel threatened and unprotected . 
A common slogan is that Europe &apos;s social model trades less economic growth for more social protection and less risk . 
But this idea does not convince everyone . 
Large groups of &quot; outsiders &quot; ( young unemployed and first time job seekers , temporary workers , shopkeepers and other self-employed ) do not see these supposed benefits because they lack a stable and protected job , or do not qualify for unemployment insurance , or are too young to benefit from public pension systems . 
These voters also complain about crime , and of the deteriorating quality of life in their cities . 
Many &quot; outsiders &quot; supported right-wing populist parties in the latest elections ; their votes are critical for the survival of the new center-right governments in many European countries . 
These &quot; outsiders &quot; were often neglected in Europe &apos;s traditional political competition , and their demands received little or no attention . 
Across Europe , they have suddenly become political arbiters . 
What these newly influential voters want is clear : less immigration , crackdowns on crime , more economic opportunities , but also more protection against economic risk and international competition . 
Politicians representing these voters lack experience in government , sometimes are technically unprepared for governance , and are suspicious of technocrats and bureaucrats , particularly those in Brussels . 
On many issues , the positions of populist parties conflict with the traditional pro-capital and pro-market platforms of established center-right parties . 
Not all of this is black . 
Some of the demands of these voters are sensible and will improve policymaking . 
Most of Europe , for example , needs better crime prevention and a serious effort at cracking down on illegal immigration . 
But in other important policy choices , populist parties could lead Europe astray . 
Of course , most European countries need to rethink the foundations of their welfare state . 
Working life needs to be lengthened , public pensions are often too generous , labor markets too rigid . 
Traditional pro-capitalist right-wing parties would welcome such reforms . 
Yet , welfare state reform is not a priority of right-wing populists . 
But the biggest risks are to European integration . 
The new populist and nationalist parties are suspicious of Europe in general , and of EU enlargement in particular . 
This hostility comes at the wrong moment in time , with Europe engaged in ambitious and difficult constitutional reforms . 
European enlargement , moreover , although imminent , is not a done deal . 
Negotiations for enlargement are still under way . 
The Convention on the Future of Europe is discussing ways to integrate new policy areas , such as internal security , immigration , elements of a common foreign policy and of external security . 
But the Convention &apos;s outcome is unpredictable . 
The opposition posed by this newly empowered political constituency could be decisive . 
Traditional center-right parties have been pro-Europe . 
European integration has rarely been affected by the left / right divide . 
That holiday from serious politics may be over for good .
