Latin America &apos;s Unfinished Quest 
SANTIAGO - The participants came , European guests were greeted , speeches were delivered , toasts made , and , in the end , the annual meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) was hailed as a success . 
But what remained the morning after was the clear sense of a region that is deeply divided , missing a common purpose , and , above all , lacking leadership . 
First , the good news : the four main countries on the Pacific Rim - Mexico , Colombia , Peru and Chile - took important steps to deepen their trade-and-integration agreement . 
By the end of this year , 90 % of all trade within the bloc will be tariff-free . 
Costa Rica asked to join , and Japan was accepted as an observer . 
This Pacific Alliance , with nearly 40 % of Latin American GDP and $ 500 billion in annual exports , has the potential to become a driving force for economic growth in the region . 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez &apos;s health kept him from attending , but the heads of state who follow his lead were out in force , and collectively blocked a European request to include in the final statement a guarantee that investment rules will not be changed arbitrarily . 
Bolivian President Evo Morales used the forum to criticize Chile and reiterate his country &apos;s territorial claims . 
When , at the end , Cuban President Raúl Castro took over the rotating presidency of CELAC , an institution presumably devoted to extending democracy &apos;s range , not even the most seasoned diplomats could suppress an ironic grin . 
CELAC , which pointedly excludes the United States and Canada , was launched in 2010 so that countries in Latin America and the Caribbean could shape their own path toward democratic politics and shared prosperity . 
They have not . 
To be sure , most countries in the region remain nominally democratic . 
True , most economies in the region have grown since the crisis , profiting from an international environment characterized by sky-high commodity prices and rock-bottom interest rates . 
But , given limited competitiveness and little business capacity to innovate , no one knows what will happen to growth in Latin America if and when commodity prices return to Earth . 
Likewise , some measures of inequality have declined recently in a handful of countries . 
But the region remains the most unequal on the planet , and poorly functioning schools and labor markets suggest that it will retain that dubious honor for the foreseeable future . 
Ask Latin American and Caribbean leaders how they plan to cope with these challenges , and you get a cacophony of answers - not all of them coherent . 
The roots of the problem are in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
Back then , governments in several Latin American countries launched radical attempts to deregulate their economies and open them to international trade and capital flows . 
Some liberalizing reform was long overdue in those countries . 
But privatizing without strengthening pro-competition policies often led to the creation of private monopolies that charged high prices for mediocre goods and services . 
Similarly , permitting massive capital inflows before properly regulating the domestic banking system caused lending booms and massive financial crises . 
The social and economic costs of those strategic missteps were huge . 
A backlash was inevitable . 
Indeed , populism , so familiar from the region &apos;s history , made a roaring comeback in Argentina , Bolivia , Ecuador , Venezuela , and elsewhere . 
The rhetoric has been 1960 &quot; s-style and crudely anti-capitalist , and the policies have been erratic and often arbitrary . 
And , despite the windfall provided by the global commodity boom of the past decade , the results leave a great deal to be desired . 
In Venezuela , per capita income today is lower than it was three decades ago . 
In Argentina , the government addressed persistent inflation of 20 % or more by cooking the price data . 
Of course , the countries that have performed better are those that have steered clear of both right-wing zealotry and left-wing populism . 
Brazil under President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva comes to mind , along with Chile under the Concertación governments . 
In those cases , market incentives for investment and growth were combined with ambitious social policies . 
Incomes expanded and poverty fell , while a broad range of human-development indicators improved . 
Brazil and Chile do not have all the answers : both countries remain highly unequal and their educational systems are mediocre , to mention just two entrenched problems . 
So , why haven &apos;t Brazil and Chile become modern , center-left development models for the region ? 
In Chile , the Concertación was an ineffectual advocate for its own achievements , because many older , more traditional Concertación leaders never quite approved of the moderate policies that the coalition was putting into place . 
Brazil , a much larger country , was the natural candidate for political and ideological leadership in the region . 
Imagine a future meeting of CELAC in which that body &apos;s presidency is handed over to a modern , progressive leader who can put forward a compelling agenda of personal freedom , economic growth , and social inclusion . 
Imagine a meeting at which claims to defend democracy were something more than a cruel joke . 
Is that too much to ask ? 
An entire generation of Latin Americans hopes that it is not .
