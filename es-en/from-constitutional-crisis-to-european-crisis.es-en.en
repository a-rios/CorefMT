From Constitutional Crisis to European Crisis 
Since the shock of the French and Dutch &quot; no &quot; votes against the European Union &apos;s proposed Constitutional Treaty , events have followed their inevitable course , but more rapidly than expected . 
The French &quot; no &quot; was a massive blow to the political credibility of French President Jacques Chirac . 
So he did what French Presidents usually do in such circumstances : rather than admit that French voters might be right , he sacked Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin as a scapegoat , replacing him with his protégé Dominique de Villepin , who has never held an elective office . 
Opinions differ as to the reasons for France &apos;s rejection of the Constitutional Treaty . 
Naturally , Chirac immediately reaffirmed his faith in the French economic model . 
The most undeniable implication of the French vote has been to raise a large question mark over the future of the EU &apos;s traditional integration project . 
Rather than admit any such thing , Chirac hurried to meet German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , so that they could jointly reaffirm their traditional alliance as the spiritual leaders of this European project , in the hope that the Constitutional Treaty might yet be rescued . 
Neither of them have been able to say how this should be done . 
The British government tried to wriggle out of taking sides on the implications of the French and Dutch votes by saying that it would suspend its own plans for a referendum , but not cancel it outright . 
But if the government thought that this mid-way position would finesse its European predicament by appeasing the large anti-European majority in the UK without gratuitously offending the EU &apos;s other members , it was quickly disabused . 
One consequence of last year &apos;s enlargement is that it is forcing a far-reaching re-negotiation of all aspects of the EU budget . 
Most of the ten new members are much poorer than the old members , and are thus much less able or willing to pay large financial contributions . 
They expect to be net financial beneficiaries , which would help them modernize . 
But the old member states that have hitherto benefited most from the budget - poorer countries like Spain , Greece , and Portugal - want the budget to be expanded , so that they can continue to receive money . 
Old member states that have traditionally contributed most , like Germany and the Netherlands , want to keep the budget as small as possible . 
Given this looming negotiation between old and new - and between rich and poor - and because Chirac has no cunning proposal for resurrecting the EU Constitution , he has sought and found a second scapegoat : Britain has , for over 20 years , benefited from a large rebate in its outsized contribution to the EU budget . 
By design the EU Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) gives large financial benefits to countries with large farming sectors , like France , but imposes financial penalties on countries with small farming sectors , like Britain . 
This inequity long rankled in Britain . 
In 1984 , Margaret Thatcher demanded and got a large rebate in the British net contribution , which this year is worth roughly € 5bn . 
Ever since , this concession has been resented by other member states . 
Last week , Chirac decided to raise the stakes in the European crisis by going on the offensive against Britain . 
The time has come , he said , for &quot; our English friends &quot; to understand that they have to make a gesture of solidarity , and renounce the rebate negotiated by Thatcher . 
The British government &apos;s first reflex was to reject any suggestion that the British rebate is open to discussion : it was justified in 1984 , and it is justified today . 
Britain , he says , might be prepared to put the British rebate on the table , but only if the French are prepared to remove the reasons for it by means of a radical renegotiation of EU farm policy . 
From a narrowly British perspective , this might seem a shrewd and reasonable posture for defending British interests . 
But , by picking up Chirac &apos;s challenge , Blair has allowed himself to be drawn away from the general European dilemma ( what to do about the Constitutional Treaty ) - for which Britain is not to blame - to a specific policy problem ( the CAP &apos;s finances ) on which Britain is isolated . 
Coming from anyone else , Blair &apos;s proposal to re-think the CAP might seem reasonable ; indeed , over the years , the EU has tried ( slowly ) to reform its defects . 
Unfortunately , in eight years of power , Tony Blair reinforced the widespread impression in the rest of the EU , that the UK is irremediably skeptical about European integration . 
His proposal will thus be seen for what it is , a counter-attack on a founding policy of the European project . 
The danger is that this week &apos;s EU summit will not be devoted to finding a solution to the dilemma of the French and Dutch &quot; no &quot; votes , but instead will be turned into a confrontation between Britain and the rest about the budget . 
This would be a pity for Europe and for Britain . 
It would underscore the depth of the chasm between leaders who are seeking to advance the cause of European political integration but are out of touch with their electorates , and the British , who do not like European political integration at all .
