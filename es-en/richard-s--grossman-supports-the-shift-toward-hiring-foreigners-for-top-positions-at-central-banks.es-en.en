The Monetary Cosmopolitans 
NEWTON , MASSACHUSETTS - Can you imagine a French citizen being elected President of the United States ? 
Or a Japanese prime minister of the United Kingdom ? 
Or a Mexican chancellor of Germany ? 
Probably not . 
Indeed , even if there were no legal obstacles , it would be difficult to imagine voters in a democracy installing a foreigner in their government &apos;s top job . 
But , during the last few years , countries have increasingly turned to foreigners and people with considerable foreign experience to assume what is generally viewed as a country &apos;s second most important position : head of the central bank . 
What has driven this shift , and should it be welcomed or discouraged ? 
For example , Stanley Fischer , nominated in January by US President Barack Obama to succeed Janet Yellen as Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve , is an American immigrant from southern Africa who served as Governor of the Bank of Israel from 2005 until last year . 
And , in July 2013 , Mark Carney , a Canadian who had served as central-bank governor in his home country , became the first foreigner to lead the Bank of England in its nearly 320-year history . 
Similarly , the widely respected governor of Ireland &apos;s central bank , Patrick Honohan , spent nearly a decade at the World Bank in Washington , DC . 
One of Honohan &apos;s deputies is a Swede with experience at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ; the other is a Frenchman . 
This represents a major departure from the tradition of filling central banks &quot; top leadership positions with people who have spent most of their careers there - a tradition that , over time , allowed central banks to be taken over by &quot; groupthink . &quot; 
With the entrenchment of a particular ideology or mode of thinking , monetary policymakers increasingly missed - by choice or inertia - opportunities to change , reinvigorate , and improve the running of these vital institutions . 
As central banks &quot; key role in the recovery from the post-2008 global economic crisis demonstrated , monetary policy must be flexible and innovative . 
That is where the different perspectives that foreigners bring can help . 
When the Fed was established a century ago , monetary authority was distributed across 12 regional reserve banks , each of which had considerable autonomy . 
The fact that the heads of each of the regional Fed banks were called &quot; governor &quot; - the same title given to heads of the long-established European central banks - was indicative of their authority . 
But , in the aftermath of the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s , it became clear that such decentralization had prevented the Fed from formulating and implementing a coherent monetary policy . 
The heads of the regional banks were &quot; downgraded &quot; from governors to &quot; presidents &quot; - the first and only time in US history when the transition from governor to president was a demotion - and power was centralized in the Board of Governors based in Washington , DC . 
Nonetheless , an important legacy of the earlier system has remained : each of the regional banks maintains its own research department , and brings a different approach to the monetary-policy debate . 
In other words , the Fed &apos;s structure continues to foster a robust and diverse mix of views - something that is severely lacking in many other central banks . 
Consider the Bank of Canada . 
Years ago , an employee at one of the regional Fed banks - who was also my graduate-school classmate - contrasted the responses to his research presentations in the United States and Canada . 
Whereas staff economists from the Federal Reserve System brought differing perspectives to the monetary-policy debate , their Canadian counterparts seemed to subscribe to a single &quot; Bank of Canada view . &quot; 
Two independent reviews of the Bank of England published in the wake of the global financial crisis found a similar lack of intellectual diversity and robust debate . 
One observed that Bank of England staff members tended to &quot; filter &quot; their advice to make it more palatable to their superiors . 
The other concluded that the crisis highlighted just how wrong the consensus view had been , and recommended a new approach that considered divergent views . 
This desire for change may have contributed to Carney &apos;s appointment as the new governor , and his recent decision to bring more outside expertise into the Bank &apos;s leadership . 
Avoiding groupthink is essential to developing innovative , effective policies capable of responding to new monetary-policy challenges - and that demands a flexible , dynamic policymaking process . 
The good news is that central banks have options for enriching their policy debates , even without the benefit of the Fed &apos;s size , structure , and geographic spread . 
For starters , they can establish committees of outside experts or commission regular external reviews of policy and the policymaking process . 
Another solution is to appoint a governor from outside the central bank , preferably one who has enough external experience to avoid being captured by groupthink . 
Or , perhaps better yet , they can hire a foreigner .
