Are We Five Years Wiser ? 
As the fifth anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda approaches , we should take the opportunity to assess the results of the response by the US and the international community . 
The attacks and the response to them have obviously brought about a sea change in international relations , but it would be difficult to argue that further atrocities have become less likely as a result . 
Why are we no more secure than we were five years ago ? 
Within a week of the attacks , President George W. Bush declared a &quot; war on terrorism . &quot; 
The metaphor of war has the singular advantage that it clearly and strongly evokes the intensity of the counterattack that was called for . 
Moreover , the metaphor of war constitutes an implicit appeal to intense mobilization , not only by a country that comes under attack , but also by its friends and allies . 
Naturally , no one questions America &apos;s right to defend itself . 
The legitimacy of a violent counterattack has never been in doubt . 
Whenever war is invoked , it implies a fight against nations , peoples , or states . 
It implies that whole territories and the populations living there are to be considered hostile . 
War implies armies and command structures that can be recognized , if not clearly known ; in any case , war entails a military confrontation with an identifiable adversary . 
On all of these points , the concept of war , to paraphrase US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , is not helpful . 
Even if the scale of the September 11 attack was of such a dimension that only the American army seemed able to face the challenge , in technical terms dealing with a threat that is extra-national rather than international is a matter of police techniques , not military tactics . 
The negative consequences of this mistaken vision very quickly became apparent . 
It is now widely known that the US government , perhaps partly unconsciously , embraced a deeply distorted image of al-Qaeda that portrayed it as a hierarchical organization with a seamless command structure - the prototype of a foe that the American army could attack and destroy . 
But al-Qaeda - the word means &quot; the base &quot; or &quot; the camp , &quot; that is , nothing more or less than a point of gathering and training - is more like a blurred sphere of influence , comprising individuals and small local cells that act on their own initiative and cooperate very rarely , and only for large-scale operations . 
It has not been proved that the attacks in London , Madrid , or Bali in the years since the September 11 plot , or the attack on America &apos;s warship the USS Cole in 2000 , reflected the existence of a &quot; center &quot; that coordinated the operations or gave orders to carry them out . 
It is also wrong to conflate Islamic terrorism with that of the Basque ETA , Sri Lanka &apos;s Tamil Tigers , or the Irish Republican Army . 
Whereas these groups have a territorial base and are preoccupied with national aims , Islamic terrorism appears to be the work of a very small number of individuals who seek to avenge the centuries-long &quot; humiliation &quot; of the Muslim world , brought about by colonization , absence of economic development , and political weakness . 
The goal of Islamic terrorists is nothing less than the destruction of the &quot; hegemonic &quot; Western world , despite most Muslim nations &quot; desire to live in peace within the international community and to cooperate in crafting effective development strategies . 
The only viable strategy for confronting the threat of Islamic terrorism was , and continues to be , a search for agreement among Muslims , and among the leaders of Muslim nations , on the forms of mutual cooperation , including police cooperation , that are needed to isolate , weaken , or destroy the militants in their midst . 
This is a long and difficult enterprise , but there remains no alternative . 
Instead , the war metaphor continues to define the US response and that of several of America &apos;s allies . 
The attraction of this metaphor may be attributable to the excessive trust that Americans place not only in their army , which is understandable , but in force in general , which is much less understandable in the case of an intelligent people . 
Whatever the case , casting the fight against terrorism as a war has led American policymakers to multiply violent military operations that have absolutely no chance of winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world . 
But to implicate Iraq , which had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or the September 11 attacks , was a huge mistake , one that has strengthened Islamic extremists and has probably helped them recruit terrorists . 
Moreover , the US response has strengthened Israel &apos;s belief in the effectiveness of military methods , leading to the recent war in Lebanon and the ongoing invasion of Gaza . 
Powerless , the international community does nothing . 
The rigidity and brutality of America &apos;s behavior - resulting in many times more civilian deaths than occurred on September 11 - have blocked any useful intervention by countries such as Algeria , Morocco , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , or the United Arab Emirates . 
Likewise , the appeal of war has ruled out the prospect of serious negotiations between Israel , Syria , and Lebanon . 
By attacking one Muslim country after another , the US and its allies have created the impression that Islam itself is the enemy , leading inexorably to the &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; that America says it wants to avoid . 
But America &apos;s strategy has failed . 
Force cannot accomplish everything . 
The international community must say clearly that Islam is not our enemy and that terrorism must be fought in other ways . 
Muslim political leaders , for their part , should declare just as openly that terrorism is not their choice . 
If both sides can stifle their murderous deviances , the hope of cultural and political reconciliation will be reborn .
