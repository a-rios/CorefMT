Round-Trip Freedom 
NEW YORK - Western media describe my friend and colleague Chen Guangcheng as a blind activist who made a flight to freedom when China allowed him to journey from Beijing to the United States . 
What is essential about Chen is neither his blindness nor his family &apos;s visit to the US , but the fact that he upholds a vision of universal human rights , a vision that can be fully realized only when , and if , China honors its promise to allow him one day to return home . 
China has a history of forcing scholars and dissidents like us into exile . 
When the Chinese student movement broke out in 1989 , I was pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of California-Berkeley . 
I traveled to Beijing to participate as an activist in Tiananmen Square , where I narrowly escaped the massacre and was able to make my way back to the US . 
Due to my activism , however , China refused to renew my passport . 
So , when I returned to China in 2002 to help the movement for workers &quot; rights , I used a friend &apos;s passport . 
China incarcerated me as a political prisoner for five years , until 2007 . 
For a year and a half of that period , I was held in solitary confinement , without access to visitors , reading materials , or even paper and pen . 
Upon my release , China renewed my passport on the condition that I return to the US . 
I have tried three times to return to my homeland , only to see China block each attempt at the Hong Kong airport . 
So Chen &apos;s case serves as a reminder that those who want to support Chinese activists &quot; struggle for human rights must support our right to enter and leave China freely . 
It also confirms that China &apos;s top leaders can be moved when the international community , led by the US , puts specific cases like his on the table . 
China &apos;s leaders directed negotiators to resolve the issue before the arrival of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , because she could be counted on to raise the issue in full view of the world &apos;s media . 
This naming and shaming approach can be more effective than most observers think . 
Human rights need not take a back seat to doing business with China . 
As a case in point , many Western observers thought that Norway &apos;s trade relations with China would be undermined when dissident Liu Xiaobo was invited to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in December 2010 . 
China complained loudly , refused to allow Liu to collect the prize , and even threatened Norway with financial repercussions . 
The same month , however , one of China &apos;s largest oil companies concluded a drilling contract with Norway &apos;s Statoil , clearly signaling that diplomatic tensions would not stop business . 
So Western diplomats who negotiate with China should call lower-level officials &quot; bluff , and focus on the signal-to-noise ratio , bearing in mind that , ultimately , decisions are taken quietly at a higher level by pragmatic leaders who are indeed susceptible to pressure . 
After all , economic growth remains China &apos;s best hope to keep the regime afloat , and it is the main criterion for officials &quot; promotion through the ranks . 
So the last thing that officials at any level want to do is jeopardize international trade . 
The strong commitment of US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration in supporting Chen made a difference , and it will make a difference in other cases , too . 
So we voices for human rights in China have reason to express gratitude to Clinton , Ambassador Gary Locke , House Speaker John Boehner , US Representatives Chris Smith , Frank Wolf , Nancy Pelosi , Jim McGovern , and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , and many citizens who spoke out for Chen . 
Chen had been sentenced to four years and three months in jail because he alienated corrupt local officials . 
After he served his term , the same officials funneled government funds to hire 200 thugs to punish him further by keeping him confined to his house . 
The resolution of Chen &apos;s dilemma shows that standing up for human rights will gain the grudging respect of China &apos;s leadership and citizenry . 
In addition , promoting democracy and human rights in authoritarian countries such as China will improve their social equality , economic productivity , and political stability in the long run , making them better trading partners . 
The right of return and freedom of speech were uppermost in Chen &apos;s mind as he engineered his family &apos;s departure for the US . 
I know because I spoke with him while he was in a hospital , negotiating his release . 
Exile is not freedom . 
For Chen , as for myself , the true flight to freedom will be made with a return ticket home .
