Musharraf and the Jihad Industry 
General Pervez Musharraf is poised to rule Pakistan for another five years . 
Not because he wants to , he says , but because no one but he can reform Pakistan . 
General Musharraf is the third Pakistani general in fifty years to seize power proclaiming a self-anointed reform agenda . 
Each time the United States and its allies nodded in agreement . 
But Musharraf is no Gorbachev , nor is he Kamal Ataturk , who pushed internal reform on their societies after recognizing the rot within . 
All of Musharraf &apos;s attempts at reform resulted from international pressure . 
Feeble at best , they have invariably avoided the type of structural changes Pakistan needs if it is ever to break out of its recurring , worsening crisis . 
Given General Musharraf &apos;s diminishing domestic popularity , some fear for his survival . 
But a real threat &quot; from the street &quot; seems most unlikely . 
The public , disillusioned by the kleptocratic regimes of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif that preceded Musharraf , is far too wretched and ambivalent to rise up . 
Moreover , militant groups cannot match the state &apos;s firepower . 
While intrigues and coups are possible , Musharraf &apos;s survival is likely because he will not threaten the enormous powers and privileges of the institution he heads and which is the only one that can seriously threaten him - Pakistan &apos;s military . 
All countries have armies , but in Pakistan the army has a country . 
Defense expenditures consume between one-third and one-half of the national budget . 
In recent decades , senior military officers have been transformed into powerful landlords through grants of choice agricultural lands and real estate . 
Retired officers head many , if not most , public corporations . 
This garrison economy is increasingly unsustainable , as Pakistan &apos;s poor multiply and the economy falters . 
While the army has always been the most powerful political force in Pakistan , it has undergone important changes in the decades since independence . 
The army &apos;s British colonial traditions were slowly Americanized during the Cold War . 
With his coup in 1977 , General Zia ul Haq injected a messianic zeal to redefine Pakistan as an Islamic state governed by Sharia ( Islamic Law ) . 
&quot; Islam , Pakistan , Jihad &quot; became emblazoned on banners at Pakistani army recruitment centers , beards proliferated , promotions went with piety , and few could be seen to miss Friday prayers . 
A new ethos was created ; this was to be an army not just for Pakistan , but for the greater glory of Islam . 
It was , after all , a different historical epoch . 
The global jihad industry , financed by the US and Saudi Arabia , welcomed it . 
But today , the army &apos;s jihad philosophy lies buried under the rubble of the World Trade Center . 
When faced by a US bent upon bloody vengeance , an acute institutional sense of survival sent the military establishment scurrying to join the US-led coalition and take up arms against its former creation , the Taliban and their Amir-ul-Momineen ( leader of the pious ) . 
It was a straightforward betrayal , resisted only by a few senior officers with an Islamic bent . 
They were quickly rendered irrelevant . 
General Musharraf knew the alternative . 
In all likelihood the Americans would &quot; have done an Iraq on Pakistan , &quot; as one highly placed member of the foreign ministry conceded to me in the week after September 11 th . 
He was probably right . 
The internal contradictions of Pakistan &apos;s volte face are now being exposed as the army &apos;s bloody encounters with Al-Qaida become more frequent , casualties mount , and hostile tribal reaction to joint US / Pakistani search-and-destroy operations on the western border increases . 
Officers and soldiers are asking , What is the purpose of the current campaign ? 
To die in Kashmir officially qualifies a soldier or officer as a &quot; shaheed &quot; ( martyr ) . 
But is fighting America &apos;s war a jihad , and are soldiers slain by Al-Qaida or other former allies also martyrs ? 
Since official certification of martyrdom is tied to land grants and compensation to families , this question carries very real material significance . 
Inevitably the anger - visible or otherwise - at having to fight America &apos;s war against Al-Qaida and the Taliban focuses on Musharraf , a man who received high praise from the United Jihad Council after incursions and battles fought against India around Kargil in Kashmir two years ago . 
Right-wing religious groups in Pakistan warmly welcomed Musharraf &apos;s successful coup . 
But today he lives in mortal danger , aware that he is silently stalked by the forces that once sided with him . 
Ironically , fate has yoked his survival to George W. Bush , who could not recall the name of this Pakistani leader at the time of the US presidential elections . 
Seeking to make permanent his coup , Musharraf has proposed amendments to Pakistan &apos;s constitution . 
A new National Security Council would formalize the army &apos;s political domination of Pakistani society , with the armed forces chiefs having the power to sack the Prime Minister and dismiss an elected Parliament . 
All of this in the name of &quot; reform , &quot; of course . 
But if Pakistan is to overcome its double challenge of escaping its army &apos;s Bonapartism and winning the war against jihadists , the military - not just society - must be reformed . 
The imperatives are clear : first , the army must accept that the social and economic needs of Pakistan &apos;s people come first and that it must be downsized to live within Pakistan &apos;s means . 
Second , the army must focus upon defending Pakistan &apos;s frontiers while accepting that there can be only a political , not a military , solution for Kashmir . 
Surely , given all that Pakistan stands to gain from genuine reform , this is not too much to ask .
