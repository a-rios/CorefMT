The Marx Renaissance 
PRINCETON - Karl Marx has returned , if not quite from the grave then from history &apos;s dustbin . 
German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr√ºck recently said that Marx &apos;s answers &quot; may not be irrelevant &quot; to today &apos;s problems . 
French President Nicholas Sarkozy allowed himself to be photographed leafing through the pages of Marx &apos;s Das Kapital . 
A German filmmaker , Alexander Kluge , is promising to turn Das Kapital into a movie . 
Few of today &apos;s new &quot; Marxists &quot; want to spell out the attractions of a man who wanted to unite German philosophy ( building on Hegel ) with British political economy ( carrying on from David Ricardo ) , and thereby turn two rather conservative traditions into a theory of radical revolution . 
Marx was certainly a perceptive analyst of the nineteenth century &apos;s version of globalization . 
In 1848 , in The Communist Manifesto , he wrote : &quot; In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency , we have intercourse in every direction , universal inter-dependence of nations . &quot; 
To be sure , there were plenty of other nineteenth-century commentators who analyzed the creation of global networks . 
The implication of Marx &apos;s renewed popularity is that capitalism is now universally accepted as being fundamentally broken , with the financial system at the heart of the problem . 
Marx &apos;s description of &quot; the fetishism of commodities &quot; - the translation of goods into tradable assets , disembodied from either the process of creation or their usefulness - seems entirely relevant to the complex process of securitization , in which values seem to be hidden by obscure transactions . 
From the analysis of the deceptive nature of complexity , there followed the recommendation of the Communist Manifesto that seems most attractive to contemporary &quot; Marxists . &quot; 
It came as point five in a ten-point program . 
Point five , which was preceded by &quot; confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels , &quot; was &quot; centralization of credit in the hands of the State , by means of a national bank with State property and an exclusive monopoly . &quot; 
The major problem in the aftermath of today &apos;s financial crisis is that banks are no longer providing credit for many transactions needed in the basic operation of the economy . 
Even the recapitalization of banks through state assistance has not been enough to revive economic activity . 
In the face of the difficulties of big automobile producers and smaller suppliers alike , many are demanding that , as part of the rescue package , the state should compel banks to lend . 
Everyone thinks of the horse that can be led to water , but cannot be made to drink . 
Even pro-market commentators have taken up the cry that the market will not provide the needed credit . 
State-compelled lending has been adopted in the past , and not just in the central planning systems of communist economies . 
It was part of the standard armory of early modern European states as they dealt with their creditors . 
Immediately after World War II , it was at the heart of French economic policy . 
More recently , in the early 1980 &quot; s , the International Monetary Fund and the central banks in the big industrial countries teamed up to pressure banks into extending more credit to the big Latin American debtor countries . 
Many bankers grumbled about having to throw good money after bad , but they gave in under the threat of greater regulatory intervention . 
The result of credit compulsion was rather paradoxical . 
The 1980 &quot; s solution saved the banks ( and the bankers ) from the debt crisis , but in the long run increased burden of repayment , and in this way decreased living standards in Latin America . 
A better solution would have been debt reduction at an earlier stage of the crisis . 
In today &apos;s circumstances , the financial system would have been better off if some version of US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson &apos;s original plan to purchase toxic assets and take them off banks &quot; balance sheets had been realized . 
But that proved too complex , because valuing each asset raised different and unique problems . 
In running away from complexity , we have come to look for simple solutions . 
When opening a new building at the London School of Economics , the Queen of England asked why no one had predicted the crisis . 
In fact , the clearest anticipation was given by two British comedians ( John Bird and John Fortune ) in a television show over a year ago , at a time when high-powered financiers were still in denial . 
In other words , the financial world has reached a kind of carnival season , in which fools are wise and clever people turn out to be idiots . 
That does not necessarily mean that the idiot &apos;s solution makes sense . 
When economic activity starts up again after a deep recession , it will not be as a consequence of people having been compelled to channel financial resources into the projects selected as politically desirable , but as a result of new ideas . 
The chances are higher that a large number of decision makers will be able to identify these new projects , and much slimmer that a centralized version of financial planning will do so successfully . 
The &quot; Marxist &quot; revival was probably an inevitable byproduct of the current crisis .
