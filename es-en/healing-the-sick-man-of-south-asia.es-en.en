Healing the Sick Man of South Asia 
LAHORE - Pakistan is undergoing three transitions simultaneously . 
How they unfold matters not only for Pakistan , but also for much of the Muslim world , particularly as the Arab Spring forces change upon governments across the wider Middle East . 
Most Muslim countries were governed for decades by autocrats who had either emerged directly from the armed forces , or had strong &quot; khaki &quot; support . 
That was the case in Egypt , Libya , Yemen , Syria , and , of course , Pakistan . 
The Arab Spring drained away whatever spurious legitimacy that style of governance ever had . 
But , in Pakistan , delegitimation of military rule had actually occurred three years earlier , and the pressure for change came from much the same source - a restive and mobilized new middle class . 
Several decades ago , the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued that economic prosperity in developing countries with weak governing institutions would not necessarily lead to political stability . 
On the contrary , economic growth in such contexts can be - and often is - politically destabilizing . 
That proved to be the case in Turkey and Pakistan in the 1990 &quot; s and early 2000 &quot; s , and later in much of the Arab world . 
Indeed , the rising aspirations of Arab youth in Egypt and Tunisia , the wellspring of the Arab Spring , followed impressive economic growth that had failed to trickle down . 
And such rising expectations have been visible in all large Muslim countries . 
As Huntington suggested , when young people see their economies grow , they begin to demand participation in decisions that affect all aspects of their lives , not just their economic well-being . 
Military-dominated political systems precluded such participation , so , with economic growth , demilitarization of politics became a rallying cry in all large military-led Muslim states , from Indonesia to the Mediterranean coast . 
Even Iran , where the Revolutionary Guards control roughly one-third of the economy , was affected when the result of the presidential election in 2009 triggered large anti-government protests in Tehran and other major cities . 
But demilitarization means more than transferring power and policymaking from the armed forces to elected parliaments . 
In their recent book Why Nations Fail , the economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson suggest that elections - even those that are free and fair - do not necessarily move societies from what they call &quot; extractive &quot; to &quot; inclusive &quot; systems . 
Indeed , extraction of a country &apos;s wealth for use by the elite can occur even in democratic societies when those who dominate the political system face no constraints other than periodic elections . 
This is where the effort to devise institutional mechanisms to check and balance elite behavior enters the picture . 
Indeed , the search for such mechanisms is precisely what is now underway in Pakistan . 
In Pakistan , a discredited military was forced by public opinion to withdraw from power , creating political space for elected representatives . 
While their personal wealth increased , living standards for everyone else either stagnated or , for lower-income groups , declined . 
So , as Pakistan negotiated its political transition , it experienced significant economic decline . 
As a result , Pakistan &apos;s judiciary , media , and many civil-society organizations are now engaged in attempts not only to keep the soldiers in their barracks , but also to constrain the political establishment &apos;s rapacious behavior . 
Three cases before the country &apos;s increasingly assertive Supreme Court promise to take Pakistan from the phase of demilitarization to a system in which meaningful checks can be exercised on those who wield power . 
One case is an attempt to force Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani &apos;s administration to reopen proceedings in a Swiss court that were examining charges of money-laundering and misuse of public funds by President Asif Ali Zardari . 
The Swiss proceedings were stopped at the request of the Pakistani government when Zardari became president . 
In the second case , the Supreme Court wants Pakistan &apos;s military intelligence agencies to account for hundreds , if not thousands , of missing people who were detained as part of the agencies &quot; campaign to contain the rise of Islamic extremism , or to undermine separatist aspirations in restive Baluchistan . 
The third case opened an old complaint lodged by a politician decades ago against the &quot; troika &quot; - composed of the president , the prime minister , and the chief of army staff - that then governed Pakistan . 
The plaintiff alleged that large amounts of funds were channeled to the troika &apos;s favored candidates to contest the 1990 general election , in which Nawaz Sharif &apos;s party won a big victory over Benazir Bhutto &apos;s Peoples &quot; Party . 
Finally , Pakistan is undergoing a transition in which power is moving from the central administration to sub-national governments . 
The 18th amendment to the constitution , adopted in 2010 , does precisely that , but implementation is being delayed by parties that prefer a highly centralized political structure . 
If Pakistan &apos;s transformation of its political system succeeds , it could serve as a model for other Muslim countries that are attempting to move from extractive to inclusive systems of governance . 
Turkey has already traveled some distance along this path . 
If Pakistan also advances , demilitarization of politics elsewhere in the Islamic world might not be far behind .
