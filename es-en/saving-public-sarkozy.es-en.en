Saving Public Sarkozy 
Ever since key public figures signed a manifesto in a French magazine denouncing the dangers of a monarchical drift - without ever mentioning the president &apos;s name - the political atmosphere in France has been electric . 
Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s rapid fall from grace is unprecedented in the history of the Fifth Republic . 
His popularity ratings are plummeting , and his party , the conservative UMP , is predicted to fare badly in the municipal elections in mid-March . 
What is behind the collapse in Sarkozy &apos;s popularity ? 
Can he recover ? 
These questions are crucial not only for France , because we are five months away from a French presidency of the European Union that should have been an important step in Europe &apos;s own rebound . 
The attacks on Sarkozy are very personal , and focus as much on his &quot; essence &quot; as on his performance . 
Can he incarnate France with dignity and legitimacy ? 
Can he transform intuitions and speeches into concrete actions ? 
Has he already lost touch with reality , surrounded as he is by a court of media courtesans ? 
In the eyes of a majority of French citizens , for whom presidents are &quot; elected monarchs , &quot; Sarkozy has &quot; de-sacralized &quot; the presidency . 
Unlike constitutional monarchies , France does not distinguish between the symbol and the reality of power . Sarkozy may want to be a combination of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair , but in symbolic terms he is also the Queen . 
And , in his quest for modernity and transparency , he has de-legitimized the symbolic dimension of his function by mixing his private and public lives . 
On the one hand , Sarkozy &apos;s fascination with rich people has helped isolate him from the average Frenchman . 
Yet , on the other hand , his flashy style is considered vulgar by traditional French elites , who are keen to dissociate themselves from someone whose educational background and instinctive reactions clearly marks him as not one of them . 
His love life is not seen as a human , romantic affair and a sign of youthful energy , but as a possibly fatal distraction , the ultimate proof of his &quot; immaturity . &quot; 
Of course , if the international economic environment had been more favourable , and if there were not so much legitimate concern about declining purchasing power , the French might have shown greater indulgence towards their young president . 
You cannot proclaim your impotence in the face of empty state coffers after pushing through useless and costly tax breaks for the richest . 
Moreover , if Sarkozy has eroded , perhaps fatally , the &quot; sacred &quot; symbolic nature of the presidency , his governance has failed to provide any compensating reassurance . 
Multiplying initiatives , being everywhere at once , accelerating the pace of reforms at the risk of confusing quality and quantity , breaking taboos , and blurring the lines between secularism and religion , Sarkozy has reinforced lingering doubts about a brilliant politician &apos;s ability to become a statesman or at least an effective ruler . 
The influence of his court has been seen as excessive and dangerous , marginalizing and frustrating the government , parliament , and his own party . 
But it is much too early to bury Sarkozy . 
While he has seemingly lost touch with the French people , he is deeply aware of and wounded by his declining popularity , and no one should underestimate his ability to reinvent himself with a new government after the municipal elections and greater distance from his immediate entourage . 
In any case , France is not Russia . 
Despite some troubling similarities between Sarkozy and Vladimir Putin , French democracy is not in danger . 
What is at stake is the dignity of the presidential office and , beyond that , France &apos;s ability to modernize . 
Indeed , the most serious casualty of the current political climate in France is Sarkozy &apos;s reform agenda . 
It is as if his personality had become the biggest obstacle to his determination to break with the past . 
Perhaps too much uncontrolled rupture in style can ultimately lead to paralysis in substance .
