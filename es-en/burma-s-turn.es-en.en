Burma &apos;s Turn 
YANGON - Here in Myanmar ( Burma ) , where political change has been numbingly slow for a half-century , a new leadership is trying to embrace rapid transition from within . 
The government has freed political prisoners , held elections ( with more on the way ) , begun economic reform , and is intensively courting foreign investment . 
Understandably , the international community , which has long punished Myanmar &apos;s authoritarian regime with sanctions , remains cautious . 
Reforms are being introduced so fast that even renowned experts on the country are uncertain about what to make of them . 
But it is clear to me that this moment in Myanmar &apos;s history represents a real opportunity for permanent change - an opportunity that the international community must not miss . 
It is time for the world to move the agenda for Myanmar forward , not just by offering assistance , but by removing the sanctions that have now become an impediment to the country &apos;s transformation . 
So far , that transformation , initiated following legislative elections in November 2010 , has been breathtaking . 
With the military , which had held exclusive power from 1962 , retaining some 25 % of the seats , there were fears that the election would be a fa√ßade . 
But the government that emerged has turned out to reflect fundamental concerns of Myanmar &apos;s citizens far better than was anticipated . 
Under the leadership of the new president , Thein Sein , the authorities have responded to calls for a political and economic opening . 
Progress has been made on peace agreements with ethnic-minority insurgents - conflicts rooted in the divide-and-rule strategy of colonialism , which the country &apos;s post-independence rulers maintained for more than six decades . 
The Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was not only released from house arrest , but is now campaigning hard for a parliamentary seat in April &apos;s by-elections . 
On the economic front , unprecedented transparency has been introduced into the budgetary process . 
Expenditures on health care and education have been doubled , albeit from a low base . 
Licensing restrictions in a number of key areas have been loosened . 
The government has even committed itself to moving towards unifying its complicated exchange-rate system . 
The spirit of hope in the country is palpable , though some older people , who saw earlier moments of apparent relaxation of authoritarian rule come and go , remain cautious . 
Perhaps that is why some in the international community are similarly hesitant about easing Myanmar &apos;s isolation . 
But most Burmese sense that if changes are managed well , the country will have embarked on an irreversible course . 
In February , I participated in seminars in Yangon ( Rangoon ) and the recently constructed capital , Naypyidaw , organized by one of the country &apos;s leading economists , U Myint . 
The events were momentous , owing both to large and actively engaged audiences ( more than a thousand in Yangon ) , and to the thoughtful and moving presentations by two world-famous Burmese economists who had left the country in the 1960 &quot; s and were back for their first visit in more than four decades . 
My Columbia University colleague Ronald Findlay pointed out that one of them , 91-year-old Hla Myint , who had held a professorship at the London School of Economics , was the father of the most successful development strategy ever devised , that of an open economy and export-led growth . 
That blueprint has been used throughout Asia in recent decades , most notably in China . 
Now , perhaps , it has finally come home . 
I delivered a lecture in Myanmar in December 2009 . 
At that time , one had to be careful , given the government &apos;s sensitivities , even about how one framed the country &apos;s problems - its poverty , lack of rural productivity , and unskilled workforce . 
Now caution has been replaced by a sense of urgency in dealing with these and other challenges , and by awareness of the need for technical and other forms of assistance . 
( Relative to its population and income , Myanmar is one of the world &apos;s smallest recipients of international assistance . ) 
There is much debate about what explains the rapidity of Myanmar &apos;s current pace of change . 
Perhaps its leaders recognized that the country , once the world &apos;s largest rice exporter , was falling far behind its neighbors . 
Perhaps they heard the message of the Arab Spring , or simply understood that , with more than three million Burmese living abroad , it was impossible to isolate the country from the rest of the world or prevent ideas from seeping in from its neighbors . 
Whatever the reason , change is occurring , and the opportunity that it represents is undeniable . 
But many of the international sanctions , whatever their role in the past , now seem counterproductive . 
Financial sanctions , for instance , discourage the development of a modern and transparent financial system , integrated with the rest of the world . 
The resulting cash-based economy is an invitation to corruption . 
Likewise , restrictions that prevent socially responsible companies based in advanced industrial countries from doing business in Myanmar have left the field open to less scrupulous firms . 
We should welcome Myanmar &apos;s desire for guidance and advice from multilateral institutions and the United Nations Development Program ; instead , we continue to limit the role that these institutions can play in the country &apos;s transition . 
Whenever we withhold assistance or impose sanctions , we need to think carefully about who bears the burden in bringing about the changes that we seek . 
Opening up trade in agriculture and textiles - and even providing preferences of the kind that are offered to other poor countries - would likely benefit directly the poor farmers who make up 70 % of the population , as well as create new jobs . 
The wealthy and powerful can circumvent financial sanctions , though at a cost ; ordinary citizens cannot so easily escape the impact of international-pariah status . 
We have seen the Arab Spring blossom haltingly in a few countries ; in others , it is still uncertain whether it will bear fruit . 
Myanmar &apos;s transition is in some ways quieter , without the fanfare of Twitter and Facebook , but it is no less real - and no less deserving of support .
