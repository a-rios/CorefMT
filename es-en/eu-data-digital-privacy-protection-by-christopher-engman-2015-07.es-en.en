Europe &apos;s Digital Wrong Turn 
STOCKHOLM - When it comes to crafting good digital policy , Europe has failed its first big test . 
In May , the European Commission announced that it would create a unified digital market of 500 million consumers that would add â‚¬ 415 billion ( $ 463 billion ) to the European Union &apos;s GDP and create some 3.8 million jobs . 
Unfortunately , a recent decision on one key digital issue - data privacy - threatens to derail that effort . 
In June , the EU &apos;s home and justice ministers voted to retain significant national powers over the protection of digital privacy , rather than creating a single set of rules that would apply in all 28 EU countries . 
If the European Parliament approves their proposal , divergent national rules would be reintroduced . 
Even more worryingly , this would open the door for provisions outlawing the benign , low-risk data mining that drives online advertising . 
Online advertising allows EU citizens to access information , educational material , commerce channels , and entertainment sites without paying for them directly , and the amount being spent on it in Europe is growing fast . 
The industry &apos;s revenues have more than quadrupled since 2006 , even as the overall European economy has stagnated . 
The EU &apos;s privacy crackdown threatens to undermine all of this . 
Not only will it create an administrative burden through additional costs and bureaucratic hassles ; it also raises the real possibility that the new rules will undermine the business model of many of Europe &apos;s most prominent online companies . 
That would be a pity - one that could have been easily avoided . 
In 2012 , the European Commission presented a proposal to replace the EU &apos;s existing data-protection legislation , the latest version of which had been drafted in 1995 , when the Internet played only a tiny role in the economy . 
The initial text was promising . 
Unfortunately , many of the most benevolent provisions have since been discarded . 
At the June ministerial meeting , the important one-stop-shop principle was gutted . 
Instead of allowing businesses to deal with the data-protection authority in the country where they are headquartered or have their main European base , member states are insisting that national regulators maintain control . 
Under the newly proposed rules , any &quot; concerned &quot; authority could object to a decision by another national regulator , triggering a complex arbitration procedure involving all 28 agencies . 
The ministers also adopted a broad definition of personal data . 
At best , this broad , indiscriminate definition of personal data threatens to create unnecessary obstacles for EU-based digital advertisers . 
Unnecessarily strict data rules will hurt European companies disproportionately . 
Google , Facebook , and other American Internet giants are in a position to receive explicit consent from users . 
But Europe &apos;s online sector is dominated by business-to-business companies with little-known brands that process consumer data but lack direct contact with users . 
As a result , the only real alternative for European Internet companies will be to work with large American platforms and become even more dependent on them . 
The United Kingdom , Sweden , Norway , and the Netherlands are global online leaders , but many other European countries are lagging far behind . 
As a result , the digital economy contributes about 4 % to the EU &apos;s GDP , compared to 5 % in the United States and 7.3 % in South Korea . 
These new regulations will ensure that European companies will be left trailing far behind their international competitors . 
Europe is facing an important choice . 
To be sure , the EU needs to reassure its citizens that their data will be used properly ; measures that do this will help the digital economy grow . 
But the continent &apos;s policymakers must remember that a digital single market cannot exist as long as there are rules that reinforce divergent national approaches to privacy and hinder the Internet &apos;s use of anonymous data for digital advertising . 
At stake is an entire generation of European digital entrepreneurs .
