In Darwin &apos;s Place 
BERKELEY - Imagine that , as a young scientist , you spent years collecting information about the foundations of how nature works . 
You built your reputation by collecting plants , animals , fossils , and geological samples from around the world , and sending back letters that tracked your development into a first-rate scientist . 
By the time you returned from a great five-year voyage , you were surprised to find that you were a rising star . 
Throughout your trip , and in the years afterward , the mists that had obscured some incredibly simple yet powerful natural explanations lifted . 
You came to realize that you were in virgin intellectual territory . 
Your academic mentors and the scientists whose works you had read were continuing to stumble over grand problems that now seemed , if not solved , at least soluble . 
People had been talking about evolution for decades , but you have come up with a mechanism - natural selection - that just might explain much of it . 
You realize that to reveal what you &apos;ve come to understand will not only revolutionize your science , but will potentially shatter many of your countrymen &apos;s religious and philosophical foundations . 
These were the circumstances in which Charles Darwin found himself in the late 1830 &quot; s and early 1840 &quot; s , when he developed the principle of natural selection and its revolutionary implication : all the Earth &apos;s life forms could have evolved from a single common ancestor . 
His was one of the most brilliant insights in the history of science : a mechanism that enabled the principle of evolution to unify and inform all of biology . 
Just for a minute , put yourself in his place . 
How would you feel ? 
( &quot; It is like confessing a murder , &quot; he wrote at the time . ) 
Here &apos;s the translation to today &apos;s world : your discovery might win you the Nobel Prize , but it also might get you a bullet in the brain from a religious fundamentalist . 
How do you feel about publishing now ? 
But then , at roughly the same time you finish drafting the first summary of your ideas , a book , written by an anonymous author , appears that also purports to explain how life might have changed through time , and considers some of the mechanisms that may underlie this grand history . 
Have you been &quot; scooped &quot; ? 
No , the author has many of his facts wrong and goes beyond reasonable speculation , which brings him disdain from scientists . 
Predictably , he fares as poorly with religious leaders , some of whom accuse him of blasphemy . 
And he hasn &apos;t independently reached your new ideas - the ideas that matter . 
But you empathize with his position : you will be pilloried in the same way if you don &apos;t nail down your theory with the best arguments possible and marginalize your opponents so that they have neither theological nor scientific reasons to attack you . 
So you wait to publish . 
Years roll by . 
You gather data , do experiments , read , and write . 
Your book becomes bigger . 
Impossibly big . 
It is a good thing you do not have to work for a living . 
Then , a bolt from the blue . 
A letter from an old colleague in Southeast Asia with whom you &apos;ve corresponded for years , attached to a manuscript that lays out your whole theory of natural selection in a nutshell . 
He &apos;s asking you , as a well-connected man of science , whether you would communicate his paper to the Linnean Society of London for reading and possible publication , if you think his arguments meritorious . 
You are unsure about what to do . 
He &apos;s scooped you on your main idea , although he hasn &apos;t thought through the implications , or worked out all the other ideas that comprise your theory . 
You don &apos;t want to lose your investment . 
You want credit where it &apos;s due , and you want to control the game , because you have so much more to show and to support your arguments . 
So you consult scientific colleagues who have known for years how you &apos;ve been developing your theory . 
They agree that it is fair to broker an arrangement with your correspondent to publish together . 
This appears to satisfy everyone , but it puts you in panic mode . 
Now you have to publish your entire theory right away , before someone else gets the credit . 
It nearly kills you , but you get the book out - only an abstract of the magnum opus that you had planned - by the end of the next year . 
You call it The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life . 
The reaction is immediate : 1,200 copies are published , and they sell out immediately . 
There are welcome reviews from scientists , but also sharp broadsides from religious people . 
Serious criticism comes from unexpected places : philosophers you knew and learned from , scientists to whom you had entrusted your priceless collections to describe . 
And yet : the genius of the argument is seen . 
Natural selection as a theory becomes a proposition in play , needing much more work . 
But almost no serious intellectual can continue to doubt the common ancestry of all living things . 
You &apos;ve changed the world : people will never again look at all species as fixed entities , but as part of a single tree of life . 
How do you feel ?
