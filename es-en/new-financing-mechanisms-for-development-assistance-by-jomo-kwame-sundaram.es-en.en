Innovation in Development Finance 
ROME - More than four decades ago , the world &apos;s wealthiest countries pledged that at least 0.7 % of their GDP would be devoted to official development assistance ( ODA ) . 
In fact , ODA disbursements have not been stable , reliable , or reflective of need , and doubts about their effectiveness linger . 
ODA declined significantly after the Cold War , dropping to 0.22 % of developed countries &quot; combined GDP in 1997-2001 , before rising again after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the United States and the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey , Mexico , the following year . 
Then , as developed-country governments imposed strict fiscal austerity in the wake of the global economic crisis , ODA fell again , to 0.31 % of GDP in 2010-2011 . 
But , since the Monterrey conference , major additional development-finance needs have been identified , including aid-for-trade schemes and financing for climate-change mitigation and adaptation . 
Indeed , critics contend that the international taxes - for example , on carbon emissions - that the Leading Group has identified as a potential source of finance infringe on national sovereignty . 
Moreover , the sources of finance do not necessarily determine how the funds are allocated , let alone how they are ultimately used . 
For example , although the so-called Tobin tax ( a small levy on financial transactions ) was originally intended to fund development assistance , a version of it was recently adopted in Europe in order to supplement national budget revenues . 
Of course , such &quot; off-label &quot; uses of innovations in development finance do not discredit them . 
The UN &apos;s 2012 World Economic and Social Survey on new development finance discusses various existing and proposed innovations in financing , intermediation , and disbursement . 
Aside from allocating and trading greenhouse-gas ( mainly carbon or &quot; carbon equivalent &quot; ) emissions allowances , &quot; solidarity levies &quot; could be imposed on airplane tickets , and taxes imposed on aviation or ship fuel . 
Another proposal involves creating new international liquidity by issuing special drawing rights ( international reserve assets maintained by the International Monetary Fund ) . 
The resulting funds , as well as those from existing unused SDRs , would be allocated or re-allocated to development projects and leveraged to augment investment resources . 
Yet another scheme would deploy royalties for natural-resource extraction from the global commons , such as Antarctica and other areas beyond &quot; exclusive &#91; national &#93; economic zones . &quot; 
Some initiatives are already underway . 
For example , the project ( RED ) is a corporate campaign that aims to raise money for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria by donating a portion of proceeds from consumer products branded with the cause . 
While some are critical of the disparity between what these &quot; altruistic &quot; companies spend on advertising and the amount of money that they actually raise , such &quot; cause marketing &quot; could prove to be an effective mechanism for generating additional development finance . 
Furthermore , some proposals entail no additional funds . 
Development-finance flows could be restructured , so that they are channeled through mechanisms like the International Finance Facility for Immunization , which binds ODA commitments over a long period and securitizes them in order to generate funds for immediate use . 
Similarly , debt-conversion schemes such as Debt2Health and debt-for-nature swaps would allow countries to redirect debt-service payments to development projects . 
Some worthwhile new risk-management proposals include advance commitments for new vaccines , subsidies to drug manufacturers to make their products more affordable , and regionally pooled catastrophe insurance . 
Over the last six years , roughly $ 6 billion has been allotted to innovative sources of financing , compared to current annual ODA of more than $ 120 billion - and far less than the almost $ 20 trillion committed by G-20 countries to economic recovery ( including bailouts ) since 2008 . 
But some recent proposals promise to raise far more resources for sustainable development . 
Likewise , regular SDR emissions to keep pace with the growth of global liquidity could yield roughly $ 100 billion annually for international development cooperation . 
Such emissions would reduce demand for US Treasury bonds and other liquid assets of preferred currencies . 
At the same time , if the world &apos;s most powerful countries stopped promoting full capital-account liberalization , developing countries would feel less pressure to protect themselves by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves . 
By investing the funds in development projects instead , they could address both savings and foreign-exchange constraints . 
Finally , innovative strategies are needed to align development finance with national development goals , transforming the multilateral system operationally so that it works more effectively with stakeholders on the ground . 
One model is the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer , which has succeeded spectacularly in reducing levels of chlorofluorocarbons , highlighting the continued potential of inclusive multilateralism .
