The Energy Deficit 
MILAN - I have been surprised by the recent coverage in the American press of gasoline prices and politics . 
Political pundits agree that presidential approval ratings are highly correlated with gas prices : when prices go up , a president &apos;s poll ratings go down . 
But , in view of America &apos;s long history of neglect of energy security and resilience , the notion that Barack Obama &apos;s administration is responsible for rising gas prices makes little sense . 
Four decades have passed since the oil-price shocks of the 1970 &quot; s . 
We learned a lot from that experience . 
The short-run impact - as always occurs when oil prices rise quickly - was to reduce growth by reducing consumption of other goods , because oil consumption does not adjust as quickly as that of other goods and services . 
But , given time , people can and do respond by lowering their consumption of oil . 
They buy more fuel-efficient cars and appliances , insulate their homes , and sometimes even use public transportation . 
The longer-run impact is thus different and much less negative . 
The more energy-efficient one is , the lower one &apos;s vulnerability to price volatility . 
On the supply side , there is a similar difference between short-term and longer-run effects . 
In the short term , supply may be able to respond to the extent that there is reserve capacity ( there isn &apos;t much now ) . 
But the much larger , longer-run effect comes from increased oil exploration and extraction , owing to the incentive of higher prices . 
All of this takes time , but , as it occurs , it mitigates the negative impact : the demand and supply curves shift in response to higher prices ( or to anticipation of higher prices ) . 
In terms of policy , there was a promising effort in the late 1970 &quot; s . 
Fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles were legislated , and car producers implemented them . 
In a more fragmented fashion , states established incentives for energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings . 
But then oil and gas prices ( adjusted for inflation ) entered a multi-decade period of decline . 
Policies targeting energy efficiency and security largely lapsed . 
Two generations came to think of declining oil prices as normal , which accounts for the current sense of entitlement , the outrage at rising prices , and the search for villains : politicians , oil-producing countries , and oil companies are all targets of scorn in public-opinion surveys . 
A substantial failure of education about non-renewable natural resources lies in the background of current public sentiment . 
And now , having underinvested in energy efficiency and security when the costs of doing so were lower , America is poorly positioned to face the prospect of rising real prices . 
Energy policy has been &quot; pro-cyclical &quot; - the opposite of saving for a rainy day . 
Given the upward pressure on prices implied by rising emerging-market demand and the global economy &apos;s rapid increase in size , that day has arrived . 
Counter-cyclicality is a useful mindset for individuals and governments . 
Recent history , particularly the excessive accumulation of private and public debt , suggests that we have not acquired it . 
Energy policy or its absence seems another clear example . 
Rather than anticipating and preparing for change , the United States has waited for change to be forced upon it . 
Energy-policy myopia has not been confined to the US . 
Developing countries , for example , have operated for many years with fossil-fuel subsidies , which have come to be widely recognized as a bad way for governments to spend their limited resources . 
Now these policies have to be reversed , which implies similar political challenges and costs . 
Western Europe and Japan , both of which are almost entirely dependent on external supplies of oil and gas , have done somewhat better . 
For security and environmental reasons , their energy efficiency increased via a combination of taxes , higher consumer prices , and public education . 
The Obama administration is now working to initiate a sensible long-term approach to energy , with new fuel-efficiency standards for motor vehicles , investments in technology , energy-efficiency programs for dwellings , and environmentally sound exploration for additional resources . 
Doing this in the midst of an arduous post-crisis deleveraging process , a stubbornly slow recovery , the process of building a new , more sustainable growth pattern , is harder - politically and economically - than it might otherwise have been , had the US started earlier.ampnbsp ; 
Still , better late than never . 
Obama is correctly attempting to explain that effective energy policy , by its very nature , requires long-term goals and steady progress toward achieving them . 
One frequently hears the assertion that democracies &quot; electoral cycles are poorly suited to implementing long-term , forward-looking policies . 
The countervailing force is leadership that explains the benefits and costs of different options , and unites people around common goals and sensible approaches . 
The Obama administration &apos;s effort to put long-term growth and security above political advantage thus deserves admiration and respect . 
If criticism of democratic governance on the grounds of its &quot; inevitable short time horizon &quot; were correct , it would be hard to explain how India , a populous , complex , and still-poor democracy , could sustain long-term investments and policies required to support rapid growth and development . 
There , too , vision , leadership , and consensus-building have played a critical role . 
The good news for US energy security is that in 2011 , the country became a new net exporter of petroleum products . 
The price of fossil fuels , however , is likely to continue to trend upward . 
Declining dependence on external sources , properly pursued , is an important development . 
But it is not a substitute for higher energy efficiency , which is essential to making the switch to a new and resilient path for economic growth and employment . 
A side benefit would be to unlock a huge international agenda for energy , the environment , and sustainability , where American leadership is required . 
This effort requires persistence and a long official attention span , which in turn presupposes bipartisan support . 
Is that possible in America today ? 
The US political system &apos;s persistently low approval ratings stem in part from the fact that it seems to reward obstructionism rather than constructive bipartisan action . 
At some point , voters will react against a system that amplifies differences and suppresses shared goals , and policy formation will revert to its more effective pragmatic mode . 
The question is when .
