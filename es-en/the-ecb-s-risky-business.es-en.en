The ECB &apos;s Risky Business 
BRUSSELS - A central bank always has a crucial role to play in a financial crisis . 
But the European Central Bank &apos;s role within the eurozone nowadays is even more &quot; central &quot; than that of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England . 
A key difference between the eurozone and the United States is that lending between two banks located in two different member countries is still perceived as carrying quite different risks than &quot; domestic &quot; lending ( between two banks in the same country ) . 
This is not the case in the US , because it has an integrated financial system , and support for banks ( deposit insurance or outright bailouts ) is administered at the federal level . 
As a result , the fact that California might be closer to bankruptcy than some eurozone countries has no influence at all on the credit rating of banks headquartered there , or on their ability to obtain funds on the interbank market . 
In Europe , by contrast , the fate of all banks depends upon their home governments . 
During the credit boom before 2007 , enormous cross-border interbank claims built up , because banks trusted one another . 
Then , in 2008 , the interbank market suddenly froze as that trust evaporated . 
This was a generalized phenomenon , not focused on particular countries , because it was still assumed at the time that all eurozone governments would be able to bail out their own banks . 
Now that the &quot; southern &quot; eurozone governments &quot; solvency no longer seems assured , distrust has grown along national lines . 
German banks continue to lend to each other ( and to other banks in northern Europe ) , but they are no longer willing to lend to Italian , Spanish , or other banks in southern Europe . 
A sudden withdrawal of interbank funding has the same consequences as a bank run . 
A bank that suddenly has to repay its interbank debt must cut credit to its own customers or sell off other assets , leading to large losses . 
This is precisely what happened when the interbank market froze after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 . 
When the cross-border interbank market stopped working this summer , a similar economic collapse was avoided only because the ECB , without much fanfare , became the eurozone &apos;s central clearing house . 
German and other northern European banks that no longer trust their southern counterparts parked their funds at the ECB &apos;s deposit facility , whereas southern European banks used the ECB &apos;s lending facilities to make up for the loss of private interbank funding . 
Regional imbalances in interbank funding can , of course , also arise in the US Federal Reserve System . 
But they are mostly intermediated within nationwide financial institutions . 
For example , high-tech firms in California might deposit cash surpluses with local branches of a large bank operating throughout the US , which might then choose to lend to oil companies in Texas . 
Adjustment to shocks is also independent of location in the US . 
If the price of oil falls , oil companies become less creditworthy and receive less credit - not because they are in Texas , but because they are oil companies . 
In the eurozone , however , banking is still predominantly concentrated along national lines . 
A savings surplus in Germany is recycled to Spain mainly through interbank lending ( German to Spanish banks ) . 
Moreover , although the EU is supposed to have an integrated banking market , the few existing cross-border banking groups are not even allowed to operate as integrated international banks , because national regulators and supervisors are &quot; ring-fencing &quot; the liquidity and assets of foreign banks &quot; local subsidiaries . 
For example , an international banking group headquartered in Italy was recently barred by supervisors from using the cash surplus of its subsidiary in northern Europe to fund the group &apos;s operations elsewhere . 
That would have been impossible in the US , given that the supervisors are federal . 
Moreover , the Federal Reserve System &apos;s regional organization is based on nine districts , each of which encompasses several states . 
Payment imbalances between Federal Reserve districts thus cannot represent imbalances between states . 
A further difference between the eurozone and the US is that the Federal Reserve normally lends only against public debt , and accepts only federal debt ( T-bills ) as collateral . 
Banks thus cannot use any holdings of California or Texas state debt to obtain central-bank funds . 
The ECB , on the other hand , accepts private assets and , in the absence of federal debt , national debt as collateral . 
This puts the ECB in a very different position from the Fed , because the quality of its collateral is determined along national lines . 
For example , Greek banks have received more than â‚¬ 100 billion in ECB financing , which is secured by a mix of private Greek assets and Greek government debt . 
If the Greek people decide in a referendum to default , the ECB will incur large losses , as much of its collateral would become worthless and the Greek banking system would collapse . 
The imperfect integration of Europe &apos;s financial markets and supervisory structure thus risks overburdening the ECB , which has had to become the central counterparty for cross-border lending . 
But in this function it has accumulated large risks , concentrated along national lines , thus leading to conflicts among member states . 
A common money and a common monetary policy cannot work properly with a banking system that is segmented along national lines . 
The most urgent step to stabilize the euro is not to follow the chimera of &quot; euro economic government , &quot; but to create the underpinnings of a truly integrated banking market with a common supervisor , a form of &quot; federal &quot; deposit insurance , and a &quot; euro bank rescue fund &quot; for the large cross-border institutions .
