India &apos;s Elites in Crisis 
NEW DELHI - For a country with 1.2 billion people , India is ruled by a surprisingly small elite , which runs everything from the government to large companies and even sports bodies . 
Almost anyone in a position of power in India , including well-known print and television journalists , is now viewed with suspicion . 
This is occurring at a time when economic growth is pulling a young and upwardly mobile population into the urban middle class . 
This new middle class is no longer constrained by the patronage systems of the village , but it also does not enjoy the cozy relationship that links the old middle class with the elite . 
Could this crisis of the elite trigger India &apos;s own Tiananmen Square moment ? 
Except in totalitarian regimes , a country &apos;s elite depends on a degree of popular acceptance , which is mostly derived from the belief that the elite is broadly &quot; fair &quot; in its dealings . 
Following the recent series of scandals , the average Indian does not believe this anymore . 
Of course , doubts about the ruling elite are not unique to India . 
Almost all countries undergoing a shift from a pre-industrial equilibrium based on patronage to one based on modern institutions and the rule of law have faced such crises of legitimacy . 
Until the early nineteenth century , for example , British politics was extraordinarily corrupt . 
The old aristocracy not only dominated the House of Lords , but also used its influence to get relatives , friends , and family retainers elected to the House of Commons by exploiting a key institutional weakness - the existence of &quot; rotten boroughs &quot; that could be bought and sold . 
The Duke of Newcastle alone is said to have controlled seven such boroughs , each with two representatives . 
Meanwhile , large and populous industrial cities like Birmingham and Manchester were barely represented . 
In 1819 , a crowd of 60,000 gathered in Manchester to demand reform , but were charged by the cavalry . 
Fifteen people were killed and many more injured in what is remembered as the Peterloo Massacre . 
Given the recent memory of the violent French Revolution , the British elite reluctantly agreed to democratizing reforms . 
Ultimately , the Reform Act of 1832 abolished the rotten boroughs and extended the franchise to the new middle class ( the working class and women would have to wait ) . 
The United States , too , went though a period of robber-baron industrialization in the 1870 &quot; s and 1880 &quot; s . 
The greed and corruption of that era were satirized in 1873 by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in their book The Gilded Age : A Tale of Today . 
The period ended with the depression of 1893-96 , and was followed by the major political reforms of the Progressive Era . 
For Britain and the US , the transition in the nature of the governing elite was relatively smooth . 
But there are many examples where such change was sudden and violent - the French and Russian Revolutions , for example . 
In Germany , the old Prussian elite successfully managed the country &apos;s industrialization in the late nineteenth century , but was discredited by defeat in World War I. Nazism filled the ensuing vacuum , and a new equilibrium would be established only after World War II . 
Similar shifts have been witnessed in Asia . 
Japan saw two shifts - the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and the period after World War II . 
South Korea was ruled by generals until widespread student protests led to a democratic transition in 1987 . 
( Many of the country &apos;s top businessmen faced prosecution in subsequent years . ) 
Indonesia experienced its shift more recently , in 1998 . 
When China confronted this moment during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , the Communist state repressed the students with an iron fist , but has since maintained a single-minded focus on economic growth . 
Corruption remains a major problem , but the authorities take care to punish the worst excesses in a highly visible way . 
Still , as the recent controversy over the Nobel Peace Prize demonstrated , the government remains nervous about any dissent that challenges the legitimacy of the ruling elite . 
Even adjusted for purchasing power , India &apos;s middle class today probably totals no more than 70 million ( far smaller than is generally assumed ) . 
One can see them everywhere - learning English in &quot; coaching centers , &quot; working anonymously in the new malls and call centers , or suddenly famous as sports stars . 
Never before has India experienced such social mobility . 
So far , this new group has been too busy climbing the income ladder to express their resentment at the excesses of the elite , but one can feel a growing sense of anger among its members . 
It is impossible to predict when the shift will happen or what form it will take . 
Given India &apos;s democratic traditions , it is likely that the change will be peaceful . 
One possibility is that it will take place province by province - the previously ungovernable state of Bihar being a prime example . 
But we might also see an unpredictable turn , with a new political leader or movement suddenly capturing the popular imagination and sweeping aside the old arrangements . 
As we know from Nazi Germany and other cases , such movements do not always lead to a happy outcome . 
Perhaps India &apos;s existing elite will learn from history , purge itself , and then open itself up to new talent . 
Many investigations have been ordered into the current corruption scandals . 
Over the course of this year , Indians will find out if such efforts are serious and whether they will lead to reform - or merely to deeper crisis .
