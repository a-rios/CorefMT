Feminism and the Male Brain 
NEW YORK - North Americans of my generation grew up with the 1970 &quot; s children &apos;s record &quot; Free to Be ... You and Me , &quot; on which Rosey Grier , an immense former football star , sang &quot; It &apos;s Alright to Cry . &quot; 
The message : girls could be tough , and boys were allowed not to be . 
For almost 40 years , that era &apos;s Western feminist critique of rigid sex-role stereotyping has prevailed . 
In many ways , it has eroded or even eliminated the kind of arbitrary constraints that turned peaceable boys into aggressive men and stuck ambitious girls in low-paying jobs . 
Feminists understandably have often shied away from scientific evidence that challenges this critique of sex roles . 
After all , because biology-based arguments about gender difference have historically been used to justify women &apos;s subjugation , women have been reluctant to concede any innate difference , lest it be used against them . 
But , in view of recent scientific discoveries , has feminist resistance to accepting any signs of innate gender difference only created new biases ? 
The feminist critique , for example , has totally remade elementary-level education , where female decision-makers prevail : the construction of male hierarchies in the schoolyard is often redirected nowadays for fear of &quot; bullying , &quot; with boys and girls alike expected to &quot; share &quot; and &quot; process &quot; their emotions . 
But many educators have begun to argue that such intervention in what may be a hardwired aspect of &quot; boy-ness &quot; can lead to boys &quot; academic underperformance relative to girls , and to more frequent diagnoses of behavioral problems , attention deficit disorder , and so on . 
And education is just the beginning . 
An entire academic discipline emerged out of the wholesale critique of the male tendency to create hierarchy , engage in territoriality , and be drawn to conflict . 
When I was in college , the feminist solution to &quot; patriarchy &quot; was an imagined world without hierarchy , where people verbalized all day long and created emotional bonds . 
This critique of &quot; masculinity &quot; also dramatically affected intimate relationships : women were encouraged to express their dissatisfaction with men &apos;s refusal to &quot; share &quot; their inner lives . 
Women complained of not being heard , of men disappearing after work to tinker in the garage or zone out in front of the TV . 
But , however heartfelt , such complaints assumed that men choose all of their behavior . 
Now a spate of scientific analyses , based on brain imaging technology and new anthropological and evolutionary discoveries , suggests that we may have had our heads in the sand , and that we must be willing to grapple with what seem to be at least some genuine , measurable differences between the sexes . 
The most famous of these studies , anthropologist Helen Fisher &apos;s The Anatomy of Love , explains the evolutionary impetus for human tendencies in courtship , marriage , adultery , divorce , and childrearing . 
Some of her findings are provocative : it seems , for example , that we are hard-wired for serial monogamy and must work very hard to maintain pair-bonds ; that highly orgasmic women enjoy an evolutionary advantage ; and that flirtation among primates closely resembles the way young men and women in a bar show their sexual interest today . 
Moreover , in her description of our evolution , Fisher notes that males who could tolerate long periods of silence ( waiting for animals while in hunt mode ) survived to pass on their genes , thus genetically selecting to prefer &quot; space . &quot; 
By contrast , females survived best by bonding with others and building community , since such groups were needed to gather roots , nuts , and berries , while caring for small children . 
Reading Fisher , one is more inclined to leave boys alone to challenge one another and test their environment , and to accept that , as she puts it , nature designed men and women to collaborate for survival . 
In her analysis , it serves everyone for men and women to share their sometimes different but often complementary strengths - a conclusion that seems reassuring , not oppressive . 
What Could He Be Thinking ? , by Michael Gurian , a consultant in the field of neurobiology , takes this set of insights further . 
Gurian argues that men &apos;s brains can actually feel invaded and overwhelmed by too much verbal processing of emotion , so that men &apos;s need to zone out or do something mechanical rather than emote is often not a rejection of their spouses , but a neural need . 
Gurian even posits that the male brain actually can &apos;t &quot; see &quot; dust or laundry piling up as the female brain often can , which explains why men and women tend to perform household tasks in different ways . 
Men often can &apos;t hear women &apos;s lower tones , and their brains , unlike women &apos;s , have a &quot; rest &quot; state ( he actually is sometimes thinking about &quot; nothing &quot; ! ) . 
Moreover , Gurian argues that men tend to rear children differently from women for similarly neurological reasons , encouraging more risk-taking and independence and with less awareness of the details of their nurture . 
One can see the advantages to children of having both parenting styles . 
He urges women to try side-by-side activities , not only face-to-face verbalization , to experience closeness with their mates . 
Somehow , all this is liberating rather than infuriating . 
So much that enrages women , or leads them to feel rejected or unheard , may not reflect men &apos;s conscious neglect or even sexism , but simply their brains &quot; wiring ! 
According to Gurian , if women accept these biological differences and work around them in relationships , men respond with great appreciation and devotion ( often expressed nonverbally ) . 
Women who have embraced these findings report that relations with the men in their lives become much smoother and , paradoxically , more intimate . 
None of this means that men and women should not try to adjust to each other &apos;s wishes , ask for shared responsibility with housework , or expect to be &quot; heard . &quot; 
But it may mean we can understand each other a bit better and be more patient as we seek communication . 
Nor does recent scientific research imply that men ( or women ) are superior , much less justify invidious discrimination . 
But it does suggest that a more pluralistic society , open to all kinds of difference , can learn , work , and love better .
