The Rise of an Insecure Giant 
SEOUL - By the time China overtakes the United States as the world &apos;s largest economy sometime in the next few years , it will have cemented its status as a major military power - one whose drive to assert itself strategically already is inspiring serious anxiety among its neighbors . 
But the truth is that China is a solitary , vulnerable rising power - one that faces potentially crippling domestic challenges . 
China is currently encircled by US military installations and allies . 
While Asian countries are largely willing to maintain and even expand their economic ties with China , none ( except North Korea , which depends on Chinese aid ) is prepared to accept it as the region &apos;s primary power . 
In fact , US allies like Indonesia and India have emerged as global players largely in response to China &apos;s rise . 
For its part , the US has shifted substantial military power toward Asia - with high-profile military deployments in Australia and the Philippines , and 60 % of America &apos;s naval capabilities now deployed in the region - and has enhanced its defense ties with Japan and South Korea . 
Moreover , it is helping to spearhead the Trans-Pacific Partnership , an economic and trade agreement that excludes China but includes many of its regional neighbors . 
Against this background , US claims that its strategic rebalancing is not about containing China are not particularly convincing . 
Indeed , the US is pursuing a strategy of primacy in Asia , not a partnership between equals , and this , together with China &apos;s own internal tensions , is undermining China &apos;s ability to participate productively in regional and global forums . 
As it stands , China lacks the confidence and experience needed to navigate the international arena . 
For example , it will not consider resolving in an international forum its dispute with Japan in the East China Sea over the Diaoyu Islands ( called the Senkaku Islands in Japan ) . 
International law , China understands , is a double-edged sword that can be used against China in other territorial disputes , or even in its domestic affairs . 
Similarly , China &apos;s miserly initial offer of $ 100,000 in aid following the recent typhoon in the Philippines demonstrates how far the country is from being a mature member of the international community . 
As a Chinese official admitted at a recent seminar in Seoul , concepts like &quot; regional order &quot; have never been a part of the country &apos;s political vocabulary . 
With regard to Japan , China faces a conundrum . 
It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate , because it fears the alternative : a Japan that expands its independent military reach . 
But US efforts to avoid precisely such an outcome cannot be good news for the Chinese , either , given that they entail a deepening of the bilateral defense relationship and support for upgrading Japan &apos;s military capabilities . 
In short , China &apos;s regional exceptionalism has landed it in a strategic trap . 
It is unwilling to accept American leadership in Asia ; but it is also reluctant to assume a more prominent role in promoting regional integration , fearing the concomitant pressure for more economic liberalization , adherence to international norms and rules , and a more transparent approach to its military buildup . 
Even the proliferation of China &apos;s economic ties in Africa , the Middle East , and South America may reflect vulnerability rather than imperial ambition . 
China &apos;s voracious quest for new energy sources has already caused it to overstretch its limited ability to protect its sea lanes . 
Despite bold reform plans - outlined at the recent Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party - China &apos;s prospects remain compromised by deep-rooted contradictions . 
For example , the inherent tension between the social change that development demands and the imperative of political stability required by authoritarian rule makes the current situation unsustainable in the long run . 
Likewise , if the reform outline &apos;s promise of a &quot; decisive role &quot; for the market ends up raising wages for poor Chinese , domestic demand might increase , but China will lose its main competitive advantage in international markets . 
This kind of dilemma has contributed to the fall of other developing-country dictatorships . 
China understands that , for now , US strategic primacy is an immutable reality . 
Even so , its leaders &quot; strategic anxiety was on display at President Xi Jinping &apos;s June meeting with US President Barack Obama , where he demanded , with the vagueness characteristic of Chinese officials , &quot; mutual respect &quot; and recognition of China &apos;s &quot; territorial integrity . &quot; 
The ostensibly trivial expression &quot; mutual respect &quot; actually modulates China &apos;s true desire : a return to the Westphalian principle of non-interference in states &quot; domestic affairs , particularly their human-rights records . 
China has staunchly opposed Western efforts , whether in Syria or in North Korea , to circumvent this principle with doctrines like the &quot; Responsibility to Protect . &quot; 
Similarly , Xi &apos;s call for the US to respect its &quot; territorial integrity &quot; carries a specific and pointed message . 
Experience demonstrates the dangers that can arise when vulnerable powers act independently . 
One need look no further than Israel , with its penchant for overreaction on security matters , or Iran , with its insistence on enriching uranium , to see what can happen when an isolated power bases its actions on a sense of existential vulnerability . 
China &apos;s rise is fraught with fear and uncertainty . 
Encirclement by a foreign power that threatens to encroach on what it considers to be its inalienable sovereign rights is bound to drive it to become a revolutionary power bent on upending the status quo . 
Before China and the US overstep each other &apos;s boundaries , they should abandon the concepts of &quot; primacy &quot; and &quot; containment &quot; in favor of a concert of Asian powers capable of resolving their differences .
