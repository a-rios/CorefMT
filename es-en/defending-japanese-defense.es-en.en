Defending Japanese Defense 
Japan &apos;s government and National Security Council plan to revise the country &apos;s National Defense Program Outline ( NDPO ) by the end of this year . 
A draft of proposed changes submitted to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi assigns three key tasks to the Self-Defense Forces ( SDF ) : effective response to new threats , participation in international peacekeeping activities , and defense against invasion . 
Today &apos;s complex security environment , with terrorist attacks by non-state actors occurring alongside traditional state-to-state wars , demands a nimble , integrated strategy . 
The draft revision of the NDPO seems to recognize this , emphasizing the need for Japan &apos;s own defense efforts , cooperation through the Japanese-US alliance , and contributions to multilateral missions . 
Moreover , the National Security Council has indicated the need to introduce a new plan for multi-functional flexible defense forces . 
Unfortunately , key components of Japan &apos;s emerging security strategy remain vague and contradictory . 
For example , while the likelihood of an invasion threat is judged to be low , the Defense White Paper of 2004 argues that the SDF &apos;s &quot; most fundamental function &quot; is to prepare for the worst , because sufficient defensive power cannot be developed overnight . 
In other words , Japan will clearly assert its will to defend the nation , and to prevent invasion in combination with the Japan-US security system . 
On the other hand , the National Security Council proposes &quot; scaling down the size of defense forces , &quot; implying mitigation of the will to defend . 
Indeed , the failure to suggest any possibility of an &quot; emergency expansion &quot; of the SDF compounds this anxiety . 
To be sure , the government is ultimately responsible for determining the appropriate scale of defense power in line with fiscal considerations . 
Japan &apos;s government should thus give a clear indication of a true will to defend the country &apos;s security . 
Of course , defense capability cannot be judged solely according to force levels . 
The draft NDPO &apos;s vision of a new , more adaptable , mobile , flexible , and multi-purpose SDF , with advanced technological resources and information gathering capacity , calls for a fundamental reassessment of the existing organization and equipment . 
In conformity with the international community &apos;s efforts to secure peace and stability , the draft also creates a core unit within each of the military branches , and establishes an integrated operational system . 
The military reorganization that the NDPO envisages is far-reaching . 
Japan &apos;s ground forces are to reorient their current structure , which is geared to combat capability in response to large-scale invasion , toward increased adaptability for military action in less severe circumstances . 
The navy is to shift its focus away from the anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) capability of the Cold War era , creating a structure aimed at defending islands , monitoring and responding to ballistic missiles , and combating illegal spy ship activities . 
The air force is to continue its monitoring activities in neighboring airspace and maintain response readiness against air attack , while modifying invasion response tactics somewhat as the likelihood of an attack from the air diminishes . 
One problem is the dilution of ASW capability . 
Japan needs to develop well-balanced defense forces with the capacity needed to respond to new threats , such as the rapid build-up of China &apos;s navy , especially its submarine forces . 
The importance of ASW capability in the Western Pacific has not waned . 
On the contrary , recent illegal violation of Japanese territorial waters by Chinese nuclear submarines suggests that , rather than being reduced , ASW capability should be built up further . 
If Japan does decide to scale down its defense forces in this respect , a bold and qualitative change is inevitable . 
In particular , this could mean the introduction of what has so far been viewed as somewhat taboo equipment , such as light aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines . In this age of uncertainty , when even the nature of the threats that nations face is uncertain , Japan &apos;s strategic and military planners must continue to seek ways to adapt the SDF to today &apos;s myriad current threats . 
But they must do so in a way that provides genuine direction , and that Japan &apos;s people , military , and neighbors find convincing .
