A Doomsday Scenario 
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq , fears that the country &apos;s economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion ; with that , worries about the health of the global economy are growing , too . 
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy &apos;s growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come . 
Can the situation get worse ? 
Yes , it can : much worse . 
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time : 
huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan &apos;s misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world &apos;s largest creditor into the world &apos;s largest debtor . 
Today , these deficits set new records by the month ; 
America &apos;s appallingly low savings rate . 
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed , this was understandable ; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings , so why bother ? 
Today &apos;s savings rate , while it has increased slightly , still finds America at the bottom of the world &apos;s savings league tables ; 
lax accounting standards . 
The Arthur Anderson , Enron , and WorldCom scandals didn &apos;t emerge out of thin air , but had their origins in the mid-1990s , when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters . 
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble ; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities ; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today &apos;s excess capacity . 
To this old brew , new ingredients have been added , notably the most rapid change in a nation &apos;s fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen . 
In a &quot; now you see it , now you don &apos;t &quot; move only a magician should love , the $ 3 trillion , ten year ( non social security ) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gaping 
Of course , excuses are at hand : the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold . 
Excuses , excuses . 
As the old saying goes : Don &apos;t count your chickens before they hatch . 
The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens , it sold them forward ! 
To anyone with decent eyesight , it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense . 
Clear , too , was the fact that , in promoting its tax cuts , the Bush Administration was engaging ( on a multi-billion dollar scale ) in dishonest , Enron-like accounting . 
So if things are so bad now , how can they get worse ? 
Here &apos;s a plausible scenario . 
To finance its trade deficit , America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day . 
When America was the only safe haven for global investors , this was easy . 
But America today appears less safe . 
The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts , lack of confidence in America &apos;s economic policy management ( compounded by the mounting deficits ) , and America &apos;s soft underlying economic fundamentals , has dented the US economy &apos;s global reputation . 
As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect , the dollar will weaken . 
As the dollar weakens , America looks even less safe . 
So a rush to the door begins . 
While a weak dollar may be good for exports , a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence . 
Eventually , even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement , especially given Bush &apos;s proposed risky experiments with the social security system . 
At that point , Americans will join the stampede out of their economy . 
Why shouldn &apos;t they ? 
They &apos;re free to choose where to put their money . 
Europe &apos;s stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative . 
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe . 
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports . 
The European Central Bank , fixated on inflation , will be slow to lower interest rates , and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses . 
Europe will join America in a downturn , reinforcing America &apos;s decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral . 
I am not predicting that this will happen . 
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy : a tax cut that might made minimal sense when it 
America is strong , and the global economy is strong . 
Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur , a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes . 
Downturns , of course , can never be fully prevented . 
Sadly , we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences .
