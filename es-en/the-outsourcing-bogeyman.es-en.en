The Outsourcing Bogeyman 
NEW YORK - Outsourcing of services has been a persistent cause of panic and protectionism in recent years , especially in the United States since the 2004 presidential election . 
Back then , the Democratic candidate , Senator John Kerry , upon hearing that digital x-rays had been outsourced from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for examination by radiologists in India , denounced firms that outsourced as Benedict Arnolds , the most infamous traitor in US history . 
Kerry &apos;s misstep was followed by alarm over outsourcing across the West . 
If free trade is to regain the support of statesmen who now hesitate over liberalizing trade with developing countries , the myths that turn outsourcing into an epithet must be countered . 
Myth 1 : Outsourcing will be like a tsunami . 
While even a shrewd economist like the former US Federal Reserve Board member Alan Blinder thought this , it is not likely for several reasons , both &quot; natural &quot; and manmade . 
Consider just two . 
First , it is simply not possible to outsource everything . 
For example , the fact that I can call someone in Bangalore to tell me how to fix a computer problem presupposes that I can understand her instructions . 
I tried this with a Dell computer and gave up after repeated attempts . 
I was so desperate that I asked Michael Dell , whom I met at the World Economic Forum in Davos , for a replacement . 
That is a remedy unavailable to others , of course . 
So Dell has now given up relying on call centers . 
Besides , many &quot; electronic plumbers &quot; have emerged who will come to your computer and fix the problem as you while away the hours working where your competence lies . 
Second , there are manmade restrictions to outsourcing particular types of expertise : professional organizations often intervene to kill outsourcing simply by requiring credentials that only they can provide . 
Thus , foreign radiologists need US certification before they are allowed to read the x-rays sent from the US . 
Until recently , only two foreign firms qualified . 
Myth 2 : Outsourcing will be only from rich to poor . 
There is a lot of two-way trade in manufactures , even within a single industry . 
Economists call it &quot; intra-industry &quot; trade . 
But when it comes to services , the popular fear is that outsourcing will go in only one direction . 
This fear is baseless . 
Indeed , there has been substantial growth in &quot; reverse outsourcing , &quot; i.e. , &quot; insourcing . &quot; 
Indian firms like Infosys and Wipro , giants in the information-technology sector , are now looking for cutting-edge services and high-grade talent as they compete for local markets such as the US . 
At IQor , the hugely successful outsourcing entrepreneur Vikas Kapoor now has 12 US locations , which account for half of its 11,000 employees . 
Myth 3 : Outsourcing costs jobs . 
A standard argument used by US Democrats against Republican business CEOs who were running for Congress last year was that they had exported US jobs . 
Senator Barbara Boxer railed continually against Carly Fiorina , a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard , that she had exported 35,000 jobs . 
The obvious reply should have been : &quot; Yes , I outsourced 30,000 jobs . 
But , if I had not , HP would have become uncompetitive in fiercely competitive markets , and I would have lost 100,000 jobs . &quot; 
Another &quot; jobs fallacy &quot; is that when a job disappears in a Western country and turns up in India , it must have been &quot; exported &quot; by nefarious businessmen . 
But , in many cases , the job has simply become uneconomic to maintain in the West , regardless of whether or not India exists . 
If it costs a US nursing home $ 2 per call to get someone to remind a patient to take her medicine , the job of providing such reminders will disappear . 
But if Indians can make the call for $ 0.25 , the nursing home might well sign on . 
This would make its patients healthier , drug makers more profitable , and India better off , because employment increases . 
In short , everyone wins from outsourcing of services . 
Alas , few understand this .
