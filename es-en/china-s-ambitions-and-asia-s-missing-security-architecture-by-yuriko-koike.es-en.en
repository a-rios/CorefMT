Kowtow or Cooperation in Asia ? 
TOKYO - When an American president &apos;s first overseas trip following his re-election is to Asia , one can be sure that something big is afoot in the region . 
Indeed , Barack Obama &apos;s decision to go first to impoverished and long-isolated Myanmar ( Burma ) attests to the potency of the changes underway in that country - and to US awareness of China &apos;s efforts to shape an Asia that kowtows to its economic and foreign-policy interests . 
Events at the ASEAN and East Asian leadership summits in Phnom Penh , the other key stop on Obama &apos;s tour , confirmed this . 
At the ASEAN summit &apos;s conclusion , Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen , a former Khmer Rouge commander who has ruled his country with an iron fist for three decades , closed the meeting by proclaiming that all of the leaders had agreed not to &quot; internationalize &quot; sovereignty disputes over islands in the South China Sea . 
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , present at the summit to sign new multi-million-dollar aid agreements with Cambodia , smiled and nodded in agreement at this apparent acceptance of Chinese wishes . 
Not so fast , said Filipino President Benigno S. Aquino III . 
No such agreement had been made . 
Hun Sen had mischaracterized the discussions among ASEAN &apos;s leaders . 
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda , who was also present in Phnom Penh , agreed with Aquino . 
At the summit &apos;s end , Vietnam , Malaysia , Indonesia , Brunei and Singapore joined with Aquino in demanding that Hun Sen &apos;s statement be amended . 
All six of these states have been pushing China to negotiate with ASEAN a multilateral process to resolve the South China Sea territorial disputes . 
China , dwarfing all of them , prefers bilateral talks . 
As Hun Sen &apos;s behavior demonstrates , countries that are overly dependent on Chinese aid and diplomatic backing will harmonize their policies accordingly . 
For two decades , Myanmar behaved likewise , until Chinese overreach , particularly the now-abandoned Myitsone dam project , revealed in full the subservient relationship that China envisioned . 
Indeed , China &apos;s arrogance - 100 % of the power from the proposed dam was to be exported to China - was probably the key factor in precipitating Myanmar &apos;s democratic political transition and new openness to the world . 
But Asians must not misconstrue Obama &apos;s visit . 
Although the US is certainly undertaking a strategic &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia , America alone cannot construct a viable security structure for the region . 
From India to Japan , every Asian country must play its part . 
There is no alternative to this approach , because China &apos;s rise has been accompanied by massive social and economic changes - in some instances dislocation - across the entire region . 
Asia &apos;s economies have , of course , become much more integrated in recent decades , particularly through production for global supply chains . 
But economic integration has not been matched diplomatically . 
Even two of the region &apos;s great democracies , Japan and South Korea , which have nearly identical strategic interests , have allowed an old territorial dispute - itself reflecting older unresolved animosities - to block closer cooperation . 
China &apos;s prolonged - and apparently contentious - leadership transition , punctuated by the purge of Bo Xilai , suggests that its leaders &quot; ability to continue to manage the country &apos;s emergence as a great power is not entirely certain . 
That makes the absence of a widely accepted regional structure of peace all the more dangerous . 
International orders emerge either by consensus or through force . 
The great task for Obama , incoming Chinese President , Xi Jinping , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , the new Japanese and South Korean leaders who will come to power following elections in December , and all ASEAN members is to ensure that consensus prevails in Asia without stoking China &apos;s greatest strategic fear - encirclement . 
As everyone in Asia should recognize , whenever communist China has deemed that it faced such a threat , it has resorted to war - in Korea in 1950 , India in 1962 , the Soviet Union in 1969 , and Vietnam in 1979 . 
But fear of provoking China should not stop Asia &apos;s leaders from seeking a regional security consensus , such as the proposed code of conduct for disputes in the South China Sea . 
Only the weakest of Asian states will submit willingly to Chinese hegemony - or , for that matter , to a Cold War-style US-led containment strategy . 
Indeed , the idea that Asian countries must choose between a Chinese or American future is false . 
But can Asia &apos;s fear of hegemony and China &apos;s fear of military encirclement be reconciled ? 
Only a shared sense of common purpose can prevent regional militarization . 
Some early steps in the right direction are visible . 
The United States has joined several other countries in embracing a Trans-Pacific Partnership , a free-trade pact linking the Americas with Asia . 
Japan &apos;s ruling party and leading opposition party are coming around to support the idea , and Obama &apos;s invitation to China to join suggests that the US is trying to forge regional consensus where it can . 
For now , however , China has other ideas . 
It has pressed ASEAN to establish a trade zone that would include China but exclude the US and Japan . 
In any case , trade agreements , however beneficial , can do little to defuse Asia &apos;s sovereignty disputes , and it is here - the greatest current source of regional tensions - that a shared common enterprise is not only possible , but also necessary if peace is to be preserved . 
After all , no government in the region - whether a democracy like Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , and the Philippines , a one-party state like China and Vietnam , or a tiny monarchy like Brunei - can acquiesce on such issues and hope to survive . 
Such diplomatic realism need not lead to zero-sum outcomes , as the example of European integration demonstrates . 
Just as the European Coal and Steel Community preceded today &apos;s European Union , all of Asia would benefit from embracing shared development ( without any renunciation of sovereignty claims ) of the rich maritime resources that , in several cases , are fueling the sovereignty disputes .
