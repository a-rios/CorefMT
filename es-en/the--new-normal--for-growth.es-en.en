The &quot; New Normal &quot; for Growth 
Cambridge - Markets are bubbling over signs of &quot; green shoots &quot; in the global economy . 
An increasing number of investors see a strong rebound coming , first in China , then in the United States , and then in Europe and the rest of the world . 
Even the horrible growth numbers of the last couple quarters don &apos;t seem to discourage this optimistic thinking . 
The deeper the plunge , the stronger the rebound , some analysts say . 
Perhaps these optimists are right . 
Is the &quot; new normal &quot; going to be the same as the &quot; old normal &quot; of the boom years from 2002 to 2007 ? 
I have trouble seeing how the US and China , the main engines of global growth for two decades , can avoid settling on a notably lower average growth rate than they enjoyed before the crisis . 
Let &apos;s start with the US , the epicenter of the financial crisis , and still the most important economy in the world . 
In the best of worlds , the US financial sector will emerge from the crisis smaller and more heavily regulated . 
Not to worry , some economists , say . 
The US grew rapidly in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s with a relatively heavily regulated banking system . 
Why not again ? 
Sure , but the early post-war financial sector wasn &apos;t called upon in those days to support nearly as diverse and sophisticated an economy as it is today . 
If authorities set the clock back several decades on banking regulation , can we be so sure they will not also set the clock back on income ? 
US consumption , the single biggest driver of global growth , is surely headed to a lower level , on the back of weak housing prices , rising unemployment , and falling pension wealth . 
During the boom , US consumption rose to more than 70 % of GDP . 
In the wake of the crisis , it could fall down towards 60 % . 
And what about the major political shift the US has experienced ? 
Tired of go-go growth , voters now look for more attention to addressing environmental concerns , health-care issues , and income inequality . 
Higher taxes and greater regulation cannot be good for growth . 
True , there is room to run the government more efficiently , especially in the areas of education and health care . 
I hope so , and certainly the Obama administration is a breath of fresh air after the stunning ineptness of the Bush-Cheney years . 
Chinese growth is set to slow over the longer run , as well . 
Even before the financial crisis , it was clear that China could not continue indefinitely on its growth trajectory of 10 % or more . 
Environmental and water problems were mounting . 
It was becoming increasingly clear that as China continued to grow faster than almost anyone else , the rest of the world &apos;s import capacity ( and tolerance ) could not keep up with China &apos;s export machine . 
China was becoming too big . 
With the financial crisis , the Chinese economy &apos;s necessary adjustment towards more domestic consumption has become far more urgent . 
True , even as exports have collapsed , the government has managed to prop up growth with a huge spending and credit expansion . 
The growing role of the government , and the shrinking role of the private sector , almost surely portends slower growth later this decade . 
Europe , too , faces challenges , and not just from the fact that it now has the worst downturn of the world &apos;s major economic regions , with Germany &apos;s government warning of a surreal 6 % decline in GDP for 2009 . 
The ongoing financial crisis will almost surely slow the integration of the accession countries in Central and Eastern Europe , whose young populations are the single most dynamic source of growth in Europe today . 
Not all regions will necessarily have slower economic expansion in the decade ahead . 
Assuming continuing reforms in countries such as Brazil , India , South Africa , and Russia , emerging markets could well fill some of the growth gap left by the largest economies . 
Even after the crisis , global growth is almost certain to remain lower than the pre-crisis boom years for some time to come . 
Governments are right to worry about the quality of growth , not just its speed . 
But when it comes to tax and profit estimates , investors and politicians need to reorient themselves to the &quot; new normal &quot; - lower average growth .
