Evolutionary Theory &apos;s Welcome Crisis 
EXETER - Those who believe that a supernatural being created the universe have never posed an intellectual challenge to evolutionary theory . 
But creationists , whether biblical fundamentalists or believers in &quot; intelligent design , &quot; do pose a threat to scientific thinking . 
Indeed , creationism &apos;s insidious genius lies in its ability to reinvent evolution in its own image as a dogmatic belief system - and thus the antithesis of science . 
The creationists are right about one thing : contrary to the impression given by much popular writing on the subject , the theory of evolution is in crisis . 
But this is a positive development , because it reflects the non-linear progress of scientific knowledge , characterized by what Thomas Kuhn described in his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions as &quot; paradigm shifts . &quot; 
For the last 70 years , the dominant paradigm in evolutionary science has been the so-called &quot; new synthesis . &quot; 
Widely publicized in recent years by Oxford evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins , the new synthesis unites Darwin &apos;s theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics , which explains heredity . 
The current crisis in evolutionary science does not imply complete rejection of this paradigm . 
Rather , it entails a major , progressive reorganization of existing knowledge , without undermining the fundamental tenets of evolutionary theory : organisms alive today developed from significantly different organisms in the distant past ; dissimilar organisms may share common ancestors ; and natural selection has played a crucial role in this process . 
Other assumptions , however , are under threat . 
For example , in the traditional &quot; tree of life &quot; representation of evolution , the branches always move apart , never merging , implying that species &quot; ancestry follows a linear path , and that all evolutionary changes along this path occur within the lineage being traced . 
But examination of genomes - particularly microbes - has shown that genes moving between distantly related organisms are an important catalyst of evolutionary change . 
Moreover , the new synthesis assumes that the main drivers of evolution are small mutations generated by chance within a species . 
But recent evidence suggests that large changes , caused by the absorption of a chunk of alien genetic material , may be just as significant . 
Indeed , the absorption of entire organisms - such as the two bacteria that formed the first eukaryotic cell ( the more complex cell type found in multicellular animals ) - can generate large and crucial evolutionary change . 
Further destabilizing evolutionary theory is the growing realization that many factors , not just the genome , determine an individual organism &apos;s development . 
Ironically , as the discovery of DNA &apos;s structure - initially lauded as the final act in the triumph of the new synthesis - led to a better understanding of genomes &quot; functioning , it ended up weakening belief in their unique role in directing biological development . 
Those who long deplored the omission of development from evolutionary models - a decades-old critique made under the scientific banner of evolutionary developmental biology ( &quot; evo-devo &quot; ) - together with the insistence that organisms &quot; development draws on a wide variety of resources , have been vindicated . 
Recent developments in molecular biology have put the final nail in the coffin of traditional genetic determinism . 
For example , epigenetics - the study of heritable modifications of the genome that do not involve alterations to the genetic code - is on the rise . 
And the many kinds of small RNA molecules are increasingly recognized as forming a regulatory layer above the genome . 
Beyond undermining the gene-centered theories of evolution that have dominated public consciousness for several decades , these developments call for new philosophical frameworks . 
Traditional reductionist views of science , with their focus on &quot; bottom-up &quot; mechanisms , do not suffice in the quest to understand top-down and circular causality and a world of nested processes . 
This brings us back to where we started . 
Radically rethinking evolutionary theory invariably attracts the attention of creationists , who gleefully announce that if professional advocates of Darwinism cannot agree , the concept must be in retreat . 
And , evolutionists , confronted with this response , tend to circle the wagons and insist that everyone is in agreement . 
But nothing more clearly demonstrates that science and creationism are polar opposites than the latter &apos;s assumption that disagreement signals failure . 
In fact , disagreement - and the deeper insights that result from it - enables new approaches to scientific understanding . 
For science , unlike for dogmatic belief systems , disagreement is to be encouraged . 
Evolutionary theory &apos;s current contretemps - and our inability to predict where the field will be in 50 years - are a cause for celebration . 
We should leave the creationists to their hollow convictions and happily embrace the uncertainties inherent in a truly empirical approach to understanding the world .
