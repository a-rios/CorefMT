Reserve Reform 
NEW YORK - Both China and the United Nations Commission on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System have called for a new global reserve system . 
That issue should be at the top of the agenda when the IMF &apos;s International Monetary and Financial Committee next meet . 
The essential idea is quite simple : in the long run , an international monetary system cannot be built on a national currency - a point made a half-century ago by the Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin . 
Recognition of this fundamental problem was the reason why the IMF &apos;s Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) were created in the 1960 &quot; s . 
The dollar standard with which the world has lived since the early 1970 &quot; s has three fundamental flaws . 
First , as with all systems that preceded it , it puts the burden of adjustment on deficit countries , not on surplus countries . 
The main exception is the United States , which , thanks to its reserve currency status , has so far been able to finance its deficit by issuing dollar liabilities that are held by the rest of the world . 
Second , the system is unstable , because it makes the major reserve currency &apos;s value dependent on US macroeconomic policy and the vagaries of the US balance of payments and associated domestic deficits . 
Since the abandonment of gold-dollar parity in 1971 , the world has experienced increasingly intense cycles in the value of the dollar and the US current account . 
The dollar has lost what any reserve asset should have : a stable value . 
The governor of China &apos;s central bank recently emphasized this basic point . 
Third , the current system is inequitable , because it forces a transfer of resources from developing countries to the industrial nations that provide reserve currencies . 
This transfer has dramatically increased over the past two decades . 
At the end of 2007 , developing countries , excluding China , held reserves equivalent to 20.6 % of their GDP , compared to just 3.7 % in 1990 . 
This generated a huge asymmetry in the world economy , as industrial countries , excluding Japan , hold only 2.6 % of GDP in reserves . 
One basic reason is that the only &quot; collective insurance &quot; available is limited and highly conditional IMF lending . 
It must be emphasized that a system based on competing reserve currencies would not solve the instability and inequities of the current system . 
In fact , it would add another one : the instability of the exchange rates among major reserve currencies . 
Indeed , this problem is already present in the current system . 
The deficiencies of current arrangements are why the world monetary system should be based on a truly global reserve currency : a fiduciary currency backed by the world &apos;s central banks . 
This is what was hoped for when SDRs were created in the 1960 &quot; s , and this process must be completed by transforming the SDRs into such a global currency . 
A major advantage of an SDR-based system is that it would provide a mechanism for the IMF to provide finance with its own resources in an agile way during crises , thus operating in the same way as central banks have been doing on a massive scale in recent months . 
It would also be a much better mechanism with which to finance the IMF during crises than the credit lines to the IMF from a few countries ( &quot; arrangements to borrow &quot; ) that the G-20 is again advocating , as it is truly multilateral financing that does not depend on any individual country . 
For such a program to work , it is essential that developing countries recognize that IMF financing is good &quot; collective insurance , &quot; so that their demand for foreign-exchange reserves would decline . 
This means that the IMF would have to lend rapidly during balance-of-payments crises , and do so without the overburdening conditionality of the past , particularly when crises stem from rapid reversal of capital flows or a sharp deterioration in terms of trade . 
The IMF took steps in this direction in March , particularly by creating the Flexible Credit Line for crisis-prevention purposes , as well as expanding other credit lines and overhauling conditionality ( relying more on ex-ante conditionality and eliminating structural performance criteria ) . 
The major problem with the new credit line is that it runs the risk of unduly dividing developing countries into two categories , with significant additional risks for the latter . 
A better alternative would be to go back to John Maynard Keynes &apos;s proposal of an overdraft ( or , in IMF terminology , drawing ) facility for all member countries , with countries that continue to use it eventually having to apply to a formal lending program . 
The overdraft facility could again be financed with counter-cyclical issues of SDRs . 
The reform should also allow for a mechanism for countries to exchange their current dollar ( and euro , yen , and pound ) assets for SDRs , thus avoiding the disruptions that could be generated by the transition to the new system . 
As Fred Bergsten has reminded us , the mechanism is already available in the form of the &quot; substitution account &quot; that was negotiated in the IMF in 1980 . 
It is time to broaden the agenda of global financial reform , which so far has focused on an essential but still limited set of issues , particularly financial regulation . 
Reform of the global reserve system must be part of that broader agenda .
