Help the Poor Help Themselves 
HELSINKI - One early result of today &apos;s global recession is that many donor governments are trimming their foreign aid programs . 
Before taking office , President Barack Obama had promised a doubling of American foreign assistance , from $ 25 billion to $ 50 billion , but since then Vice-President Joe Biden has warned that this commitment will probably be achieved more slowly because of the downturn . 
Here in Finland , our aid decreased by 62 % in the early 1990 &quot; s , a period that Finns still call &quot; The Depression . &quot; 
Japan &apos;s overseas aid declined by 44 % when that country hit hard times . 
The current worldwide slump could bring a cut in official development assistance ( ODA ) of 30 % . 
It is also easy to predict that donor governments will be looking carefully at the ever-growing expenditure on the United Nations &quot; 14 peacekeeping operations around the world . 
The total bill for all UN operations in the 12 months to mid-2008 reached $ 6.7 billion , about twice the level 15 years ago . 
One can only imagine the grave consequences if operations that are already spread thin are cut . 
Recall that the Rwandan genocide was preceded by a similar lack of enthusiasm for financing the UN mission there . 
Recent events in Congo and elsewhere suggest that there is no room for complacency . 
But by far the biggest transfer of assets from rich countries to the developing world takes place through migrant workers &quot; remittances . 
Few decision-makers seem aware of this . 
In 2006 , around 150 million migrants sent roughly $ 300 billion to their families in developing countries . 
The number of transactions is huge , estimated at 1.5 billion remittances annually . 
Most are for sums of only $ 100- $ 300 , and they normally go towards immediate household consumption . 
The value of all ODA in 2006 was $ 126 billion , less than half the value of private remittances , even though it includes assistance from OECD and non-OECD countries , as well as from China . 
If the recession costs migrants their jobs in richer host countries and forces them to return home to their countries of origin , millions of already poor people will be thrown into greater poverty . 
The possible impact can be gauged by looking at where the $ 300 billion in remittances are distributed . 
In 2006 , poorer European countries received about $ 50 billion , Africa got $ 38 billion , Latin America and the Caribbean $ 68 billion , the Middle East $ 24 billion . 
Asia is the major beneficiary , receiving $ 113 billion . 
In all , an estimated 10 % of the world &apos;s population is estimated to benefit from remittances , with 57 countries each receiving $ 1 billion or more annually . 
Indeed , some countries are dependent on this income flow . 
Cape Verde received 34 % of its GDP from remittances , Eritrea 38 % and Burundi 23 % . 
In Asia , the figures were 30 % for Afghanistan and 38 % for Tajikistan , while in Europe Moldova received 31 % of its GDP from external sources . 
Some of these countries are either in conflict or are fragile states , so a diminishing flow of remittances will aggravate their instability , and perhaps increase the flow of migration to other countries . 
Governments in Europe and elsewhere should therefore consider carefully what other forces will be at work if and when migrant workers are sent home . 
These governments already spend tax money on direct foreign aid . 
So they should weigh tax breaks that might entice employers to keep migrant workers on the payrolls , as this would probably be a much more efficient way to support these poor countries . 
Moreover , given that transaction costs often take a big slice of remittances , aid mechanisms could be used to create safe and cheap channels for financial flows , especially where private money cannot easily reach remote rural areas , as is often the case in Africa or Asia . 
Anti-terrorism laws are a problem here , because the demand for more effective control mechanisms on international financial transfers places an extra burden on remittance operators . 
These new rules have certainly pushed transaction costs higher . 
But the fight against terror and its financing means that governments and financial institutions have extensive data on the cross-border flow of money , which should be used to help people send money to their relatives more easily . 
Sending money to some countries is now allowed only through formal banking channels , and this has created virtual monopolies while also preventing remittance money from reaching rural areas where banks don &apos;t operate . 
In West Africa , a simple money transfer operator now handles 70 % of official payments and also imposes exclusivity on banks . 
Allowing more informal financial institutions to channel foreign payments would ease the money flow to remote regions . 
Cooperatives , credit unions , and new forms of micro-financing could form networks that would ensure greater accessibility . 
Restrictive legal rules in some countries exclude migrants from using official banking systems unless they have the necessary legal status . 
Other countries , however , have taken steps to make remittance transfers possible via mobile phones . 
The sheer size of these remittances , and their importance in keeping many millions of people above the poverty line , suggests that rich-country governments should take a careful look at the existing system . 
An improved system could help alleviate the burden imposed on innocent victims of the financial and economic downturn . 
Such a review of remittances should look into restrictive practices that could be abolished , and ask whether official assistance should be adapted to the needs of this informal yet crucially important aid network .
