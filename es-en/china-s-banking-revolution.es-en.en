China &apos;s Banking Revolution 
One of the greatest challenges China must confront before the WTO treaty enters into force in 2007 is to prepare the country &apos;s banking system for privatization and competition with foreign banks . 
The government has established a new agency , Central Hujin Investment Company , to manage and re-capitalize big state-owned banks before they are sold . 
Hujin has already injected $ 60 billion of China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves into the Bank of China , the China Construction Bank , and the Industrial and Commercial Bank . 
The Agricultural Bank will also require new capital , although the government is not yet preparing it for privatization . 
The government &apos;s rescue policies appear to be working . 
During the past two months , Bank of America has announced a $ 2.5 billion investment in return for a 9 % stake in the China Construction Bank , and The Singapore-based holding company Temasek paid $ 1.4bn for a 5.1 % stake in China Construction Bank . 
The Royal Bank of Scotland is leading an investment group that will invest $ 3.1 billion more in the Bank of China , while Goldman Sachs and Germany &apos;s Allianz are close to an agreement to acquire a 9.9 % stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank for a similar sum . 
The government hopes that these foreign investments will set the stage for the banks to go public on stock exchanges in Hong Kong and elsewhere during 2006 , whereas foreign banks are investing with an eye to penetrating the enormous Chinese market . 
The big three state-owned banks have vast branch networks and employ hundreds of thousands of people . 
Foreign banks could never hope to achieve such comprehensive coverage without a local partner . 
They will focus initially on sectors such as credit cards but could develop other joint ventures . 
HSBC also announced a major investment in Ping An Insurance , which could set the stage for experiments with Bancassurance in the future . 
The Bank of Communications listed on the Hong Kong stock market shortly after the HSBC investment , so it has been able to provide the market with more information than have the banks that are still awaiting privatization . 
Goldman Sachs is bullish , believing that the bank can record 17 % loan growth this year , a 20-basis-point improvement in margins , and significant growth in fee income . 
The major concern , however , is evidence of a growing volume of non-performing loans . 
The Bank of Communications &quot; performance suggests that China &apos;s lending boom of 2003 and 2004 could lead to another wave of defaults this year and next . 
In 2004 , the investment share of GDP rose to 45 % - one of the highest levels in recorded financial history - as banks financed a huge expansion of property development and manufacturing capacity . 
Now , the largest banks are claiming significant increases in non-performing property loans , while the glut of new industrial capacity implies that some firms may not have adequate profits to service their debts . 
Alhough the Bank of China curtailed its lending growth to only 6 % last year because of concerns about credit quality , many new local banks have expanded their lending aggressively , and could now suffer huge losses as the economy slows and firms &quot; solvency weakens . 
In these circumstances , privatization will have profound consequences for China &apos;s economy . 
The recent capital-spending boom produced a burst of speculative lending in 2003 and 2004 because the banking system was still state-owned and responsive to political pressure - until the government itself imposed credit controls in April 2004 to prevent a sharp upsurge in non-performing loans . 
In the next business cycle , China &apos;s banks will be privately owned for the first time since 1949 . 
They will make loans on the basis of commercial criteria rather than relations with big state-owned companies . 
They will be less vulnerable to political pressure from local governments to finance development projects . 
They are likely to place much greater emphasis on consumer lending , especially mortgages and credit cards . 
With China &apos;s mortgage lending equal to only 10 % of GDP , compared to 60-70 % in the Anglo-Saxon countries , there is huge opportunity for growth . 
The transformation in China &apos;s banking system , coupled with the recent decision to revalue China &apos;s currency , will require major changes in the conduct of monetary policy . 
Until recently , an exchange-rate peg dominated China &apos;s monetary policy , with interest rates unchanged for nine years until October 2004 , as the government attempted to manage lending through administrative guidance and credit controls . 
In the future , China will have to rely more heavily on interest rates to manage monetary policy , using the price of capital , not political considerations , to influence how firms make investment decisions . 
The transformation in China &apos;s banking system is complex and difficult because it involves a change in its fundamental nature . 
However , barring any major economic bumps , the changes will have a positive impact , as capital allocation becomes more efficient . 
Increased emphasis on household lending should also create a better balance in the economy between capital spending and consumer spending than was possible during the expansion of 2002-2004 .
