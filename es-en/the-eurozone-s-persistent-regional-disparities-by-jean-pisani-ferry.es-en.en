The Euro &apos;s House Divided 
BRUSSELS - The European Commission &apos;s latest economic outlook paints a disheartening picture : unemployment rates close to or above 5 % in Austria , Germany , and the Netherlands in 2014 , but above 25 % in Greece and Spain and roughly 15 % in Ireland and Portugal . 
In the same year , per capita GDP is expected to be almost 7 % above its pre-crisis level in Germany , but about 7 % below in Ireland , Portugal , and Spain - and a terrifying 24 % below in Greece . 
So the deep economic and social divide that has emerged within the eurozone is expected to persist . 
Such a gulf within a monetary union cannot be sustained for very long . 
As Abraham Lincoln said , &quot; a house divided against itself cannot stand . &quot; 
The same monetary policy cannot possibly fit the needs of a country that is in depression and another that is at or close to full employment . 
Indeed , the single most important question for the future of the eurozone is whether the gap between prospering and struggling members is being closed . 
The optimistic reading is that , despite no sign of improvement in the labor market , economic performance has in fact started to improve , and an adjustment process is under way . 
The proof , it is often argued , is that external deficits have contracted substantially . 
External accounts clearly matter , because they reflect the balance between domestic saving and investment . 
Until 2007 , imbalances within the eurozone largely resulted from too little saving and / or too much real-estate investment , resulting in a growing accumulation of private debt . 
So the contraction of external deficits is a sign that a correction is under way , and the rebalancing is impressive . 
In Spain , Portugal , and Greece , the deficit has been reduced by more than seven percentage points of GDP since 2007 , and in Ireland the current-account balance has swung into surplus . 
The problem , however , is that a large part of this improvement reflects collapsing domestic demand , which has plummeted by around one-quarter in Greece and Ireland since 2007 , and by one-eighth in Spain and Portugal . 
Investment in equipment - the key to strengthening productive capital in the tradable-goods sector - has generally suffered even more . 
To be sure , demand contraction was inevitable in these countries , given that they were living far beyond their means ; no economy can permanently sustain a rate of demand growth exceeding that of GDP . 
This cannot be regarded as a success . 
The news is better on the export side . 
Despite a grim environment , exports / GDP ratios have increased significantly in all four economies . 
Ireland was known to be a very reactive , outward-oriented economy . 
Confronted with domestic economic collapse and a stagnant European environment , firms in Greece , Spain , and Portugal have turned to overseas markets and significantly increased their countries &quot; shares of eurozone exports to the rest of the world . 
Spain &apos;s performance in foreign markets is especially impressive . 
On the eve of the euro &apos;s creation , its exports outside the EU were just a quarter of French non-EU exports ; now they are half the French level . 
The question , to which a clear answer may be impossible , is how much of these exports are for profit and how much are for survival - and thus whether strong trade performance can be sustained . 
During the euro &apos;s first decade , the countries that are now struggling recorded persistently higher wage and price inflation than those in Europe &apos;s north . 
To recover and return to both internal and external balance , they must not only close the cost gap , but actually reverse it , thereby generating the trade surpluses needed to repay the foreign debt that they accumulated in the meantime . 
The news on this front is mixed . 
Since 2007 , labor costs have roughly stagnated in Greece , Spain , and Portugal ( though the mix of wage cuts and productivity gains varies from country to country ) , and have contracted by 8 % in Ireland , whereas they have increased by more than 10 % in Germany . 
So a rebalancing is under way . 
Contrary to stereotypes , for example , real wages in Greece have declined by 6 % annually over the last three years . 
The problem , however , is that prices have generally proved much more rigid , declining only in Ireland . 
In the rest of struggling Europe , price adjustment is barely noticeable . 
Firms , especially in sectors sheltered from international competition , have retained market power and have increased prices in response to the rising cost of capital . 
The result is that the process of internal devaluation , as economists call it , is occurring very slowly . 
Employees have suffered wage cuts , but prices have not declined accordingly , so their loss of purchasing power is higher than it should be . 
Likewise , economies have not recovered lost competitiveness , so employment , especially in the traded-goods sector , is lower than it should be . 
Austerity and reforms were supposed to deliver rebalancing within the eurozone . 
Ultimately , perhaps , all the pain will pay off . 
The issue is not whether fiscal consolidation and external rebalancing are necessary - they are .
