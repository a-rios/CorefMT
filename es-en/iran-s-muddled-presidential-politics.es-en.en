Iran &apos;s Muddled Presidential Politics 
WASHINGTON , DC - The decision of former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami not to seek the presidency again has revealed how muddled Iranian presidential politics now is . In trying to sort out this muddle , the most important thing to keep in mind is not so much who will be elected , but what that choice will reveal � about the intentions of the country &apos;s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
Unfortunately , the most likely outcome will be continuing transformation of the Islamic Republic from a civil government into a garrison state in which the military plays a major role in determining political and economic matters . 
Who will actually win the vote is unpredictable , but not because Iran is democratic . 
Ayatollah Khamenei , who is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces , oversees the agencies that will run the election : the Guardian Council and the Ministry of Interior , which supervise the electoral process , and the Basij militia and Revolutionary Guard ( IRGC ) , which unofficially control the ballot-boxes and the vote-counting process . 
Recent surveys show that the increasing unpopularity of the current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , stems primarily from his economic policies . 
Although oil prices reached an all-time high in 2008 , unemployment and inflation ( now 31 % ) are out of control and the government is facing a $ 44 billion budget deficit . 
The public sector accounts for roughly 80 % of the economy , and relies mostly on now-plummeting oil revenue , while Iranian banks face a credit crisis , with Mahmoud Bahmani , the governor of the Iran Central Bank , estimating total delinquent payments to be $ 38 billion . 
But Ahmadinejad &apos;s unpopularity does not necessarily weaken his chances of being re-elected . 
A few months before the election , neither of the two main political currents , conservative and reformist , has settled on its candidate . 
Among the reformists now in the race , Mehdi Karrobi , the former speaker of the Majlis is a declared reformist candidate . 
Mir Hossein Moussavi , a former prime minister , and Abdullah Nouri , a former interior minister , are also expected to enter the race . 
On the conservative side , Ahmadinejad so far stands alone . 
But many conservatives also oppose his economic policies , as well as his management style . 
Conservative voices have repeatedly argued that supporting Ahmadinejad will cost them votes and reinforce the economic crisis . 
Conservative disenchantment with Ahmadinejad is apparent in the current Majlis , which is predominantly conservative . 
The Majlis has rejected the government &apos;s economic bills , and has repeatedly impeached or challenged Ahmadinejad &apos;s cabinet ministers . 
Iran &apos;s main diplomatic challenge will center on its nuclear program and relations with the United States . 
Since the president has no authority over these issues , any disagreement between the Supreme Leader and the next president will place the president in a difficult position with no real power . 
In terms of domestic policy , the major challenge for the next president will be the economy . 
Over-reliance on oil revenues , the effect of longstanding international sanctions , and the reluctance of foreign companies to invest in Iran have exacerbated the economy &apos;s structural problems . 
Perhaps one of the most significant elements in Iran &apos;s stagnation is that the Revolutionary Guards control a large portion of the economy , and are beyond the reach of government regulation . 
In order to manage the economic crisis successfully , any president must not only shift economic policy , but also amass enough political power to be able to thwart the intervention of the Revolutionary Guards and other organizations in economic policy-making . 
Former President Khatami &apos;s initial decision to run for the post again grabbed the international community &apos;s attention . 
Yet a Khatami victory would not have guaranteed change . 
As president , he faced criticism from reformists for his failure to resist a range of powerful groups that sabotaged economic reform and improvement in Iran &apos;s relations with the west . 
Khatami &apos;s organizational savvy had not improved much since then . 
So far , he lacks even a media platform for his faction . 
Reformist critics believe that in order to mobilize people it will not be enough just to campaign against Ahmadinejad . 
If a reformer is to win he must prove that he will be able to sway Iran &apos;s political structures toward a reform agenda . 
But reformists ask : if the Supreme Leader does not even permit the Khatami faction to have a newspaper , would he really have allowed Khatami to become president ? 
Even if any reformer does become president , will he be able to overcome his differences with the Supreme Leader ? � 
Speculation about the outcome of the election is an interesting parlor game . 
But it should not distract us from the fundamentals of Iranian politics . 
The next president may have room to adjust economic or social policies . 
But , on the big issues of foreign policy , relations with the West , and the nuclear program , the identity of the president is not important . 
These issues will be decided by a man who is not running for office in June , but whose power is secure : Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader .
