Risking It All 
CAMBRIDGE - Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the developed world fret about myriad minor - or sometimes improbable - hazards : carcinogens in food , air crashes , and so forth . 
But we are less secure than we think . 
We are in denial about scenarios that could cause such devastation that even one occurrence would be too many . 
Much has been written about possible ecological shocks triggered by the impact of a growing human population &apos;s demands on the biosphere , and about the social and political tensions stemming from resource scarcity or climate change . 
Even more worrying are the downside risks of powerful new cyber , bio , and nanotechnologies : A few individuals , via error or terror , could ignite a societal breakdown so quickly that government responses would be overwhelmed . 
The &quot; Anthropocene &quot; era , in which the main global threats come from humans rather than from nature , became especially risky with the mass deployment of thermonuclear weapons . 
Throughout the Cold War , false alarms and miscalculation by both superpowers were a constant occurrence , with several posing a serious risk of triggering nuclear Armageddon . 
Those who anxiously lived through the Cuban missile crisis would have been gripped by panic had they realized just how close the world came to catastrophe . 
Only later did we learn that President John F. Kennedy at one stage assessed the odds of nuclear war as &quot; somewhere between one in three and even . &quot; 
And only when he was long retired did Kennedy &apos;s defense secretary , Robert McNamara , state frankly that &quot; &#91; w &#93; e came within a hairbreadth of nuclear war without realizing it . 
It &apos;s no credit to us that we escaped - Khrushchev and Kennedy were lucky as well as wise . &quot; 
It is now conventional wisdom that nuclear deterrence worked ; and , in a sense , it did . 
But that does not mean that it was a wise policy . 
If you play Russian roulette with one or two bullets in the barrel , you are more likely to survive than not , but the stakes would need to be astonishingly high - or the value you place on your life inordinately low - for this to seem a wise gamble . 
But we were dragooned into just such a gamble throughout the Cold War . 
It would be interesting to know what level of risk other leaders thought they were exposing us to , and what odds most citizens would have accepted , had they been asked to give their informed consent . 
For my part , I would not have chosen to accept a one in three - or even a one in six - chance of a disaster that would have killed hundreds of millions and shattered our cities , even if the alternative were a Soviet invasion of Western Europe . 
And , of course , the devastating consequences of thermonuclear war would have spread far beyond the countries that faced a direct threat . 
Fortunately , the threat of global annihilation involving tens of thousands of H-bombs is in abeyance , though there is now more reason to worry that smaller nuclear arsenals might be used in a regional context , or by terrorists . 
But when we recall the geopolitical convulsions of the last century - two world wars , the rise and fall of the Soviet Union , and so forth - we cannot rule out a global realignment that leads to a future standoff between new superpowers . 
A new generation could face its own version of the Cuban missile crisis - one that might be handled with less skill - or less luck - than the original was . 
Nuclear weapons are the darkest side of twentieth-century science . 
But there are novel concerns stemming from the impact of fast-developing twenty-first-century technologies . 
Our interconnected world depends on elaborate networks : power grids , air traffic control , international finance , just-in-time delivery , and so forth . 
Unless these networks are highly resilient , their manifest benefits could be outweighed by catastrophic ( albeit rare ) breakdowns . 
Moreover , a contagion of social and economic breakdown would spread worldwide via computer networks and &quot; digital wildfire &quot; literally at the speed of light . 
Concern about cyber-attacks , by criminals or hostile countries , is rising sharply . 
Likewise , while it is hard to make a clandestine H-bomb , millions will one day have the capability and resources to misuse biotechnology , just as they can misuse cybertechnology today . 
The physicist Freeman Dyson foresees a time when children will be able to design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets . 
Were this to happen , our ecology ( and even our species ) surely would not survive unscathed . 
And , as for cybertechnology , should we worry about another science fiction scenario - that a network of computers could develop a mind of its own and threaten us all ? 
Some would dismiss such concerns as a jeremiad ; after all , human societies have survived for millennia , despite storms , earthquakes , and pestilence . 
But these human-induced threats are different : They are new , so we have had limited exposure to them and cannot be so sanguine that , if disaster struck , we would survive for long - or that governments could cope . 
It follows that we have no grounds for confidence that we could survive the worst that even more powerful future technologies could inflict on us . 
In a media landscape saturated with sensational science stories , end-times Hollywood productions , and Mayan warnings of apocalypse , it may be hard to persuade the public that potential catastrophes could arise as unexpectedly as the 2008 financial crisis did - and with a far greater impact . 
Existential risks receive disproportionately little serious attention . 
Some suggested scenarios can be dismissed , but we should surely try to assess which ones cannot - and study how to mitigate them .
