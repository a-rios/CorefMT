Science and Africa \ u0027s Salvation 
Africa is a rich continent  -  rich in bio-diversity , rich in mineral resources , rich in precious stones . 
It is also rich in traditional knowledge , especially knowledge associated with indigenous and medicinal plants . 
But Africa is also a poor continent . 
With roughly 13 % of the world &apos;s population , it enjoys only 1 % of the world &apos;s wealth . 
An estimated 50 % of Africa &apos;s population lives in poverty and 40 % suffer from malnutrition and hunger . 
Two-thirds of Africa &apos;s land is degraded and more than half of its population lives without safe drinking water . 
Malaria threatens many regions and HIV / AIDS has devastated the youth of many African nations , including Botswana , South Africa , Zimbabwe , where an estimated 25 % of adults are afflicted with this deadly disease . 
Stark disparities exist not only between Africa and the rest of the world , but between Africa and the rest of the developing world . 
What accounts for this ? 
There are many political , socioeconomic and environmental factors . 
Centuries of foreign colonialism followed by decades of homegrown authoritarian governments . 
A chronic lack of transparency in economic transactions often accompanied by corruption . 
Unsustainable use of natural resources . 
Marginal participation in the global economy . 
But another , less visible or dramatic factor , is also at work : Africa &apos;s woeful shortcomings in science and technology . 
By almost any measure , African science and technology is in a dismal state : in terms of the miniscule numbers and inadequate skills of its research and technical personnel ; the poor and neglected quality of the infrastructure ; the low level of instruction in primary and secondary schools ; the miserly investments in universities and research institutes . 
What should African nations do to advance their scientific and technological capabilities ? 
I suggest a five-step program : 
First , develop , sustain , and utilize local capacities and leadership . 
Developing scientific and technical capacity is less difficult than sustaining it , and sustaining it is less difficult than utilizing it . 
Yet , the ultimate impact of science and technology depends on all three factors . 
So African nations must invest in scientific and technological education and training . 
Each nation must also develop strategies that offer scientists and technologists local employment opportunities . 
To assure such sustainability , a vibrant educational system and an enduring , yet flexible , job base are needed . 
Second , mobilize the best and most relevant science and technology in Africa and elsewhere to address critical social and economic problems . 
The food , health and environmental issues faced by people in the least developed countries are of a different dimension ( often of a different kind ) to issues faced by people in rich countries . 
Such differences help to explain why science and technology initiatives in developed countries rarely target Africa &apos;s most critical problems . 
If Africa is to use science and technology to tackle its most pressing problems , it must develop its scientific and technical capacities . 
Otherwise , it will be forever beholden to &quot; second-hand &quot; science that likely will never quite fit the continent &apos;s circumstances . 
Of course , African nations should not turn their backs on research from beyond their borders . 
Indeed , efforts should be made to strengthen poorly funded , yet relevant , programs within UN organizations , and African nations should continue to pursue cooperative projects with constituencies with special ties to the continent . 
For example , sub-Saharan African scientists should seek to tap distant yet potentially strong ties with expatriate scientists of African origin working in rich countries . 
Third , build the case for supporting indigenous science and technology . 
This is a critical challenge for African scientists given competing demands on the continent &apos;s limited financial resources . 
African scientists not only have an obligation but a self-serving interest to convince governments of the value of science and the need to support such endeavors . 
Such efforts must include a willingness to engage the public in discussions on science-based issues , a desire to lobby the government for support , and , perhaps most importantly , a commitment to pursue research that focuses on critical social and economic problems  -  that is , agendas that allow scientists to help their nations build stronger and more sustainable societies . 
Fourth , share innovative and successful experiences in the development and application of science and technology . 
Africa &apos;s successful experiences in the application of science and technology for development are all-too-often drowned out by dismal news across the continent . 
Identification of genetic molecular markers for improved tea harvests in Kenya , ongoing efforts to examine alternative treatments for river blindness in Uganda , research on sickle-cell anemia in Ghana , and detailed assessments in Madagascar of the effectiveness of medicinal plants treating diabetes are examples of science-based initiatives that deserve recognition within the larger scientific community and among the public . 
Fifth , strengthen and build African centers of excellence . 
Despite the dismal condition of most scientific and technological institutions in Africa , pockets of strength exist . 
For example : the Immunology Laboratories in Cameroon , the African Centre for Meteorological Applications in Niger , and the African Centre for Technology in Senegal could be transformed into international centers of excellence . 
Such a transformation would not only boost African science but could serve as models for developing of other institutions across the continent . 
To address its problems and avoid being marginalized even more , Africa must devise long-term strategies that enable it to sustain economic growth and compete in a world where development is increasingly dominated by scientific knowledge and technical skills . 
Science and technology cannot save Africa by themselves , but Africa without science and technology cannot be saved .
