Taking Faith Seriously 
LONDON - The term &quot; Arab Spring &quot; is already highly disputed . 
Do the revolutions across the Arab world presage the glory days of summer , or a passage through a bleak winter ? 
One thing is certain : the influence of religion and faith in determining the outcome . 
Consider the scale of what is now happening . 
Across the Middle East and North Africa , Islamist parties are ascendant . 
Sunni / Shia divisions are also at the fore . 
Terrorism , based on a perversion of religion , is disfiguring politics not only in familiar places , but also in Nigeria , Russia , Kazakhstan , the Philippines and elsewhere . 
More than half of today &apos;s conflicts in the world today have a predominantly religious dimension . 
Most ( though not all ) religious faiths today contain extremist groups , all capable of producing discord among previously settled communities . 
True , much of this extremism is based on a perversion of Islam ; but such perversions of faith are also often directed against Muslims . 
In parts of Europe , Islamophobia now rivals anti-Semitism and has potent and dangerous political appeal . 
In short , religion matters . 
Three and a half years ago , when I started a foundation dedicated to improving interfaith relations , some thought it quixotic , or plain weird : Why would a former prime minister want to do that ? 
I did it for a very simple reason . 
My experience as Prime Minister taught me that none of the problems of the Middle East and beyond - including Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Somalia - can be understood unless we comprehend the importance of religion . 
I don &apos;t mean the politics of religion , but religion as religion . 
We cannot treat the influence of religious faith in purely secular terms . 
We must address it also as a genuine issue of faith . 
In fact , a fundamental foreign-policy weakness , especially in the West , is the assumption that political solutions alone provide a sensible path to the future . 
They don &apos;t . 
Those who feel that their faith compels them to act in a way destructive of mutual respect must be persuaded that this is a wrong reading of their faith ; otherwise , such a faith-based compulsion will always trump secular political arguments . 
Consider the Middle East and North Africa today . 
Like it or not , the Muslim Brotherhood and other religious parties will possibly dominate . 
They are longstanding , well organized , deep rooted in communities , and , above all , highly motivated - a winning combination anywhere . 
Arrayed against them are the discredited politics of the old regimes and well-meaning , often numerous , but highly disorganized liberal-minded groups . 
The risk we face is easy enough to describe . 
The challenge for these emerging democracies is to remain democratic through the traumas of comprehensive change . 
In particular , their economies need to reform , open up , and grow in order to meet their citizens &quot; rising expectations . 
Indeed , the region has some of the world &apos;s youngest populations , with the average age often below 30 . 
Egypt &apos;s population was around 30 million in the 1950 &quot; s ; today it is 90 million . 
Young , aspiring populations , whose criticism of the old regime was at least as much economic as political , need their tourist industry back on its feet , their business entrepreneurs feeling confident , and eager foreign investors . 
They need fundamental education and welfare reforms . 
But democracy is not just about the free elections and the constitutional rule of the majority . 
It is about freedom of expression , freedom of religion , and markets that , albeit regulated , also are free and predictable . 
In other words , democracy is not just a system of voting , but an open-minded attitude . 
That distinction - open versus closed - is as politically salient today as traditional left-right distinctions . 
Do we view globalization - with technology , communication , migration , and travel pushing us closer together - as something to be embraced but made to work fairly , or as a threat to our traditional way of life that must be resisted ? 
I believe that the future belongs to the open-minded . 
There are two faces of faith in our world today . 
One is seen not just in acts of religious extremism , but also in the desire of religious people to wear their faith as a badge of identity in opposition to those who are different . 
The other face is defined by extraordinary acts of sacrifice and compassion - for example , in caring for the sick , disabled or destitute . 
One face is about service to others ; the other face does not accept them . 
One recognizes that equal dignity should be accorded to all human beings , and seeks to build bridges of understanding between faiths . 
The other regards those who do not share their faith as unworthy unbelievers , and seeks to build a protective wall around it , or even to be actively hostile to &quot; outsiders . &quot; 
All over the world , this battle between the two faces of faith is being played out . What is needed are platforms of understanding , respect , and outreach in support of the open-minded view of faith . 
Education has a vital role to play . 
How many Christians know that Jesus is revered by Muslims as a prophet , or that it was through Islam that Christian thinkers in the eleventh century relearned the importance of Aristotle and Plato ? 
And how many Muslims understand fully the Christian Reformation and what it taught believers about philosophy and religion ? 
How much do either Muslims or Christians really know of their debt to Judaism ? 
And have we in the West any real appreciation of the true nature of the Hindu or Buddhist faith ? 
Do we understand how Sikhism developed its extraordinary openness to all faiths , or who the Bahai &apos;s are and what they believe ? 
The point is that faith is culture ; and , in today &apos;s world , people of different cultures are coming into contact as never before . 
Whether this produces harmony or discord depends our frame of mind - open or closed . 
Can strong religious faith coexist with such pluralism ? 
This is a key question of our time . 
Sometimes we ignore it , hoping we can treat it as something other than religion . 
Sometimes we just give up and embrace secularism . 
The first ignores the essence of the problem ; the second undermines faith , which still has a hugely important role to play in civilizing globalization and infusing it with spirit . 
In short , we need religion-friendly democracy and democracy-friendly religion . At this time of Christian celebration , that is an important message , of which Jesus Christ , I believe , would have approved .
