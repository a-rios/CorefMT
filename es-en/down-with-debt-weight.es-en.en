Down with Debt Weight 
LONDON - Nearly four years after the start of the global financial crisis , many are wondering why economic recovery is taking so long . 
Indeed , its sluggishness has confounded even the experts . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , the world economy should have grown by 4.4 % in 2011 , and should grow by 4.5 % in 2012 . 
In fact , the latest figures from the World Bank indicate that growth reached just 2.7 % in 2011 , and will slow this year to 2.5 % - a figure that may well need to be revised downwards . 
There are two possible reasons for the discrepancy between forecast and outcome . 
Either the damage caused by the financial crisis was more serious than people realized , or the economic medicine prescribed was less efficacious than policymakers believed . 
In fact , the gravity of the banking crisis was quickly grasped . 
Huge stimulus packages were implemented in 2008-9 , led by the United States and China , coordinated by Britain , and with the reluctant support of Germany . 
Interest rates were slashed , insolvent banks were bailed out , the printing presses were turned on , taxes were cut , and public spending was boosted . 
Some countries devalued their currencies . 
As a result , the slide was halted , and the rebound was faster than forecasters expected . 
But the stimulus measures transformed a banking crisis into a fiscal and sovereign-debt crisis . 
From 2010 onwards , governments started to raise taxes and cut spending in response to growing fears of sovereign default . 
At that point , the recovery went into reverse . 
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff tell it in their masterly book This Time is Different , there is no secure way of short-circuiting a deep banking crisis . 
The crisis originates with &quot; excessive debt accumulation , &quot; which makes economies &quot; vulnerable to crises of confidence . &quot; 
Commercial banks have to be bailed out by governments ; then governments have to be bailed out by commercial banks . 
In the end , both have to be bailed out by central banks . 
All of this , according to Reinhart and Rogoff , involves a &quot; protracted and pronounced contraction in economic activity . &quot; 
They reckon that the average length of post-war crises has been 4.4 years - the time it takes for the necessary &quot; de-leveraging &quot; to occur - after which the crisis of confidence is over and economic growth revives . 
However , there is something missing in the story . 
Recovery from the Great Depression took about 10 years , more than twice the post-war average . 
Reinhart and Rogoff offer a couple of reasons for the difference in recovery rates : the slow policy response to the Great Depression and the gold standard , which meant that individual countries could not export their way out of depression . 
In other words , fiscal policy and the monetary-policy regime have a decisive influence both on the depth of the collapse and how long before the economy recovers . 
It is also significant that big financial collapses occurred again in the 1970 &quot; s , after being virtually absent in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , when the Keynesian system of managed economies and the Bretton Woods system of managed exchange rates was in place . 
The major post-war crises that Reinhart and Rogoff consider run from 1977 to 2001 . 
They occurred because regulation of banks and controls on capital movements were lifted ; they were shorter than in the 1930 &quot; s because the policy responses were not idiotic . 
Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono emphasized that point earlier this month , boasting to British Prime Minister David Cameron that Indonesia &apos;s successful recovery plan after the 1998 collapse was inspired by John Maynard Keynes . 
&quot; We must ensure that the people can buy ; we must ensure that industries can produce ... &quot; 
Today , many governments , especially in the eurozone , seem to have run out of policy options . 
With fiscal austerity all the rage , they have given up ensuring that &quot; people can buy &quot; and &quot; industries can produce . &quot; 
Central banks have been handed the job of keeping economies afloat , but most of the money that they print remains stuck in the banking system , unable to arrest stagnating consumption and falling investment . 
Moreover , the eurozone itself is a mini-gold standard , with heavily indebted members unable to devalue their currencies , because they have no currencies to devalue . 
So , given that Chinese growth , too , is slowing , the world economy seems destined to crawl along the bottom for some time yet , with unemployment rising in some countries to 20 % or more . 
With fiscal , monetary , and exchange-rate policies blocked , is there a way out of prolonged recession ? 
John Geanakoplos of Yale University has been arguing for big debt write-offs . 
Rather than waiting to get rid of debt through bankruptcies , governments should &quot; mandate debt forgiveness . &quot; 
They could buy bad loans from lenders and forgive part of the principal payable by borrowers , simultaneously reducing lenders &quot; collateral requirements and borrowers &quot; debt overhang . 
In the US , the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) program and the Public-Private Investment Program ( PPIP ) were in effect debt-forgiveness schemes aimed at sub-prime mortgage holders , but on too small a scale . 
But the principle of debt forgiveness clearly has applications for public debt as well , especially in the eurozone . 
Those who fear excessive public debt are the banks that hold it . 
Junk public bonds are no safer for them than junk private bonds . 
Both lenders and borrowers would be better off from a comprehensive debt cancelation . 
So would citizens whose livelihoods are being destroyed by governments &quot; desperate attempts to de-leverage . 
Philosophically , the debt-forgiveness approach rests on the belief that creditors share culpability for defaults with debtors , since they made the bad loans in the first place . 
As long as the borrower has not misled the lender at the time of taking the loan , the lender bears at least some responsibility for the transaction . 
In 1918 , Keynes urged the cancelation of inter-Allied debts arising from World War I. 
&quot; We shall never be able to move again , unless we can free our limbs from these paper shackles , &quot; he wrote . 
And , in 1923 , his call became a warning that today &apos;s policymakers would do well to heed : &quot; The absolutists of contract ... are the real parents of revolution . &quot;
