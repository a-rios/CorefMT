The Gambler of North Korea 
SEOUL - After a painstaking investigation , South Korea is pointing the finger of blame at North Korea for the sinking of its warship , the Cheonan , on March 26 . 
The debate about how to respond is complicated by the fact that the Cheonan &apos;s sinking does not seem to be a stand-alone event , but was , instead , part of a change in North Korea &apos;s general pattern of behavior . 
Indeed , North Korea has become increasingly bold and impetuous ever since Kim became ill ( probably from a stroke ) in August 2008 . 
In the past , top North Korean leaders tended to calculate carefully the costs and benefits when they acted to put pressure on the outside world . 
And they were inclined to play only one of their &quot; threat &quot; cards at a time . 
But in April and May 2009 , they threw diplomatic caution to the wind , launching a long-range rocket ( as well as various missiles ) and conducting a second nuclear test - all in the space of several weeks . 
As soon as the international community reacted , by adopting United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 , North Korea quickly shifted to a charm offensive aimed at the United States and South Korea . 
The authorities released two American journalists and a South Korean worker whom they had seized in August 2009 on charges of violating North Korean law . 
But when the North Korean regime realized that smile diplomacy did not get it whatever it was they wanted , the country &apos;s rulers shifted back to hostility . 
This time , the authorities froze South Korean real estate in the Geumgang Mountain tourist zone and , most seriously of all , attacked the Cheonan . 
The regime even dispatched two spies to Seoul to assassinate Hwang Jang-yop , the highest-level North Korean official ever to defect to South Korea . 
I believe that this change in North Korea &apos;s pattern of behavior is profoundly related to recent fundamental changes there . 
First , Kim Jong-il and his third son , Kim Jong-un , may have become much more confident as a result of North Korea &apos;s emergence as a de facto nuclear state . 
They seem to believe that possession of nuclear weapons provides them with far wider room for strategic and tactical boldness . 
After all , they achieved what they wanted in defiance of enormous international pressure , and even succeeded in transferring nuclear technology to Syria several years ago without being punished . 
Given such a run of successful gambles , why be timid ? 
The second change concerns Kim &apos;s successor . 
North Korea &apos;s new boldness may reflect Kim Jong-il &apos;s wish to polish the 26-year-old Kim Jong-un &apos;s image as a strong and decisive leader . 
Or , it may be that all of the provocations that have followed Kim Jong-il &apos;s illness may be the work of Kim Jong-un himself . 
In other words , the process of power transfer may be progressing much faster than anyone outside of North Korea has guessed . 
Finally , long-term mismanagement and international sanctions have pushed the North Korean economy to the brink of collapse . 
As a result , the regime may be trying to divert people &apos;s attention from internal difficulties and push them to unite behind the emerging new leader . 
The attack on the Cheonan may have been particularly useful in cementing the regime &apos;s hold on the military , which felt disgraced by North Korea &apos;s inept performance in a confrontation with the South Korean navy near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea in November 2009 . 
But , compared to the more fundamental factors discussed above , I believe that this is probably a secondary motive for the attack on the Cheonan . 
The problem is that all three factors - nuclear-armed boldness , the succession , and economic malaise - will continue to influence North Korea &apos;s behavior for the time being . 
Without a strong and internationally coordinated response to the sinking of the Cheonan , such reckless provocations are not only likely to continue , but may become more frequent . 
Thus , South Korea and the international community must respond firmly . 
A joint South Korea-US military exercise near the Demilitarized Zone or a joint anti-submarine exercise at the Northern Limit Line should be considered . 
A UN Security Council resolution denouncing North Korea &apos;s brutal attack on the Cheonan must be an essential part of any international diplomatic response . 
Making North Korea pay a high economic cost for its rash behavior should be considered as well . 
All of these options are , however , short-term responses , and will likely be insufficient to bringing about any serious change in North Korea . 
A more fundamental , long-term strategy is needed to face the new reality and achieve lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula . 
One of the messages that Chinese President Hu Jintao delivered to Kim Jong-il at their bilateral summit on May 5 - concerning North Korea &apos;s need to launch serious economic reform and open up to the world - has provided a clue as to how to move forward . 
So far , the international community has focused mainly on the immediate concern of denuclearizing North Korea . 
But this is merely addresses the symptom , not the disease . 
It is past time for the international community - particularly China , Russia , the US , Japan , and South Korea - to devote similar diplomatic effort to persuading and pressuring North Korea to reform and open its economy . 
The world must develop a more carefully calibrated policy toward North Korea , one aimed at simultaneously implementing denuclearization and economic reform . 
The added benefit of such an approach is that it is far more likely to gain Chinese support than today &apos;s single-minded focus on denuclearization .
