Europe &apos;s Youth Unemployment Non-Problem 
BRUSSELS - European policymakers have decided that they must be seen to be &quot; doing something &quot; about youth unemployment . 
A special summit of Europe &apos;s heads of state has been called , and a &quot; Youth Employment Initiative , &quot; proposed at the EU Council of Ministers &quot; meeting in February , aims to &quot; reinforce and accelerate &quot; measures that were recommended in a &quot; Youth Employment Package &quot; in December 2012 . 
This activism comes mainly in response to the latest alarming figures on youth unemployment in southern Europe , with sky-high rates of joblessness widely regarded as politically unacceptable . 
But there are several reasons to doubt that youth unemployment is a discrete problem meriting special treatment . 
Indeed , official youth unemployment statistics are misleading on two counts . 
First , the data refer to those from 15 to 24 years old . 
But this age group consists of two sub-groups with very different characteristics . 
The &quot; teenagers &quot; ( 15-19 years old ) should mostly still be in school ; if not , they are likely to be very low skilled - and thus to have difficulty finding a full-time job even in good times . 
Fortunately , this group is rather small ( and has been declining in size over time ) . 
Unemployment among those aged 20-24 should be more troubling . 
Members of this cohort who are seeking full-time employment have typically completed upper secondary education , but have decided not to pursue university education ( or have completed their university studies early ) . 
Second , the data on youth unemployment are based on active labor-market participants . 
But labor-market participation averages just 10 % among teenagers in Europe . 
( Teenage activity rates come close to 50 % only in countries like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , where having a part-time job while in school is very common . ) 
Labor-market experts thus consider the unemployment rate a potentially misleading indicator , because a youth unemployment rate of 50 % does not mean that half of the young population is unemployed . 
That is why one should look at the unemployment ratio - the percentage of the unemployed in the reference population - rather than at the unemployment rate . 
Indeed , this indicator paints a somewhat less alarming picture than that created by the headline youth-unemployment rate of more than 50 % in Spain , or even the 62.5 % rate recently reached in Greece . 
The youth-unemployment rate in Greece does not mean that close to two-thirds of young Greeks are unemployed . 
Only 9 % of Greek teenagers are labor-market participants ; two-thirds of that number cannot find a job . 
The unemployment ratio among teenagers in Greece is thus less than 6 % . 
But this figure is not reported widely because it is much less alarming . 
Among those in the 20-24 age group , the difference between the reported unemployment rate and the percentage of youth without a job and looking for one ( the unemployment ratio ) is less stark . 
But , even among this age group , one finds that the unemployment ratio is often about one-half of the widely reported unemployment rate . 
Moreover , one must ask how much youth unemployment contributes to total unemployment . 
Looking at the problem this way reveals a completely different picture from the one usually presented . 
In those countries where the problem makes the biggest headlines ( the eurozone &apos;s south , with Greece and Spain supposedly the worst cases ) , youth unemployment accounts for less than a quarter of overall unemployment . 
By contrast , youth unemployment contributes relatively much more ( about 40 % ) to overall unemployment in countries like Sweden and the UK . 
One could argue that the latter two should worry about their youth unemployment more than Spain or Greece should . 
The fact that youth unemployment is just a part of a larger problem leads to the real policy question : Why should officials spend limited time , energy , and public funding specifically on unemployed young people , rather than on all of the unemployed ? 
Does a teenager &apos;s unemployment represent a greater loss to society than that of a single mother or an older worker , who might have been providing an entire family &apos;s only income ? 
The loss of the value added produced by a teenager is probably much lower . 
In purely economic terms , one could thus argue that youth unemployment ( especially teenage part-time unemployment ) is much less important than unemployment among those who are in their prime earning years . 
Moreover , young people have the option of continuing their education , thus adding to future earnings power , whereas continuing education is a much less viable alternative for their elders . 
Europe has a general macroeconomic problem , owing to demand factors that interact with a rigid labor market , rather than a specific youth-unemployment problem . 
This implies that there is no need for ad hoc measures for young people , which merely risk overloading welfare systems with even more exemptions and special rules .
