Why is China Lashing Out ? 
NEW YORK - It must be galling for the Chinese government to keep seeing Nobel Prizes go to the wrong Chinese . 
The first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian , a critical playwright , artist , and novelist , who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000 , while living in exile in Paris . 
The latest is Liu Xiaobo , a literary critic and political writer , who was awarded this year &apos;s Nobel Prize for Peace while serving a prison sentence for &quot; subversion &quot; of the Communist regime . 
Since the Dalai Lama is not a Chinese citizen , I will leave out his Nobel Peace Prize , though to China &apos;s rulers it was perhaps the most irritating of all . 
Yet the Chinese government &apos;s response to Liu &apos;s Nobel Prize has been extraordinary . 
Instead of a show of lofty disdain , or official silence , it made a colossal fuss , protesting fiercely about plots to undermine China , and putting dozens of prominent Chinese intellectuals , including Liu &apos;s wife , Liu Xia , under house arrest . 
As a result , the utterly powerless , hitherto quite obscure Liu Xiaobo , has become not only world famous , but much better known inside China , too . 
Combine this with China &apos;s bullying of Japan , by blocking the export of rare-earth metals vital for Japanese industry , over a few uninhabited islands between Taiwan and Okinawa , and its refusal to let the renminbi appreciate , and one must wonder why China is being so heavy-handed in its foreign relations . 
These strong-arm tactics stand out even more against the deftness of Chinese diplomacy over the last few decades . 
Japan , the old wartime enemy , has been outmaneuvered repeatedly , and a soft touch made South Koreans and Southeast Asians feel relatively comfortable with China &apos;s increasing power . 
But China &apos;s recent thuggish behavior is changing Asian opinions . 
As the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia - even in communist Vietnam - appears to show , Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer , out of fear of China . 
Other Asian countries might even be drawn closer to Japan , the only alternative to the US as a counterbalance to the Middle Kingdom . 
This cannot be what China wants . 
So why is China being so severe ? 
One possible explanation is that China is a little drunk on its new great-power status . 
For the first time in almost 200 years , China can really throw its weight around , and it will do what it wants , regardless of what other countries may think . 
A few decades ago , it was Japan that thought it was going to be Number One , and its businessmen , politicians , and bureaucrats were not shy about letting the rest of the world know . 
Call China &apos;s recent actions revenge for a century of humiliation by stronger powers . 
But this may not be the best explanation for China &apos;s behavior . 
In fact , the reason may be just the opposite : a sense among China &apos;s rulers of weakness at home . 
At least since 1989 , the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s monopoly on power has been fragile . 
Communist ideology is a spent force . 
Using the People &apos;s Liberation Army to murder civilian protesters , not only in Beijing , but all over China in June 1989 , further undermined the one-party system &apos;s legitimacy . 
The way to regain the support of the burgeoning Chinese middle class was to promise a quick leap to greater prosperity through high-speed economic growth . 
The ideological vacuum left by the death of Marxist orthodoxy was filled with nationalism . 
And nationalism in China , promoted through schools , mass media , and &quot; patriotic &quot; monuments and museums , means one thing : only the firm rule of the CCP will prevent foreigners , especially Westerners and the Japanese , from humiliating Chinese ever again . 
This is why anyone , even a relatively unknown intellectual like Liu Xiaobo , who challenges the legitimacy of Communist Party rule by demanding multi-party elections , must be crushed . 
It is why the government does not dare to let the renminbi appreciate too fast , lest economic growth slow , causing the Party loses face and legitimacy . 
And it is why bullying Japan is always a good option : China &apos;s rulers do not necessarily hate Japan , but they are afraid to look weak in the eyes of their citizens , who are taught from kindergarten that foreign powers want to humiliate China . 
This suggests that if Liu Xiaobo and like-minded dissidents ever got their wish , and democracy came to China , the problem of Chinese nationalism would not go away . 
After all , if the people feel persecuted by Japan or the United States , then the people will demand chauvinistic policies . 
Democracy has not tempered South Korean chauvinism much , either , since the demise of the military dictatorship in the 1980 &quot; s . 
But nationalism may not be a political constant . 
Nationalism is often fed by a sense of impotence . 
When citizens feel disempowered by an authoritarian government , the next best thing is to feel empowered by national prowess . 
In a multi-party democracy , on the other hand , citizens are concerned with other interests , material , social , even cultural ones , and thus less likely to be drawn into aggressive chauvinism . 
Or so we must hope .
