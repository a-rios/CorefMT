Closing Europe &apos;s Strategy Gap 
MADRID - The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year . 
But one question has largely escaped thorough examination : what Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine indicates about the European Union &apos;s foreign policy . 
During the early stages of the crisis , Germany , which had bet heavily on Russia &apos;s modernization , was averse to taking any consequential action . 
But , as the crisis deepened , German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to persuade her European counterparts to implement a broad and biting sanctions regime . 
This certainly was a step in the right direction , but it did nothing to address the foreign-policy failings that helped spark the Ukrainian crisis and continue to undermine Europe &apos;s response - namely , the EU &apos;s misguided Neighborhood Policy ( ENP ) and its muddled approach to energy . 
On both of these fronts , the EU &apos;s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin . 
It increasingly appears that Ukraine is becoming locked in a &quot; frozen conflict &quot; - Russia &apos;s foreign-policy specialty . 
Indeed , the situation in Ukraine represents a tactical victory for Russia , with the fragile but enduring ceasefire - and accompanying legislation that grants Donetsk and Luhansk considerable political autonomy - allowing Russia to entrench the conflict near the EU &apos;s border . 
Moreover , the delayed implementation of key elements of the EU &apos;s association agreement with Ukraine is clear evidence that , at the moment , Russia dictates the terms of EU-Ukrainian engagement . 
In Europe , the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy , particularly in view of Hungary &apos;s decision to suspend gas flows to Ukraine . 
Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n &apos;s government , whose behavior in recent years has been at odds with the EU &apos;s criteria for democracy , now openly approves of authoritarian regimes - and Putin &apos;s , in particular - with serious potential consequences for European unity . 
Nonetheless , the timing of the current ceasefire , which coincides with the installation of a new EU Commission , is advantageous , as is Putin &apos;s shortsighted emphasis on tactical victories . 
EU leaders should take advantage of the break in the fighting to stop reacting and start anticipating . 
With a long-term strategic vision , the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin &apos;s short-term successes . 
Such a vision must include a reconceptualization of the ENP . 
The program &apos;s mission - to help guide the political , social , and economic transitions of neighboring states - is not inherently problematic ; the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued . 
For starters , the ENP assumes that all of the EU &apos;s neighbors , both in the south and in the east , ultimately want to realize European values and structures in their own countries . 
In other words , the ENP does not account for the developmental , cultural , and aspirational differences among the EU &apos;s partner countries . 
The ENP suffers operationally from its excessively technical approach and lack of strategic vision . 
For example , before the Ukraine crisis , the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the association agreement that it did not consider adequately the potential fallout of the process - such as , say , a response from Russia . 
To be sure , the EU recognized its need for a coherent strategy , and attempted to resolve it by establishing the European External Action Service and the position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs . 
But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission , and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension , owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intra-EU disagreements . 
It is telling that Ashton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus , such as the negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia . 
Further eroding Europe &apos;s effectiveness is its fragmented approach to securing energy supplies . 
With every country largely controlling its own energy policy , Europe &apos;s energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies . 
To the extent that there has been an EU-wide energy strategy , it has related to renewables , rather than the intersection of geopolitics and energy security . 
But there is reason for hope . 
The new Commission , which its president , Jean Claude Juncker , has restructured significantly , could provide Europe with the strategic leadership it so badly needs . 
In fact , Juncker has already expressed a desire to integrate incoming High Representative Federica Mogherini into the Commission &apos;s policy program . 
The new structure - which tasks Mogherini with guiding and coordinating the work of multiple commissioners , including those responsible for trade , the ENP , and climate and energy - should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policies , particularly after Mogherini completes her European Council-mandated assessment of the global strategic landscape . 
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a reset of Europe &apos;s foreign-policy strategy . 
For that to happen , Mogherini must assert herself as a leader , backed by Juncker and the new European Council president , Donald Tusk . 
And , most important , all EU member states must recommit themselves to cooperation . 
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of Europe &apos;s values . 
Indeed , Europe has a large set of tools at its disposal ; it just needs to figure out how to use them . 
If it can , it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge , but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today &apos;s rapidly shifting global environment .
