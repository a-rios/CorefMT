Europe and Anti-Europe 
LONDON - The European Parliament election has set off a painful process of rethinking not only how the European Union works , but also what it is fundamentally about . 
The outcome made it clear that there are now two Europes : one in which the logic of integration is deeply embedded in the political system and the social order ; and one that rejects the basic assumptions of pooled sovereignty . 
The good news is that most of Europe is in the former category ; the bad news is that the exceptions include two very large and powerful countries . 
The debate about Europe is not simply a discussion of the merits of this or that institutional or technical solution to a problem of political coordination ; it is about how societies can organize themselves successfully in a globalized world . 
Up to now , there has been too much emphasis on institutional design , and not enough on social dynamism and innovation . 
Before the election , pro-Europeans regarded the upcoming vote as evidence that a new pattern of EU-wide democracy was emerging . 
Europe would look more like a country , with pan-European political parties proposing a top candidate ( Spitzenkandidat as the Germans put it ) to be the European Commission &apos;s next president . 
But Euroskeptics countered that the new political order would not work . 
Voters would treat the elections as they had in the past : an opportunity to protest - though not against Europe so much as against their own national governments . 
They would also vote against austerity , imposed as a part of the EU &apos;s strategy to defend the monetary union . 
Neither the optimists nor the pessimists were correct . 
No obvious European leader emerged from the election , and political haggling among EU governments over the next Commission president is likely to be prolonged and to look anything but democratic . 
At the same time , despite news headlines suggesting the contrary , there was no uniform wave of anti-Europeanism , or of disillusion with the European project . 
Indeed , in many countries , including some of those most severely hit by the financial and economic crisis , voters turned out to endorse both their governments and the European project . 
The pro-incumbent effect was discernible in Spain and , most dramatically , Italy , where the new reform government of Matteo Renzi defeated expectations that Italians would deliver another big protest vote . 
In Eastern Europe , Poland &apos;s governing Civic Platform outperformed the nationalist opposition , while voters in the Baltic states , where the economic effects of austerity were the most severe in the entire EU , endorsed centrist European Parliament candidates . 
The unexpected weakness of the populist right in the Netherlands and the solid performance of the ruling Christian Democrats in Germany was a reflection of the same phenomenon : a new core Europe that is politically stable and self-confident . 
Across the Rhine and across the English Channel , however , things look very different . 
In both France and the United Kingdom , the success of insurgent populist parties has shaken the political landscape . 
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls described the victory of Marine Le Pen &apos;s far-right National Front as a political &quot; earthquake . &quot; 
And , though the Front &apos;s triumph could easily be ascribed to the unpopularity of Socialist President Fran√ßois Hollande and his government , the parallel triumph of the UK Independence Party cannot be explained as a protest vote against the coalition government , which is delivering an economic recovery . 
The UKIP &apos;s stunning victory was unambiguously a popular rejection of Europe , in particular of immigration from the EU . 
The election outcomes in France and Britain reflect both countries &quot; deeper deviations from the European pattern . 
For starters , their imperial legacies constrain them to behave like nineteenth-century Great Powers , not as part of the globalized and inter-connected world of the twenty-first century . 
This is reflected in their economic models . 
In Britain , over-dependence on financial services reflects the view that finance is the central coordinating activity of economic life , which made more sense in the nineteenth century than it does today . 
For France , the equivalent weakness is a proclivity for corporate gigantism . 
But the panoply of small and medium-size enterprises that make Germany and Spain entrepreneurial and economically successful is almost entirely missing in France . 
Both Britain and France are having vigorous debates about how to change their economic models . 
Some reformers in government want more German-style apprenticeship schemes ; there is talk of tax breaks for small businesses , and of easing excessively intrusive regulatory burdens . 
It is difficult to see how either Britain or France can survive on the basis of nostalgia . 
Reforming both countries is as essential a task as reforming Europe &apos;s creaky and complex political order . 
And that requires much more than just tweaking public spending and introducing some high-tech infrastructure projects ; it means recreating the basis for a more dynamic society . 
Domestic reform in Europe &apos;s two large former imperial powers is also an essential element in making Europe work . 
While it is conceivable that the European project could survive without Britain , a united Europe without France is unthinkable .
