Renewing Europe &apos;s Security Dialogue 
ATHENS - The year 2009 has been one of great change , taking place amidst even greater uncertainty . 
Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , the resilience of the post-Cold War security system in Europe is being tested . 
Longstanding conflicts remain unresolved and complex new challenges are emerging . 
Energy security , organized crime , terrorism , absolutism and fundamentalism , climate change , and cybercrime are acute concerns for every country . 
The economic crisis has left many people far less prosperous , and perhaps less inclined to be ambitious in our efforts to address Europe &apos;s security challenges . 
But we must also keep in mind that crisis brings with it opportunities for change . 
This year has also seen a number of positive developments , including a &quot; reset &quot; in relations between two key players in the European security dialogue : Russia and the United States . 
The European Union has recently taken important steps towards greater cohesion and unity with the appointment of a President and High Representative for Foreign Affairs . 
We should celebrate these achievements even as we recognize that serious problems remain to be resolved . 
There are different perspectives on how Europe &apos;s security architecture should be designed , but we all agree on the urgent need to tackle this critical challenge through constructive dialogue . 
It is in this spirit of cooperation and bridge-building that 56 foreign ministers - representing the US , Canada , and European countries , including the Russian Federation and the rest of the former Soviet Union - will meet in Athens on December 1-2 on my invitation to discuss the future of European security . 
The talks mark the continuation of the &quot; Corfu Process , &quot; anchored in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which began with an informal ministerial meeting on Corfu in June . 
An attempt to address Europe &apos;s unfinished business , the Corfu Process is an opportunity for us to come together to assess the gaps in our common security , to craft more effective responses to existing challenges , and - most importantly - to generate new political will for joint action . 
This includes action to preserve arms-control regimes , including the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ; to accelerate the resolution of protracted conflicts ; to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and to assess and address traditional and new threats . 
We cannot afford to leave the region &apos;s protracted conflicts such as the ones in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria on the back burner , as last year &apos;s war in Georgia made abundantly clear . 
People living in these areas need peace and stability , not a fragile 
Security challenges in neighboring regions also require a joint response . 
Afghanistan is a case in point . 
And threats like terrorism , trafficking of arms , drugs , and people , and climate change are borderless and complex . 
Only a joint response can be effective . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of an era of mistrust and division , and opened the way for cooperation aimed at a peaceful and stable Europe . 
Europe has come a long way from those years of division , but we have not yet fully reaped the benefits promised by the wave of change of 1989 . 
The OSCE meeting in Athens comes at a critical time , when Europeans must move into the twenty-first century more united than ever before . 
We must take this opportunity to restore the full capacity of the OSCE and make a fresh commitment to an indivisible European security system .
