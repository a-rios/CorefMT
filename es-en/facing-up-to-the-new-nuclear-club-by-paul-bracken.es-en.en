The Second Nuclear Age 
NEW HAVEN - North Korea &apos;s launch of a long-range missile in mid-December was followed by a flurry of global condemnation that was almost comical in its predictability and impotence . 
The atomic bomb has returned for a second act , a post-Cold War encore . 
This larger pattern needs to be understood if it is to be managed . 
The contours of the second nuclear age are still taking shape . 
This took at least ten years in the first nuclear age , and this time may be no different . 
In the Middle East , South Asia , and East Asia , old rivalries now unfold in a nuclear context . 
Part of the Israeli nuclear arsenal is being shifted to sea , with atomic warheads on diesel submarines , to prevent their being targeted in a surprise attack . 
Israel also is launching a new generation of satellites to provide early warning of other countries &quot; preparations for missile strikes . 
If Iran &apos;s mobile missiles disperse , Israel wants to know about it immediately . 
Thus , the old problem of Arab-Israeli peace is now seen in the new context of an Iranian nuclear threat . 
The two problems are linked . 
How would Israel respond to rocket attacks from Gaza , Lebanon , or Egypt if it simultaneously faced the threat of nuclear attack by Iran ? 
What would the United States and Israel do if Iran carried its threat to the point of evacuating its cities , or placing missiles in its own cities to ensure that any attack on them would cause massive collateral damage ? 
Pakistan has doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal in the last five years . 
Its armed forces are set to field new tactical nuclear weapons - short-range battlefield weapons . 
India has deployed a nuclear triad - bombers , missiles , and submarines - and in 2012 tested an intercontinental ballistic missile , giving it the ability to hit Beijing and Shanghai . 
India almost certainly has a multiple warhead ( known as a MIRV ) , in development , and has also launched satellites to aid its targeting of Pakistan &apos;s forces . 
In East Asia , North Korea has gone nuclear and is set to add a whole new class of uranium bombs to its arsenal . 
It has rehearsed quick missile salvos , showing that it could launch attacks on South Korea and Japan before any counter-strike could be landed . 
China , too , is shifting its nuclear forces to mobile missiles and submarines . 
These weapons can be put on alert in a way that would be highly visible to US satellites and the global media . 
Thus , the Chinese can easily &quot; nuclearize &quot; a crisis with the US or anyone else . 
They do not have to detonate a nuclear weapon , but only alert adversaries to the dramatic increase in the political stakes and dangers of a showdown . 
Russia , not wanting to be left out of the act , has recently staged the largest nuclear exercises in decades to remind everyone that it remains a serious nuclear player , too . 
But they cannot be understood in isolation from the larger multipolar system of major powers that is forming . 
To a great extent , this is a nuclear multipolar system : possessing nuclear weapons contributes to a country &apos;s global status as a major power . 
To see this , consider the following question : When was the last time that the US or anyone else seriously proposed that India sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) - that is , that India give up the Bomb . 
Given America &apos;s economic problems and looming defense cuts , as well as growing Chinese power , there is no longer even a remote possibility that this demand will be made . 
India has become an accepted , legitimate member of the nuclear club , the fiction of the NPT notwithstanding . 
It is even less likely that China or Russia would disarm for the sake of a nuclear-free world . 
But the most urgent problem stems from the breakdown of major countries &quot; one-time nuclear monopoly and the empowerment of smaller countries like North Korea , Pakistan , Israel , and , quite possibly , Iran . 
A new set of rules for diplomacy , military strategy , and arms control is needed to stabilize this emerging nuclear order . 
Pretending that it does not exist is not a strategy .
