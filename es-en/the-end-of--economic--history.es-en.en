The End of ( Economic ) History ? 
PARIS  -  
Such is the case with John Maynard Keynes &apos;s paper &quot; Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren . &quot; 
The importance of Keynes &apos;s paper consisted not so much in how he answered the questions he posed , but in the nature of the questions themselves . 
Could the very functioning of the capitalist system bring an end to the problem of scarcity - and hence to capitalism itself ? 
What might people &apos;s lives in such an era reasonably be expected to look like ? 
Keynes began to examine these questions with the calculus of compound interest and its spectacular outcome when applied to long periods . 
At a 2 % rate of growth , any figure , including GDP , will increase 7.5-fold in a century . 
So , would the problem of scarcity - which underlies all economics - be resolved by such an increase ? 
For Keynes , the answer was a straightforward yes , because such an increase would allow the satiation of what he calls &quot; absolute needs . &quot; 
True , Keynes was well aware that relative needs - &quot; keeping up with the Joneses &quot; - will never be satiated , but he thought that these needs would become of second-order importance , so remote from the search for the good life that seeking to satisfy them would be recognized as a form of neurosis . 
According to Keynes , we would instead progressively learn how &quot; to devote our further energies to non-economic purpose . &quot; 
But here arithmetic ends and the complexity of human nature begins . 
How are we to define &quot; absolute needs &quot; ? 
Are they independent of time and place ? 
Were they the same at the beginning of the twentieth century as they are now ? 
This is where Keynes &apos;s thesis runs into trouble . 
As soon as we abandon the fiction that economic agents are Robinson Crusoes , absolute needs turn out to be indistinguishable from relative needs , because the goods that satisfy our needs change . 
For example , life expectancy has increased over time thanks to the progress of medicine and hygiene and to the increased quality and diversity of goods ( for example , safer food ) . 
The demand for better goods ( and services ) to meet our needs seems to be boundless , driving science and innovation . 
Keynes may have relied so heavily on such a simplistic characterization of human needs to make his point &quot; that the economic problem is not ... the permanent problem of the human race . &quot; 
While this view may be exaggerated , for believers in economic and social progress , it is not entirely wrong . 
At the very least , scarcity need not be a question of life and death . 
All that is required is an increase in the standard of living and social cohesion - the refusal to endanger the lives of the poorest through a lack of redistribution . 
Nevertheless , scarcity would remain , because there is no such a thing as a stationary state in which all needs are satisfied and mankind ceases to hope for a better future . 
But Keynes &apos;s emphatic tone suggests that he believed in his own taxonomy of needs . 
What he found most detestable was capitalism as an end in itself . 
Capitalism is an efficient means , but pure communism is the only moral end of any economic system . 
At that point , &quot; &#91; t &#93; he love of money as a possession ... will be recognized for what it is , a somewhat disgusting morbidity , one of those semi-criminal , semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease . &quot; 
For Keynes , only those who will be able to sublimate their non-satisfied relative needs into a higher ideal would find their way in the new paradise . 
&quot; We shall honour those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well , the delightful people who are capable of taking direct enjoyment in things , the lilies of the field who toil not , neither do they spin . &quot; 
Keynes seemed to be extolling a kind of elite communism . 
Of course , in a world of abundance , one may hope that the class of elites will become ever larger . 
But , 
It is not surprising that it didn &apos;t survive .
