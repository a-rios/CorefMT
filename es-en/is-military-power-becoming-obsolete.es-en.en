Is Military Power Becoming Obsolete ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Will military power become less important in the coming decades ? 
It is true that the number of large-scale inter-state wars continues to decline , and fighting is unlikely among advanced democracies and on many issues . 
But , as Barack Obama said in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 , &quot; we must begin by acknowledging the hard truth that we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes . 
There will be times when nations - acting individually or in concert - will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified . &quot; 
When people speak of military power , they tend to think in terms of the resources that underlie the hard-power behavior of fighting and threatening to fight - soldiers , tanks , planes , ships , and so forth . 
In the end , if push comes to shove , such military resources matter . 
Napoleon famously said that &quot; God is on the side of the big battalions , &quot; and Mao Zedong argued that power comes from the barrel of a gun . 
In today &apos;s world , however , there is much more to military resources than guns and battalions , and more to hard-power behavior than fighting or threatening to fight . 
Military power is also used to provide protection for allies and assistance to friends . 
Such non-coercive use of military resources can be an important source of the soft-power behavior of framing agendas , persuading other governments , and attracting support in world politics . 
Even when thinking only of fighting and threats , many analysts focus solely on inter-state war , and concentrate on soldiers in uniforms , organized and equipped by the state in formal military units . 
But in the twenty-first century , most &quot; wars &quot; occur within , rather than between states , and many combatants do not wear uniforms . 
Of 226 significant armed conflicts between 1945 and 2002 , less than half in the 1950 &quot; s were fought between states and armed groups . 
By the 1990 &quot; s , such conflicts were the dominant form . 
Of course , civil war and irregular combatants are not new , as even the traditional law of war recognizes . 
What is new is the increase in irregular combat , and the technological changes that put ever-increasing destructive power in the hands of small groups that would have been priced out of the market for massive destruction in earlier eras . 
And now technology has brought a new dimension to warfare : the prospect of cyber attacks , by which an enemy - state or non-state - can create enormous physical destruction ( or threaten to do so ) without an army that physically crosses another state &apos;s border . 
War and force may be down , but they are not out . 
Instead , the use of force is taking new forms . 
Military theorists today write about &quot; fourth generation warfare &quot; that sometimes has &quot; no definable battlefields or fronts &quot; ; indeed , the distinction between civilian and military may disappear . 
The first generation of modern warfare reflected the tactics of line and column following the French Revolution . 
The second generation relied on massed firepower and culminated in World War I ; its slogan was that artillery conquers and infantry occupies . 
The third generation arose from tactics developed by the Germans to break the stalemate of trench warfare in 1918 , which Germany perfected in the Blitzkrieg tactics that allowed it to defeat larger French and British tank forces in the conquest of France in 1940 . 
Both ideas and technology drove these changes . 
The same is true of today &apos;s fourth generation of modern warfare , which focuses on the enemy &apos;s society and political will to fight . 
Armed groups view conflict as a continuum of political and violent irregular operations over a long period that will provide control over local populations . 
They benefit from the fact that scores of weak states lack the legitimacy or capacity to control their own territory effectively . 
The result is what General Sir Rupert Smith , the former British commander in Northern Ireland and the Balkans , calls &quot; war among the people . &quot; 
In such hybrid wars , conventional and irregular forces , combatants and civilians , and physical destruction and information warfare become thoroughly intertwined . 
Even if the prospect or threat of the use of force among states has become less probable , it will retain a high impact , and it is just such situations that lead rational actors to purchase expensive insurance . 
The United States is likely to be the major issuer of such insurance policies . 
This leads to a larger point about the role of military force in world politics . 
Military power remains important because it structures world politics . 
It is true that in many relationships and issues , military force is increasingly difficult or costly for states to use . 
But the fact that military power is not always sufficient in particular situations does not mean that it has lost the ability to structure expectations and shape political calculations . 
Markets and economic power rest upon political frameworks : in chaotic conditions of great political uncertainty , markets fail . 
Political frameworks , in turn , rest upon norms and institutions , but also upon the management of coercive power . 
A well-ordered modern state is defined by a monopoly on the legitimate use of force , which allows domestic markets to operate . 
Internationally , where order is more tenuous , residual concerns about the coercive use of force , even if a low probability , can have important effects . 
Military force , along with norms and institutions , helps to provide a minimal degree of order . 
Metaphorically , military power provides a degree of security that is to political and economic order as oxygen is to breathing : little noticed until it begins to become scarce . 
Once that occurs , its absence dominates all else . 
In this sense , the role of military power in structuring world politics is likely to persist well into the twenty-first century . 
Military power will not have the utility for states that it had in the nineteenth century , but it will remain a crucial component of power in world politics .
