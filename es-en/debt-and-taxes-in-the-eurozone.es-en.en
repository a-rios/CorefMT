Debt and Taxes in the Eurozone 
BRUSSELS - The current crisis in the eurozone is known around the world as the &quot; euro sovereign-debt crisis . &quot; 
But the crisis is really about foreign debt , not sovereign debt . 
The importance of foreign debt is well illustrated by the case of Portugal : although the country &apos;s public-debt and deficit ratios are broadly similar to those of France , the risk premium on its public debt increased continuously , until it was forced to turn to the European rescue fund . 
The key problem confronting Portugal is thus not fiscal policy , but the high ( foreign ) debt of its private sector - its banks and enterprises . 
The limited importance of public debt alone is also evident in Italy and Belgium . 
Both countries have much higher debt-to-GDP ratios than Portugal , but both are paying a much smaller risk premium . 
The key reason is that they both have very little foreign debt ( Belgium is actually running a current-account surplus ) . 
Indeed , although Belgium &apos;s debt ratio is above the euro area average ( at around 100 % of GDP ) , the country still pays a risk premium of less than 100 basis points - despite being without a government for more than a year . 
Why are markets focusing on foreign debt ? 
One reason , of course , is that in a crisis , private debt tends to become public debt . 
Financial markets thus look at the overall indebtedness of a country . 
But it matters to whom this debt is owed . 
The key point is that eurozone states retain their full taxing powers , which yields a simple corollary for a country with high public debt but no external debt : its public debt is held by residents , and the government can always service its debt by some form of lump-sum taxation ( say , a wealth tax ) . 
For example , the government of such a country could simply pass a law that forces every holder of a government bond to pay a tax equivalent to 50 % of the face value of the bond . 
The value of public debt would thus be halved , much in the same way as it would be if the government ordered the central bank to double the money supply , which would presumably lead to a doubling of prices . 
The nature of the tax needed to pay off public debt might be different if banks held public debt , because in this case the government would have to tax the holders of bank deposits . 
But the key point remains : as long as a government retains its full taxing powers , it can always service its domestic debt , even without the ability to print money . 
But this is not the case if the debt is owed to foreigners , because the government cannot tax them . 
It is thus foreign debt that constitutes the underlying problem for a sovereign with solvency issues . 
( The exception to this rule is the United States , which enjoys what Charles de Gaulle called its &quot; exorbitant privilege &quot; of having its foreign debt denominated in its own currency . ) 
Things get more complicated if foreign residents hold a large part of a country &apos;s public debt , but its residents also have large foreign assets . 
In this case , the government faces the temptation to default on its foreign debt , while its citizens can still enjoy the returns from their foreign assets . 
The more difficult it is for the government to tax its residents &quot; foreign assets , the greater this temptation will become . 
Yet , even in this case , the government should be able to service its debt if it can somehow induce its citizens to sell their foreign assets and buy domestic government bonds instead . 
The importance of this point was illustrated in 2001 by Argentina , which did not have a large net foreign debt . 
The private sector had large foreign assets , while the government had about the same amount of foreign liabilities . 
Even so , Argentina went bankrupt , because wealthy Argentines had spirited their assets out of the country , and thus out of the reach of the government , while poor Argentines refused to pay the taxes needed to satisfy foreign creditors &quot; claims . 
On the other hand , when the foreign assets of the country are held not by households , but by institutions , such as pension funds , they can be identified and taxed . 
This is mostly the case in Europe . 
This analysis suggests that the &quot; excessive &#91; current-account &#93; imbalances &quot; procedure that is to be introduced under the ongoing reform of eurozone governance goes in the right direction . 
But it also implies that the single-minded concentration of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund on fiscal adjustment in the EU periphery is misguided . 
For Greece , fiscal adjustment is , of course , the key issue . 
For Portugal , however , the key problem is the private sector &apos;s continuing external deficit . 
Ireland is different again , as it has very little foreign debt and will soon run a current-account surplus . 
Its government should then no longer need external financing , provided it can mobilize its own citizens &quot; savings . 
As shown by the experience of Latvia , risk premia can then come down very quickly . 
In short , fiscal adjustment is necessary but insufficient to escape a debt crisis . 
Fostering domestic savings , and getting citizens to buy bonds of their own government instead of keeping their money abroad , is just as important .
